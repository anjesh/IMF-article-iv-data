Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation, Fourth Review
Under the Three-Year Arrangement Under the Extended Credit Facility, and
Request for Modification of Performance Criteria
Prepared by the African Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Roger Nord and Thomas Dorsey
June 29, 2010

Discussions: The discussions were held in Bamako during March 24–April 6, 2010 and in
Washington during the 2010 Spring Meetings. The team comprised Messrs. Maret (head), Féler
(Resident Representative), Camard, Ghazanchyan, and Razafimahefa (all AFR). The team met
Prime Minister Modibo Sidibé, Minister of Finance and Economy Sanoussi Touré, National Director
of the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) Oumar Ly, other officials, Mali’s development
partners, and representatives of civil society and the business community.
Exchange restrictions and regime: Mali, a member of the West African Economic and Monetary
Union (WAEMU) accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles
of Agreement on June 1, 1996, and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on current
international transactions. The WAEMU’s exchange regime is a conventional peg to the Euro.
Article IV consultation: The discussions focused on policies to prevent debt distress, reduce
vulnerability to external shocks, and enhance growth prospects. Current risks to external stability are
low, but policies to improve the competitiveness of the economy need to be pursued more vigorously.
There are longer-term risks posed by rapid population growth and a potential decline in gold exports.
Fourth review under the ECF arrangement: The current three-year ECF arrangement was approved
on May 28, 2008, in the amount of SDR 27.99 million (30 percent of quota). The first three reviews
were completed in December 2008, July 2009, and February 2010, respectively. Staff recommends
completion of the fourth review on the following basis:
 All quantitative performance criteria for end-December 2009 were met.
 All of the structural benchmarks have been observed, except one for which corrective actions
are underway.
 The 2010 Supplementary Budget is in line with the understandings of the Third Review.
Publication: The authorities consent to the publication of this report.

Executive Summary
The program supported by the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) remains on track. The
implementation of the government’s economic and financial program in 2009 was broadly
satisfactory despite the global crisis. All quantitative targets were met at end-December
2009, and three of the four structural benchmarks of the review were observed; corrective
actions for the fourth one are underway, including through the implementation of a new
public accounting software.
Growth was sustained at 4.5 percent, average inflation declined to 2.2 percent, and the
balance of payments improved markedly in 2009. These outcomes reflect a strong
agricultural harvest, buoyant gold export prices, and lower oil prices, as well as prudent
macroeconomic policies. The balance of payments benefited also from the equivalent of
5½ percentage points of GDP in exceptional external resources (privatization receipts and
the SDR allocations).
The 2009 basic budget deficit—the overall budget balance excluding grants, foreignfinanced capital expenditure and spending financed by the Highly Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) Initiative—was lower than programmed, at 1.4 percent of GDP, but
the targeted reduction in pending bills was not fully achieved until end-March 2010.
The 2010 economic outlook remains positive, with a projected strengthening of
economic activity. Discussions focused on the use of privatization proceeds amounting to
4 percent of GDP while maintaining macroeconomic stability. The mission welcomed the
authorities’ reaffirmation of their aim to limit the new basic budget deficit to no more than
2½ percent of GDP in 2010 and urged them to be fully transparent in the use of the
privatization receipts.
The structural reform program is progressing satisfactorily, with a further
strengthening of public finance management targeted in 2010. The privatization of the
cotton parastatal CMDT and the reform program of the Housing Bank of Mali are on track.
Looking ahead, the policy challenges remain daunting. Maintaining external and
internal sustainability will require the implementation of prudent debt and fiscal policies in
the context of an expected decline of the mining sector, currently accounting for 75 percent
of exports. Tackling vulnerabilities to external and natural shocks implies careful risk
management strategies, the elaboration of sound contingent policies, and a diversification
of economic activities. To that effect, the development of the private sector and the
achievement of higher growth rates, which is also warranted by demographic pressures,
require a more assertive development strategy. In line with previous recommendations,
staff emphasized the importance of improving competitiveness, as well as the soundness of
and prospects for the financial sector.
Staff supports the authorities’ request for completion of the fourth ECF review.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Mali’s arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) was approved
in the context of the 2008 food and fuel crisis, at the time of the last Article IV
Consultation (SM/08/142, 5/5/08). The 2008–11 arrangement was heavily frontloaded to
address financing needs stemming from the surge of world food and fuel prices that started
to affect Mali in 2007. It aimed at preserving macroeconomic stability while achieving
higher levels of growth and making credible forays in poverty reduction through prudent
fiscal policies and complementary structural reforms. While inflation spiked to 13 percent
in 2008, a good harvest yielded growth of 5 percent despite difficulties in the cotton sector,
and the sharp deterioration of the external current account balance was mostly financed by
private capital inflows (Tables 1 and 6–16, Figure 1). The basic fiscal deficit (that excludes
grants, foreign-financed capital expenditure and HIPC Initiative financed spending) was
stable at 1 percent of GDP, though financing constraints resulted in a significant buildup in
the domestic payment float by the end of 2008.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION
2.
Economic performance in 2009 was good. The unwinding of the 2008 fuel and
food shocks played an important role in offsetting the negative effects of the global
downturn, and a good harvest contributed to the turnaround. Inflation declined to 2.2
percent, growth was better than expected at 4.5 percent, and the balance of payments and
the external current account recorded significant improvements, buoyed by high gold
export prices and exceptional capital inflows. The sale of 51 percent of state telecom firm
SOTELMA was completed in July, yielding US$0.4 billion (4 percent of GDP). This,
together with the allocation of 74 million SDRs in August, contributed to a substantial
increase in the international reserves of the West African Economic and Monetary Union
(WAEMU) in 2009. Program implementation remained satisfactory with all quantitative
performance criteria and benchmarks observed at end-September and end-December 2009.1
The structural benchmarks for the fourth ECF review were all completed except for one,
which was partially observed and for which remedial actions are underway (Tables 2
and 4).

Preliminary data suggest that all end-March 2010 quantitative benchmarks were observed as well.

3.
Fiscal performance was satisfactory in most respects. The basic fiscal deficit
was lower than programmed, at 1.4 percent of GDP, but budgetary execution at the end of
2009 was hampered by delays in foreign aid disbursements, the release of large amounts of
budget allocations when expenditure restraints were lifted, and enduring weaknesses in
cashflow forecasting and management, which resulted in a temporary surge in pending
bills. Consequently, the reduction in pending bills and domestic arrears targeted at endDecember 2009 was only met at end-March 2010. In addition, new Value Added Tax
(VAT) credits have been recorded as unpaid, pending the implementation of an effective
reimbursement system that is scheduled for end-2010. Improved domestic debt and cash
management will be one focus of ongoing reforms at the Treasury in 2010, with the help of
a recently-arrived Fund resident expert.
III. PROGRAM ISSUES
A. The Macroeconomic Framework
4.
Economic prospects have remained positive since the third program review.
With a better than expected 2009 outturn and the implementation of a modest fiscal
impulse, growth projections for 2010 and beyond have been increased slightly. Over the
medium term, continued solid growth in agriculture, including a post-privatization renewal
of cotton production, is expected to anchor growth in the 5-6 percent range. With prudent
monetary policies at the regional level and prospects of a reasonable harvest, average
inflation remains subdued and projected at around 2 percent in 2010.
5.
Buttressed by an additional improvement in the terms of trade linked to
buoyant gold and cotton prices and declining oil prices, the external current account
deficit will decline in 2010. The weakening of the CFA franc will also contribute to a
medium-term strengthening of the trade balance, despite the projected higher level of
imports as a result of the fiscal stimulus package being implemented over 2010–12 (see
below).
B. Fiscal Policy
6.
In keeping with the policy commitments made at the time of the third review
under the ECF arrangement, the authorities are implementing a modest fiscal
stimulus package aimed at sustaining higher levels of growth. The package is financed
by the privatization revenue of SOTELMA and spread over the period 2010–12, with a
view to preserving macroeconomic stability, remaining compatible with the absorptive
capacity of the economy, and maintaining the long term sustainability of public finances.2
Funds have been allocated to the eight priority areas of President Touré’s 2007–12
2

Details of the expenditure program financed with the proceeds from selling SOTELMA are set out in Table
1 of the authorities’ Letter of Intent.

9
Economic and Social Development Plan. About one-fourth of the money is destined for
infrastructure, agriculture, and the social sectors; one-fourth for counterpart funds to cofinance public investment with donors; another one-fourth for paying down domestic debt;
and the balance for housing construction, decentralization, and other uses. For 2010, the
authorities have introduced a supplementary 2010 budget law to the National Assembly
that sets a target of 2.4 percent of GDP for the basic fiscal deficit, compared with a 2009
outcome of 1.4 percent of GDP. Of this target, 1.3 percent of GDP consists of nonrecurrent
expenditures financed by privatization receipts under the targeted expenditure program
announced by President Touré in November 2009. This leaves the underlying basic deficit
at a level equivalent of 1.1 percent of GDP, which is comparable to recent years and
broadly sustainable in the long run.
7.
As envisaged, the revised budget law for 2010 also incorporates more realistic
allocations to support the agricultural sector. New spending equivalent to 1.4 percent of
GDP have been introduced, with nearly half accounted for the by non-recurrent expenditure
financed by SOTELMA revenue. The other half reflects additional support to the cotton
sector and fertilizer subsidies (½ percent of GDP), a Constitutional referendum to approve
a strengthening of state institutions (notably the creation of a Senate and the strengthening
of the Supreme Court’s financial oversight role), and higher domestic interest payments.3
The authorities did not consider that the drought in Eastern Mali would have a significant
budgetary impact, despite the release of cereals from government stocks, as the
international community is also providing assistance to those affected.
8.
Staff regretted that the revised budget law did not include the specific cuts that
are required to achieve the stated basic deficit targets, but the authorities advocated
that they have the legal powers to regulate budget execution within the approved
budget ceilings. While firmly committed to the basic deficit targets, they highlighted their
track record and the need for flexibility in budget execution to achieve these targets. They
considered that, through a judicious reallocation of existing budget allocations, they have
sufficient fiscal space within existing budgetary envelopes to achieve the required savings
while addressing other potential expenditure needs within the deficit target.
C. Structural Reforms
9.
Discussions on structural reforms of the 2010 program focused on maintaining
the momentum of reforms, including those that should come to fruition during the
year. The most prominent of these are the privatization of cotton ginning company
(CMDT) and the continued restructuring of the Housing Bank of Mali (BHM) with a view
3

Ex-post control of expenditure in Mali is conducted by both an Office of the Auditor-General and a branch
of the Supreme Court. The planned amendments to the Constitution will make the accounts section of the
Supreme Court more autonomous and allow for an enhanced role. In addition to these two bodies, there are a
number of other agencies within the executive branch auditing public finances.

10
to privatizing it in 2012. Several public finance reforms are expected as well: the new
Treasury accounting system should be ready in time for the start of the 2011 budget; a new
budget reporting presentation (“TOFE”) incorporating earlier work on government
accounts in the banking system should be operational at end-June; and improved
forecasting techniques should strengthen the role of the treasury cash flow plan. Other
actions stemming from the reform programs of the Tax and Customs Departments, such as
the introduction of a medium taxpayer unit, should also show results. Most of these reforms
have been inscribed in the PAGAM II, the second-generation multi-donor PFM reform
program to be formally launched in the coming months.
10.
The authorities are planning complementary reforms to strengthen further
public finances. In particular, they intend to put an end to the problem of VAT credit
arrears by establishing a new system for issuing refunds promptly. They are embarking on
a modernization and rationalization of their tax system in line with regional guidelines and
revenue objectives, which will start with the elaboration of a reform program by the end of
2010 and for which technical assistance from the Fund is being sought. Following a World
Bank diagnostic audit, a number of measures are also being taken to strengthen public debt
management.
D. Program Modalities
11.
Program monitoring will be carried out on the basis of quantitative
performance criteria and benchmarks in Table 3. The initial targets for end-June, endSeptember, and end-December 2010 have been modified, if appropriate, to take into
account the fiscal stimulus package to be financed by SOTELMA revenue and the greater
reduction of pending bills required in 2010 by the temporary surge of the float at end-2009.
In light of these new developments, the authorities have requested approval of the revised
quantitative performance criteria and benchmarks for end-June, and staff supports this
request. The revised program also includes a quantitative benchmark on poverty-reducing
spending, which, in line with the requirements of the ECF instrument, covers mostly
current expenditure on education and health and aims at supporting the sectoral objectives
set in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP).
12.
Structural benchmarks for end-December remain focused on strengthening
public finances and the financial sector (Table 5). They cover an audit of the renewed
activities of the BHM, the introduction of a VAT credit reimbursement system, the
elaboration of a tax reform program, and the implementation of a new public accounting
system at the Treasury.
IV. MEDIUM-TERM POLICY CHALLENGES
13.
Mali’s economic prospects beyond the immediate program period hinge on the
authorities’ success in maintaining external and internal sustainability, reducing the
country’s vulnerability to external and natural shocks, and tackling long-term

11
demographic pressure. These policy challenges were set against the backdrop of the 2009
debt sustainability analysis (DSA, IMF Country Report No. 10/64), the mining sector study
recently completed by the authorities, and the preliminary results of a new population
census, as well as recent program performance (Box 1). Potential risk of debt distress

Status
Prudent fiscal policies have been implemented, and
the 2009 basic fiscal deficit was lower than
programmed. However, slower revenue growth in
recent years has increased budget pressures and
reduced fiscal space. A new multi-donor PFM
reform plan to be implemented shortly includes
program budgeting reforms to improve expenditure
targeting and tax administration reforms.
Widespread distribution of rain-fed rice seed; an
accelerated program to expand irrigation schemes;
and fertilizer subsidies to peasants have combined to
radically increase cereal production since 2008.
Progress has been good in restructuring and
privatizing major public enterprises. However, the
environment for private sector development has
shown little improvement.
FSAP recommendations from 2008 have been
incorporated in Mali’s financial sector strategy,
which is being implemented.
No general public sector wage increases have been
announced since 2007, helping to contain unit labor
costs. Some other reforms have been pursued,
though in piecemeal fashion.

Work is underway to revitalize the mining and
agricultural sectors and to improve Doing Business
indicators. Despite a greater focus on growth in
PRSP progress reports, policy measures have been
scarce outside these key sectors, and vulnerability
issues other than food have not been on the policy
agenda.

12
pointed to the need of prudent debt management policies; managing risks of external and
natural shocks highlighted the need for sound contingent policies, budget flexibility and
economic diversification; and boosting economic growth and reducing poverty called for
more assertive development strategies and structural reforms to ensure development of the
private sector and greater competitiveness.
A. Managing Risk of Debt Distress
14.
As a result of the HIPC Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
(MDRI), as well as implementation of sound policies, Mali’s risk of debt distress is
low, but uncertainties regarding the mining sector’s outlook might challenge that
assessment. The 2009 DSA included a less favorable baseline growth in mineral exports
than previous DSAs, and the potential for future debt distress hinged primarily on the
outlook for the mining sector. The authorities have completed a gold sector study that
confirms the prospects of a decline of the sector in the medium term on the basis of
currently known reserves. The authorities expressed nevertheless confidence that Mali’s
prospects for future mineral development remained excellent (Box 2). For gold, the
Box 2. Mining Sector: Macroeconomic Impact and Prospects
Gold mining expanded in Mali for more than 20 years. Output rose from 5 tons a year in the
mid-1990s to 25 tons in 2000. The scaling up of industrial production allowed it to reach 60 tons
in 2003, when Mali became the third largest gold producer in Africa and the ninth in the world.
Annual output has oscillated around 54 tons since then.
Mali’s economy now relies heavily on gold. In 2009, the sector accounted for 8 percent of
GDP and more than 70 percent of gross merchandise exports. However, demand by the mines
for local goods and services is limited, with many inputs sourced abroad. Moreover, the bulk of
dividends accrues to non-residents and is therefore remitted abroad. More important is gold’s
contribution to government revenue, which has reached 20 percent in recent years.
Current proven reserves will likely be depleted in the medium term, but the scaling-up of
exploration may allow production to continue. Current reserves should sustain production
only for five to seven years, but the government is taking measures to accelerate exploration. It
is now moving to reclaim unused exploration rights granted in the past to local entrepreneurs to
reallocate them to international companies with more adequate technical and financial resources.
The authorities also plan to expand geological surveys including with external bilateral technical
assistance.
The diversification of mining beyond gold is also underway. Iron ore production with
reserves estimated at 91 million tons, and phosphate production are slated to start later this year.
A cement plant will open in 2011, with annual production of 1 million tons, while uranium
mining is planned to begin in 2012. In addition, bauxite production is expected by 2016.and
feasibility studies for other minerals, including manganese, copper, and nickel, are being
undertaken.

13
country has a promising geological structure, but intensified exploration is needed for the
development of the underground mining activities that will eventually replace the current
open-pit mines. The country has also interesting prospects for other minerals, with
important development projects under discussion. The authorities recognized the risk that
new production might not come on stream soon enough to offset the foreseeable decline in
production from existing mining projects. They agreed that the sector needed close
monitoring and consideration of new reforms with a view to facilitating exploration and
enhancing non-gold mining prospects. To that end, they intend to present a draft for a new
Mining Code to the National Assembly later this year.
15.
Pending confirmation of better prospects for the mining sector, prudent debt
management policies remain in order. The stress tests conducted under the DSA
prepared by Bank and Fund staffs in late 2009 suggest some potential threats to external
debt sustainability. Such threats preclude borrowing on non-concessional terms. Staff
stressed the point that Mali should continue to finance its fiscal deficit primarily through
external grants and concessional loans, and avoid recourse to nonconcessional mediumand long-term external debt, as well as costly domestic debt. The authorities shared this
analysis and recognized the potential risks. They reaffirmed their current commitment to
implementing prudent macroeconomic and financial policies, strengthening further their
debt management capacity, and avoiding nonconcessional loans, despite the new flexibility
in debt limits in Fund-supported programs.
B. Managing Risk of External Shocks
16.
The limited impact of the global recession on Mali belies the country’s
susceptibility to exogenous shocks and its vulnerability to their effects. The dependence
on rain-fed agriculture leaves the country open to both economic and humanitarian crises in
the event of unfavorable rainfall or a repeat of the 2005 locust infestations. Indeed, the
current food crisis in Niger and Chad has also touched Eastern Mali, where UN agencies
say that some 250,000 people face food insecurity. Due to a heavy reliance on international
assistance to face food crises, the authorities have usually maintained minimal budget
outlays to respond to such situations. The country is also at risk of terms of trade shocks.
Unfavorable movements in the world prices of oil products, cereals and cotton can have a
significant impact on the economy and the population, as happened in 2008. The strength
of gold prices since the onset of the global financial crisis has helped cushion Mali from the
negative effects of the crisis, notably declines in non-privatization foreign direct investment
and in private remittances, but these prices remain highly volatile.
17.
Ensuring a sustainable fiscal policy stance over the medium term remains a
prerequisite for addressing Mali’s vulnerability to exogenous shocks. In this context,
staff advocated that a basic fiscal deficit target of about 1 percent of GDP was sustainable
inasmuch as it can be financed by projected net external budgetary support, does not imply

14
a domestic financing requirement, and is concurrent with external debt sustainability.4 The
authorities were in broad agreement with this underlying medium term fiscal path.
18.
For a given fiscal path of the deficit, a stronger revenue base can play an
important role in mitigating shocks. The staff encouraged the authorities to broaden the
tax base and strengthen revenue administration. A key step would be to allow for greater
flexibility in setting domestic petroleum product prices: between February 2009 and April
2010, only 60 percent of the increase in border prices of oil products was passed through to
pump prices, resulting in lost tax revenue of 0.3 percent of GDP on an annualized basis.
The authorities agreed that it is important to broaden the tax base and pointed to their
efforts to strengthen tax and customs administrations, as well as finalize a reform program
by end-2010 to streamline and modernize the tax system. The authorities were less inclined
than staff to view the rebound in oil prices as permanent and warranting additional action at
this time.
19.
On the expenditure side, improved budget planning and execution can also
provide valuable room for maneuver in the face of unanticipated shocks. In particular,
the staff underlined the importance of prudent budgeting, improved arbitrage between
competing budgetary needs, and explicit contingency planning to tackle unforeseen events.
The authorities stressed their track record of prudent macroeconomic policies, improved
budget preparation, and rapid intervention to address unforeseen external shocks, such as in
2008. But they did not favor the introduction of explicit budgetary allocations for
unforeseen events, arguing that the Malian budgetary system was flexible enough to
address minor events through a reshuffle of allocations. In the case of major events, such
precautionary budget allocations would not be sufficient and revised budget laws would be
necessary.
C. Managing Economic Growth Potential and Demographic Pressures
20.
Mali’s very high population growth poses a severe challenge for economic
development and poverty reduction. Recent economic growth of around 5 percent is
insufficient to reduce poverty in a country with 3.6 percent population growth. Close to one
half of Mali’s population is now estimated to be under the age of 15. With such a young
age structure, Mali’s population is expected to at least double in the next twenty-five years.
This population surge translates into growing demand for public services and threatens to
worsen the already high rate of youth unemployment. A recent World Bank study estimates
that maintaining education standards in Mali would require more than a doubling of the
4

The WAEMU targets a basic fiscal balance that is greater than or equal to zero. Under this criterion, total
revenue, excluding grants, has to cover current expenditure and capital expenditure financed by domestic
resources. Consequently, external budgetary support, net of amortization, cannot be used to support additional
spending and has to be saved.

15
number of teachers over the next five years.5 In the same vein, maintaining the current rate
of 63 pupils per teacher would require creating each year about 2.5 times the number of
new classrooms that have been completed in recent years. Similar issues arise for the
provision of basic health and public sanitation services.
21.
A fast-growing population reinforces the need for deepening and accelerating
structural reforms to raise economic growth and create jobs. Mali’s PRSP and recent
progress reports point to an especially wide gap between low urban and high rural poverty,6
and rightly highlight higher economic growth as a necessary condition for poverty
reduction (see Figure 2, Box 3, and Table 13 on progress towards the Millennium
Development Goals).

« Mali-The Demographic Challenge », World Bank Report No 44459-ML, June 2009.

Mali’s progress report on the implementation of its PRSP in 2009 was reviewed in a workshop with donors
and civil society organizations on June 7, 2010 and is being finalized. It can be reasonably expected to be
submitted to the Board by end-December 2010.

16
To this effect, the PRSP targets an annual average growth rate of 7 percent. Yet, this target
remains ambitious in light of historical trends, and the new data on population growth
would call for even higher economic growth rates. Staff stressed accordingly the need to
buttress growth objectives by a stronger development strategy and comprehensive reforms.
While noting that the results of the census and their impact on social sectors had yet to be
confirmed, the authorities concurred with the need to refine their development strategy.
They highlighted their commitment to strengthen current policies to support the
development of the private sector and the agricultural sector, such as the Rice Initiative,
targeted fertilizer subsidies, and support of the cotton sector. They stressed that a
cornerstone of the strategy will remain the development of the agricultural sector. Various
important projects are being implemented or under consideration in this context, including
substantial external financing by development partners such as the Millennium Challenge
Corporation and a multi-donor group for a $160 million agricultural development program.
Recent efforts to boost agricultural production, both through greater investment and
through fertilizer subsidies that serve as income transfers, should also help temper the
disparity between rural and urban areas.
Box 3. The 2008 Progress Report on the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRSP)
On September 3, 2009, the Council of Ministers approved the 2008 PRSP progress report. The
report noted the difficulties presented first by the food and fuel shocks and later by the global
financial crisis, yet acknowledged that some of the measures taken to attenuate their impact—
notably tax exemptions—were not well targeted and had a limited effect to protect the poor.
The report recognizes the importance of the excellent 2008 harvest in avoiding stronger impacts
from these shocks, and attributes much of the strong rise in production to the government’s
Rice Initiative. Going forward, the report makes a range of recommendations, including further
efforts to develop social protection programs, provided that they are well targeted; measures to
reduce Mali’s vulnerability to external shocks; and acceleration of the statistics master plan.

22.
A particular concern for private sector-led growth is weak competitiveness. As
noted in the recent Article IV Consultation for the WAEMU area, up to the recent Euro
depreciation, Mali’s real effective exchange rate has risen by some 50 percent since the
1994 devaluation of the CFA franc. However, the standard exchange rate assessment points
only to mild overvaluation (Box 3). Mali’s lack of competitiveness stems primarily from
structural causes that should be addressed by improving the business climate, diversifying
the economic base, alleviating impediments to trade, and raising productivity. While
important reforms have been effected under the current program, particularly with regard to
the largest state-owned enterprises, the key impediments have diminished little, and Mali
ranks 130th of 133 countries in the World Economic Forum’s most recent Global
Competitiveness Report . In this context, the authorities indicated that they are
implementing a result-oriented action plan adopted in early 2009 to improve business
conditions and reduce operating costs of the private sector (Doing Business Indicators are
reported in Table 14).

17

Box 4. Exchange Rate Assessment
In addition to the work done recently for the 2010 WAEMU Consultation, two techniques from
the standard toolkit—the macroeconomic balance and the external sustainability approaches—
have been applied to assess the level of the CFA franc relative to its medium-term equilibrium
level for Mali. While subject to significant statistical uncertainty and based on data preceding
the recent weakening of the Euro, these additional approaches suggest that the CFA franc may
be overvalued relative to the Malian economy by some 8 to 16 percent, broadly consistent with
the results from the WAEMU consultation.
The macroeconomic balance approach suggests that the CFA franc is overvalued by about
8 percent relative to the level implied by Mali’s medium-term fundamentals. This relies on an
estimated norm for the current account deficit of about 5.5 percent of GDP, compared to an
underlying projected deficit of 8.3 percent of GDP by 2015. Using an alternative specification
that accounts for terms of trade and foreign aid composition, the norm for the current account
deficit is somewhat smaller and the overvaluation of the CFAF franc is about 16 percent.
The external sustainability approach, which stabilizes net foreign assets, points to a smaller
overvaluation of 9 percent. The resulting norm is about 3 percentage points of GDP below the
projected level for current account deficit. Thus, with a nominal growth rate of 6 percent in
Mali, the current account deficit necessary to stabilize net foreign assets at 60 percent of GDP is
about 3 percent of GDP.

23.
Tackling the vulnerabilities of and potential risks from the financial sector will
contribute to a more stable macroeconomic environment and promote economic
growth. The authorities expressed satisfaction with the impact of the reduction of the stock
of pending government payments on the quality of banks’ portfolios, notwithstanding
remaining weaknesses in treasury management and the end-2009 surge in pending bills
(see Table 11 on financial soundness indicators). The authorities also expressed confidence
that the important role played by regional banks in the Malian financial system did not
constitute a significant source of additional risk, as local subsidiaries were sufficiently well

18
capitalized and their claims on affiliated companies were limited. The expected
consolidation in the banking system as a result of higher minimum capital requirements had
not yet taken place, and staff urged close attention to weaknesses that might emerge in this
process. The authorities considered that the creation of a financial stability department at
the central bank would largely fill the need in this regard.
24.
The recommendations of the 2008 FSAP have been incorporated into the
authorities’ own financial sector development strategy (FSDS), adopted by the Cabinet
in July 2008. The action plan derived from the FSDS is being implemented and significant
progress has been achieved in the areas of bank restructuring and public debt management.
The authorities and staff agreed on the need to keep the momentum of reforms in these
areas and implement other recommendations, including those to strengthen bank
supervision.
D. Other Issues
25.
Mali's statistical base is adequate for effective surveillance, and efforts are
under way to strengthen capacity (Statistical Issues are summarized in the Informational
Annex). Staff reviewed progress in implementing the GFS 2001 methodology. In
particular, it discussed ways to strengthen the monitoring of public companies and
prospects to widen the coverage of public finance statistics from the central government to
the nonfinancial public sector. Particular emphasis was placed on strengthening these
statistics, as well as balance of payments data, in the context of the ECF arrangement.
26.
Against a backdrop of security issues and reported drug trafficking in the
North of the country, Mali is making progress in addressing the deficiencies of its
framework for Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Finance of Terrorism
(AML/CFT). A 2008 report had found Mali’s regime in an embryonic state with
legislative and preventative measures being assessed as deficient, and Mali was partially
compliant or non-compliant with 46 out of 49 of the recommendations. The follow-up
report presented in November 2009 to the Inter Governmental Action Group against
Money Laundering in West Africa (GIABA) pointed out some progress in AML/CFT, in
particular with regard to the criminalization of financing of terrorism. Essential structures
of the AML/CFT mechanism have been established and made operational, including the
Financial Intelligence Unit (CENTIF) and the Planning and Statistics Unit. Additional
actions are envisaged to build up the efficacy of the framework, such as the creation of an
inter-ministerial committee and the elaboration of a national strategy to coordinate action.
27.
Further trade liberalization, notably in the event of an Economic Partnership
Agreement (EPA) with the European Union (EU), could help to strengthen Mali’s
competitiveness. Trade policy issues are normally handled on a regional basis at the
WAEMU level. For the EU, however, negotiations are being conducted by ECOWAS, with
assistance from the WAEMU commission, and Mali has not been pursuing a separate

19
interim bilateral agreement. The Malian authorities are concerned over possible revenue
losses from an EPA, and they support the regional position that accompanying measures—
including financial assistance to offset the impact of liberalization under the EPA—should
be in place before an agreement is signed.
28.
The most recent safeguards assessment of the BCEAO was completed on
March 1, 2010. The 2010 update assessment found that the BCEAO continues to have
controls in place at the operational level. The overall governance framework should
nonetheless be strengthened by the addition of an audit committee to ensure that the Board
of Directors exercises appropriate oversight over the control structure, including the audit
mechanisms and financial statements. Efforts to implement fully the International Financial
Reporting Standards reporting framework should also be pursued.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
29.
Despite the global financial and economic crisis, the implementation of the
government’s economic and financial program in 2009 was broadly satisfactory.
Growth was sustained at 4.5 percent, inflation reduced to 2.2 percent, and the balance of
payments improved markedly. Mali also benefited from exceptional revenue linked to the
privatization of the telecom parastatal SOTELMA and the SDR allocations of the IMF.
30.
The overall basic budget deficit, on a commitment basis, was lower than
expected, but the targeted reduction in pending bills was delayed until end-March
2010. The Ministry of Economy and Finance is taking corrective measures to address this
issue and prevent the recurrence of payment arrears, including on VAT credits. A
continued focus on strengthening treasury management is central to the authorities’ PFM
objectives.
31.
The implementation of structural reforms continued to make good progress in
2009, notably with regards to the state enterprises and the strengthening of public
finances. SOTELMA was successfully privatized; the housing bank BHM is being
effectively restructured; and the reform of the cotton sector, including the privatization of
the parastatal CMDT, is moving ahead. Work also continues apace in the strengthening of
public financial management, and staff looks forward to the finalization of the new reform
program in this area.
32.
The 2010 economic outlook remains positive. The implementation of a prudent
fiscal stimulus package, to be financed by part of SOTELMA’s privatization revenue and
cast in a revised budget law, will buttress economic growth in a stable macroeconomic
context. In this regard, the staff welcomes the authorities’ commitments to continue
implementing prudent policies and maintain an underlying fiscal adjustment process with a
view to preserving long term sustainability of public finances. The revised budget law also
reflects, in line with previous commitments, recent government decisions on agricultural
input subsidies and support to the cotton sector. Staff urges the authorities to monitor

20
carefully budget execution and realize the necessary savings that will ensure respect of the
program targets for the basic fiscal deficits.
33.
Mali’s exchange regime and real exchange rate remain broadly appropriate,
and the country is at low risk of debt distress. Nevertheless, the country faces major
challenges in remaining internationally competitive, and reforms aimed at reducing the cost
of doing business and at improving the provision of financial services need greater
attention. Mali’s rapid population growth, and the need to find jobs for a swelling
population, further increase the urgency of measures to raise the growth rate.
34.
Mali continues to be highly vulnerable to external shocks. Improving the
country’s capacity to respond to such shocks, including by maintaining prudent fiscal
policies, would make the country more resilient. Moreover, higher growth and progress in
reducing rural poverty would also help reduce these vulnerabilities.
35.
The provision of data is broadly adequate for Fund surveillance. However, staff
encourages the authorities to pursue their efforts to address, including with Fund support,
limitations and deficiencies in their data compilation and reporting systems.
36.
Based on program performance to date and the authorities’ commitments to
program implementation, staff recommends completion of the fourth review of the
ECF arrangement.
37.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Mali will take place in
accordance with the July 15, 2002 Executive Board decision on consultation cycles.

Cumulative figures from the beginning of each year. Noncontinuous performance criteria at end-March and end-September 2009 are quantitative benchmarks. See technical memorandum of understandings for definitions.
These quantitative targets are before payment of VAT credits in arrears. The revised targets for the end-June, end-September, and end-December 2009 reflect the recapitalization of the Housing Bank of Mali (BHM) for CFAF 19.1 billion in May 2009

and net projected reductions of the payment float by CFAF 45 billion at end-June and end-September 2009, and CFAF 30 billion at end-December 2009 (the program includes an adjustor for any deviations from the targets on the reduction of the payment float).

APPENDIX I
Program of the Government of Mali Supported by an
Arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility
LETTER OF INTENT FOR THE 4TH REVIEW

Bamako, June 28, 2010
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
U.S.A.
Sir:
1.
Implementation of our economic and financial program supported by the International
Monetary Fund through an arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) was
satisfactory in 2009 and the results achieved were encouraging. Unlike the surge in global
food and energy prices in 2008, the 2009 international financial crisis and global recession
had only a limited impact on the national economy. In 2010, the year of our fiftieth
anniversary of independence, we intend to continue our efforts to promote sustained
economic growth with a view to improving the living standards of the population and
reducing poverty. Attainment of these objectives is contingent on maintaining
macroeconomic stability and deepening important structural reforms, particularly in the area
of public financial management.
A.

Program implementation in 2009 and in the first quarter of 2010

2.
The economic climate was relatively positive in 2009. As stated in our letter of
December 23 last, favorable prices for gold—which accounts for 75 percent of our export
earnings—the fall in world energy and food prices following their steep rise in 2008, and a
second consecutive year of good rainfall meant that the Malian economy was not unduly
affected by the adverse effects of the global recession.
3.
Gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 4.5 percent in real terms, driven mainly by
the good results of the crop year. These good results also helped bring average inflation down

40
from 9.1 percent in 2008 to 2.2 percent in 2009, against the backdrop of the easing of
regional monetary conditions by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO).
4.
Helped by the evolution of international prices of gold, petroleum products and food,
the external current account deficit showed only a slight dip despite a drop of around
15 percent in migrant workers’ remittances and a decline in revenue from tourism as a
consequence of both the global recession and security problems in the north of the country.
5.
The capital account balance also improved markedly owing essentially to the IMF
SDR allocations and the rise in foreign direct investment, which was in turn largely
attributable to the partial privatization of Société des Télécommunications du Mali
(SOTELMA), resulting in an appreciable increase in Mali’s contribution to the international
reserves of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU).
6.
These good results overall reflect not only favorable external factors but also the
implementation of prudent macroeconomic policies. The government’s underlying basic
fiscal balance (excluding expenditures financed by the Highly Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) Initiative and receipts from the privatization of SOTELMA) recorded a deficit of
CFAF 32.7 billion (0.8 percent of GDP) in 2009, as opposed to the 1.4 percent of GDP
projected during the third program review and compared with a deficit of 1 percent of GDP
in 2008. The basic deficit, including expenditures financed by SOTELMA, was contained at
1.4 percent of GDP compared with a target of 1.8 percent. This outcome is a reflection of
strong tax revenue performance, especially indirect taxes, and control of spending. Revenue
overshot their targets by 0.5 percentage point to reach 15.4 percent of GDP. On the
expenditure side, savings on current expenditure made it possible to offset an overrun in
domestic financed capital outlays and net lending.
7.
Despite improved control of the basic fiscal balance, we were unable to meet the
target for reducing the government’s budgetary float vis-à-vis its suppliers and Treasury
correspondents at end-2009. The budgetary float of CFAF 145.7 billion at end-2008 was
reduced to CFAF 129.1 billion at end-2009, compared with the CFAF 66 billion targeted in
the program. This outcome can be explained by the stepped up pace of expenditures in the
last quarter of 2009, following the strict regulation of spending over the first nine months of
the year, and the late disbursement of CFAF 32 billion in external budgetary assistance in the
last days of the month of December 2009. The issuance and the settlement of payment orders
in the fourth quarter were consequently carried over in part to 2010 in the form of new
budgetary float. Nevertheless, the deposits accumulated at December 31, 2009 were used in
the first quarter of 2010 to reduce the budgetary float to CFAF 55.2 billion at end-March
2010, that is below the target initially set for end-2009. These significant fluctuations of the
budgetary float strengthen our determination to make further improvements in the forward
management of government cash flow. If one takes into account the reduction of the Value
Added Tax (VAT) credits owed to mining companies from CFAF 69 billion at
end-December 2008 to CFAF 29 billion at end-December 2009, the pending bills of the State

41
have been reduced from CFAF 215 billion to CFAF 158 billion over the same period. We
intend to reduce this level of pending bills to CFAF 80 billion at end-December 2010.
8.
All the performance criteria of the program for end-December 2009 were met,
including the two related to net domestic financing of the government, which were corrected
to take account of VAT arrears clearance operations and the underperformance noted with
regard to the reduction of the budgetary float. In addition, the three structural benchmarks for
end-December 2009 on the (i) adoption of a strategy and a timetable for government
divestment of the state-owned housing bank (BHM), (ii) finalization of a study on the
macroeconomic impact of the gold sector, and (iii) preparation, jointly with the BCEAO, of
an inventory of the accounts included in the net position of the government vis-à-vis the
banking system and of an appropriate methodology for recording the movements of the
accounts in the table of the government’s financial operations (TOFE).
9.
However, the benchmark on the putting in place of a system to monitor the budgetary
float has not been met, particularly as a result of delays in implementing the new integrated
government accounting software application. A coordination unit was set up at the National
Directorate of the Treasury and Public Accounting (DNTCP) to support the provider in
accelerating the operationalization of the software. Pending the implementation of the real
time monitoring system, outstanding payments continue to be monitored on a regular basis
through the expenditure chain. Since end-April 2010, the DNTCP has also been receiving
technical assistance from an IMF resident expert for the implementation of the new public
accounting management integrated software.
10.
We have continued to observe satisfactory economic and financial developments in
2010. International market trends remain favorable to Mali; national economic growth
indicators are encouraging; and average inflation has continued to subside to reach
1.2 percent at end-April. The launching of the 2010/11 agricultural campaign was done under
good conditions and is supported by favorable initial weather conditions, except in the East
of the country where a drought persists and results in pockets of food shortages that we aim
at addressing through our food security program and with our development partners. The
implementation of our program remains satisfactory; based on preliminary data, the
indicative quantitative targets at end-March 2010 have been observed.
B.

Outlook for 2010

11.
The revision of our economic and financial program for 2010 is based on the
objectives and commitments made under the third program review. Essentially, it reflects the
implementation of a fiscal policy that targets higher growth through an increase of nonrecurrent spending financed by revenues from the privatization of SOTELMA. We intend to
continue to focus on prudent public financial management and the deepening of key
structural reforms in pursuit of the objectives contained in the Poverty Reduction and Growth

42
Strategy Framework (CSCRP). The support of Mali’s technical and financial partners (TFPs)
remains vital for our ongoing efforts in this direction.
12.
Economic growth is expected to exceed 5 percent in 2010, fuelled by the upturn in
both regional and global economic activity, our adjusted fiscal policy, and the projected good
agricultural harvest. According to current forecasts, cotton ginning is set to recover and more
robust activity is projected in the building, public works, and tertiary sectors. At the regional
level, the BCEAO will continue to pursue a prudent monetary policy to anchor inflation
expectations and stabilize inflation at around 2 percent in Mali. However, despite the
continued solid performance of gold prices on the world market and the rise in cotton prices,
our external position may deteriorate slightly as foreign direct investment tapers off from the
exceptionally high level reached in 2009 as a result of the privatization of SOTELMA.
Further, our economy remains very heavily dependent on rainfall and continues to be
vulnerable to new exogenous shocks, including on its terms of trade.
Fiscal policy
13.
The government stands by the commitments and fiscal objectives adopted in its
previous letter of intent. Thus, prior to the conclusion of the fourth program review, the
government intends to submit to the National Assembly a supplementary budget
incorporating various policy components that could not be taken into account at the time of
the vote on the initial budget for 2010.
14.
In the supplementary budget law for 2010, the target for the basic deficit (excluding
HIPC expenditure) has been increased from 1.6 to 2.4 percent of GDP, reflecting an increase
in non-recurrent spending financed by SOTELMA privatization receipts. As regards the
underlying basic deficit, that is, excluding expenditures financed by SOTELMA, the initial
target level remains unchanged at 1.1 percent of GDP as both revenue and expenditure
measures have been put in place to offset the new fiscal spending amounting to around
0.8 percent of GDP.
15.
The revenue target remains unchanged at 15.4 percent of GDP. The supplementary
budget includes an amount of CFAF 5 billion paid by a telecommunications company for a
third-generation (3G) license. Further, in view of the efforts made by the Directorate-General
of Taxes (DGI) in the area of tax administration, its revenue target for 2010 has been revised
upwards by CFAF 3 billion. To ensure that its revenue targets are met, the government will
continue its policy of reflecting international oil price fluctuations in domestic prices.
Petroleum product prices were, therefore, raised last April. Good revenue performance in the
first quarter of 2010, in line with the program, also offers sufficient justification for keeping
the revenue target unchanged.
16.
On the expenditure side, we have finalized the broad outlines for use of the
SOTELMA privatization proceeds to finance non-recurrent expenditures over the 2009–12

43
period (see attached Table 1). The revised 2010 budget law takes on board an additional
CFAF 30.9 billion in expenditures to be financed by these proceeds, that is, an increase of
0.9 percent of GDP bringing the total to 1.4 percent of GDP. The planned expenditure
concerns mostly capital expenditure to support economic growth. The transparent
management and close monitoring of the use of the privatization receipts will be ensured
through specific allocations in the budget laws and the use of a sub-account of the Treasury
in the BCEAO, which was opened especially for the recording and use of this revenue.
17.
The supplementary budget also provides an opportunity for budget support needs in
the context of efforts to revive the cotton sector and the agricultural inputs subsidization
policy for the 2010/11 crop season to be reflected more adequately. These needs have arisen
from recent information on the conduct of the crop season and decisions taken in March 2010
by the Higher Council for Agriculture. The budget allocation of CFAF 13.9 billion included
in the initial budget law for the subsidization of agricultural inputs will be increased by
CFAF 7.8 billion to incorporate expenditures planned under this item for the 2010/11 crop
season. Similarly, budget support to the cotton sector in 2010 will be increased by CFAF
16.1 billion, including CFAF 8.7 billion corresponding to assumption by government of the
costs of the CMDT employee reduction scheme, a CFAF 2 billion contribution to the efforts
to rehabilitate the cotton ginning plant, CFAF 2 billion for the settlement of banking payment
arrears, and CFAF 3.4 billion to clear the arrears on invoices for inputs from the 2006/07 and
2007/08 crop seasons. The adequacy of these additional expenditures to meet the needs of
supporting agricultural inputs and the cotton sector will be assessed in the context of the fifth
program review.
18.
The supplementary budget law also includes an adjustment of the amounts to cover
expenditures for interest payments on domestic debt and the holding of a constitutional
referendum before the end of the year. This referendum opens the way for important
institutional reforms aimed at consolidating our democracy. Among other things, the
proposed reforms address the creation d’un Senate, an Audit Office (Cour des Comptes) to
strengthen existing provisions for ex-post control of budget execution, and a single,
independent audiovisual regulatory authority.
19.
Thus, the new expenditures contained in the supplementary budget law amount in
total to CFAF 63.9 billion, i.e., 1.4 percent of GDP, broken down as follows: 7.0 billion in
expenditures of goods and services, 19.1 billion in transfers and subsidies, 4.0 billion in
interest on domestic debt, 28.9 billion in capital expenditure, and 7.4 billion in net lending.
SOTELMA privatization receipts will finance the increased level of capital expenditure and
CFAF 2 billion of net lending, in addition to the CFAF 28.9 billion already included in the
initial budget law, i.e., a total of CFAF 59.8 billion.
20.
In the light of the new expenditure and revenue, the government has committed in the
supplementary budget law to making savings on expenditure during the execution of the
budget law so as to limit the underlying basic deficit to CFAF 52.6 billion, that is the initial

44
target of 1.1 percent of GDP. Twenty-five percent of the planned budget savings, estimated
at about CFAF 20 billion, or 0.4 percent of GDP, will be in the area of goods and services,
twenty-five percent in subsidies and transfers, and fifty-percent in capital expenditure.
21.
The government’s overall budget deficit, on a commitment basis and excluding
grants, is targeted at CFAF 393 billion, i.e., 8.5 percent of GDP versus actual figures of
6.9 percent of GDP in 2009. Taking into account net external financing, including grants,
estimated at 3.9 percent of GDP, the need for domestic financing of this fiscal stimulus to
support growth is limited to 1.1 percent of GDP. To this need should also be added, however,
the projected reduction of the stock of outstanding payments at end-2009 by CFAF
49 billion. In addition, the government has accumulated CFAF 29 billion in new arrears of
VAT credit reimbursements to four mining companies whose tax amnesty period recently
expired. These arrears will be settled in 2010, possibly through a rescheduling agreement
over 3 years.
22.
The overall need for domestic financing of the budget, therefore, amounts to
2.8 percent of GDP. It will be met primarily by drawing on the exceptional revenues from the
privatization of SOTELMA (1.3 percent of GDP), deposits constituted at end-2009
(0.7 percent), and rescheduling of the VAT arrears (0.4 percent).
Structural Reforms
23.
We are pursuing our efforts to improve public financial management supported by
our TFPs. In the wake of the satisfactory implementation of the action plan for improving
and modernizing public financial management (PAGAM/GFP), a second generation of
reforms is under preparation (PAGAM 2) in line with standards of the Public Expenditure
and Financial Accountability (PEFA) framework. In the strategic plan, the PAGAM/GFP2
are aimed mainly at:


Optimizing government revenues on a sustainable basis,



Improving the quality of budget preparation and execution to encourage our partners
to use budget support as the preferred form of assistance,



Strengthening the system of financial governance by improving the efficiency of expost controls by the Accounts Section,



Stepping up fiscal deconcentration and decentralization supported, starting in 2010,
by a three-year World Bank technical assistance program.

24.
Improving the mobilization of domestic financial resources remains one of the
government’s main priorities. To this effect, we will adopt a national tax transition program
with a view to increasing the tax revenue to GDP ratio to 17 percent in the medium term,
with emphasis on broadening the tax base and revamping existing exemption arrangements

45
(structural benchmark). The program will include a study on the tax potential of Mali as well
as a new generation of tax reforms aimed at modernizing and streamlining our tax system for
which we are seeking IMF technical assistance. Against that backdrop and in the context of
transposing WAEMU directives on taxation into the national legislation, a number of draft
legislative texts will be prepared for submission to the National Assembly, including
legislation to reduce corporate taxes and introduce a land tax on developed and undeveloped
property. A draft new mining code will be prepared by end-December 2010 that will cover
other mineral resources beyond gold, facilitate mining research and exploration, and be
integrated in the program to modernize and streamline the tax system.
25.
The Directorates-General of Taxes (DGI) and of Customs (DGD) will continue their
efforts to improve tax and customs administration, with technical assistance from the IMF.
The DGI will continue to pay special attention to the functioning of the new Medium
Taxpayer Office (MTO). Along similar lines, the DGD will continue to work towards
introducing an automated targeting system for customs inspections by early 2011. Efforts
will also to needed to modernize and strengthen the capacity of the National Directorate of
Government Lands and Property Registry (DNDC), established in 2002, as part of the
broader objective of boosting revenue recollection. A program to enhance the DNDC will be
approved by end-2010.
26.
The government will implement by end-December 2010, in consultation with the
Fund, a VAT management system that respects the integrity of the tax and provides an
effective mechanism for the prevention and the reimbursement of VAT credit arrears
(structural benchmark). In this context, it commits to resolving the problems of accumulation
and reimbursement of VAT credits in general and of export companies in particular.
27.
In the context of the transition to result-oriented budgets, we have effectively started
in April 2010 the migration of our public spending management software to a new version
(PRED5). The modules for the preparation and execution of the budget have been
parameterized and output tables prepared. Test operations are ongoing with a view to make it
fully operational by end-June 2010. A new public accounting software will also be
operational at end-2010 and inter-connected with the public spending management software
to ensure a monitoring not only of budgetary execution up to the final payment stage but also
of pending bills (structural benchmark).
28.
Significant progress has been made towards the introduction, by end-June 2010, of a
new government flow of funds table (TOFE) in which the presentation of domestic financing
(bank and nonbank) will be consistent with international best practices. These efforts aimed
at improving budgetary statistics will be pursued in the second half of 2010 and incorporated
into the ongoing work to upgrade the rolling projected cash-flow plan to strengthen cash
management.

46
29.
In addition, the National Public Debt Committee (CNDP) established by Decree of
September 24, 2009 will become operational by end-September 2010 by the adoption of
regulations regarding its operations and the nomination of the members of the technical
commission of the CNDP. The CNDP is responsible for examining all domestic or external
debt plans and requests for guarantees prior to any final decision by the government. The
reporting and the management of the domestic debt will be strengthened with a view to, first,
ensuring the exhaustivity of data at the level of the CNDP and, second, improving the
programming of the recourse to regional financial markets.
Other structural reforms
30.
The government will continue to implement the recommendations of the 2008
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), in keeping with the financial system
development strategy adopted in the same year. Particular attention will be paid to
implementation of the restructuring plan of the BHM, with the goal of divestment of the
government’s interests in 2012. Thus, by end-December 2010, the government will proceed
with the recruitment of a privatization advisor. It will conduct an evaluation of the
restructuring plan of the BHM, including the use of the government funds transferred for the
renewed lending activities of the BHM in the first half of 2010, in collaboration with the
BCEAO (structural benchmark).
31.
For the cotton sector, the call for expressions of interest in the privatization of the
cotton parastatal CMDT was published in February 2010. A special workshop in April 2010
validated the draft of the national strategic framework for the development of the cotton
sector, and the final report will be ready by end-June 2010. The government will ensure that
this privatization operation takes place in the best conditions to ensure the economic and
financial sustainability of the sector.
Modalities for monitoring the program
32.
Discussions on the fifth program review will focus on the implementation of
structural reforms and on the draft budget for 2011 taking into account the fiscal anchor on
an underlying basic deficit of around 1 percent of GDP.
33.
Performance under the current program will be evaluated on the basis of Tables 3
and 5 and the Technical Memorandum of Understanding attached. In that context, we request
the modification of the end-June 2010 quantitative performance criteria and benchmarks,
which takes into account the end-2009 outcome and recent developments. It is envisaged that
the fifth program review will be concluded by end-2010 on the basis of the performance
criteria at end-June 2010 and that the sixth review will be completed by end-May 2011 on the
basis of the performance criteria at end-2010.

47
34.
The government requests that the Executive Board of the IMF complete the fourth
review of Mali’s ECF arrangement and approve the disbursement of the fifth loan equivalent
to SDR 2 million. The government considers that the policies described in this letter are
sufficient to achieve its program objectives. It will, however, take any other measures that
may prove necessary to that end. Mali will consult with the Fund on the adoption of these
measures and in advance of any revision to the policies contained in this letter, in accordance
with the Fund’s policies on such consultation. The government will provide Fund staff with
any required information contained in the Technical Memorandum of Understanding on
progress made in implementing the program. During the program, the government will not
introduce or intensify any exchange restrictions, multiple currency practice, or import
restriction for balance of payments of purposes, nor conclude any bilateral payment
agreements that are inconsistent with Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. The
government authorizes the IMF to publish this letter, and the related Staff Report on this
review.
Yours sincerely,
/s/

and net projected reductions of the payment float by CFAF 45 billion at end-June and end-September 2009, and CFAF 30 billion at end-December 2009 (the program includes an adjustor for any deviations from the targets on the reduction of the payment float).

ATTACHMENT I
TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
1.
This technical memorandum of understanding defines the performance criteria and
benchmarks for the program supported by the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement. It
also sets out the frequency and deadlines for data reporting to the staff of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) for program-monitoring purposes.
I. DEFINITIONS
2.
Unless otherwise indicated, the government is defined as the central administration of
the Republic of Mali and does not include local administrations, the central bank, or any
other public entity with autonomous legal personality that is not included in the table of
government financial operations (TOFE).
3.
The definitions of “debt” and “concessional loans” for the purposes of this
memorandum of understanding are as follows:
(a)

Debt is defined in Point 9 of the Decision of the Executive Directors of the IMF
No. 12274-00/85 of August 24, 2000, as revised on August 31, 2009 (Decision No.
14416-(09/91).

(b)

A loan is considered concessional if, on the date the contract is signed, the ratio of the
present value of the debt, based on the reference interest rates, to the nominal value of
the debt is less than 65 percent (i.e., a grant element exceeding 35 percent). The
reference interest rates used in this assessment are the currency specific commercial
interest reference rates (CIRRs) established by the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD). For debt with a maturity exceeding 15 years,
the ten-year-average CIRR published by the OECD is used to calculate the grant
element. For shorter maturities, the six-month average CIRR is used. To both the tenyear and six-month averages, the same margins for differing repayment periods as
those used by the OECD need to be added (0.75 percent for repayment periods of less
than 15 years, 1 percent for 15 to 19 years, 1.15 percent for 20 to 29 years, and 1.25
percent for 30 years or more).
II. QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA AND FINANCIAL INDICATORS

Except as noted, the following financial variables shall constitute performance criteria at
end-June and End-December and financial indicators otherwise. The basic fiscal balance is a
financial indicator at all test dates.

54
A. Ceiling on Net Domestic Financing of the Government; Subceiling on
Net Domestic Bank and Market Financing of the Government
4.
Net domestic financing is defined as the sum of (i) net bank credit to government, as
defined below, and (ii) nonbank financing of the government.
5.
Figures on net bank credit to government are calculated by the BCEAO. Figures on
nonbank financing are calculated by the public treasury, and are final in the context of the
program.
6.
Net bank credit to government is defined as the balance between government debts
and government claims vis-à-vis the central bank and commercial banks. The scope of net
bank credit to government is that used by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO)
and is consistent with established Fund practice in this area. It implies a broader definition of
government than that specified in paragraph 2 by also including local governments, and
selected autonomous government agencies and projects. government claims include the
CFA franc cash balance, postal checking accounts, secured liabilities (obligations
cautionnées), and all deposits with the BCEAO and commercial banks of public entities, with
the exception of industrial or commercial public institutions (EPICs) and public enterprises,
which are excluded from the calculation. Government debts to the banking system include all
debts to these same financial institutions. Deposits of the cotton stabilization fund and
government securities held outside the Malian banking system are not included in the
calculation of net bank credit to government.
7.
Nonbank financing of the government is defined as nonbank market financing and
other nonbank financing. Nonbank market financing includes sales net of repayments of
government bills and bonds held outside national banking institutions. Other nonbank
financing of the government includes proceeds from the sale of government assets,
repayments on domestic debt to nonbank creditors, and other net claims on the treasury. The
receipts from sale of government assets are defined as the proceeds from the sale, effectively
received by the government during the fiscal year, of all or part of the shares held by the
government in privatized enterprises. In the event that payments in respect of these sale
transactions are expected to extend beyond the fiscal year, the residual will be included in the
calculation of nonbank financing of the government in each of the subsequent years, in
accordance with the annual scheduling of the expected payments.
8.
Net domestic bank and market financing of the government is defined as the sum of
(i) net bank credit to government, as defined above, and (iii) nonbank financing of the
government through the issuance of securities to nonbanks or to nonresident banks domiciled
within the West African Economic and Monetary Union.

55
Adjustment factors
9.
The ceiling on the change in net domestic financing of the government and the
subceiling on bank and market financing in 2010 will be adjusted down (up) if external
budgetary assistance exceeds (falls short of) the program amount. Budgetary assistance is
defined as grants, loans, and debt relief (excluding project loans and grants, IMF resources,
and debt relief under the Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries, but including both
general and sectoral budget support). Adjustment will be made at a rate of nil percent for
amounts up to CFAF 10 billion; 50 percent for amounts from CFAF 10 billion up to
CFAF 25 billion; and 75 percent for amounts in excess of CFAF 25 billion.
10.
The ceiling on the change in net domestic financing of the government and the subceiling on bank and market financing in 2010 will be adjusted up (down) if the actual net
reduction of the payment float exceeds (falls short) of the programmed amounts (CFAF
43.7 billion at end-June, CFAF 48.7 billion at end-September 2010, and CFAF 49.1 billion at
end-December 2010). The payment float is defined to include payment orders unpaid by the
Treasury in the context of the budget execution and the deposits of correspondents and
various depositors, irrespective of their age. In addition, the ceiling on the change in net
domestic financing and the sub-ceiling on bank and market financing in 2010 will be
adjusted up for the settlement of VAT credits to exporters that are in excess of the
programmed amounts, that is CFAF zero billion at end-June and end-September 2010, and
CFAF 29 billion at end-December 2010: the adjustment refers to payments made on VAT
credits accrued in 2010 and on the end-2009 stock of CFAF 29 billion.
B. Nonaccumulation of External Public Payments Arrears
11.
External payments arrears are defined as the sum of external payments due and
unpaid for external liabilities of the government and foreign debt held or guaranteed by the
government. The definition of external debt provided in paragraph 3(a) applies here.
12.
Under the program, the government will not accumulate external payments arrears,
with the exception of arrears arising from debt under renegotiation or being rescheduled. The
performance criterion on the nonaccumulation of external payments arrears will be applied
on a continuous basis throughout the program period.
C.

Ceiling on Nonconcessional External Debt with a Maturity of One Year or More
Newly Contracted or Guaranteed by the Government and/or Public Enterprises

13.
This performance criterion applies not only to debt as defined in point 9 of the
Executive Board Decision No. 12274-(00/85) (8/24/00), as revised on August 31, 2009
(Decision No. 14416-(09/91), but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for which no
value has yet been received.

56
14.
The concept of government for the purposes of this performance criterion includes
government as defined in paragraph 2, administrative public institutions (EPAs), scientific
and/or technical public institutions, professional public institutions, industrial and/or
commercial public institutions (EPICs), state-owned enterprises, and local governments.
15.
Starting on the date of program approval by the Executive Board of the IMF, a ceiling
of zero is set for nonconcessional borrowing. This performance criterion is monitored on a
continuous basis.
16.
The government undertakes not to contract or guarantee external debt with a maturity
of one year or more and a grant element of less than 35 percent (calculated using the
reference interest rates corresponding to the borrowing currencies provided by the IMF). This
performance criterion applies not only to debt as defined in point 9 of the Executive Board
Decision No. 12274-(00/85) (8/24/00), as revised on August 31, 2009 (Decision No. 14416(09/91), but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for which no value has yet been
received. However, the criterion does not apply to (i) financing granted by the IMF, (ii) debt
rescheduling transactions of debt existing at the time of the approval of the PRGF
arrangement, and (iii) CFA franc debt contracted or guaranteed by the government with West
African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) residents (including CFA debt initially
contracted or guaranteed by the government with WAEMU residents and subsequently
acquired by nonresidents).
D. Ceiling on Short-Term External Debt Newly Contracted or Guaranteed
by the Government and/or Public Enterprises
17.
The definition in paragraph 2 and 3 of this TMU applies to this performance criterion.
Short-term external debt is debt with a contractual term of less than one year. Import- related
credit, CMDT foreign borrowing secured by the proceeds of cotton exports, and debt-relief
operations are excluded from this performance criterion. Treasury bills issued in CFA francs
on the WAEMU regional market are also excluded. In the context of the program, the
government and public enterprises will not contract, or guarantee, short-term external debt.
This performance criterion is monitored on a continuous basis.
E. Floor on Cumulative Net Tax Revenues
18.
Government tax revenues are defined as those that figure in the Table on government
financial operations (TOFE), and include all tax revenues accruing to the ordinary budget.
Net tax revenues are gross tax revenues less tax refunds, notably on VAT. The government

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms at the
completion point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in NPV terms at
the decision point. Hence these two amounts cannot be added.
2

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point
corresponding to interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed
during the interim period.
Decision point—point at which the IMF and the World Bank determine whether a country qualifies for
assistance under the HIPC initiative and decide on the amount of assistance to be committed.
Interim assistance—amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision and completion
points, up to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the assistance committed at the decision point
(or 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in exceptional circumstances).
Completion point—point at which the country receives the remaining balance of its assistance committed
at the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of interest income as defined in footnote 2
above. The timing of the completion point is linked to the implementation of pre-agreed key structural
reforms (i.e., floating completion point).

full stock of debt owed to the Fund as of end-2004 that remains outstanding at the time the member
qualifies for such debt relief.

9.

Safeguards Assessments

The Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) is a common central bank of the
countries of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAMU). The most recent
safeguards assessment of the BCEAO was completed on March 1, 2010. The 2010 update
assessment found that the BCEAO continues to have controls in place at the operational
level. The overall governance framework should nonetheless be strengthened by the addition
of an audit committee to ensure that the Board of Directors exercises appropriate oversight
over the control structure, including the audit mechanisms and financial statements. The
completion of the Institutional Reform of the WAMU and the BCEAO in the beginning of
2010 should help to correct that situation. Efforts to implement fully the International
Financial Reporting Standards reporting framework should also be pursued.
10.

Exchange Rate Arrangements

Mali is a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). The
exchange system, common to all members of the union, has no restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions. The union’s common currency,
the CFA franc, was pegged to the French franc at the rate of CFAF 50 = FF 1 from 1948 until
early 1994. Effective January 12, 1994, the CFA franc was devalued, and the new parity set
at CFAF 100 = FF 1. Effective January 1, 1999, the CFA franc was pegged to the Euro at a
rate of CFAF 655.96 = EUR 1.
As of June 1, 1996, Mali and other members of WAEMU accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. Mali’s exchange

65
system has no restrictions on making payments or transfers for current international
transactions and the country does not engage in multiple currency practices.
Sharing a common trade policy with other members of WAEMU, Mali has shifted key trade
policy-making to the sub-regional level. The common external tariff (CET) was adopted in
January 2000. Mali complies with the union’s tariff rate structure and has effectively
dismantled internal tariffs. Between 1997 and 2003, WAEMU tariff reform reduced the
simple average custom duty from 22 percent to 15 percent; the maximum rate is currently
20 percent. Imports to Mali are not subject to quantitative restrictions.
Mali’s exports to the European Union generally enjoy non-reciprocal preferential treatment
in the form of exemption from import duties under the Everything but Arms initiative.
Malian goods enjoy nonreciprocal preferential access to the markets of developed countries
other than the European Union under the Generalized System of Preferences. Mali is also
eligible to benefits from the United States’ African Growth and Opportunity Act. Mali
imposes no de jure restrictions on exports.
11.

Article IV Consultations

Mali’s Article IV consultation cycle is governed by the provisions of the July 2002 decision
on consultation cycles. The Executive Board completed the 2008 Article IV consultation
(EBS/08/52) on May 28, 2008.

II. MALI: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
7
(May, 2010)
A.

Partnership in Mali’s development strategy

1.
Mali’s Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Framework (GPRSF), adopted by the
Government in December 2006, comprises programs over the 2007-11 period grouped under
the following three pillars: (i) infrastructure development and strengthening of the productive
sectors (including food security, rural development, SME development, and sustainable
natural resources management); (ii) strengthening of the structural reform agenda
(comprising public sector reforms, investment climate, financial sector, governance, and
capacity of the civil society); and (iii) strengthening of social sector services (including
promotion of job creation, improved access to basic social services, and HIV/AIDS).
2.
The IMF and World Bank staffs maintain a collaborative relationship in supporting
the Government’s macroeconomic and structural reforms, in line with the guidelines for
enhanced Bank-Fund collaboration. This includes participation of Bank staff in the meetings
with the Malian authorities on the Fund’s program review missions, and IMF staff
participation in Bank development policy missions as well as in Bank internal review
meetings on key operations or studies. The IMF takes the lead in macroeconomic
stabilization and the World Bank in social and structural areas, with close collaboration on a
few structural areas that have a particular impact on macroeconomic stability. The Fund’s
dialogue and conditionality are consistent with the structural programs agreed with the Bank,
and the Bank’s policy framework with Mali is consistent with the Government’s
macroeconomic framework agreed with the Fund.
B.

World Bank Group strategy

3.
The World Bank Group’s strategy, outlined in the joint IDA-IFC Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) discussed by the Board of Directors on February 5, 2008, selectively
supports key pillars of the 2006 GPRSF. The CAS covers the period FY08-11 and has two
strategic objectives: (i) promote rapid and broad-based growth; and (ii) strengthen public
sector performance for service delivery. Within the two CAS pillars, the Bank will focus on
(a) private sector led growth by addressing key constraints such as productivity, energy,
transport, and finance and by linking the country to the rest of the world; (b) governance; and
(c) capacity development. The Bank also supports Mali under the Bank’s Regional
Integration Assistance Strategy (2001), notably the programs for connection to the West
Africa Power Pool, harmonization of country policies and/or regulatory frameworks
(telecommunications, agriculture, and financial sectors), water resource development of the
Niger and Senegal Rivers, strengthening of road transport corridors and transit facilitation,
and strengthening the regional payments system. The Bank’s assistance to Mali in its support
to regional integration will be fully aligned with the regional PRS and WAEMU regional
7

69
economic program (REP) priorities.
4.
As of May 2010, the IDA portfolio in Mali consists of 9 operations totaling $526.05
million in net commitments, of which $306 million (58 percent) remain undisbursed.
Including the regional operations, the portfolio amounts to $712.24 million. About 36 percent
of the IDA portfolio is concentrated in the energy sector. The FY08-FY11 CAS envisages
yearly PRSCs and self-standing investments in key projects in the energy, agriculture and
urban sectors. The second series of PRSCs (PRSC-3 to PRSC-5) was introduced in FY09.
The second operation of the series is scheduled for Board consideration on June 1, 2010, for
an amount of SDR 46.5 (US$70.5 equivalent), including SDR 10.3 million (US$15.5
equivalent) in Pilot Crisis Response Window resources.
5.
Recently completed non-lending activities include a Public Expenditure Management
and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR); a study on Mali Population and
Development; a Mali Education Diagnosis for the Third Investment program for the
Education Sector, a study on Skills Development, a study on Mali Safety Nets, and two
studies on the impact of the food crisis namely “Assessing the Potential Impact on Poverty of
Rising Cereals Prices” and “Impact of Rising Rice Prices and Policy Responses in Mali:
Simulations with a Dynamic CGE Model”. Ongoing non-lending activities include a series
of notes on growth, and an Investment Climate Assessment. The Bank is also supporting the
preparation of the second Public Expenditure and Financial accountability (PEFA) report and
a household survey. The FY11 indicative knowledge program includes a growth note on
mining, a country environmental assessment, and poverty notes.

IMF-World Bank collaboration

6.
Areas in which the Fund leads. The Fund takes the lead in macroeconomic
stabilization including macro-fiscal policy, monetary policy, exchange rate policy, and
financial stability and risk management.
7.
Areas in which the Bank leads. The Bank takes the lead in structural areas where
both institutions have conditionality, including cotton sector reform, privatization and
regulatory reform (financial and mining sectors). The Bank also leads in other areas such as:
agricultural competitiveness/diversification and rural development; private sector
development; urban development; transportation policy/infrastructure; energy sector reforms;
and social sectors (health, education, social protection, and population issues). The Bank’s
work in structural areas includes lending operations, analytical work and economic and social
policy dialogue. The Bank collaborates closely with other donors in all areas of its sector
dialogue with Mali. Harmonized donor support is established in some sections (health,
education, Office du Niger, cotton, budget) and is being established in other sectors, namely
rural water supply and sanitation.
8.
Areas of shared responsibility. Both Bank and Fund monitor progress on budgetary
and public expenditure management, yet emphasize different aspects of the Government’s
reform program in the respective support operations to Mali. The Bank emphasis in this area
is on strengthening all phases of the public expenditure system—budget preparation,
execution, and controls—to support the Government’s objectives of progressive shift toward

70
result-based budgeting and improved expenditure management. Bank support is at the
national level in the finance ministry (Medium Term Budget Frameworks, procurement,
budget reporting, auditing, and information technology system) and sector ministries
(selected sector MTEFs, inter- and intra-sectoral allocations), as well as at de-concentrated
and decentralized levels of government (IT system, capacity building, auditing, participatory
monitoring and evaluation). The Fund’s emphasis is on fiscal management, expenditure
management (including financing of transfers to parastatals), revenue enhancing measures,
and audit capabilities. Table 1 summarizes the areas of Bank-Fund collaboration in Mali.

III. MALI: STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of April 30, 2010)
Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Mali has
been participating in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since September 2001
and has advanced the implementation of its short- and medium-term plans for improvement.
The metadata has been posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB), since
June 2003.
Real sector
The economic accounts of Mali are prepared by the National Directorate of Statistics and
Data Processing (DNSI), in accordance with the System of National Accounts 1968 (SNA68)
and adapted to certain characteristics specific to Mali. They are compiled on an annual basis.
There are, however, weaknesses in the accuracy, coverage, and timeliness of national
accounts data. The main reason has been the inadequacy of source data, along with
insufficient funding and technical staffing of the DNSI. The work on implementing the
System of National Accounts 1993 (1993 SNA) is ongoing, with the support of the West
African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) Commission and AFRITAC West. At
this time, the new base year, 2006, has been completed, and 2007 is near completion. It is
expected that a new national accounts series spanning 1997-2006 will be available by
October 2010.
In concert with other WAEMU member countries, the DNSI has been compiling and
publishing a harmonized consumer price index (CPI) for Bamako on a monthly basis since
early 1998.
Government finance statistics
As part of the process of economic integration among the member countries of the WAEMU,
the country has made significant progress in bringing its fiscal data in line with the common
framework that has been developed with technical assistance from the Fund (the harmonized
table of government financial operations – TOFE). However, further efforts are needed to
improve the timeliness and coverage of the TOFE. Work is progressing with the assistance of
STA, AFRITAC West and AFRISTAT to expand the coverage of the TOFE to public
agencies and local governments, as well as to strengthen coverage of domestic financing
items. Quarterly budget execution reports are posted on the Ministry of Finance website on a
timely basis.
In July 2007, a GFS mission visited Bamako to advance further the implementation of the
Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001, and subsequently a country page was
introduced in the 2007 issue of GFS Yearbook. To date the authorities have supplied six
years of annual GFS data and they are preparing to disseminate quarterly data to STA for

73
publication in IFS. In January 2008, the Minister of Finance issued a decree committing the
government to the development of a database which will facilitate the balance sheet approach
to analysis of the public sector; among the first steps will be an inventory and appraisal of the
fair market value of nonfinancial assets. In July 2008, STA AFRITAC West staff visited
Bamako for a short follow-up mission and was provided with complete data on both social
security agencies.
Public debt statistics are prepared and monitored by separate agencies: external debt by the
National Public Debt Directorate (NPDD) and domestic debt by the National Directorate of
the Treasury and Government Accounting. The NPDD uses CS-DRMS accounting software.
Debt data and projections are of generally good quality, although there is scope for
improving presentation as well as the coverage of debt relief (multilateral and bilateral). A
Debt Management Performance Assessment (DeMPA) was finalized in late 2009, and the
authorities are working to strengthen debt data in line with the DeMPA report’s
recommendations.
Monetary data
Monetary and financial statistics:
Monetary and financial statistics, compiled and disseminated by the regional Central Bank of
West African States (BCEAO), are broadly adequate and their institutional coverage is
comprehensive. The dissemination of monthly monetary data from the BCEAO takes four to
six weeks consistent with GDDS recommendations. Data are posted on the BCEAO website
with a considerably longer lag. Accuracy is somewhat hampered by the use of 1990 sorting
coefficients to estimate cross border amounts of banknotes among BCEAO countries, which
in turn are used to estimate currency in circulation and to adjust the net foreign assets of each
member country. Standardized Report Forms (in line with the Monetary and Financial
Statistical Manual) are still not regularly used to report monetary data to the IMF.
Balance of payments
In December 1998, the responsibility for compiling and disseminating balance of payments
statistics was formally assigned to the BCEAO by area-wide legislation adopted by the
countries participating in the WAEMU. The BCEAO national agency finalizes the data
toward mid-November of the following year, and publishes immediately thereafter in the
form of a brochure, which however are not sufficiently robust.
In general, the external sector statistics in Mali exhibit serious deficiencies. Concepts and
definitions used to compile the balance of payments statistics are in broad conformity with
the guidelines presented in the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5). The
adoption of BPM6 methodology is not required before 2013/2014, except for the recording of
SDR allocations as debt liabilities. The Mali balance of payments metadata should also be
updated.

74

The BCEAO set up a subregional unit responsible for reconciling intra-WAEMU trade data,
which is responsible for harmonizing the bilateral statistics of member states to eliminate
asymmetries before these data on internal transactions in the Union are consolidated to
prepare the WAEMU regional balance of payments. The corrections made are retroactive to
national data and help to improve them.
Balance of payments data remain weak in a number of key areas. Data on remittances,
foreign direct investment and portfolio flows are similarly weak. Project aid is currently
classified as current transfers rather than in the capital account, and several large in-kind
projects are not captured in the balance of payments data properly.
Data on international investment position is published in IFS and BOPSY up to 2007. A
foreign private capital survey (FPC) from DFI called “PRC CPE” is underway as in all Franc
Zone countries. However, foreign assets of the private non banking sector are not well
covered in the financial accounts as the surveys of residents’ foreign assets remain very
partial, and no use is made of an existing alternative source, e.g., BIS statistics.
The April-May 2003 multi sector statistics mission found that the balance of payments
compilation system is generally sound and encouraged the authorities to integrate banking
settlement sources and disseminate the balance of payments within the recommended
timeliness, as set by the GDDS. The first of these recommendations is remains pending.
Annual statistics on balance of payments are reported to STA on a regular basis, but with
some delay.
Poverty Statistics
The PRS Annual Update identifies a key set of poverty indicators for monitoring of the PRS
implementation.

IMF Executive Board Completes Fourth Review Under ECF Arrangement for Mali
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the fourth
review of Mali’s economic performance under a program supported by the Extended Credit
Facility (ECF)1. The Board’s decision enables the government to request a disbursement
amounting to SDR 2 million (about US$3 million), bringing total disbursements to Mali to
an amount equivalent to SDR 23.99 million (about US$36.1 million). The Executive Board
also approved the modification of end-June 2010 performance criteria.
The Executive Board also concluded the 2010 Article IV consultation. Details of the
findings of the Article IV will be published in a Public Information Notice in due course.
The ECF arrangement for Mali was approved in May 2008 (see Press Release No. 08/126)
for an amount equivalent to SDR 27.99 million (about US$42.1 million).
At the conclusion of the Board's discussion, Mr. John Lipsky, First Deputy Managing
Director and Acting Chair, stated:
“The authorities are to be commended for the satisfactory implementation of their economic
and financial program in 2009, despite the global economic crisis. The 2010 economic
outlook is positive, with a projected strengthening of economic activity. Continued

The Extended Credit Facility (ECF) has replaced the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) as the
Fund’s main tool for medium-term financial support to low-income countries by providing a higher level of
access to financing, more concessional terms, enhanced flexibility in program design features, and more
focused streamlined conditionality. Financing under the ECF currently carries a zero interest rate, with a grace
period of 5½ years, and a final maturity of 10 years. The Fund reviews the level of interest rates for all
concessional facilities every two years.

77
commitment to prudent macroeconomic and structural reform will be necessary to reduce
vulnerabilities, diversify the economy, raise economic growth, and reduce poverty.
“The authorities are implementing a modest fiscal stimulus package reflected in a revised
budget law and financed by part of SOTELMA’s privatization revenue. The authorities are
committed to ensure full transparency in the use of the privatization receipts. Budget
execution will need to be carefully monitored and the necessary savings ensured to achieve
the targets for the fiscal deficit and the reduction of pending bills.
“Prudent fiscal and debt policy will be critical to reduce the Malian economy’s vulnerability
to external shocks. The authorities plan to streamline the tax system and broaden the tax
base. They are also determined to strengthen public debt management and exercise prudence
in managing and contracting external debt.
“Mali’s structural reform program is making satisfactory progress, with a further
strengthening of public finance management targeted in 2010. The privatization of the cotton
parastatal CMDT and the reform program of the Housing Bank of Mali are on track.
Nevertheless, the authorities will need to redouble their reform efforts to enhance the
environment for private sector activity, improve the provision of financial services, diversify
the economic base, alleviate impediments to trade, and raise productivity” Mr Lpisky added.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation
with Mali
On July 16, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Mali.9
Background
As a landlocked Sahelian country of 14 million people, Mali has struggled to overcome low
social indicators and high poverty rates. Since the democratic transition of the early 1990s,
it has posted steady economic growth of around 5 percent per year. Macroeconomic
stability is reinforced through membership in the West African Economic and Monetary
Union (WAEMU). However, Mali’s dependence on a few export commodities and its
susceptibility to drought and other natural disasters has left it highly vulnerable to economic
shocks.
Macroeconomic performance has been generally good during the past two years. Mali’s
agriculture-based economy has weathered the global economic storm well. Its growth rates
have been among the highest in the WAEMU region in the last 5 years, and real gross
domestic product (GDP) grew by 4½ percent in 2009. Goods harvests, reflecting favorable
weather and supportive policies, have positively affected growth. The drop in crude oil and
food prices have contributed to a sharp reduction in inflation. Fiscal performance in 2009
was slightly better than expected, but the targeted reduction in pending bills and domestic
arrears was not fully achieved until March 2010. The external accounts benefited from
buoyant gold prices and the decline in oil and food prices, as well as the equivalent of

9

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds discussions with each member,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and
discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the
staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of
the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive
Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summing up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

79
5½ percentage points of GDP in exceptional external resources (privatization receipts and
the Special Drawing Rights (SDR) allocations).
A number of structural reforms were carried out in 2009. Telecom provider SOTELMA was
successfully privatized; a tender was launched to sell state cotton ginner CMDT; and
progress was made in restructuring the housing bank, BHM, prior to a planned 2012
privatization. The new multidonor public financial management (PFM) reform program,
PAGAM II, will be launched shortly, but previously-identified PFM reforms have continued.
Mali’s 2009 debt sustainability analysis, carried out jointly with World Bank staff, assessed
Mali’s risk of debt distress to be low. However, that analysis identified a number of risks,
notably the risk from the uncertain prospects from the mining sector and the risk from the
potential debt burden should Mali choose to borrow abroad on nonconcessional terms.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the authorities for their strong economic performance, supported by
sound macroeconomic management and favorable harvests and export prices. Directors
noted that continued commitment to prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reform
will be necessary to reduce vulnerabilities, diversify the economy, and reduce poverty.
Directors supported a limited fiscal stimulus in 2010, focusing on public investment and
other priority spending. In this context, they emphasized that further improvement in
transparency in budget planning and execution is crucial. Directors regretted the build-up of
pending bills, and recommended further efforts to strengthen cash management and
address the long-standing issue of VAT credit arrears. They also encouraged further
progress in broadening the tax base and improving revenue administration. Given the
uncertainties surrounding Mali’s export prospects, Directors called on the authorities to
devote particular attention to strengthening debt management to avoid the risk of debt
distress.
Directors concurred that the continued strong implementation of structural reforms remains
important to strengthen the economy’s competitiveness and raise growth potential. They
noted the recent good progress in this area, but encouraged further efforts to enhance the
business climate, improve the provision of financial services, and boost private sector-led
growth.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to incorporate the 2008 FSAP recommendations
into their financial sector development plans. They also commended the authorities for
taking steps to strengthen the AML-CFT regime. Directors encouraged the authorities to
strengthen statistical capacity, particularly in the area of public finance and balance of
payments statistics.

Statement by Laurean W. Rutayisire, Executive Director for Mali
July 14, 2010
1.
My Malian authorities continue to value the advice provided by the Fund and its staff
as they advance the policy and reform agenda set forth in Mali’s economic program
supported by the Extended Credit Facility (ECF). They are appreciative of the policy
dialogue they have held with staff and Management in Bamako and Washington in recent
months and look forward to maintaining a close and productive working relationship with the
Fund so as to facilitate further progress toward program objectives.
2.
The 2010 Article IV consultation provides yet another welcome opportunity for the
authorities to appreciate staff’s insight on the key policy challenges facing the country. Key
among these challenges is the need to achieve higher rates of economic growth so as to
significantly reduce poverty and make headway towards attainment of the Millennium
Development Goals, as reaffirmed in last year’s progress report of the authorities’ growth
and poverty reduction strategy which outlines the key policy measures that are envisaged to
achieve this objective. The authorities are also aware of the importance of carefully
managing public debt and further strengthening the country’s resilience to external shocks, as
advised by the staff. They are hopeful that substantial progress will continue to be made on
these fronts notably through continued adherence to prudent debt and fiscal policies and
implementation of the ambitious public investment program partly financed by SOTELMA
privatization proceeds.
Recent Economic and Program Performance
3.
As noted in the authorities’ letter of intent, the authorities have laid the foundations of
Mali’s strong economic performance in 2009 by sticking to the implementation of prudent
macroeconomic policies embedded in the ECF-supported program. Partly as a result, the
economy of Mali has continued to grow at a relatively high level amid the recent global
economic and financial crisis, overperforming that of many comparable countries. After
peaking in the last quarter of 2008, consumer price inflation has since been contained below
3 percent. Fiscal performance was satisfactory as noted by staff with the basic fiscal deficit
being held below the program target. The external current account balance improved
significantly, as gold export prices rose and external conditions became more favorable.
4.
Mali’s performance under the current ECF arrangement continues to be strong. As
was the case at the time of the third ECF review, performance on the quantitative front has
been irreproachable, with all performance criteria set for the test date set of the current
review being met. Economic management has thus continued to be sound during the period
covered by the review. In particular, net domestic financing and net tax revenues were
respectively below and above target; and external debt was managed prudently, with no
external payments arrears being accumulated and no external nonconcessional borrowing
contracted.
5.
As noted by staff, the structural reform program proceeded satisfactorily. All but one
structural benchmarks set for this fourth ECF review were observed, thus enabling the

82
authorities to make further inroads in the implementation of their reform agenda. More
specifically, the authorities finalized a strategy for the restructuring of the housing bank,
BHM, as well as a study on the macroeconomic impact of the gold sector. At the same time,
they worked jointly with monetary authorities to better grasp the net position of the
government vis-à-vis the banking system and to establish an appropriate framework for
recording transactions in the government’s financial accounts. Overall, this structural
performance thus translated into enhanced quality of public finance statistics, increased
resilience of the banking system, and better understanding the macroeconomic incidence of
the depletion of known gold reserves.
6.
However, the one missed benchmark relates to the planned establishment of a
monitoring system for the budgetary float which did not take place according to schedule, as
it hinges on the ongoing implementation of a new public accounting system. Meantime, the
authorities will continue to abide by the existing alternative system of monitoring the
budgetary float through the expenditure chain. It is also noteworthy that a sharp decline in the
budgetary float was registered in the first quarter of the current year in line with the
authorities’ program commitment although the float reduction did not meet program
expectations at the end of 2009 following higher spending and delays in the disbursement of
external assistance during the last quarter of that year.
7.
In view of the programmed use of SOTELMA privatization proceeds and the planned
reduction of pending bills in 2010, the revision of the quantitative criteria and benchmarks
initially set for June 2010 was warranted. In this regard, we would appreciate Board approval
of the authorities’ request for this modification.
Policy and Reform Agenda for the Rest of 2010
8.
Prudence will continue to guide the authorities in the conduct of fiscal policy. The
2010 supplementary budget law submitted to the Parliament embodies a prudent fiscal stance
with the underlying basic deficit—excluding expenditures financed by SOTELMA
privatization proceeds—being kept in the neighborhood of 1 percent of GDP. As we reported
at the time of the third ECF review, the authorities’ commitment to a transparent use of
SOTELMA privatization proceeds remains unwavering. These resources are deposited in a
Treasury account open at regional the central bank, thus facilitating the tracking of their use.
9.
The strong revenue performance that has been recently registered is also expected
going forward, as the authorities will adhere to continuous implementation of to revenueenhancing measures. In particular, the streamlining of the tax system is envisaged with the
aim at boosting revenue mobilization along with the broadening of the tax base,
rationalization of the tax legislation, and the review of existing tax exemptions. In support of
these efforts Fund technical assistance in the area of tax administration will remain critical.
10.
The authorities will persevere in their efforts to strengthen public debt management.
In this connection, while taking necessary steps to clear VAT credit arrears due to mining
companies, the authorities also intend to put in place a framework that enables timely
reimbursement of VAT credits and prevent recurrence of such arrears. Moreover, the recently
established debt management committee will play a crucial role in reviewing ex-ante the

83
government’s borrowing plans and ensuring timely access to regional financial markets. By
the same token, the authorities will continue to abide by their demonstrated commitment to
prudence in managing and contracting external debt.
11.
Strengthening public financial management (PFM) remains a cornerstone of the
authorities’ structural agenda. As the action plan for improving and modernizing PFM
(PAGAM/GFP) has been successfully implemented, work is underway to develop a new
PFM reform program that builds on progress already made and aims notably at further
improving budget preparation and execution. The planned introduction of a new public
accounting system at the Treasury will also play a key role in better monitoring budget
execution and reporting of government’s financial transactions.
12.
With regard to the financial sector, preliminary data show that financial soundness
indicators for Mali’s banking sector broadly improved in 2009, as reported in Table 11 of the
staff report. In particular, capital adequacy ratios and profitability of the banking sector
improved while nonperforming loans in percent of total loans declined. These positive
developments notwithstanding, financial sector reform will continue to proceed in line with
the authorities’ financial sector development strategy. In particular concrete actions are
envisaged in the coming months to advance the restructuring of BHM, including the selection
of a privatization advisor tasked with evaluating the impact of the measures that have already
been taken by the authorities as part of the bank’s restructuring plan.
13.
Reform of the cotton sector is another area in which the authorities are determined to
make further inroads. This reform remains overshadowed by the privatization process of the
cotton ginning company, CMDT. Mindful of its implications for the viability of the sector,
the authorities are taking prudent but decisive steps to that resolve, notably by developing a
strategic framework for the development of the cotton sector.
14.
Based on Mali’s satisfactory program implementation and the authorities’ determined
commitment to the program, we would appreciate Directors’ approval of the proposed
decision and completion of the current ECF review.
