Executive Summary
Background
Although average economic growth has been high over the last decade, inflation and output
have been volatile. In large part, this reflects the periodic episodes of major investment in the
energy and aluminum-smelting sectors. Following the completion of the late 90s investment
projects, output declined in 2002. However, new projects have subsequently rekindled rapid
growth and the economy is now exhibiting signs of overheating, with imbalances evident in
inflation, the current account, and external debt. Both monetary and fiscal policy have been
tightening, although to this point in the cycle, monetary policy has done the largest share.
Key policy issues
Outlook and Risks: Growth is forecast to be close to 6 percent in 2005, moderating slightly
and shifting toward net exports the following year. The current account deficit is expected to
peak at 12 percent of GDP in 2005, improving only slightly in 2006 given the rapidly
growing level of external debt. Inflation is anticipated to remain well above the 2½ percent
target over the next two years. Views differed regarding the risks to the outlook, with staff
and the central bank concerned that imbalances could widen more than forecast and then
unwind sharply with a rapid contraction in demand. The finance ministry, however, saw both
near- and medium-term risks contained by a substantial increase in the economy’s supply
capacity satisfying much of the expected growth, and rising household debt-servicing costs
preventing above-forecast demand growth.
Fiscal policy: Given the different assessments of the risks, staff saw a stronger case than did
the authorities for suggested measures to tighten the near-term fiscal stance. The authorities
were receptive to staff’s recommendations for strengthening the medium-term fiscal
framework by defining the multiyear spending targets in nominal levels and deriving them
from a rules-based system that would ensure a systematically countercyclical stance.
Monetary policy: The shared view was that monetary policy had responded appropriately to
rising inflation and that persistent inflationary pressures would likely lead to further increases
in interest rates. To more firmly anchor inflation expectations and thereby increase stability,
staff made two, well-received, suggestions: the introduction of a pre-announced schedule for
policy meetings that would conclude with a public statement regarding the bank’s decision
on interest rates; and publication of an interest rate path projected to return inflation to target.
Financial sector stability: Although stress tests and financial indicators suggested that the
financial sector was sound, the financial supervisor is working toward implementing even
more stringent stress tests as well as expanding their scope. There was agreement that the
Housing Financing Fund could be reformed to allow banks a share of the mortgage market,
which would increase financial stability, while retaining the benefits of the existing system.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Economic growth in Iceland has been impressive over the last decade. GDP grew
at an average rate of 3.8 percent between 1995 and 2004, second only to Ireland among
industrial countries. As a result, Iceland’s GDP per capita is now 84 percent of that in the
United States. This success arises from a combination of factors that unfolded throughout the
1990s: major investment projects in the energy and aluminum-smelting sectors that helped
diversify the economy and build export capacity; wide-ranging market liberalization and
privatizations; and fiscal consolidation. The structural reforms implemented throughout the
1990s, the floating of the currency and the adoption of inflation targeting in 2001, and
significant improvements in financial sector supervision introduced in the early 2000s have
also helped improve the economy’s resilience. This was illustrated by the relatively soft
landing achieved in 2002, as the large imbalances from the investment boom of the late
1990s were resolved.

While average growth has been
strong, macroeconomic volatility has
been pronounced. Both inflation and
output-growth variability in Iceland have
been notably higher than in other industrial
countries. The major investment projects
have contributed both to the high growth
rate and to overall macroeconomic volatility
because of their size relative to that of the
economy. In addition to their direct effect
on investment spending, the income and
employment effects stimulate consumption,

adding to upward pressure on the exchange rate and inflation. After the peak of the
investment cycle has been passed, the unwinding of the built-up imbalances results in sharp
adjustments in domestic demand, the demand for imports, the exchange rate, and inflation.
These features of the Icelandic economy pose significant challenges for macroeconomic
policy aiming for both growth and stability.1
3.
Following the recession in 2002, new investment projects have rekindled rapid
economic growth and imbalances have reemerged. After declining by 2.1 percent in 2002,
GDP grew by 4.2 percent in 2003 and a further 5.2 percent in 2004. The direct effect of the
investments and their indirect effect on consumer confidence generated total domestic
demand growth of close to 8 percent in both 2003 and 2004. The extensive use of foreign
labor in the construction phase of the projects helped to limit labor market pressures. In
addition, the slack in the goods market initially accommodated growth. However, the slack
was quickly exhausted, and imbalances have started to emerge in the current account,
external debt and—albeit to a more modest extent than in previous episodes—inflation
(Figure 1).
4.
After recovering to a small positive balance in 2002, large current account
deficits have reemerged. As the investment projects require significant imports of capital
goods, the reversal in the current account was to be expected. However, the additional
contribution of imported consumption goods has been stronger than anticipated. The current
account deficit is now forecast to peak at 12 percent of GDP in 2005, double that forecast at
the time of the last Article IV consultation. In part, the increase reflects an upward revision to
the size of the projects and the share occurring during the peak year. However, a significant
portion also reflects the buoyant response of households to their improved prospects.

This volatility also complicates economic projections as reflected in the large revisions and
errors in both the staff’s and the authorities’ forecasts.

interest rates from a 5-year moving average reduced y-o-y CPI inflation by roughly 0.5 percentage points.

5.
External liabilities have increased sharply, primarily reflecting banks’ use of
foreign borrowing to fund domestic credit expansion. Preliminary data show that the net
external debt-to-GDP ratio increased from 98 percent in 2003 to 122 percent in 2004. In
2004, banks’ lending to households grew by 98 percent and that to firms by 30 percent.
Although banks’ net external debt has risen sharply, limits are enforced on their open
currency positions. Consequently, banks intermediate a large volume of foreign currencydenominated lending. While a significant portion of this goes to firms with foreign currency
revenue streams, banks have also been increasingly extending foreign currency loans to
domestic firms (although not in significant amounts to households) without such a natural
hedge. The increase in banks’ external liabilities also reflects their expansion abroad,
principally to other Nordic countries and the United Kingdom. Encouragingly, banks’ credit
ratings have been improving over the last two years owing to their strengthening financial
position. Capital adequacy ratios have been increasing well above required minimums,
profitability has been high (in particular reflecting a stock market boom over the last year),
and default rates are low and declining (Figure 2).
6.
In August 2004, banks began to compete with the Housing Financing Fund
(HFF) for first mortgages, thereby accelerating the rate of expansion in household
credit. Prior to August 2004, the publicly guaranteed HFF dominated the first-mortgage
market, and banks primarily provided the second mortgages required by households because
of HFF lending limits. In the summer of 2004, banks saw an opportunity to enter the market
when the HFF started issuing noncallable housing bonds directly to the market and offering
mortgage loans at a fixed spread above the cost of finance. Given the increased transparency
and the magnitude of the spread, banks matched loan rates, plus offered larger mortgages,
higher loan-to-value limits, and the option to refinance existing mortgages, allowing equity
withdrawal. Consequently, banks were able to quickly capture a large share of the market and
HFF mortgages were prepaid in significant amounts. In response, the government accelerated
reforms at the HFF to raise loan limits.
7.
Inflation exceeded the upper bound of the central bank’s target range in early
2005, but has since moderated. In February, with year-over-year CPI inflation at
4.5 percent, the central bank was obliged to submit a report to the government outlining why
inflation had breached the 4 percent upper bound and the prospects for returning it to target
(Figure 3). Domestic demand pressures, most notably in the housing market, were cited as
the main factor underlying high inflation. In May, Statistics Iceland changed the
methodology for calculating the user cost of housing in the CPI. The new methodology uses
a 12-month moving average of real mortgage rates rather than the previous five-year moving
average. With real mortgage rates declining between August and November 2004, this
change, along with developments in food prices, resulted in year-on-year CPI inflation of
2.9 percent in May, considerably below the 4.3 percent reported in April.2 However,
2

The change in the CPI methodology reduced year-over-year inflation by 0.5 percentage
points in May.

The central bank has responded decisively to accelerating inflation. Since May
2004, the policy rate has risen from 5.3 percent to 9.5 percent. However, because of the
acceleration in inflation, the real policy rate

shifted from a deficit of 1 percent of GDP in 2003 to an estimated surplus of 0.4 percent in
2004. General government nominal expenditure growth exceeded that budgeted by
4 percentage points in the last year, with the largest slippages occurring at the local level.
However, these slippages were more than offset by faster-than-budgeted revenue growth. For
2005, the budget contains additional restraint, with the most recent ministry forecast
estimating a surplus of 0.9 percent of GDP, virtually the same as the staff’s. Based on the
multiyear spending targets, no significant further tightening will occur in 2006. A permanent
reduction of 1 percentage point in labor income taxes took effect in January 2005, and
additional reductions have been announced for 2006 and 2007. Permanent tax reductions can
be introduced because of the extended period of prudent fiscal management, as illustrated by
the low and declining ratio of general government debt to GDP, which stood at 23 percent at
end–2004.

Box 1. Implementation of Past Fund Policy Advice
The authorities have generally followed policies consistent with Fund advice, most particularly in
the structural and institutional areas (market liberalization, privatization, monetary policy
framework, and financial sector reform). In particular, the 2001 Financial Sector Assessment
Program (FSAP) served as the basis for strengthening the legal framework for the financial
supervisory system and establishing standards for risk control and risk management for the
payments system. On fiscal policy, introducing multi-year spending targets into the budget was
consistent with Fund advice on strengthening the medium-term framework. However, there has at
times been less agreement with the advice on the appropriate cyclical fiscal stance.
Regarding the effectiveness of Fund surveillance, the authorities noted that the enhanced
transparency of the IMF and the publication of the concluding statements were welcome
developments. At the same time, a slower turnover in mission team members would ease resource
costs of consultations.

II. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
10.
With large imbalances emerging and likely to grow, discussions centered on
ensuring that appropriate policies were in place to help contain the imbalances and
their associated risks, and limit their reemergence beyond the current cycle. There was
agreement that the flexibility arising from wide-ranging structural reforms, a profitable and
well-capitalized financial sector, and sound public finances were likely to have increased the
economy’s resilience, as testified by the relatively smooth unwinding of imbalances in 2002.
Nonetheless, staff stressed that enhancing macroeconomic stability should be a central policy
objective and accordingly focused the discussions on the following:
•

achieving a tighter fiscal stance than currently envisaged over the remainder of the cycle;

•

ensuring that the rapid expansion in external liabilities and domestic credit does not
intensify vulnerabilities that will amplify the downturn once investment slows; and

•

modifying the inflation-targeting and the medium-term fiscal frameworks to help limit
the extent to which imbalances develop when large shocks hit the economy.4
A. The Outlook and Risks

11.
There was broad agreement that growth will be robust and imbalances will
persist throughout 2005–06. Staff and the authorities forecast GDP to grow by roughly
6 percent in 2005, driven by domestic demand. Project-related investment will peak in 2005,
with the associated confidence and income effects on consumption amplified by the easing in
mortgage credit conditions and cuts in labor income taxes. The current account deficit is
forecast to be 12 percent of GDP in 2005. In 2006, growth is expected to ease, in part
reflecting an anticipated further tightening in monetary policy. Higher interest rates and
rapidly rising household debt levels are expected to moderate consumption growth and
investment is forecast to decline from its

Although some longer-term structural and trade issues are important for Iceland, they
received less focus in this consultation because the current cyclical volatility and imbalance
issues were jointly deemed to be more important.

higher-value-added products and markets. Little improvement is expected in the current
account deficit in 2006, as the narrowing of the trade deficit will be partially offset by a
deterioration in the income account, owing to the rapidly growing stock of foreign debt and
the expected gradual rise of foreign interest rates.
12.
The authorities and staff both project inflation to remain well above the central
bank’s target through 2005–06. Both the central bank and the staff forecast that strong
growth will overheat the domestic economy and generate above-target inflation. The finance
ministry, however, sees only modest excess demand pressures and attibutes inflationary
pressure mainly to an expected gradual króna depreciation. This difference arises because the
ministry forecasts a rapid increase in aggregate supply from a strong labor supply response to
the tax cuts and the immediate addition of investment flows to the effective capital stock.
Staff expect the labor supply response to be more modest because Iceland’s labor force
participation rate of 81 percent is high by all standards; furthermore, for the group aged 16 to
24, which has a relatively low participation rate, the tax cuts increase the incentives to
acquire more education. Furthermore, it seems prudent to add investment flows to the capital
stock only after the associated plant and equipment become fully productive.

13.
Beyond 2006, the shared outlook is for growth to slow to close to its potential
rate, with staff, however, pointing to appreciable risks of a less benign outcome.
Although private consumption is expected to continue to be supported by strong income
growth, investment will return to a normal level with the completion of the projects. More of
the increased aluminum capacity will then be productive, and the reequilibration of the
exchange rate is expected to stimulate exports and dampen imports. Consequently, the
current account deficit is forecast to narrow sharply in 2007 and then exhibit a gradual
improving trend beyond. The slowing in aggregate demand is forecast to result in modest
excess supply, which, in combination with a slowing in house price appreciation due to the
response of housing supply, will bring inflation back to target. This baseline view assumes
that the increased flexibility in the Icelandic economy, not least of all in the exchange rate,
will allow the built-up imbalances to be resolved in an orderly fashion. Staff, however, saw
considerable risk of a less benign outcome, whose preemption provided the motivation for its
policy advice.

- 14 -

14.
While there was broad agreement on the central scenarios, there was a different
appreciation of the balance of risks. In the near term, staff viewed the risks to be on the
upside, in terms of persistent overheating pressures, with—in contrast—considerable
downside risk of slower growth later on. Staff argued that, given the easing in credit
conditions, households could respond more than forecast to their improved income and
wealth positions, thereby widening the imbalances—a concern shared by the central bank. In
addition, staff stressed that relying primarily on monetary policy to contain demand
pressures, as the currently expected policy mix does, risks further exchange rate appreciation
and a greater-than-forecast widening of the external imbalances. Staff observed that once the
investment projects have been completed, the extent of the downside risk would be related to
the magnitude of the built-up imbalances. A sharp correction in the currency, possibly
sparked by the scale of the imbalances or disorderly conditions in international capital
markets, could then produce a much larger retrenchment than expected in domestic demand,
particularly in light of the high and rapidly growing level of foreign indebtedness. The
finance ministry contended that the increase in debt-servicing costs from the growing
household debt burden would provide a natural brake on consumption, limiting risks in both
the near and long term.
B. Fiscal Policy
15.
Although the fiscal stance has tightened as growth has accelerated, no additional

was that the fiscal stance did not need to be as
tight because the structural change in the economy since the previous boom had increased its
resilience. In addition, the authorities noted that the 2005 fiscal surplus would likely be larger
than the most recent projection because tax receipts were running above forecast. Given that
the main surprises were in value-added tax receipts and stamp duties on housing transaction,
staff suggested that this could point to greater-than-projected demand pressures.
16.
Views differed on whether the labor supply response to the tax cuts would
prevent them from adding to the overheating. The staff advised that the tax cuts planned
for 2006 and beyond be postponed until it was clear that excess demand conditions had
dissipated fully. Staff reasoned that the tax cuts would contribute to overheating, particularly
in light of the increased availability of low-cost finance (Box 2). The authorities expected
that a strong labor supply response to the tax cuts, estimated at 800 people a year through

- 15 -

2005–07, would satisfy the additional demand. Staff expected, however, that the labor supply
response would be more modest.5

A permanent reduction in labor income taxes is simulated in MULTIMOD under two assumptions
about the proportion of liquidity-constrained households (solid line 40 percent and dotted line 10
percent).1 The path for the tax cut replicates that announced for Iceland starting in 2005 (1 percentage
point in 2005,1 percentage point in 2006, and 2 percentage points in 2007). Government spending is
permanently reduced to sustain the tax cut. These simulations illustrate how the tax cut may
contribute to the projected short-term overheating in the economy, and how the developments in the
mortgage market in Iceland, which have reduced the proportion of liquidity-constrained households,
may amplify these effects.

Iceland”.

17.
There was more agreement on the scope for reducing government expenditures,
particularly public investment. The authorities noted that public investment projects
scheduled for 2005–06 could be postponed without impeding the economy’s supply capacity.
Because the multiyear spending targets for public consumption are formulated in real terms
and then converted to nominal terms using the CPI forecast, nominal public consumption is
5

In addition, staff analysis presented in the selected issues chapters suggests that, even if the
labor supply responds as the authorities expect, it will not prevent overheating. In the staff’s
MULTIMOD-based simulations, the increased production capacity would be quickly
absorbed because those entering the labor force would demand consumption goods and firms
would increase investment demand in response to the additional labor supply growth.

- 16 -

projected to grow at above 7 percent in 2005–06. Staff argued that more modest increases
would be both possible and advisable, pointing to the introduction or expansion of user fees
in health care and education as a possible option. In addition, staff noted that the risk of
stronger-than-expected municipal spending in the run-up to the local elections in early 2006
strengthened this case. Without agreeing on the specific measures, the authorities concurred
that reducing the growth in public consumption could be considered, especially if economic
indicators suggested more overheating than currently forecast.
18.
The authorities were receptive to staff recommendations for strengthening the
medium-term fiscal framework. Although the debt sustainability analysis presented in
Appendix II indicates that fiscal policy is on a sound footing from a medium-term
perspective, staff saw a stronger role for fiscal policy in supporting monetary policy and
helping to reduce overall macroeconomic volatility. It recommended that the multiyear
pending targets be specified in nominal—rather than real—terms at the general government
level and that central and local governments cooperate more closely to ensure that slippages
do not occur. Nominal spending targets, it noted, were more transparent, enforceable, and
consistent with the inflation-targeting framework. The authorities agreed that closer
cooperation between levels of governments would be beneficial, but noted that local
governments highly valued their independence and would resist spending constraints
imposed by the central government. They noted that although nominal spending targets had
several positive features, the indexing culture was strong in Iceland because of the experience
of high inflation in the 1970s and in the 1980s and that such a change would need to be
implemented gradually. Staff also called for the introduction of a rules-based system to
derive the multiyear spending targets to ensure the simultaneous achievement of the
government’s medium-term debt target and a consistently countercyclical fiscal stance.6 The
authorities saw merit in introducing such a system to guide the medium-term fiscal
framework.
19.
The authorities noted that the privatization of Iceland Telecom was proceeding
as planned. They indicated that they had strived to ensure an open and transparent process.
Proceeds from the sale, a significant portion of which the authorities anticipate will go to
debt reduction, are expected to be higher than the ISK 35–40 million sought in 2001. Staff
encouraged the authorities to use the entire proceeds for debt reduction.
C. Monetary Policy
20.
The shared view was that the pace of monetary tightening over the last year has
been appropriate. Although overheating in the housing market has been one of the main
reasons for above-target headline inflation, the decisive monetary policy response was
6

Such a rules-based approach could be broadly patterned after that used in the United
Kingdom which includes both a target for the deficit over the cycle as well as a target for net
government debt. The approach would need to be customized for Iceland to achieved the
desired magnitude of the countercyclical stance.

- 17 -

appropriate for several reasons. First, the central bank’s mandate specifies the inflation
objective in terms of headline CPI including housing. Second, because headline CPI is used
to index mortgages, house price inflation has important long-term implications for household
welfare. Third, excess demand conditions in the housing market are often a leading indicator
of general demand conditions, and forward-looking monetary authorities need to respond to
such indicators.
21.
There was agreement that, although temporary factors had recently lowered
CPI inflation, persistent inflationary pressures were still strong and further increases in
the policy rate were likely. Three key factors that had temporarily lowered CPI inflation
were pointed out: revisions to the methodology for computing the user cost of housing (see
para 7);7 a price war among discount food stores; and the pass-through of the exchange rate
appreciation. The revision to the CPI methodology—given base effects—is not expected to
have a downward impact on inflation beyond November 2005. While the food price
competition effect was expected to be short-lived, the exchange rate pass-through could
continue for the remainder of the year. However, the central bank expected that despite these
temporary factors, excess demand conditions would continue to exert upward pressure on
inflation.
22.
The developments in the mortgage market were seen by all to be forcing the
central bank to rely more heavily on the exchange rate channel for monetary
transmission. The monetary authorities emphasized that even though long-term mortgage
rates had been falling and credit availability increasing while the policy rate was rising,
monetary policy was not impotent. At the same time, they recognized the increase in
downside risk further out, inherent in relying heavily on the exchange rate channel,
especially in the absence of a tighter fiscal stance.
23.
Staff suggestions for improving the monetary policy framework were well
received. The authorities noted that inflation expectations continue to be based heavily on
actual outcomes. Staff suggested two changes that could help anchor inflation expectations.
First, in addition to the current practices associated with the publication of the quarterly
Monetary Bulletin, a preannounced schedule for the intervening monetary policy meetings
could be introduced. These meetings would also conclude with a public statement of the
central bank’s decision regarding interest rates. This would increase the public profile of
monetary policy, enhance transparency, and help formalize the communications and
decision-making process within the central bank. Second, the Monetary Bulletin could
include a scenario based on an interest rate path that the central bank viewed as necessary to
return inflation to target. In response, the central bank noted that they did conduct regularly
scheduled monetary policy meetings; however they agreed that the staff recommendations
could prove helpful.
7

Regarding the revisions to the CPI, the central bank noted that with shorter moving average
of interest rates in use, changes in monetary policy could have a perverse impact on CPI
inflation in the short term.

- 18 -

24.
The authorities and staff concurred that controlling inflation was more difficult
in Iceland than in many other inflation-targeting countries and discussed possible
measures to address this. Empirical analysis presented by staff suggested that inflation was
more likely to be outside the Icelandic central bank’s tolerance band than for a larger
inflation-targeting country like Canada (Box 3). The staff discussed with the authorities the
relative costs to credibility of being outside the band versus operating within a wider band.
The authorities felt that the recent episode of inflation outside the band had not been costly to
credibility and were reluctant to risk the potential cost of widening the range, especially
given the relative newness of the framework. Staff suggested that targeting a price index that
removed some volatile components—such as food and energy prices, as has been done in
other countries—could help address the issue. The authorities agreed, but noted that it would
be important to wait until headline inflation had been firmly reanchored to the target before
changing the targeted index.

The efficient policy frontiers for Iceland, the United States and Canada suggest that the inflationoutput variability tradeoff faced by the monetary authorities in Iceland is considerably less
favorable than that faced by either Canadian or U.S. authorities. This reflects the small size of the
Icelandic economy relative to the magnitude of the economic shocks to which it is subjected.
The frontiers are constructed by using estimated macroeconomic models of these countries to
examine simple efficient monetary policy rules for Iceland.1

D. Competitiveness
25.
Even allowing for the uncertainty about its equilibrium level, there was broad
agreement that the real effective exchange rate was modestly overvalued. Expectations
were that the overvaluation, which long-term averages suggest is in the 10 to 15 percent
range, would gradually dissipate as investment and interest rates returned to more normal
levels. The authorities noted that, although the level of the exchange rate was squeezing

- 19 -

profits in some sectors, most export-oriented companies were becoming adept at adjusting to
exchange rate fluctuations. For example, the fisheries have been very effective at adopting
processing techniques that increase value added and allow them to direct their output toward
markets where prices were high. There have been some fish-processing plant closures, but
the authorities saw this as a required rationalization that was being accelerated by the current
exchange rate level. Furthermore, these closures were not raising employment concerns as
there will be job opportunities in some of the affected areas at the new aluminum facilities.
Regarding economywide competitiveness, discussions with labor and employer federations
suggested that the parties to the private sector wage agreements will act responsibly, as they
have in the past, when deciding whether the current multiyear wage agreements should be
reviewed in November 2005.
E. Financial Sector
26.
Financial Supervisory Authority (FME) officials observed that stress tests and
other indicators suggested that the financial sector was sound, despite the rapid pace of
credit expansion. In aggregate and by institution, the major banks would continue to meet
minimum capital adequacy standards if bond and equity prices were to fall sharply and
defaults increased substantially. Given the recent large increase in equity and house prices,
FME officials also noted that they would be implementing more stringent tests in these areas.
Staff asked about progress on the ongoing work related to exchange rate and interest rate
stress tests, which are becoming increasingly important because of the rapidly growing
levels of external, household, and firm debt, a large portion of which is foreign-currency
denominated (Box 4, Figure 4). Regarding exchange rate stress tests, FME officials noted
Box 4. Iceland’s Corporate Leverage
Icelandic firms’ debt has risen sharply since the mid-1990s, reaching more than 160 percent of GDP in
2004. Since high leverage can contribute significantly to corporate distress in the presence of
macroeconomic shocks, it is important to verify whether these rates are Iceland-specific and identify
driving forces. Using a unique data set on corporates, the staff finds that, irrespective of the measure of
leverage used, Icelandic firms are more leveraged than in other Nordic countries, both throughout the
sample (1995-2003) and across industries.1 Further analysis shows that there may be fundamental reasons
for this finding. Specifically, the tax regime, which until recently has been more beneficial to debt than to
equity issuance, and the industrywide degree of internationalization, as measured by the ratio of exports to
production, seem to have a particularly strong impact on leverage in Iceland.

that, in cooperation with the central bank, they had compiled a preliminary data set that
would allow them to examine the vulnerabilities presented by banks’ indirect exchange rate
exposure. Work on interest rate stress tests was still in a preliminary phase. FME officials
expressed some concern about recent developments at the HFF, which they now supervised.
With the HFF relying extensively on noncallable bonds for funding and prepayments running
high as a result of banks’ entry into the mortgage market, the HFF is lending excess funds to
banks. This is not a legislated core activity for the HFF, and its capital adequacy
requirements do not reflect the risk of such activities. FME officials stressed the need for the
government to quickly address this issue.
27.
It was agreed that the entry of banks into the mortgage market was a positive
development, and that the HFF should be reformed to ensure that this presence could
be sustained. To diversify their assets and increase the stability of earnings, domestic banks
need to increase their share of the mortgage market. Starting in August 2004, banks have
begun to do so, competing directly with the HFF for first mortgages (Box 5). However, as the
HFF enjoys a public guarantee, it is not clear whether banks will be able to sustain this
Box 5. Mortgage Market Developments in Iceland1
In 2004, the publicly-guaranteed Housing Financing Fund (HFF) reformed its mortgage financing and
increased its lending limits, in part in response to the entry of commercial banks into the mortgage market.
As a result, mortgage lending increased sharply and real mortgage rates declined substantially. New
possibilities to refinance and withdraw equity have contributed to the demand pressures in the economy,
with spill-over effects on the housing market, residential construction, and household debt.

Few countries provide public support through the mortgage system to the extent that is done in Iceland
today, with interest rate subsidies for single-family housing generally focused on social needs. The recent
developments in the Icelandic mortgage market might constitute a golden opportunity for reform of the
HFF, aimed at maintaining the benefits of the current system while also allowing for banks to remain
profitably in the mortgage market.

Financing Fund.”

- 22 activity on a profitable basis without taking on excessive risk on the funding side. Given the
country’s level of wealth and high rate of homeownership, staff questioned the need for a
publicly backed retail mortgage finance institution such as the HFF. The authorities noted
that, in addition to ensuring access to homeownership regardless of income or region of
residence, the HFF served two other important functions. First, because Iceland is so small,
having a single entity securing the funding allows for economies of scale that help ensure
low-cost mortgage finance. Second, having a single institution issuing housing bonds has
increased those bonds’ international profile, ensuring a liquid market for domestic-currencyenominated bonds. Staff suggested, and the authorities agreed, that the HFF could be
reformed in such a way that banks could profitably remain in the mortgage market, thereby
increasing financial stability, while still retaining the positive features of the current system.
F. Other Issues
28.
Statistics Iceland officials and staff discussed the motivation for the change in
the CPI methodology introduced in May. Officials indicated that moving to a shorter
moving average of interest rates was more consistent with the objective of capturing the spot
user cost of housing. Initially, the longer moving average was used to avoid the possibility
that interest rate volatility would induce excess volatility in the CPI. However, real mortgage
rates have turned out to be less variable than expected, and the decision was made to shorten
the averaging period. While agreeing with the theoretical motivation for the change, staff
raised concerns about the timing and the lack of preannouncement. Officials agreed that these
were important considerations and in the future such changes would be announced well in
advance. Furthermore, they saw the merit of keeping such methodological changes to a
minimum.
29.
Official development assistance (ODA) is targeted to increase from an expected
0.21 percent of GNP as of end-2005 to 0.35 percent in 2009. The authorities noted that
one of the greatest challenges with ODA was ensuring that it effectively alleviated poverty.
To that end, they have increasingly been focusing on specific projects, and because it has
worked well, plan to continue with this approach.
30.
A successful conclusion to the Doha round would be welcomed by the
authorities. It was noted that this would likely imply a reduction in agricultural subsidies
and trade protection. Although agricultural subsidies were politically important in Iceland,
the authorities expressed confidence that adjustment could be accommodated.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
The authorities have consistently implemented policies that have supported
strong economic growth, but the challenge now is to increase macroeconomic stability.
In particular, at the current point in the economic cycle, appropriate policy measures need to
be put in place so that the unwinding of the imbalances in the current account, external debt,
domestic demand and inflation following the completion of the current investment projects
do not generate excessive volatility in real activity.

- 23 32.
Although fiscal policy has been tightened, a more restrictive stance than that
contained in the 2005 budget is required. While the increased flexibility of the economy
—not least of which is the flexible exchange rate regime introduced in 2001—has enhanced
its ability to quickly adjust, prudence is called for to avoid the potentially large negative
impact of a disorderly unwinding of the imbalances. Since the drafting of the 2005 budget,
the outlook for aggregate demand has been revised upward considerably and projected
imbalances have widened. Consequently, fiscal policy should be tightened appropriately.
33.
The required fiscal tightening will need to rely on both expenditure and tax
measures. On the expenditure side, additional public investment projects, including some of
those planned for the remainder of 2005, should be delayed until after the energy-intensive
investment cycle peaks. On the tax side, although reducing income taxes stands to have
longer-term benefits for labor supply, the impact is likely to unfold gradually and be modest,
given Iceland’s already commendably high labor market participation rate. It would,
therefore, be prudent to postpone the tax cuts announced for 2006 and beyond until it is clear
that excess demand in the economy has dissipated. If the tax cuts cannot be delayed,
offsetting cuts in government expenditure, beyond those currently planned, should be
identified and implemented. This may also be an opportune time to introduce or extend the
application of user fees in health care and education. Additionally, proceeds from the
privatization of Iceland Telecom should be fully used for debt reduction.
34.
Although public finances are on a sound footing from a medium-term
perspective, the medium-term fiscal framework could usefully be strengthened. The
introduction of multiyear spending targets was a step in the right direction, but more can be
done. Defining these targets in nominal terms at the general government level would be
beneficial and the central and local governments should cooperate more to prevent slippages.
Furthermore, the multiyear spending targets should be derived from a rules-based approach
that ensures the simultaneous achievement of the government’s medium-term target for
public debt and a consistently countercyclical fiscal stance. This would enhance the prospects
for achieving both strong and stable growth.
35.
Monetary policy has been responding appropriately to emerging demand and
inflationary pressures. Rising house prices have contributed significantly to inflation.
However, they are indicative of the general overheating of the economy, and the policy
response has hence been appropriate. While temporary factors have recently lowered
measured CPI inflation, monetary policy should continue to focus on the underlying demand
conditions that are the primary source of persistent inflation. The developments in the
mortgage market, which have lowered the cost of long-term financing to households, have
increased the challenge of stabilizing inflation. The central bank will need to be prepared to
respond to changing economic circumstances, while recognizing that having to rely heavily
on the exchange rate channel for the transmission of monetary policy, given the current
overvaluation, will add further to external imbalances and the sharpness of the eventual
unwinding.
36.
Because of the size of the economy, stabilizing inflation in Iceland is a more
difficult task than in larger inflation-targeting countries and measures to help address
this should be implemented. Introducing a schedule for preannounced monetary policy

- 24 meetings that conclude with a public announcement of the central bank’s decision regarding
interest rates could help enhance inflation stability by more firmly anchoring inflation
expectations. The inclusion in the Monetary Bulletin of a scenario based on an interest rate
path that would return inflation to its target could also be helpful in this regard.
37.
Once the current investment cycle has been completed, further enhancements
to the monetary policy framework could increase the stability in both inflation and real
economic activity. Although the indexation of mortgage loans in Iceland, among other
reasons, makes it important to continue to target a measure of inflation that includes house
prices, removing volatile components—such as energy or food, as has been done in other
countries—could be considered.
38.
The risks to financial stability of the ongoing credit boom should be monitored
closely and prudential measures implemented quickly if required. Financial institutions
have strong balance sheets. Given that asset prices are continuing to accelerate sharply, the
development of more stringent stress tests is welcome and staff looks forward to the FME’s
prompt implementation. Furthermore, in light of the rapidly growing debt levels, a large
portion of which is foreign-currency denominated corporate debt, the FME should accelerate
the pace of developing and implementing interest rate and exchange rate stress tests. The
importance of this is further highlighted by the sensistivity of the external debt positon to
exchange rate movements, as illustrated in the external debt sustainability analysis.
39.
The entry of commercial banks into the mortgage market has been a positive
development from a financial stability perspective, but reform of the HFF will be
necessary to ensure that the banks’ presence can be sustained. If banks must compete
directly with the HFF, which enjoys a funding advantage because of its state guarantee, it is
not clear whether they can profitably sustain their mortgage-market lending. Consequently,
expeditious reform of the HFF is necessary. The reform should be guided by broad principles
that will retain the positive aspects of the current system, while allowing it to evolve in a
manner that will strengthen the stability of the financial system.
40.
To provide the opportunity for an early assessment of developments in current
demand pressures and related imbalances, it is proposed to move the next Article IV
consultation temporarily to the standard 12-month cycle.8

Iceland was shifted from a 24- to a 12-month cycle also during the 2001–03 boom episode.
In August 2003, in light of the positive assessment of the FSAP update and encouraging
macroeconomic performance, Iceland was returned to a 24-month cycle.

1998-1999. Kauphting Inc. included from year 1996. Figures for Islandsbanki include both the banking and insurance part of the corporation.
2/ Inflation adjusted accounting principles were discontinued in year 2002. Results for year 2002 and onwards are therefore in nominal terms but were in real terms before year 2002.
3/ Deposit money banks, adjusted for FBA and Commercial Loan Fund. Kaupthing bank Inc. included from year 2002 and Glitnir included from May 2003.
Figures from year 2003 onwards for sectoral breakdown of lendings is not comparable with the past because of new loan classification.
4/ Item “miscellaneous” also includes individuals’ private business operations. Changed with new loan classification in year 2003. See note above.
5/ Loans for which special provisions have been posted less specific provisions, and other loans which have been interest frozen. Appropriated assets not included.
6/ New loan classification results in a break for this series in the year 2003.

APPENDIX II

ICELAND: SUSTAINABILITY EXERCISE
Public Debt Sustainability
The staff’s baseline scenario predicts a decline in the gross public debt-to-GDP ratio from
37 percent in 2004 to 27 percent in 2010, suggesting that risks to medium-term debt
sustainability are limited (Table A1). When the historical average values of real GDP
growth, the real interest rate, and primary balance are used throughout the projection period
(scenario A1), the gross debt ratio falls to only 15 percent by 2010. Keeping the primary
balance unchanged over the projection period (A2) lowers the debt ratio almost as much, to
16 percent by 2010. The most significant “bound test” is the shock to real GDP growth in
2005 and 2006 (B2), which increases the gross debt ratio to 57 percent by 2010. A 10 percent
of GDP increase in other debt-creating inflows in 2005 (B6) raises the debt ratio to 38
percent by 2010 while a one time real depreciation of 30 percent in 2005 (B5) raises it to 35
percent. Meanwhile, shocks to the real interest rate (B1) and to the primary balance (B3)
have little impact on debt dynamics compared with the baseline scenario.
External Debt Sustainability
Significant current account deficit, driven by the investment projects, coupled with expansion
of Icelandic firms and commercial banks abroad, resulted in a sharp increase of the external
debt (from 159 percent of GDP in 2003 to 220 percent in 2004). However, in net terms the
level of external dent has risen only by 24 percent reaching 122 percent of GDP in 2004. As
Table A2 indicates, in the baseline scenario external debt is projected to decrease and
stabilize around 200 percent of GDP. The alternative scenarios and bound tests indicate that
while Iceland is resilient to a variety of shocks, movements in exchange rate could drive the
gross external debt to above 300 percent of GDP.

1/ Gross general government debt.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
8/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
9/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).
10/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

APPENDIX III

ICELAND—STATISTICAL ISSUES
Iceland’s economic database is comprehensive and sufficient for effective surveillance.
Iceland has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). A Statistics
Department (STA) mission conducted the data module of the Report on the Observance of
Standards and Codes (ROSC) during February 1–15, 2005.
Data on a wide range of economic and financial variables are provided to the Fund in a
timely manner during and between consultations. In addition to periodic press releases,
statistical information is disseminated to the public through a range of monthly, quarterly and
annual publications by three main institutions (The Central Bank of Iceland (CBI), the
Ministry of Finance, and Statistics Iceland), and is increasingly available on their internet
sites. Provision of electronic data in English has improved substantially in the last year,
especially from Statistics Iceland.
Iceland is in observance of the SDDS since June 30, 2004, meeting the specifications for
coverage, periodicity, and timeliness, but uses a flexibility option on the timeliness and
periodicity for the production index and the producer price index (PPI). Iceland generally
meets the requirements regarding advance release calendars. However, there are some delays
in the dissemination of data on central government operations and central government debt,
and the advance release dates posted for these data categories are tentative dates. Also,
summary methodology statements in a number of data categories are neither provided nor
posted on the Dissemination Standard Bulletin Board of the IMF.
As regards the national accounts data, the authorities shifted to ESA95 in August 2000 and
revised the corresponding time series back to 1990. Another revision was carried out in 2002
going back only to 1997.
While the authorities publish Treasury returns on a monthly basis, only annual data on the
general government balance are currently available. Iceland reports government finance data
in accordance with the GFSM 2001 framework in the GFS Yearbook and is an up-to-date
contributor to the International Financial Statistics (IFS).
Iceland’s balance of payments data deviate from the IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual,
fifth edition (BMP5) in certain respects. In particular, the CBI follows the methodology
applied by the European Central Bank (ECB) for the calculation of income payable by
collective investment institutions (e.g., mutual funds). Unlike the BMP5, the ECB’s
methodology includes portfolio investors’ shares of retained earnings in the balance of
payments statement.
Some other departures from BPM5 are: a) income on external debt and foreign direct
investments is compiled on a due-for-payment basis, including that between affiliated
enterprises; b) debt between affiliated banks is not identified; c) banking sector loans are not
classified separately from currency, and deposits; d) foreign direct investments are valued at
book value; e) external debt is valued at face value; f) financial derivatives held by banks are

- 37 -

APPENDIX III

not available as on-balance sheet item; g) domestic currency deposits held with banks by
nonbank nonresidents are not recorded as part of external debt.
It should be noted that balance of payments statistics focus mainly on traditional sectors
while certain other sectors are becoming more important (e.g., statistics of international trade
in services).
Monetary Statistics
The concepts and definitions broadly conform to the guidelines of the Monetary and
Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). Departing from the MFSM, monetary aggregates
include deposits of the foreign sector and the central government; and the currency-linked
and indexed bonds held by nonresidents are classified as domestic instead of foreign
liabilities. Classification and sectorization are mostly in line with the MFSM, except that, in
the accounts of other depository corporations (that is, commercial and savings banks),
financial derivatives are off balance sheet and positions of nonfinancial public corporations
are indistinguishably included as part of government; and, in the accounts of the CBI, fixed
assets are off balance sheet and IMF accounts are included under other items net instead of as
foreign liabilities. The basis for recording follows the MFSM, except that several banks
report loans net of provisions and securities for investment are not at market value.

Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by Staff Representatives for the 2005 Consultation with Iceland
Approved by Alessandro Leipold and Martin Fetherston
September 26, 2005
1.
This supplement provides an update to the staff’s medium-term outlook for Iceland
based on revisions to historical National Accounts data and outturns since the staff report
was finalized. The new information does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal, though
the stronger momentum of growth heightens the risks and strengthens the case for a more
restrictive fiscal stance.1
2.
In mid-September, Statistics Iceland released revisions to quarterly National
Accounts data extending back to 1997 that reflect the application of chain linking. The
revisions suggest that the trough of the 2001–02 downturn was milder, with the pace of the
subsequent recovery being slower in 2003,
Iceland: Growth profile and Revisions
but faster in 2004 (annual growth in 2004
9.0
was revised up by 1 percentage point).
6.0
Reported year-over-year GDP growth for
the second quarter of 2005, at 6.8 percent,
3.0
is slightly faster than was expected. Taken

together, the revisions to GDP and its
second quarter growth rate suggest that

was finalized. Additional support for this
view is evident in September’s year-over-year CPI inflation rate of 4.8 percent, above both
expectations and the 4 percent upper limit of the central bank’s tolerance range.
3.
Given the greater momentum in the economy, the staff outlook for growth and
inflation in 2005 has been revised upward and the current account deficit is now forecast to

the latest available data and the new projections.

-2-

be 13 percent of GDP. For 2006, however, staff expects a more pronounced slowing in
growth because monetary policy is likely to tighten more than previously expected with
inflation now outside the tolerance range. In fact, markets are expecting the policy rate to
increase by 50 basis points, to 10 percent, when the quarterly Monetary Bulletin is released
on September 29, with most analysts looking for additional tightening to follow. Based on
the outlook for faster growth in nominal private consumption and wages, higher than
previously expected revenues will lead to slightly larger fiscal surpluses in 2005 and 2006.
However, on a structural basis, the fiscal balance is now forecast to be in deficit over these
two years as opposed to the very small surpluses forecast previously.
4.
The updated outlook, with a larger current account deficit, higher short-term nominal
interest rates and, consequently, the potential for more appreciation of the currency in the
near-term, implies that the risk of a sharp slowing in activity further out may now be higher.

1998-1999. Kauphting Inc. included from year 1996. Figures for Islandsbanki include both the banking and insurance part of the corporation.
2/ Inflation adjusted accounting principles were discontinued in year 2002. Results for year 2002 and onwards are therefore in nominal terms but were in real terms before year 2002.
3/ Deposit money banks, adjusted for FBA and Commercial Loan Fund. Kaupthing bank Inc. included from year 2002 and Glitnir included from May 2003.
Figures from year 2003 onwards for sectoral breakdown of lendings is not comparable with the past because of new loan classification.
4/ Item “miscellaneous” also includes individuals’ private business operations. Changed with new loan classification in year 2003. See note above.
5/ Loans for which special provisions have been posted less specific provisions, and other loans which have been interest frozen. Appropriated assets not included.
6/ New loan classification results in a break for this series in the year 2003.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
October 14, 2005

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with
Iceland
On October 3, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Iceland.1
Background
An extended period of structural reforms, privatizations, and fiscal consolidation as well as
large investment projects in the aluminum-smelting sector have resulted in high average
GDP growth in Iceland over the last decade. At the same time, in large part because of the
magnitude of investment projects relative to the size of the economy, the volatility in output
growth and inflation has been notably above that in other industrial countries.
Following a recession in 2002, growth has been accelerating, fueled by new investment
projects in the energy and aluminum-smelting sector. With GDP growth of 3.6 percent in
2003 followed by growth of 6.2 percent in 2004, the available slack in the economy was
quickly absorbed. Consequently, inflation recently breached the 4 percent upper bound of
the tolerance range, prompting a report from the central bank to the government outlining
the underlying factors and prospects for returning inflation to target. Domestic demand
pressures, particularly in the housing market were cited as the key factors. With private
consumption and investment being the key drivers of growth, the current account has
deteriorated sharply, reaching a deficit of 8.5 percent of GDP in 2004. Domestic demand
has been supported by rapid credit expansion that the banks have funded largely through
external borrowing, increasing net external debt by 24 percentage points to122 percent of
GDP in 2004.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2Monetary policy has been responding to the growing demand pressures, and since May
2004 the policy rate has risen by 420 basis points to 9.5 percent. However, with increased
competition in the mortgage market lowering long-term mortgage rates and increasing the
availability of credit to households, monetary policy has been working largely through the
exchange-rate channel. The fiscal stance has tightened, as the general government
balance moved from a deficit of 1.0 percent of GDP in 2003 to an estimated surplus of
0.4 percent of GDP in 2004.
GDP is forecast to grow by 6 percent in 2005. Strong domestic demand is expected to be
the key driver as project-related investment peaks, and consumption spending is further
stimulated by mortgage market developments and labor income tax cuts. The current
account deficit is projected to peak at 13 percent of GDP in 2005. Inflationary pressures are
expected to persist and markets anticipate further increases in interest rates. Some
additional fiscal tightening is expected in 2005, as the general government surplus is
forecast to rise to almost 1.5 percent of GDP. However, the multi-year spending targets in
the 2005 budget and planned labor income tax cuts imply no additional tightening in 2006.
Growth is forecast to moderate to less than 5 percent in 2006 and rebalance toward the
external sector. However, the expected improvement in the trade balance will be partly
offset by a further deterioration in the income balance and the current account is projected
to improve only modestly. Once the new export capacity associated with the investment
projects comes on line and investment returns to a more normal level in 2007, the current
account deficit is anticipated to fall to just under 8 percent of GDP and improve gradually
beyond that point.
Executive Board Assessment
The Executive Directors commended Iceland’s recent economic performance on the back of
stability-oriented polices and structural reforms undertaken over the last decade. These
included central bank independence, the introduction of inflation targeting and a floating
exchange rate regime, strengthening of financial supervision, privatization, and export
diversification. Directors also noted that more recently the ongoing major investment
projects, while central to export diversification, have contributed to economic volatility and
macroeconomic imbalances. Consequently, the key challenge for policy is to enhance
macroeconomic stability by ensuring an orderly unwinding of the current imbalances and
limiting their reemergence in the future.
Directors stressed that the main policy task in the near-term is to contain the current
pressures in private consumption, the housing market, the current account, and inflation.
They considered that both monetary and fiscal policy would need to contribute to this end.
Directors recognized that, in the absence of appropriate fiscal tightening, too heavy a
reliance on monetary policy would increase the likelihood of further exchange rate
appreciation that would, in turn, widen the external imbalances and induce more borrowing
from abroad.
With strong public finances and low and declining public debt, Directors agreed that
medium-term fiscal sustainability is not at risk. However, they emphasized that further
tightening of the fiscal stance is needed to contain imbalances and their associated risks.
Directors noted that the tightening could be achieved by some combination of delaying

-3planned tax cuts, postponing additional public investment projects, and reducing growth in
public consumption expenditure.
While welcoming the introduction of multi-year spending targets, Directors called for a
further strengthening of the medium-term fiscal framework. In particular, the introduction of
a rules-based, multi-year framework would help ensure a counter-cyclical fiscal stance
without jeopardizing medium-term targets for public debt. Directors also noted that the
introduction of nominal rather than real expenditure targets would contribute to the
credibility of budgetary policies, with nominal targets being more transparent and
enforceable.
Directors commended the proactive and vigilant monetary policy stance of the Central Bank
of Iceland, including the most recent tightening, announced on September 29. They
stressed that, in an environment with strong growth in domestic demand and rising inflation,
this policy stance was appropriate. At the same time, Directors noted that the expansion of
credit that followed the entry of commercial banks into the mortgage market has increased
the difficulty of the central bank’s inflation stabilization task. Some Directors noted that
further increases in policy rates might be warranted. More generally, Directors considered
that these circumstances reinforced the need for strong fiscal adjustment.
Directors welcomed the successful implementation of the inflation-targeting monetary policy
framework, noting that it has served Iceland well. Most felt that it could be further improved,
taking steps to enhance the communication of monetary policy to the public. Several
Directors suggested that once the current cycle is over, modifications to the framework,
such as removing volatile components from the targeted inflation index, should be
considered.
Directors pointed to the risks to financial stability of the ongoing credit boom and
emphasized that close monitoring of the financial sector is critical. Despite the strong
balance sheets of financial institutions, risks reside in accelerating asset prices, highly
leveraged corporations, and rapidly expanding credit, a portion of which is financed by
borrowing in foreign currency. They encouraged the Financial Supervisory Authority to
implement quickly their plans for more stringent stress tests and—given the large and
growing portion of foreign-currency-denominated debt—to expand their scope to include
interest rate and exchange rate risks.
Directors noted that the increased presence of commercial banks in the mortgage market
has diversified their asset base and increased financial stability. At the same time, Directors
expressed concern that banks would find it difficult to fund their mortgage portfolios
profitably in the medium term if they had to compete at the retail level with the Housing
Financing Fund, a publicly guaranteed mortgage institution. They also noted that increased
competition in mortgage lending has led to a surge in housing prices and private
consumption that has fueled inflation. Directors called for a reform of the Housing Financing
Fund in a manner that would both strengthen the stability of the financial sector and retain
the positive features of the current system.
Directors commended the authorities’ progress in the privatization of Iceland Telecom and
welcomed intentions to use a significant portion of the proceeds for retiring public debt.

-4Directors welcomed the targeted increase in Official Development Assistance (ODA). They
also welcomed the authorities’ efforts to reduce agricultural subsidies in the context of the
Doha round, and encouraged them to take further trade liberalization measures towards
opening Iceland’s market to developing country imports.

Statement by Jon A. Solheim, Executive Director for Iceland
and Bjorn Gunmar Ólafsson, Advisor to Executive Director
October 3, 2005
The Icelandic authorities would like to express their appreciation to the Article IV mission
for the constructive discussions in Reykjavik this summer and the well balanced Staff Report.
The topics for the Selected Issues Papers were appropriate and the government especially
welcomes the analyses of the housing market and the possible impact of tax cuts. The
authorities are in broad agreement with the main conclusions, although some divergences in
views remain, in particular on the potential impact of the upcoming income tax cuts and their
timing in the business cycle. The authorities would like to thank the mission that conducted
the ROSC Data exercise in February for their valuable input and careful assessment that will
enhance the quality of Iceland’s data.
Over the last decade Iceland has experienced one of the highest economic growth rates
among industrialized countries, or an average rate of 3.8% per year. Growth for 2006 is
expected to be significantly higher. This impressive growth can be attributed to a
combination of structural reforms, fiscal consolidation, diversification of the export base and
large investment projects in the aluminum-smelter sector. Important structural changes
include the floating of the currency, adoption of inflation targeting in 2001, privatization of
banks and improvements in the financial sector regulatory framework. Icelandic businesses
are increasingly investing abroad and have rapidly expanded their activities in several
countries. Real disposable income has also increased significantly in recent years.
While economic growth has been robust macroeconomic imbalances have emerged. The
current account deficit is high, but is expected to peak at over 12% of GDP in 2005. Half of
the deficit is due to the large investment projects. These ongoing large investment projects
have had a direct effect on investment spending and income which has stimulated
consumption and put upward pressure on inflation and the exchange rate. In addition,
mortgage credit conditions eased considerably after the commercial banks entered the
housing loan market and started to compete with the state Housing Financing Fund (HHF) in
August 2004. This represented an unexpected change which had profound implications for
credit growth. Consumption has been significantly spurred by a confluence of factors
underpinning optimism. A wealth effect associated with a surge in housing prices has
stimulated credit growth. The relatively high real exchange rate has led to a rise in imports of
consumer goods. Finally, the high income growth has added to optimism.
Fiscal Policy
The general government balance has been mostly in surplus for the last eight years. The
government has pursued a policy of fiscal consolidation and has focused on debt reduction
and closing the funding gap on pension obligations in the public sector. The pension system
is close to being fully funded. In light of concerns that the economy might be overheating,
staff has encouraged the fiscal authorities to tighten their stance. The fiscal authorities
believe that additional tightening is forthcoming already in 2005. The surplus will be much
larger than expected as tax receipts are running well above the budgeted amount while

-2expenditures have been tightly controlled. At this juncture, the budget surplus for 2005 is
anticipated to be 2% of GDP, but the budget proposal 2005 envisaged a surplus of 1.25% of
GDP.
In July the state telecommunication company was privatized and more than half of the
receipts will be used to reduce the external debt of the central government. In 2001 the
foreign debt of the Republic was 28% of GDP. This ratio has been improving rapidly and is
expected to be 9% of GDP at the end of the year. The strong position of the Treasury is
especially appropriate as Iceland has a comparatively young population and the gross debt
ratio is expected to reach 20% at the end of the year.
The government adopted multiyear spending targets in 2003 whereby government
consumption may not grow by more than 2% in real terms each fiscal year. Staff has
recommended that in order to increase transparency, the multiyear spending targets should be
specified in nominal terms at the general government level. The authorities agreed that there
were positive aspects to this change, but they have noted that the indexing culture is still
relatively strong in Iceland and the general public is very literate in this sense due to the high
inflation period in the 1970’s and 1980’s.
Monetary Policy
The CPI published on September 12 showed an increase of 4.8% from September last year,
but most of the increase is due to the surge in housing prices. Inflation has been above the
Central Bank’s target of 2.5% from April 2004 and exceeded the upper tolerance limit twice
in 2005. This development obliged the monetary authorities to submit a public report to the
government explaining why inflation breached the 4% upper limit and the prospects of
returning to the target. The main inflationary pressures come from strong domestic demand
driven by the housing market boom in addition to those originating in the investments
projects. Most of the rise in the CPI is explained by the housing component of the index.
Inflation excluding housing prices remained low at 1.4% in September, after being close to
zero during the summer. Goods prices in general have been on the decline, reflecting the
strong krona. This has prompted calls for the removal of the owner occupied housing
component from the index. The authorities, however, consider the housing component an
important measure of domestic inflationary pressures and a leading indicator of more general
inflationary trends later on. Hence, the monetary authorities fully agree with staff that the
housing component should remain in headline CPI.
The Central Bank has responded firmly to deteriorating inflation prospects. Since May 2004
the policy rate has been raised from 5.3% to 10.25%, most recently when the Central Bank
issued its Monetary Bulletin on September 29. This policy action has been reflected, inter
alia, in a 10% appreciation of the krona over the last year. High interest rates have also
encouraged foreigners to issue bonds in Icelandic krona in the international markets starting
in late August. This has led to a further appreciation of the exchange rate in the most recent
weeks.
The inflation forecast presented in the latest Monetary Bulletin shows a deteriorating outlook
in the absence of further monetary restraint. It was on that basis that the Central Bank raised

-3its instrument rate by 0.75 percentage points. In announcing that decision, the Central Bank
said that by taking such a large step now, it would hopefully succeed in convincing
households, businesses and the financial markets that it is absolutely serious in keeping
inflation as close as possible to the target over the next two years and further ahead, even if
this temporarily hits certain sectors hard. Leaving inflation to its own devices and allowing it
to take root would be even more costly, since the process of unwinding such a development
would require more painful measures.
Staff has suggested the introduction of a pre-announced schedule for monetary policy
meetings that would be concluded with a public statement of the Central Bank’s decision
regarding interest rates. Staff believes that this would enhance transparency and the public
profile of monetary policy. The authorities note this suggestion, but would like to emphasize
that the Board of Governors of the Central Bank conducts regular monetary policy meetings,
although they do not follow a publicly announced schedule. It is also necessary to stress that
there are de facto four monetary policy decision dates per year, i.e. the publication dates of
the quarterly Monetary Bulletin which contains the Central Bank’s inflation forecast. Each
Monetary Bulletin starts with a policy statement explaining, inter alia, the rationale behind
the decision of the Board of Governors either to change interest rates or leave them
unchanged. Thus, it is equivalent to a public declaration at the conclusion of a pre-announced
monetary policy meeting. These dates are seen by the markets as monetary policy decision
dates, as confirmed in comments by analysts and commentators and the development of
expectations in the period preceding the publication of the Monetary Bulletin.
Structural Policies and Imbalances
Significant structural reforms have been implemented during the last decade that has
liberalized the economy. The banking sector was fully privatized in early 2003 and the
privatization of the state telecommunication company was finalized this summer. The HFF
now faces competition from the commercial banks in the mortgage market. The authorities
view these developments as positive and concur with staff that reforms of the HFF are
warranted. A working group has been established to assess the appropriate changes for the
institution.
Staff believes that the balance of risks is on the upside, especially due to the easing of credit
conditions that have fueled consumption. Staff further believes that the monetary policy has
borne most of the burden in addressing the imbalances. The Government, on the other hand,
stresses that its current stance has also been adequately restrictive. In line with the
government’s medium-term strategy public investment projects for 2004 – 2006 have been
postponed until the end of the investment period and public consumption growth restrained
to 2% per year. Moreover, the bulk of the tax cuts will not be implemented until 2007-2010,
when the economy is expected to slow down. Most of the proceeds from the privatization of
the telecommunication company will not come into play in the economy until 2007. The
Government believes that these steps should be sufficient on its part to address the rising
imbalances in the economy. Furthermore, the authorities view the external imbalance as
temporary and highly investment driven. Once the investment projects wind down the deficit
should also contract. The intertemporal allocation of consumption is also known to be highly
correlated with changes in both the exchange rate and incomes. A reduction in the foreign

-4exchange value of the krona and contracting domestic activities have been associated with a
rapid unwinding of the current account deficit.
The authorities note the staff assessment that the rapid expansion in external liabilities and
domestic credit can create difficulties and intensify vulnerabilities that could amplify the
downturn once investment slows down. The authorities would like to stress that the external
position can, to a certain extent, be explained by demographics and should be also viewed in
context of the strong financial position of the government, increasing assets of the
households and a well funded pension system. The wealth of the pension system now
exceeds the GDP. Most of the debt rests with the private sector which has been increasing its
gross debt, but at the same time this has been accompanied by a significant increase in assets.
The financial sector has grown significantly in the last decade. The banks have increasingly
been investing abroad and actively taken part in mergers and acquisitions. As a result, the
banking system is much more diversified and its income base has broadened. About half of
the banks income is now derived from abroad and this ratio is estimated to increase in the
coming years. The total assets of the Icelandic banks have approximately risen seven fold in
4 ½ years time. The banks are well funded as the external financial environment has been
benign. The banks are believed to have taken advantage of the circumstances and structured
their debt accordingly. The financial sector is constantly under prudent scrutiny and the
financial supervisory authority has strengthened its activities in recent years.
The main features of the Icelandic economy have been flexibility and resilience, which have
been identified by the rating agencies in the past. In recent years the foundation of the
economy has been strengthened significantly due to the structural reforms that have been
undertaken. The authorities, therefore, believe that the economy is even more resilient than in
the previous boom and that the economy will come out of this business cycle without serious
disturbance. The ability of households and firms to participate in the macroeconomic
adjustment should not be neglected.
In February the authorities undertook a Data ROSC exercise and the reports have been sent
to the authorities, which are about to finalize their response. The whole exercise has been
constructive for the authorities. It is believed that the ROSC Data Module and the DQAF
reports were well balanced and gave a good overview of the current status. The authorities
will approve the publication of the ROSC work and their responses on the IMF’s website.
