Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2008 Consultation with Indonesia
Approved by Daniel Citrin and Tessa van der Willigen
July 11, 2008
• This report is based on discussions held in Jakarta during May 15–28, 2007. The staff
team comprised Messrs. Zavadjil (head), Reichold (all APD), Le Borgne (FAD), and
Mesdames Ruiz Arranz (APD) and McCaughrin (MCM). Messrs. Schwartz, Senior
Resident Representative, and Morales, Deputy Resident Representative, participated in the
mission. Messrs. Warjiyo and Agung from the Executive Director’s Office also attended
meetings.
• Counterparts: Discussions were held with the previous Coordinating Minister for
Economic Affairs and newly appointed Bank Indonesia Governor Boediono, Minister of
Finance and now also Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Sri Mulyani Indrawati,
Coordinating Minister for Social Affairs Aburizal Bakrie, Minister of Trade Mari Pangestu,
Minister of Planning Paskah Suzetta, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Purnomo
Yusgiantoro, and other senior officials, as well as representatives of the private sector and
academia.
• Context of past surveillance: Close relations between the authorities and the Fund are
being maintained. The staff has been supportive of the authorities’ policy priorities and
policy implementation has been broadly consistent with recent Fund policy
recommendations in most areas (Table 1).
• Indonesia’s exchange rate regime is a managed float. Indonesia has accepted the
obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system free
of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions.

• Statistics are broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, although they could be improved
in some areas (Annex IV). Indonesia subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination
Standard. The statistics ROSC was completed in early 2005. A fiscal ROSC update was
conducted during this Article IV mission.

Executive Summary
Background and outlook
•

Indonesia’s growth performance remains strong despite the deteriorating global
environment. Growth is expected to remain at over 6 percent in 2008 on favorable
resource sector activity and increased investment.

•

While inflation remained within the target range at end-2007, it has accelerated since and
is expected to reach 12 percent at the end of the year, reflecting large increases in food
and fuel prices, as well as demand pressures. In response, Bank Indonesia (BI) has started
to tighten monetary policy (by 75 basis points since May).

•

The government raised subsidized fuel prices by 29 percent in May, the first time since
2005. Nevertheless, energy subsidies remain sizeable (5 percent of GDP in 2008).

•

Indonesia’s financial sector has displayed resilience in the face of the global credit
market turmoil and financial soundness indicators continue to improve. However, the
economy remains vulnerable to shifts in investor sentiment and volatility in the
government bond market has increased.

Policy Discussions
•

Staff and the authorities agree that monetary tightening, supported by some exchange rate
appreciation, is warranted to put inflation back on a downward path. Staff recommended
that interest rates will need to be brought promptly to a more neutral 2–3 percent in real
terms to limit the second-round effects of the fuel price increase. The authorities believe
that this can be achieved by somewhat smaller rate increases. As the 2008 inflation target
will be missed, effective communication and a credible commitment to the medium-term
inflation objectives will be important to anchor inflationary expectations.

•

The new policy of increased reselling of official foreign exchange receipts from oil
exports should support the rupiah and help dampen inflation, but a more automatic
mechanism for recycling official reserves would, in addition, enhance liquidity and
foreign exchange market development. The rupiah is seen as moderately undervalued.

•

The fiscal stance is consistent with a continued reduction in the public debt burden, but
high energy subsidies could further reduce the scope for spending on priority areas.
While staff suggested introducing automatic adjustments of fuel prices (or, as second
best, ad-hoc adjustments) to improve the composition of spending, the authorities noted
that further price increases may not be feasible ahead of the 2009 elections and are,
instead, considering options to limit the consumption of subsidized fuel.

•

Financial sector policies should focus on maintaining the stability and the soundness of
the financial system. Private sector credit growth and standards for new loan approval
should be closely monitored and prudential regulations should not be loosened further.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Since the conclusion of the last Article IV consultation in mid-2007, Indonesia’s
growth performance has remained strong despite the deteriorating global environment.
In 2007, the economy recorded the highest growth rate in a decade (over 6 percent) and the
momentum was maintained in Q1 2008. As a result, poverty and unemployment have
declined significantly, though they remain high at 15.4 percent and 8.5 percent, respectively.
2.
Nevertheless, new challenges have emanated from rising commodity prices.
Government bond yields have spiked since end-February as investor sentiment deteriorated
due to surging fuel subsidies and inflation concerns. Domestic fuel prices were subsequently
increased by about 29 percent and Bank Indonesia (BI) started raising interest rates in May,
but uncertainty remains as international oil and food prices have continued to rise and global
growth is expected to slow in 2008. Meanwhile, external financing conditions have tightened
somewhat as a result of the global financial market turmoil. All this said, overall, Indonesia
remains in good shape to weather these challenges and has positive prospects, assuming
flexible macroeconomic policy responses to deal with fuel subsidies and inflation.
3.
While having to handle these short-term issues, the authorities are also focusing
on accelerating growth and improving social conditions. As discussed extensively in
previous Article IV reports, investment remains low by regional standards, in large part
reflecting the relatively weak investment climate and governance issues. The lack of
infrastructure is also seen as a major constraint to growth. In attempting to address these
issues, progress was made last year, with the passage of the investment law and a key tax
law, as well as a series of measures to improve the business climate. However, other
elements of the reform agenda (e.g., the VAT and the income tax laws) have not yet been
passed by parliament, though the authorities are hopeful of early approval. Labor market
reform has been slowed by political resistance, and any progress will likely occur only after
the 2009 general elections (Table 9).
4.
Against this background, the discussions focused on the: (i) inflation outlook and
appropriate monetary and exchange rate policies; (ii) impact of the fuel price adjustment and
options to contain fuel subsidies in the context of volatile global oil prices; and (iii) fallout of
the global financial turmoil and economic slowdown on the financial system, and regulatory
implications. Progress in structural reforms was discussed extensively in previous Article IV
consultations and key areas have recently been covered by other multilateral institutions.1

5
II. ECONOMIC BACKGROUND
5.

Strong growth has been accompanied by increasing inflation.

•

Growth of 6.3 percent in 2007 was driven by domestic demand, both robust private
consumption and a rebound in investment that included a strong rise in foreign direct
investment. While exports performed strongly, supported by continuing demand for
Indonesia’s commodities, the recovery of imports in the second half of the year reduced
the contribution of net exports to growth. The growth momentum was maintained in the
first quarter of 2008 despite the deterioration in consumer confidence (Figure 1).2

•

Headline inflation has accelerated to 11.0 percent at end-June, while core inflation
reached 8.7 percent at end-May (latest available data).3 Part of this uptick owes to the
impact of the fuel price adjustment in late May. However, fueled by high food prices and
demand pressures, headline inflation had already reached 9 percent at end-April, well
above BI’s 4–6 percent target range for end-2008.

6.
Accommodative monetary policy appears to have contributed to the rise in
inflationary pressures since mid-2007. After lowering interest rates to 8 percent and then
holding them unchanged since late 2007, BI hiked rates three times since May by a total of
75 basis points in response to rising inflation. Furthermore, bank liquidity has been tightened
in 2008, as the overnight rate has increased by about 400 basis points from the average level
in December 2007 in line with the implementation of the change in the monetary operations
framework (see paragraph 20). Nevertheless, the real policy interest rate calculated on the
basis of core inflation has been declining over the year and is currently around zero.
7.
The relative weakness of the rupiah may have also added to inflationary
pressures in the second half of 2007, but the external position remains generally strong.
The real exchange rate remains moderately undervalued, as discussed in paragraph 18.
Nevertheless, the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) depreciated further (by
10 percent) in 2007 as Indonesia accumulated US$14 billion of reserves. However, in 2008
the NEER has remained stable and BI has slowed the accumulation of reserves. While the
current account recorded a surplus of 2.5 percent of GDP in 2007 supported by gains in the
price of major commodity exports, there have been some episodes of capital outflows.

2

Worsening consumer confidence is largely attributed to rising inflation. Nevertheless, the historical correlation
between this indicator and consumption growth and activity has been low.

3

Starting with the June data, the statistics bureau rebased the CPI index to reflect changes in buying patterns,
resulting in a reduced the weight of food and higher weights of communications and transportation. This
rebasing is conducted every five years. While historical data are yet to be revised to make comparisons possible,
it is estimated that inflation through May may have been about 1½ percentage points lower using the weights in
the new base year.

Fiscal performance has been strong despite rising fuel subsidies. Energy subsidies
rose to 3 percent of GDP in 2007 (almost a third of total current spending). Nevertheless, the
fiscal deficit was contained to 1.2 percent of GDP, well below the government’s target.
Revenue performance was buoyant, with an across the board surge in non-oil and gas
revenue being a testament to both the underlying strength of the economy and payoff from
ongoing reforms in tax administration. Budget execution has also improved noticeably, in
particular in the area of development expenditure.
9.
Indonesia’s financial sector has displayed resilience in the face of the global
credit market turmoil. Financial soundness indicators have improved, with banking sector
profitability increasing, and gross NPLs declining to 4 percent amid strong private credit
growth (Figure 2). The stock market index remains about 6 percent above the level at endJune 2007. Nevertheless, volatility has increased, and since end-February, EMBI and CDS
spreads have widened more than in other emerging market countries. Several factors have
limited the transmission of global financial
shocks:

•

Ample domestic liquidity. The banking sector is well capitalized and highly liquid.

•

Relatively low reliance on external financing. Both strong profitability and ample
domestic credit, have allowed Indonesian corporations to continue to finance their
investments despite the higher cost of external funds. Moreover, vulnerabilities have
declined as debt to asset ratios have fallen.4

10.
Nevertheless, the government bond market came under stress in March,
reflecting largely investors’ concerns about inflation and fuel subsidies (Figure 3). Bond
yields have spiked by about 300 basis points since end-February. Some bond auctions have
not attracted the targeted demand, although the government was successful in raising
$2.2 billion in an external bond issue in June.

III. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
11.
Notwithstanding the weakening external environment, Indonesia’s growth is
expected to remain strong, assuming timely responses to changing economic conditions.
•

Growth is projected by the staff to slow slightly to 6.1 percent in 2008. After a
stronger-than-expected first quarter, some weakening is expected in the second part of
2008, owing to the effects of higher domestic fuel prices, tighter monetary policy, and the
expected global slowdown. However, investment is expected to remain strong, in line
with rapid credit growth, a booming resource sector, and some improvement in the
investment climate.

•

Indonesia is better sheltered than many other emerging market economies against a
U.S. slowdown. High commodity prices in the WEO baseline and still healthy demand
from other emerging countries will continue to boost exports of major commodities. The
economy’s diversified export base and its lower trade exposure, including indirect links,
to the U.S. relative to regional peers, should allow Indonesia to continue to record trade
surpluses. Nonetheless, these surpluses are expected to decline over time, reflecting the
higher reliance on imported oil as well as higher non-oil imports in line with stronger
private investment.

At the same time, there are significant external downside risks to growth, and
Indonesia could be strongly affected by a deterioration in economic and financial
conditions beyond the WEO baseline.
•

While relatively less vulnerable to slower U.S. growth, shifts in investor sentiment
and financial contagion could be disruptive. Increased global risk aversion, involving
substantial deleveraging and repricing of risk, could trigger capital outflows from highbeta and more volatile emerging markets. Staff analysis suggests that, within Asia,
Indonesia’s financial markets remain relatively sensitive to spillovers from short-term
shocks to risk aversion (Box 1).

•

A sharp reversal of the rise in commodity prices could pose downside risks to
growth. Commodities account for more than half of total exports in Indonesia. Therefore,
declines in commodity prices would undermine export revenue, as well as profits and
valuations of many commodity producers on the Jakarta stock market. This could also
trigger capital outflows, put pressures on the rupiah, and reverse the recent increase in
FDI to these sectors. On the positive side, declines in food and oil prices would help ease
inflationary pressures and reduce budget subsidies.5

13.
A continued rise in global oil and food prices, on the other hand, pose a
significant risk for the inflation outlook. Food price pressures are expected to ease with an
expected strong rice harvest and international prices of many food commodities leveling off.
However, price pressures could mount later in the year, especially if the strong rice harvest
fails to materialize.6
IV. DISCUSSIONS OF KEY POLICY CHALLENGES
A. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies: Responding to Rising Inflation
14.
As in many other countries, inflationary pressures have intensified since the
beginning of the year (Figure 4). Headline inflation is expected to reach 12 percent by the
end of the year, reflecting the effect of the fuel price adjustment, high food prices, as well as
demand pressures.
15.
Rising commodity prices have contributed disproportionately to the increase in
inflation in Indonesia. Food prices accounted for 49 percent of y/y inflation as of June,
compared with a CPI weight of 36 percent. Similarly, the 29 percent fuel price adjustment
also significantly raised the headline inflation rate, as did some other commodity prices, such
as gold, although to a lesser extent.
5

Annex I describes in more detail the medium-term impact of a possible adverse shock scenario, assuming a
stronger global slowdown, a sharp drop in commodity prices, and a surge in risk aversion.
6

Such a scenario is explored in the accompanying Selected Issues Paper: Inflation Outlook and Monetary
Policy Challenges.

12

BOX 1. FINANCIAL MARKET SPILLOVERS: EVIDENCE FROM RECENT DATA 1/
Global shocks to risk aversion have a significant impact on Indonesian financial
markets. Shocks to the VIX index tend to spill over into Indonesian financial markets within
2–3 days. As expected, the largest impact is on equities, the most risky asset class.
Within Asia, Indonesia’s financial markets remain relatively sensitive to such shortterm spillovers. Compared to some important emerging market countries outside the region
(e.g., Turkey, South Africa, and Brazil) Indonesian markets appears to be somewhat more
stable. Nevertheless, the analysis suggests that Indonesia could be significantly affected by
another episode of flight from emerging market assets.

However, strong domestic demand and weakness in the rupiah also contributed
to rising inflation. Cross-country monetary comparisons suggest that a number of emerging
market central banks with inflation targeting frameworks have responded more aggressively
to rising inflationary pressures, looked at in terms of the timing and size of rate hikes as well
as the level of real interest rates.
•

Rupiah weakness. By end-June, the rupiah had depreciated by about 11.5 percent in
nominal effective terms since mid 2007, pushing up imported inflation, although it has
remained quite stable in 2008.

•

Closing output gap. Solid estimates of potential output are not available, but the economy
has been growing at its fastest pace in 10 years. Despite bottlenecks in transportation and
infrastructure, capacity utilization has increased, and the unemployment rate has
declined. Real interest rates have been falling steadily since late 2006, contributing to the
acceleration of credit growth and domestic demand.

BI has begun to tighten monetary policy to address inflationary pressures. The
mission suggested that real interest rates would need to be brought to at least a neutral
2–3 percent (based on a 2009 inflation projection of about 7½ percent), and that this level
should be achieved soon to help anchor inflationary expectations. The authorities believe that
a real interest rate of about 1½ percent is neutral and have adopted a more gradual approach,
hoping that somewhat smaller rate increases might be sufficient. Nevertheless, they
emphasized, and staff agreed, that the extent and pace of tightening will depend on the
evolution of domestic economic performance, commodity prices, and the exchange rate.
18.
To complement interest rate policy and limit pressure on the rupiah, BI has been
“recycling” official foreign exchange receipts to provide liquidity to the foreign
exchange market. Higher oil prices boost oil-related revenues and reserve accumulation.
Since early 2008, BI has slowed the pace of accumulation of reserves which have increased

15
by $2.5 billion with respect to the level at end-2007.7 Staff supported this policy and
suggested that a moderately stronger rupiah would be in line with fundamentals and help
support both the external balance and the inflation objective. Model-based estimates suggest
that the rupiah remains somewhat undervalued in real effective terms—about 0 to 15 percent,
depending on the methodology (Box 2). However, the authorities and staff agreed that there
are limits to the recycling policy, and a steady and prolonged decline in reserves should be
avoided. Current reserve levels are comfortable and there is no urgency to increase reserves,
although over the medium-term higher reserves could reduce vulnerabilities and borrowing
costs (see Selected Issues paper on reserve adequacy). To enhance transparency and support
foreign exchange market development, the mission suggested that BI could consider an
automatic mechanism for “recycling” foreign exchange receipts similar to the one
implemented in Mexico, whereby part of the realized reserve accumulation in one quarter is
sold during subsequent quarters.
19.
The mission proposed several steps to improve transparency and communication
and help anchor inflationary expectations.
•

Inflation forecasts. The mission recommended publishing inflation forecasts (beyond the
current year) and discussing monetary policy decisions more explicitly in reference to the
inflation forecasts and targets beyond the current year. On the other hand, public
statements with regard to specific future interest rate levels and credit growth targets
could be less specific.

•

Targets. The mission did not recommend changing the 2008 target (the current inflation
rate is well outside the target range), given the short time left in the current year. Instead,
it would be preferable to provide a forecast and explain the reasons for the deviation. In
contrast, a revision of the 2009 and 2010 targets (4.5±1 and 4.0±1, respectively) could be
considered with a view to tracing a realistic yet sufficiently ambitious path towards
achieving an unchanged medium-term inflation objective of around 3 percent (in line
with Indonesia’s major trading partners). While revisions to inflation targets should
generally be avoided to maintain credibility, in this case, the 2009–10 targets are no
longer realistic and in the absence of official multi-year forecasts to guide expectations,
more realistic targets that guide monetary policy decisions could help anchor
expectations about inflation and monetary policy. However, in its communications
strategy, BI should focus more on the medium-term objectives and the measures needed
to ensure their achievement. BI broadly agreed and highlighted their commitment to the
medium-term objective.

7

The government deposits all foreign exchange receipts (arising from oil-related revenues and external
borrowing) with BI. Meanwhile, government purchases of foreign exchange (for external debt service) are
much smaller, and the state oil company Pertamina buys foreign exchange for gasoline imports on the open
market. This results in sizable reserve accumulation, unless BI sells (recycles) some of those reserves again in
the market.

16
BOX 2. INDONESIA: EXCHANGE RATE ASSESSMENT
Real Exchange Rate Developments: Indonesia real effective exchange rate (REER) has recovered
significantly since the Asian crisis, reaching the most appreciated level in 10 years in mid-2007. More
recently, however, some of the appreciation has been reversed with a real depreciation of around 9
percent from May 2007 to April 2008, despite continued improvements in Indonesia’s terms of trade.
Estimation of the Equilibrium Exchange Rate: According to two of the three methodologies used by
the IMF’s Consultative Group on Exchange Rate Issues (CGER), the rupiah may be modestly
undervalued relative to the long run equilibrium, in the range of 0-15 percent. The macroeconomic
balances (MB) approach implies that the exchange rate is fairly valued, with the current account (CA)
norm estimated to be -0.5 percent of GDP, close to the underlying CA (-0.1 percent of GDP). The
equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) and the external sustainability approaches suggest an
undervaluation of 13 and 15 percent respectively. The increase in the estimated ERER in recent years is
primarily due to stronger commodity prices and a rising NFA position. However, some caution is
necessary in interpreting these results. In particular, given the assumption of zero misalignment over the
sample used in the ERER approach, inclusion of a long pre-crisis period in the sample may lead to an
overestimation of the equilibrium ERER.
Export Performance: Despite the modest estimated undervaluation, Indonesia’s export market share in
global trade dipped slightly in 2007 following the increase from 2004–06, and remains slightly below the
2000 level (by 0.03 percentage points).
Overall Assessment: Econometric estimates suggest that the rupiah may be modestly undervalued. In
the near term, there is some room for appreciation which would also contribute to lowering inflation.
However, competitiveness challenges remain, as evidenced by the slight fall in export market share since
2000 and by Indonesia’s relatively low ranking in investment climate surveys. Over the medium term,
Indonesia’s modest current account surplus is projected to continue to narrow and eventually give way to
a small deficit, consistent with its level of development and the projected strengthening of domestic
demand, along with an easing of commodity prices. Given the large improvement in the NFA position
and projected current account dynamics, risks to external sustainability are limited.

BI’s changes to the monetary operations framework have been successful and
well-received by the markets. BI moved the operational target from the 1 month SBI rate to
the overnight interbank rate on June 9. BI had started the transition process early in the year
by stepping up fine-tuning operations for liquidity management and conducting SBI auctions
through a variable rate tender. This enabled BI to stabilize the overnight rate and move it in
line with the one-month SBI rate.
B. Fiscal Policy: Implications and Sustainability of Fuel Subsidies
21.
Overall, fiscal performance continues to be strong and the 2008 fiscal stance
supports further public debt reduction. The overall fiscal deficit of the central government
is foreseen by the staff to be limited to 1.9 percent of GDP for 2008. This would reduce
public debt to below 32 percent at end-2008—in line with the 30–35 percent of GDP target
for end-2009, which has provided an anchor for fiscal policy in recent years. This fiscal
deficit level is also appropriate to safeguard investment in infrastructure and social
expenditures, especially in light of the underspending of recent years and very large
infrastructure needs. The government is expecting a slightly lower deficit (1.8 percent of
GDP) than contained in the revised budget (2.1 percent of GDP) on account of lower
consumption of subsidized domestic fuel. Local/regional governments are expected to
continue to accumulate small surpluses in 2008 because of still limited implementation
capacity.
22.
However, high energy subsidies
could further reduce the scope for
spending on priority areas. These subsidies
are likely to account for over one third of
central government discretionary spending in
2008 and have led the government to
introduce a 10 percent cut on discretionary
spending compared to the original 2008
budget. (See Box 3 for a discussion of the
impact of oil prices on the budget.)

The government has taken steps to limit fuel subsidies. The price increase of
May 24 had a positive impact on the budget of about 0.6 percent of GDP and created fiscal
space, while reducing smuggling incentives. To limit the burden on the poor, a significant
part of this fiscal space is being used on a cash compensation scheme, while the remaining
(0.3 percent of GDP) will help contain the fiscal deficit. Under this scheme, the government
is disbursing monthly cash payments to 19 million households through December 2008, and
is expanding its rice distribution program. In addition, as a response to rising food prices, the
government has introduced several tax incentives and trade measures aimed at limiting food
price increases, such as the reduction of import duties on rice, wheat, and soybeans, as well
as VAT exemptions.

18
BOX 3. THE IMPACT OF OIL PRICES ON THE BUDGET

Surging international oil prices have again raised concerns in the markets about the
budget impact and sustainability of energy subsidies. Such concerns, in addition to rising
inflation, have contributed to the recent government bond sell-off, as well as the widening of
Indonesia’s CDS and EMBI spreads in relation to peers.
However, considering all oil related revenues and expenditures, the net effect on the
budget is relatively small. Oil-related expenditures for the central government arise from fuel
and electricity subsidies paid to the state oil company Pertamina and the electricity company
PLN, as well as from transfers to the regions based on a revenue sharing formula. However, a
large share of those regional transfers is based on budgeted, not actual, oil prices so those
transfers only adjust in the next budget year. Oil-related revenues take the form of royalties,
income tax, profit sharing agreements and dividends from Pertamina. The latter are usually
paid based on the previous year’s profits, delaying the impact on the budget by one year,
although the government can request advance dividends (as in 2008). The initial combined
effect of a $10/barrel oil price increase on the fiscal deficit is currently estimated at about
0.1 percent of GDP. This increases to about 0.2 percent of GDP in the following fiscal year.
The evolution of subsidized fuel consumption is a key factor determining the fiscal
impact. The above estimates assume

Overall, as long as consumption remains contained, energy subsidies are not a threat to
fiscal sustainability, although they do affect the quality of spending.

19

24.
The authorities noted that further steps will be taken in the future to reduce the
cost of fuel subsidies. Despite the recent fuel price increase, energy subsidies remain large
(about 5 percent of GDP in 2008). The authorities plan to contain subsidized fuel
consumption, possibly by capping purchases of subsidized fuels to certain amounts and
through gradual price increases for certain users, such as private cars. Efforts are also
underway to replace heavily subsidized kerosene by more economical LPG as the main
cooking fuel through supplying the population with free LPG-using stoves.
25.
The mission proposed to reintroduce automatic fuel price adjustments, designed
to achieve the government’s goal of eliminating fuel subsidies over the medium term.
Automatic adjustments would ensure that higher global oil prices protect the fiscal position
while helping depoliticize the process of fuel price adjustments. The authorities cautioned
that automatic adjustments are politically not feasible at this point. The mission noted that
further ad-hoc adjustments would also help reduce subsidies, albeit a second best alternative
to an automatic adjustment mechanism.
26.
Public finance reforms are producing good results. The ongoing reforms are aimed
at strengthening revenue collection and public financial management, as well as improving
the investment climate by making the tax system more business-friendly.8 Comprehensive tax
administration reforms, including the roll-out of the small taxpayers offices, are already
generating important gains, both in terms of revenue and the investment climate. Progress is
being made towards establishing a treasury single account, though completion hinges on
resolving various issues with BI including remuneration of government deposits.
Encouraging efforts have also continued to be made in improving fiscal transparency,
including the publication of a fiscal risk statement in the 2008 budget.
C. Financial Sector Policies: Implications of the Global Financial Market Turmoil
27.
While Indonesia has so far remained relatively insulated from the global crisis,
looking ahead, local markets are vulnerable to higher funding costs, spikes in volatility,
and declining risk appetite. Financing pressures have increased for those Indonesian
corporates that have access to foreign markets. So far, companies have been able to react by
increasing financing from the domestic banking system, but rising policy interest rates and
high government bond yields suggest that domestic financing conditions are also likely to
tighten somewhat. Meanwhile, exchange rate volatility has remained subdued, but a loss of
confidence, including on the part of the local investor base, could exert downward pressure
on the rupiah.
28.
However, the banking system should remain relatively resilient, even in the
advent of an adverse macro shock. Stress testing analysis suggests that under a macro
scenario where commodity prices fall sharply and global economic growth decelerates, none
8

See Selected Issues Paper: Progress in Fiscal Institution Building.

20
of the largest 15 banks would see their CARs fall below the 8 percent minimum threshold
(Box 4). Banks have gradually reduced their holdings of government bonds as a share of
assets (to about 30 percent), while shifting their holdings in the trading portfolio into variable
rate securities, and thus are less affected by the rise in policy rates. In addition, strict limits
on open FX positions (20 percent of total capital) restrict the direct impact of exchange rate
risk. Nevertheless, the mission encouraged BI to continue improving their stress testing
framework, including tail risk scenarios and analysis of banks’ liquidity risks.
29.
The authorities and staff agreed that private sector credit growth will have to be
monitored closely. While not representing a threat for macroeconomic stability at this point
(the loan to deposit ratio is only 71 percent and private sector credit is equivalent to only
about 25 percent of GDP), the rapid acceleration in bank lending, particularly consumer
credit and credit in foreign currency, could become a source of vulnerability.9 The mission
cautioned that, while asset quality has improved, NPLs may be lagging and the current
cyclical strength may disguise financial weaknesses. BI should closely scrutinize screening
criteria for new and restructured loans and ensure banks are properly provisioned and
hedged. Efforts should also focus on improving monitoring of private sector external debt
and data coverage of nonbank financial institutions and corporations.
30.
Several prudential regulations have been modified with a view to stimulate
credit growth. Because of what it perceived as overly restrictive regulations that have
unduly limited lending in some areas such as SMEs, BI reduced capital requirements on
banks by lowering the risk weights on loans to small and medium enterprise (SME). A
similar measure was implemented with respect to corporate bonds, while establishing caps on
corporate bond holdings. All these measures are consistent with Basel II and international
best practices, but credit concentration limits were raised above international standards.
While these measures are not likely to have a major impact on credit, staff noted that credit
growth is already expanding at a rapid pace, and there was no need for additional stimulative
measures.

9

Supervisors and the business community felt that most of the foreign currency credit is being directed to the
commodity sector, which is export-oriented.

21
BOX 4: STRESS TEST ANALYSIS ON INDONESIA’S BANKING SYSTEM
Sufficient capitalization and strong asset quality should enable Indonesian banks to remain relatively
resilient in the event of an adverse macroeconomic shock.
The banking system remains well-capitalized. As credit growth has increased, the capital adequacy ratio
(CAR) and the ratio of Tier 1 capital to assets (leverage ratio) have declined to 18% and 15%, respectively
for the largest 15 banks. However, both still exceed standard thresholds by ample margins (a Tier 1 ratio
below 4 percent is considered seriously undercapitalized). The Tier 1 capital ratio is used as an additional
metric, since reported CARs are high in Indonesia as a result of zero risk weighting of sizable government
bond portfolios. Liquidity is relatively high in Indonesia’s banking system and thus not a matter of concern
at this point.
The largest 15 banks, representing nearly 70 percent in total assets, were subject to stress tests. The
results are based on BI’s risk model that links key indicators, such as NPLs, to the main macro variables.
Under the baseline macro projections, capitalization ratios and NPLs are expected to remain broadly
unchanged (see text table). The banking system was also subject to a more extreme scenario, which assumes
that commodity prices fall sharply amid a global economic slowdown (see description of the adverse macro
scenario in Annex III). Under this scenario, average Tier 1 and CAR ratios of the banks fell both by
2.6 percentage points each. Most banks would be able to absorb the impact of this extreme but plausible
shock. However, one bank would see its Tier 1 capital ratio dip below 4 percent, and two banks would
experience a drop in the CAR below the 8 percent threshold.
Sensitivity analysis was also performed to determine the magnitude of shocks required to significantly
impact capitalization. Thresholds were determined for key variables affecting credit, interest rate,
exchange rate, and market risk. Deterioration in credit quality remains the largest risk. If 24 percent of loans
were downgraded to the next lower classification, one bank’s Tier 1 capital would fall below 4 percent. It
would require fairly large shocks in interest rates, bond prices, or the exchange rate for at least one bank to
become seriously undercapitalized.
Overall the banking system should be able to sustain significant stress, owing to its low loan-to-deposit
ratio, large share of floating-rate securities, small net open exchange rate position, strong profitability, and
high capital cushion. However, credit quality needs to be closely watched, especially in light of rapid credit
growth.

31.
The authorities are planning a gradual transition to Basel II between 2008 and
2010. The pace of transition will be differentiated across banks, with smaller banks
proceeding at a slower pace. Most of the needed regulations for Pillar I are expected to be
completed this year. The mission emphasized that the transition needs to be carefully
managed and that efforts should focus on the implementation of Pillar 2, including enhancing
day-to-day risk-based supervision at BI and day-to-day risk management at regulated banks.
The reduction in capital requirements for certain assets that has taken place under the
authorities gradual approach to Basel II, as described in paragraph 30, could lower capital
standards of the banking sector. It is, therefore, important to offset these lower risk weights
with other higher capital requirements, such as for operational risk, or by increasing loan
provisioning.
32.
The current review of the financial safety net should help strengthen the
institutional framework. Protocols are under discussion to establish clear responsibilities in
the event of a crisis. The draft financial safety net law is being discussed between the
government and BI in the context of the Financial Stability Forum, with a view to
strengthening the legal framework for bank resolution, and the LOLR framework is being
assessed to ensure consistency with international best practice. While clear responsibilities
are important to support timely responses in case of a crisis, it will also be important to retain
sufficient flexibility in the framework to be able to react to potential unexpected conditions.
33.
For some time now, the authorities have stated their intention to participate in
an FSAP. They recognize that the FSAP would provide useful inputs to guide further
financial sector reform but have not committed to a specific timing, highlighting the need for
careful preparation to maximize the benefits of the FSAP.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
Indonesia’s economy has shown resilience in the face of global financial market
turmoil and the global slowdown. Sound macroeconomic policies in recent years have
improved fundamentals, including lower debt ratios and higher reserves, and thus limited the
transmission of adverse shocks. Banks have avoided adverse spillovers from mature markets,
due to very low subprime-related exposures, high liquidity in the system, and sufficient
capital. Meanwhile, relatively low reliance on external sources and the ready availability of
domestic bank financing have enabled corporations to increase investment despite tighter
conditions on global capital markets.
35.
Growth is expected to remain strong, although there are downside risks. Robust
domestic demand and buoyant exports supported by high commodity prices should continue
to propel the economy. Nevertheless, downside risks predominate and Indonesia could be
affected substantially by a weakening in growth in Asia beyond the WEO baseline, especially
if accompanied by slumping commodity prices. In addition, Indonesia’s financial markets
remain vulnerable to major episodes of global risk aversion and contagion from other
emerging markets. These risks underscore the need for prompt policy responses to changing
external circumstances.

23
36.
Continued monetary policy tightening is needed. High food and fuel prices have
been the main source of inflationary pressures. However, strong domestic demand, supported
by rapid credit growth and low real interest rates, has also contributed. Real interest rates are
now negative and also low by cross country comparison, which has likely contributed to the
relatively weaker rupiah. BI has appropriately started hiking interest rates, but further
increases will be needed promptly to limit second round effects of the fuel price increase and
put inflation back on a firmly declining path. Considering the momentum of domestic
demand, the resulting effect on growth should be mild and short-lived.
37.
Efforts should continue to strengthen the inflation targeting framework. As the
2008 inflation target will clearly be missed, effective communication and a credible strong
commitment to the medium-term targets will be important to anchor inflationary expectations
and maintain confidence. This should include publishing inflation forecasts and could
involve adjusting the 2009–10 targets. The shift of the operational target to the interbank
overnight rate has been managed well and should help improve the effectiveness of monetary
policy.
38.
Indonesia’s exchange rate policy is generally appropriate. Staff estimates suggest
that the real exchange rate is likely to be somewhat undervalued as a result of improving
fundamentals and the recent underperformance of the rupiah in 2007. The new policy of
increased reselling of oil receipts should strengthen the currency and help support monetary
policy in dampening inflationary pressures. Foreign exchange sales should be managed in a
way that does not create perceptions of specific exchange rate targets and should avoid a
sustained decrease in reserves. A mechanism with less short-term discretion could be useful
in that regard. While reserves are adequate, some additional accumulation over the mediumterm could further reduce vulnerabilities.
39.
The fiscal stance is consistent with a substantial reduction of the public debt
burden, but energy subsidies present a major challenge. The recent fuel price increase
was an important step to address this problem, and the accompanying cash transfers to the
poor are an effective instrument to cushion the social impact. Cash transfers should also be
used to replace the tax incentives and trade measures recently introduced to limit food price
increases. While there is a significant risk that subsidies will be higher than planned, there
should be enough cushion in the 2008 budget to ensure that the impact on fiscal sustainability
and public borrowing requirement is manageable. However, the introduction of preferably an
automatic fuel price adjustment mechanism, or ad-hoc fuel price adjustments, would help
protect fiscal space for capital and social expenditures and guard against remerging concerns
and speculation about the sustainability of subsidies and timing of price adjustments.
Because of these uncertainties, there is currently little scope for deploying fiscal policy in the
event of a downturn, despite the fundamentally sound position. On public finance reforms,
staff continues to support the ongoing agenda and recognizes the impressive results that have
already been achieved.
40.
With credit growth already expanding at a high rate, financial sector policies
should focus on maintaining stability and the soundness of the financial system. Going

24
forward, prudential regulations should not be loosened beyond international standards with a
view to stimulate credit growth. Instead, standards for new loan approval need to be closely
monitored, especially foreign currency credit and consumer credit. Staff supports the planned
gradual transition to Basel II, but it will be important to ensure that capital standards for the
banking system are not lowered as a result of partial implementation. The review of the
financial safety net is welcome and should result in a flexible system that ensures timely
responses in case of a crisis. Staff encourages the authorities to confirm a date for the FSAP,
as this exercise could help identify areas for further improvement in the financial sector.
41.
Over the medium-term, continued progress on structural reforms is needed to
achieve higher sustainable GDP growth. Staff welcomes progress towards implementing
reforms over the past year. While major breakthroughs in key areas such as labor market
reform seem unlikely in the run-up to the 2009 elections, recently announced policy packages
covering infrastructure, small and medium enterprises, the investment climate, and financial
sector signal the authorities intention to press ahead with the structural agenda.
42.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Table 1. Indonesia: The Authorities’ Response to Recent Fund Policy Advice
Advice from the 2007 Article IV Discussions

Actions Taken

Monetary and exchange rate policy
Monetary policy should focus on achieving the 2008
target. While the rupiah appreciation and moderating
core inflation has opened room for limited interest rate
cuts, BI needs to exercise caution.
Future surges in capital inflows should be addressed
through allowing further rupiah appreciation and
intervention to limit excessive exchange rate
movements.

Interest rates were left unchanged during 2007-H2, until a surprise cut of 25
bp in December, despite rising core inflation and a weaker rupiah. Inflation
met the 2007 target, but has trended upwards since and reached
10.4 percent recently, above the 4–6 percent 2008 target range. In
response, BI raised interest rates by a cumulative 75 bps in May and July.
BI started to “recycle” foreign exchange receipts from oil to help alleviate
downward pressures on the rupiah.

Fiscal policy
Fiscal deficit targets of 1.8 percent and 1.7 percent of
GDP in 2007 and 2008, respectively, are appropriate.

The fiscal deficit in 2007 was 1.2 percent of GDP due to better than
expected revenue collection. The 2008 deficit target is consistent with a
continued decline in the public debt to GDP ratio.

Fuel price adjustments should be depoliticized by the
introduction of a mechanism for automatic
adjustments of energy prices.

Domestic fuel prices were raised by 29 percent in May 2008. However,
prices remain the lowest in the region (at about 30–70 percent of
international spot prices depending on the fuel product).

Create a Single Treasury Account to ensure better
fiscal management.

Cash management regulations were approved in July 2007. However, a few
outstanding issues continue to impede the establishment of a TSA.

Improve fiscal space through both revenue and
expenditure measures (especially reducing untargeted
energy subsidies).

No new revenue measures were introduced (a tax policy package has been
under discussion in parliament since 2005). The recent fuel price
adjustment alleviates pressures on the budget but due to rising oil prices,
energy subsidies continue to squeeze priority spending.

Improvements are needed in a number of areas to
better assess fiscal risks, including monitoring of
SOEs, reporting of quasi-fiscal and extra-budgetary
activities and monitoring contingent liabilities.

A statement of fiscal risks and a medium-term fiscal framework were
introduced in the 2008 budget.

BI should reconsider the appropriateness of the
relaxation in prudential regulations to encourage
lending.

There has been no reversal of previous regulation.

A deeper non-bank financial sector could be a
significant source of long-term financing.

The Sharia Banking Bill was approved by parliament on April. Efforts to
develop the government securities market were made, including the
reintroduction of T-bills auction and a decree on the Dealer System. The
latest policy package includes various measures in support financial sector
development.
An explicit strategy has not yet been developed.
The authorities have agreed in principle to participate in an FSAP, but have
yet to commit to a date.

Financial sector

A strategy on the future role of state banks is needed.
The authorities should participate in an FSAP.

Structural reforms
Focus on increased infrastructure spending, including
by facilitating public-private partnerships, and improve
business climate.

Investment has picked up over the past year. The government revised its
negative list (indicating sectors with limitations on foreign investment) at
end-2007. The list improves clarity for foreign investors.

Improve flexibility in the labor market.

No progress has been made on this area.

APPENDIX I. INDONESIA: MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK UNDER AN ADVERSE MACRO
SCENARIO AND PUBLIC AND EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
This annex compares the medium-term outlook under the baseline with an adverse macro
scenario based on a more severe global slowdown, a sharp decline in commodity prices, and
capital outflows, triggered by tightening global liquidity and increasing risk aversion. It also
analyzes the impact of several exogenous shocks on the sustainability of public sector debt
and external debt.
I.

ADVERSE SCENARIO

Sharper global growth slowdown, accompanied by a fall in commodity prices, higher
risk aversion, and capital outflows.
Macro shocks: Global growth is assumed to slow further, by 1 percentage point relative to
the WEO baseline for 2009, while major export commodity prices, including oil, fall by
20 percent relative to the baseline (resulting in an oil price of $100 per barrel). The
anticipated adverse impact is assumed to trigger increased risk aversion and cause a market
sell-off in Indonesian equity and bond markets, as well as the rupiah.
Policy response: BI is assumed to increase the policy rate by around 200 bps relative to the
baseline to stem the capital outflow, stabilize the exchange rate, and limit the impact on
inflation. In addition, BI is also assumed to intervene in the foreign exchange market to
cushion the effects of capital outflows. Fiscal policy aims to contain the deficit through some
cuts in capital expenditures.
Projections: Lower global growth and commodity prices lead to a contraction in exports.
Combined with the deceleration of domestic demand as a result of higher interest rates and
negative market sentiment, the result is GDP growth of about 5 percent (about 1 percent
below the baseline). With the exchange rate depreciating by around 15 percent, inflation
picks up to 8.5 percent (versus 7.5 percent in the baseline). Bond yields would rise by
200 bps in line with policy interest rates and equity prices fall by 30 percent, reflecting
higher interest rates, lower commodity prices, and a weaker economy. The current account
surplus narrows (by 0.3 percentage points) due to lower export receipts, which, together with
capital outflows, leads to slowdown in reserve accumulation. The fiscal position would
deteriorate due to declining revenue and higher interest cost, despite the offsetting effect of
lower energy subsidies and some cuts in capital expenditure, resulting in a deterioration of
the fiscal deficit by around 0.2 percentage points of GDP.

II.

DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS UNDER THE BASELINE SCENARIO

A. Public Debt
1.
The public sector debt ratio has declined steadily from 58 percent of GDP at
end-2003 to an estimated 35 percent at end-2007 (Figure 2). This reflects the
government’s fiscal consolidation policy, declining interest rates, and high real GDP growth
rates. The share of debt held by foreign creditors (mostly multilateral institutions) has
declined to less than 50 percent. This trend is likely to continue as the authorities increasingly
tap the domestic bond market.
2.
Under the baseline scenario, public
sector debt is expected to decline to around
25 percent of GDP by 2013. In terms of
government revenues, public sector debt will
decline from 196 percent to 138 percent over
the 2007–13 period. These results are based on
the key assumptions underlying the baseline
projections for 2008–13, specifically that:
(1) real GDP growth averages 6.5 percent;
(2) the primary surplus averages 0.1 percent of
GDP; and (3) average nominal interest rates on
public debt increase slightly to 7.9 percent by
the end of the period.

3.
The standard sensitivity analysis shows that the trajectory of the debt ratio is
most sensitive to changes in interest rates, exchange rates or contingent liabilities
(Figure 2). Increasing average real interest rates by half of the historical standard deviation, a
one-time 30 percent real depreciation of the exchange rate, or a 10 percent increase in
contingent liabilities eventually lead to a 8 percentage points of GDP increase in the debt
ratio by 2013. Other macroeconomic shocks have a more limited impact.
B. External Debt
4.
Indonesia’s external debt has also declined steadily since the crisis, from over
150 percent of GDP in 1998 to around 32 percent in 2007 (Figure 3). External debt as a
percentage of exports has also declined, from 288 percent to 105 percent, over the same
period.
5.
External debt dynamics are sustainable under the baseline scenario, with the
debt to GDP ratio declining to around 18 percent by 2013. The main factors driving these
favorable dynamics are: (1) real GDP growth projected to increase to 6–7 percent over the
medium term; (2) a projected positive growth- interest rate differential; and (3) an expected

38
increase in non-debt-creating capital
inflows. The favorable trend in external
debt may be reversed if these positive
developments do not occur.

6.
External debt sustainability is
most vulnerable to shocks to the
exchange rate. A one-time 30 percent real
exchange rate depreciation would raise the
debt ratio by around 16 percentage points
in 2009, with the impact declining to
around 11 percentage points over the
baseline by 2013.

ANNEX II. INDONESIA: WORLD BANK RELATIONS
(As of June 20, 2008)
Indonesia Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
The World Bank’s CAS for Indonesia was extended by one year to FY08 (from July 2007
to June 2008) to coincide with Indonesia’s scheduled graduation from IDA funding. The
Bank Group’s strategy remains strongly aligned to that of the government. The CAS
addresses the two fundamental problems impeding rapid poverty reduction: (i) a weak
investment climate and (ii) the lack of quality service delivery to the poor. Both of these
challenges, in turn, arise from the same fundamental cause—weak governance. In addition,
the significant expansion of the Bank program and quick redeployment of resources to postdisaster efforts (notably in Aceh and Yogyakarta/Central Java) in the context of perennial
natural disasters call for a greater emphasis on natural disaster management. Lastly, given the
good track record of reform, continued financing need, solid macroeconomic indicators, and
improved creditworthiness, the CAS supports the request by government to recalibrate
assistance toward more program lending, namely the on-going Development Policy Lending
(DPL) series and the Infrastructure DPL.
A new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), which reflects Indonesia’s transition from
IDA to middle income country status, is currently under preparation and is expected to go to
the Board in second half of 2008. The CPS will focus on improving Indonesia’s institutions,
both at the central and sub-national level, through six core areas of engagement: private
sector development, infrastructure, poverty reduction, education, climate change and natural
resource management, and disaster mitigation and recovery.
World Bank Engagement: Selected Highlights
Improving the Climate for High Quality Investment: The DPL program, coupled with
targeted projects, a large AAA program, and IFC interventions are supporting policy and
institutional reforms for higher growth. Reforms supported by DPLs have helped consolidate
macroeconomic stability; enhanced competitiveness of the financial sector; streamlined
procedures for business start-up, trade, and customs; improved tax administration; and
promoted SMEs. A robust dialogue on infrastructure provision is addressing a key constraint
to growth. Key issues being addressed through TA include regulatory reforms, new
legislation, risk management, and PPP. A strategy to mobilize long-term private financing
through NBFIs has been developed and a project establishing infrastructure and guarantee
funds is currently under preparation. The IFC has complemented Bank work in several of
these areas, including local financing of infrastructure, business licensing, and SME
development. Bank Group activities have focused on the rural investment climate, with a set
of projects to help modernize services to farmers and fishing communities and to address

4

related issues on water management, agricultural services, agribusiness, land titling,
irrigation, and coral reef protection.
Making Service Delivery Responsive to the Poor: Bank efforts have strongly supported
improvements in quality and equitable access to education, water and sanitation (WSS), and
health services. Activities have focused on strengthening capacity and systems, and changing
the way services are managed and delivered top-to-bottom to improve results. Financial
support in education targets the full range of issues from early childhood development (ECD)
to tertiary education. The Bank has supported an education sector review and the
development of a comprehensive national medium-term strategy (RENSTRA) covering all
levels of education, formal and non-formal. A series of Provincial Health Projects (PHPs)
were designed to help clarify the roles of different levels of government. Interventions have
also aimed at district health administrations’ capacities and making service planning and
delivery more participatory and accountable. The focus is on areas where indicators lag
behind neighboring countries: maternal and child health, and nutrition. CDD approaches in
WSS and the GEG program seek to inculcate a more sanitary and healthier environment. The
Bank is currently involved in the Government’s National Program of Community
Empowerment (PNPM) and a Conditional Cash Transfer Program. Several of these service
delivery efforts are also supported by a service delivery policy pillar within the DPL
program.
Addressing the Core Issue of Governance: The World Bank recognizes governance as the
most critical cross-sectoral issue and, hence, has positioned it at the core of the Bank’s work
program. The DPL program and particularly the Government Financial Management and
Revenue Administration Program (GFMRAP) are designed to improve public administration,
particularly in the area of public financial management. Along with well targeted
interventions, such as Public Expenditure Reviews, trust funded programs supporting
corruption prevention and civil service reform, the relatively large CDD portfolio are
resulting in progress toward strengthening accountability, functional streamlining and
modernization of processes both at the national, subnational, and community levels. Via the
multi-donor Decentralization Support Facility (DSF), the Bank works with other donors to
improved decentralization and donor effectiveness.
Program for the Recovery of Aceh and Nias: The Bank is deeply engaged in the recovery
of Aceh and Nias, with a focus on post-tsunami reconstruction, institution building,
analytical support and monitoring of progress. The Bank has mobilized an Aceh
reconstruction program substantial in scope and objectives. The Bank has played a vital role
in putting in place key elements for the management of the reconstruction effort and
coordinating the response of the international community. Immediately after the tsunami, in
partnership with the Netherlands, the Bank established a multi-donor office in Banda Aceh,
and made the facilities available to all donors working in Aceh. The community based

5

housing approach deployed by the Bank in Aceh under the MDF housing project, has been
indicated by the Government of Indonesia as the model for the massive housing
reconstruction program in Yogyakarta and Central Java, following the May 2006 earthquake.
At the government’s request, the Bank has established the Multi-donor Java reconstruction
Fund (JRF), primarily supporting housing reconstruction with total value of pledge
US$79 million. Given Indonesia’s geographic location and vulnerability to natural disasters,
Disaster Management has become an important component of the Bank’s country strategy.
New Lending Operations: As of June 2008, the Bank’s active portfolio comprised
25 projects with a total net commitment of $2.7 billion and an undisbursed balance of
$1.7 billion. In FY07, in addition to the development policy loan, 7 projects were delivered
for a total lending volume of $1.2 billion. For FY08, $1.3 billion was approved, including the
Fourth DPL ($600 million), an Infrastructure DPL ($200 million), the BERMUTU education
project ($86 million), the Urban and Rural Community Empowerment projects
($409 million) and a GEF Geothermal project ($4 million). For FY09, two development
policy loans and projects in urban water, dams, roads, community empowerment, education,
youth employment, public finance management, and infrastructure financing are expected to
be delivered.
Analytic and Advisory Activities (AAA)
There is sustained Bank engagement in policy dialogue with GOI, on the direction and
substance of its economic, structural, and institutional reform agenda. The AAA program has
been organized around five “breakthrough” themes: (1) investment climate, (2) reducing
poverty, (3) improving decentralized service delivery, (4) improving governance, and
(5) progress and constraints in the recovery of Aceh and Nias. The “flagship reports” in
related areas, the stand-alone policy notes and think pieces, and day to day informal dialogue
between Bank staff and government counterparts, are providing support to GOI in making
informed policy choices and in defining the shape of supporting Bank programs.

ANNEX III. INDONESIA: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK1
(As of July 4, 2008)
Asian Development Bank (ADB) cumulative loans to Indonesia exceeded $22.5 billion at
end-December 2007. In 2007, the ADB approved a total of $950 million or 7.2 percent of
the total loans approved by the institution for the year. The assistance provided financing
mainly for three programs to accelerate progress towards achieving the Millennium
Development Goals in education and health and contribute to the poverty reduction agenda,
promote resilience of the financial sector, and to improve the investment climate, public
financial management, and public service delivery in Indonesia. It also covered a project loan
supporting government efforts to reduce and prevent malnutrition in Indonesia based on
strengthening community-based services, community empowerment, and social mobilization.
In 2006 the ADB Board endorsed the Indonesia Country Strategy and Program (CSP) 2006–
2009. The CSP aims to help the government achieve higher levels of pro-poor sustainable
growth and to enhance social development, with a key thematic focus on governance and
capacity development in all operations. Five areas of engagement were derived to address the
main constraints to development: improved infrastructure and infrastructure services,
deepened financial sector, improved decentralization, accelerated MDG achievement, and
strengthened environment and natural resources management. Since then annual public
sector lending and non-lending programs has been agreed with the government selectively
focusing on these areas of engagement.
Between 1967 and 2007, ADB also provided 491 Technical Assistance grants to Indonesia
amounting to $253.66 million. The TA grants were financed from ADB’s Technical
Assistance Special Fund, the Japan Special Fund, and other sources. In 2007, eight TA grants
amounting to $6.2 million was approved, and represented 2.5 percent of total TA grants
approved by ADB during the year.

ANNEX IV. INDONESIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES2
1.
Indonesia’s macroeconomic statistics and statistical base are broadly adequate to
conduct effective surveillance. Indonesia has been a subscriber to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since September 1996, observing most of the SDDS
requirements. Exceptions include the currency composition in the reserve template in the first
quarter of 2007, general government data for 2005, and the timeliness in the production index
data where short delays have occurred.
Real Sector
2.
The annual national accounts have 2000 as the base year. Quarterly GDP data are
published in a timely manner for both expenditure and production sides. The estimates are
based on a limited set of indirect indicators of uncertain quality. Some sectors are influenced
strongly by seasonality, and seasonally adjusted data are prepared but not published. In
addition, no survey of nonfinancial services is prepared. An economic census of businesses is
undertaken every 10 years, without updates in the intervening period. The household budget
survey does not cover higher income households. There are inconsistencies with the Bank of
Indonesia (BI) in imports and exports; and, with the Ministry of Finance (MoF) regarding
local government figures. The five-yearly input-output tables remove statistical
discrepancies, but there are large discrepancies in the intervening years. The Fund has
recommended: (i) development of a system to continuously update the census of businesses;
(ii) introduction of comprehensive annual establishment surveys for nonfinancial services
industries; (iii) publication of annual GDP estimates, including a time series of at least
20 years; (iv) development of a set of annual supply and use tables (SUTS) starting from
2000; (v) expedited conversion to the 1993 System of National Accounts; and (vi) enhancing
the convergence exercise on trade data with BI.
3.
Labor market data, including wages and employment, are available, albeit reported
with some delay, through the annual labor market survey (Sakernas) published by the Bureau
of Statistics. Data on minimum and maximum wages for the formal sector are also available.
Quarterly data are available on industrial wages, with some delay.

2

The section is based on a Detailed Assessment of Indonesia’s observance of the IMF’s Data Quality
Assessment Framework, prepared by STA in March 2005.

9

Public Finance
4.
Available government finance data suffer from a number of weaknesses, in terms of
classification, coverage, and timeliness. Data on budgetary central government were
available until recently with a one-month lag, but subnational (provincial and local)
government data are available only with a lag of two years, and the quality of this data is
variable. Problems in budget and accounting systems have been compounded by the recent
decentralization initiatives, which have shifted substantial resources to the subnational
governments. Substantial efforts are in train, and significant progress has been made to
overcome these problems, ranging from the planned adoption of advanced accounting and
statistical standards, to the introduction of best practice budget management processes, and
the development of computerized financial management information systems.
5.
Against this background, the MoF and the Ministry of Home Affairs are committed to
keeping the requirements of fiscal statistics at the forefront of ongoing fiscal reforms, so as to
make better statistical monitoring one of the goals of the current efforts. Reflecting the close
link between this major reform process and its impact on data reporting, it should be noted
that the one-month lag on central government reporting lengthened significantly, but only
temporarily, in the course of 2007 as a new revenue reporting system was put in place. This
should reverse itself as the reform is fully implemented. The coverage and timeliness of
public debt statistics is generally adequate; however, only limited information on contingent
liabilities is available. The new expenditure classification introduced in the 2005 budget, is
generally consistent with the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) on
functional codes and classification, although the data are compiled on a cash basis.
6.
The authorities have committed to adopting GFSM 2001 standards. To this end, the
Fund staff has recommended in the short term: (i) establishment of a register of all
extrabudgetary units to improve the coverage of central government activity; and
(ii) inclusion of the economic codes consistent with the GFSM 2001 in the chart of accounts
to ensure that general government units report in a statistically meaningful way all
transactions and balances over which they exert control. Over the medium-term, priority
should be given to (i) seizing the opportunity offered by the two new subnational fiscal
reform efforts to simultaneously establish the underlying reporting arrangements to obtain
timely preliminary data for local government statistics; and (ii) to develop GFSM 2001
operating statements, statements of sources and uses of cash, and partial balance sheets, all of
which should be published on the MoF websites.3

Monetary Accounts
7.
Good quality monetary statistics are compiled by the BI on a timely basis. With STA
assistance, BI has developed an integrated database from which alternative presentations of
monetary statistics can be drawn to meet the needs of BI and the Fund. Further work,
however, is needed to expand the coverage of depository corporations to include mutual
funds (REKSA DANA), which report data to BAPEPAM—an agency that supervises some
of the nonbank financial institutions. To this end, BI is currently developing institutional
data-sharing arrangements that would enable it to access the register of—and data on—
mutual funds.
8.
To strengthen monetary statistics, STA missions have recommended: (i) collection of
source data on mutual funds in a format that meets statistical requirements; (ii) expansion of
the coverage of the monetary statistics to include mutual funds; and (iii) harmonization of the
reported interbank positions between the BI and commercial banks.
Balance of Payments
9.
Trade data are affected by some shortcomings. While customs sources utilized by the
BI are considered generally reliable, coverage of merchandise trade flows is insufficient.
Also, when the online reporting system for exports and imports was introduced in 2004, the
historical series were reconstructed only as far back as 2003. As a result, prior to 2003
balance of payments statistics are not entirely consistent with the national accounts estimates.
Data on services suffer from outdated surveys and weak methodologies. The BI adjusts the
customs data to cover exports and imports of Batam and other bonded zones. Data on
services suffer from outdated surveys and weak methodology. Adjustments are also made to
data on compensation of employees and workers’ remittances to cover professional workers,
legal workers not reported to the Ministry of Manpower, and illegal workers.
10.
For the capital and financial account, the methodological basis for the compilation of
FDI data needs substantial improvement. Inflows are currently calculated based on loan
disbursements to companies that have foreign equity using a fixed ratio to estimate equity
inflows. Surveys conducted by BI to collect FDI data have a low response rate and the
coverage of the directory of enterprises should be improved. Other areas that need
improvement include the recording of trade credits and the asset data for portfolio investment
and other investment transactions. The magnitude of the errors and omissions item has been
significant and appears to be related to the methodology used, for instance, for unrecorded
assets in the financial account. Financial transactions data have not been reconciled with
changes in the International Investment Position (IIP).
11.
The BI has proposed a range of measures to address these weaknesses. On traderelated data, a working group has been established to reconcile differences between BI and

11

customs data. The BI is planning to collect and publish data on goods imported for
processing, goods procured in ports by carriers, and transactions with the oil and gas sector.
On the financial account, the BI is planning to collect and publish data on direct investment
abroad, portfolio investment assets, other investment assets, and trade credits, to help address
the shortcomings in the recording of private financial flows.
International Investment Position
12.
An annual IIP is compiled, but the underlying data are weak in several areas, notably
for FDI. External debt statistics have improved considerably with the introduction of an
External Debt Information System (EDIS) in 2002. The system records external debt of
government and over 800 other entities that report to the BI on a monthly basis. The system
generates data for public sector external debt and debt service, as well as those for private
banks, that are considered reliable. However, improvements are still needed with respect to
components of private corporate sector data, particularly in distinguishing between scheduled
and actual debt service, in estimating the accumulation/reduction of private sector payments
arrears, and in estimating rescheduling and debt reductions received by the private sector
from external creditors.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Indonesia
August 1, 2008
1.
This statement provides an update on recent economic developments based on
information received after the staff report was issued. The new information does not alter the
thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
High-frequency indicators suggest that economic activity remains firm despite
the rise in domestic fuel prices in May. Motor vehicle and motorcycle sales continued to
rise rapidly in June (by 38 percent (y/y) and 46 percent, respectively). Cement consumption
and investment imports remain strong as well, while exports have been growing by nearly
30 percent (y/y) in nominal terms. GDP growth in the second quarter is, therefore, expected
to have remained above 6 percent.
3.
Indonesian financial markets have strengthened in the last few weeks. Pressures
in the government bond market have eased, reflecting market expectations that inflation may
have peaked, a relatively positive budget outlook, and the favorable outcome of the sovereign
issue in June. Ten-year government bond yields have declined by 175 basis points from the
highs in mid-June, while the last bond auctions have attracted larger than expected demand.
Despite renewed strains in global financial markets, foreign ownership of SBI (central bank
notes) and SUN (government bonds) has increased by nearly $5 billion since mid-June,
contributing to an appreciation of the rupiah of around 2 percent against the dollar.
4.
The government presented an updated projection of the 2008 budget and
announced some key features of its draft 2009 budget proposal. The 2008 fiscal deficit is
expected to be 1.9 percent of GDP, slightly below the revised budget, on account of stronger
revenues and some cuts in expenditure. Nevertheless, energy subsidies are projected to reach
5.7 percent of GDP, compared to 4.2 percent of GDP in previous projections. The draft
2009 budget proposal, which will be submitted to parliament in August, envisages a lower
fiscal deficit of 1.5 percent of GDP, as tax revenues are expected to improve by
0.4 percentage points of GDP. The proposal aims at curtailing subsidized fuel consumption
through the kerosene-LPG conversion program, while increasing infrastructure and
development expenditure. The draft budget proposes a new revenue sharing mechanism with
the regions and incorporates contingencies to protect the budget in case oil prices reach
$160 p.b.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
Indonesia
On August 1, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the 2008 Article IV consultation with Indonesia. 1
Background
Since the conclusion of the last Article IV consultation in mid-2007, Indonesia’s growth
performance has remained strong despite the deteriorating global environment. Growth
of 6.3 percent in 2007, the highest growth rate in a decade, was driven by domestic
demand, both robust private consumption and a rebound in investment that included a
strong rise in foreign direct investment. While exports performed strongly, supported by
continuing demand for Indonesia’s commodities, the recovery of imports in the second
half of the year reduced the contribution of net exports to growth. The growth
momentum was maintained in the first quarter of 2008. As a result, poverty and
unemployment have declined significantly, though they remain high at 15.4 percent and
8.5 percent, respectively.
Nevertheless, new challenges have emanated from rising commodity prices.
Government bond yields have risen by about 250 basis points since end-February as
investor sentiment deteriorated due to surging fuel subsidies and inflation concerns.
Domestic fuel prices were subsequently increased by about 29 percent. Headline
inflation has accelerated to 11.0 percent at end-June, while core inflation reached
8.7 percent at end-May (latest available data), well above Bank Indonesia’s (BI) 4–6
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

2
percent target range for end-2008. After lowering interest rates to 8 percent and then
holding them unchanged since late 2007, BI hiked rates three times since May by a total
of 75 basis points in response to rising inflation. Nevertheless, the real policy interest
rate calculated on the basis of core inflation has been declining over the year and is
currently around zero. Meanwhile, uncertainty remains as international oil and food
prices have continued to rise, global growth is expected to slow in 2008.
The external position remains generally strong. Staff estimates that the real exchange
rate is moderately undervalued. Nevertheless, the nominal effective exchange rate
(NEER) depreciated further (by 10 percent) in 2007, which likely contributed to
inflationary pressures, while Indonesia accumulated US$14 billion of reserves. However,
in 2008 BI has slowed the accumulation of reserves and the NEER has remained stable.
While the current account recorded a surplus of 2.5 percent of GDP in 2007 supported
by gains in the price of major commodity exports, there have been some episodes of
capital outflows and external financing conditions have tightened somewhat as a result
of the global financial market turmoil.
Fiscal performance has been strong despite rising fuel subsidies. Energy subsidies rose
to 3 percent of GDP in 2007 (almost a third of total current spending). Nevertheless, the
fiscal deficit was contained to 1.2 percent of GDP, well below the government’s target.
Revenue performance was buoyant, with an across the board surge in non-oil and gas
revenue being a testament to both the underlying strength of the economy and payoff
from ongoing reforms in tax administration. Budget execution has also improved
noticeably, in particular in the area of development expenditure.
Indonesia’s financial sector has displayed resilience in the face of the global credit
market turmoil. Several factors have limited the transmission of global financial shocks,
including (i) reduced external vulnerabilities, (ii) low exposure to structured credit and
derivative products, (iii) ample domestic liquidity, and (iv) relatively low reliance on
external financing. Financial soundness indicators have improved, with banking sector
profitability increasing, and gross non-performing loans (NPLs) declining to 4 percent
amid strong private credit growth. The stock market index remains about 6 percent
above the level at end-June 2007. Nevertheless, volatility has increased, and since endFebruary, Emerging Markets Bond Index (EMBI) and Credit Default Swaps (CDS)
spreads have widened more than in other emerging market countries and the
government bond market came under stress in March, reflecting largely investors’
concerns about inflation and fuel subsidies.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the resilience of the Indonesian economy to the global
slowdown and financial market turmoil, underpinned by strong macroeconomic
fundamentals and the highly liquid and well-capitalized banking system. Robust
domestic demand and buoyant exports supported by high commodity prices have
contributed to this commendable performance, and are expected to continue to sustain
the growth momentum. Downside risks are associated with a less favorable external
environment, a possible slump in commodity prices, and remaining vulnerability to
spikes in global risk aversion and contagion from other emerging markets.

3
Directors saw as a key immediate challenge the need to rein in the inflationary
pressures stemming from the large increases in food and fuel prices and strong
domestic demand. They welcomed the recent increases in interest rates, and
considered that further monetary policy tightening will be needed to put inflation back on
a firmly declining path. Directors encouraged the authorities to continue to strengthen
the inflation targeting framework, through effective communication, publication of
inflation forecasts, and a strong commitment to the medium-term targets. They agreed
that the shift of the operational target to the interbank overnight rate has been managed
well and will enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy.
Directors considered Indonesia’s flexible exchange rate policy appropriate. Noting the
staff’s assessment that the real effective exchange rate may be somewhat undervalued,
Directors welcomed the new policy of increased reselling of oil receipts, which should
help strengthen the currency and support monetary policy in dampening inflationary
pressures. They underscored that such a policy should be pursued with care to avoid
creating perceptions of specific exchange rate targets. At the same time, efforts should
continue on the structural front to strengthen external competitiveness. While reserve
levels are broadly adequate, some additional accumulation over the medium term could
further reduce vulnerabilities.
Directors welcomed Indonesia’s strong fiscal performance. They considered the fiscal
stance appropriate and consistent with a substantial reduction of the public debt burden.
Directors commended the authorities for addressing the challenge of energy subsidies
through the recent fuel price increase, accompanied by cash transfers to the poor.
Going forward, Directors encouraged the authorities to move toward an automatic fuel
price adjustment mechanism, which would be the preferred solution to ensure fiscal
space for capital and social expenditures and guard against emerging concerns about
the sustainability of subsidies. In the interim, further ad-hoc adjustments would help
reduce the cost of fuel subsidies. Directors welcomed the progress made in public
finance reforms, and looked forward to the completion of the pending reforms of the tax
system and tax administration. To further enhance fiscal transparency, the authorities
were encouraged to consider participating in the Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative.
Directors observed that Indonesia’s banking system remains relatively resilient to
macroeconomic shocks and exchange rate risks. They agreed that the rapid credit
growth calls for close monitoring and strict adherence to prudential regulations in line
with international standards. Directors supported the planned gradual transition to Basel
II, and welcomed the review of the financial safety net, with a view to ensuring timely
responses in case of a crisis. They looked forward to Indonesia’s early participation in
the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP).
Directors welcomed progress toward implementing structural reforms over the past year.
Further efforts will nevertheless be needed to achieve higher sustainable GDP growth,
aimed particularly at improving the business climate and accelerating infrastructure
development. In that regard, Directors viewed the recently announced policy packages
as a welcome signal of the authorities’ intention to press ahead with the structural
reform agenda.

Statement by Perry Warjiyo, Executive Director for Indonesia
and Juda Agung, Advisor to Executive Director
August 1, 2008
1.
On behalf of the Indonesian authorities, we would like to express our appreciation
to the staff for their constructive policy dialogue during the 2007 Article IV Consultation and
for their balanced report and relevant Selected Issues paper. The Indonesian authorities
broadly agree with general thrusts of the staff’ assessment of the Indonesia’s economic
performance and their policy suggestions to maintain macroeconomic stability and sustain
the growth momentum in the face of current deteriorating global environment.
2.
The Indonesian economy and financial system have weathered remarkably
well against the on-going high oil and food prices and current global economic
slowdown. The authorities have taken bold measures to adjust their economic policy mix to
maintain macroeconomic stability and growth momentum. To secure fiscal sustainability and
at the same time allow the needed fiscal space, domestic fuel prices were raised to cut
subsidies, accompanied by well-targeted social transfers and reinforcing current expenditure
restraints to improve efficiency in the public sectors. The central bank has pre-emptively
raised its policy interest rate to curb inflation expectations and the second-round impacts of
domestic fuel price increase. At the same time, the structural reforms are moving forward to
improve the quality of economic growth through improvements in the investment climate,
acceleration of infrastructure development, and strengthening financial system stability.
Recent Updates and Outlook
3.
In 2007, the Indonesian economy has recorded the highest performances for
the first time since the Asian crisis. The economy grew at a record high of 6.3 percent,
while inflation remained within the target range of 5-7 percent. The growth has been broad
based, with a substantial acceleration of investment and buoyant consumer demand,
particularly driven by reform progress, improved business perception and purchasing power.
The government budget deficit was well contained at 1.3 percent of GDP, while the debtGDP ratio continued to decline rapidly, falling to around 30 percent by the end of 2007.
Balance of payments continued to record significant surpluses, contributing to international
reserves of US$ 59.5 billion at end-June 2008, equivalent to 5.1 months of imports and
external public debt services.
4.
Going forward, given the slowdown in the global economy and continued high
commodity prices, the economy would moderate slightly in 2008 and 2009. Our
authorities are, however, confident that the economy will continue to hold up the global
slowdown reasonably well, with growth projected to around 6 percent for 2008 and return to
6.3 percent in 2009. High commodity prices would remain a key driver of Indonesian
exports, while in the domestic side, the rapid credit expansion and the better investment
climate will continue to boost the domestic consumption and investment. Indonesia's balance

2
of payments is expected to remain strong, giving positive impacts on exchange rate stability.
Like staff, the authorities see containing inflation and managing the fiscal impact of high oil
prices continue to be the immediate key policy challenges. However, our authorities believe
that inflationary pressures will ease and return into the range of 6½ -7½ percent in 2009
following the monetary tightening supported by the on-going fiscal and structural measures.
Fiscal Policies and Reforms
5.
The 2008 revised budget centers on safeguarding fiscal position from
escalating fuel subsidies while continue to creating fiscal space for growth. On the
revenue side, the fiscal reforms that have been progressing well over the past years have
yielded the needed increases in tax and non-tax revenues as well as dividend from SOE’s.
Nonetheless, measures on spending are also needed, and indeed our authorities have taken
bold measures to reprioritize expenditures and improve their efficiency. Expenditures of
government agencies and line ministries were cut by as much as 10 percent while at the same
the authorities introduced an energy saving program, improved efficiency in Pertamina and
PLN, and retained the policy for food subsidies for the poor. Additionally, steps were taken
to accelerate the transfer from highly subsidized kerosene to less subsidized LPG.
6.
A bolder step was taken by raising the domestic fuel prices in May 2008. While
this move is essential to maintain the credibility of the budget, it is also aimed at creating
fiscal space for priority spending on infrastructure and social programs. To cushion the
impact of higher fuel prices on the most vulnerable groups, the authorities re-implemented
the targeted cash transfer program. Moving forward, while our authorities share the staff’s
suggestion on the need to gradually eliminate the fuel subsidies in the long-term, they see
that it is politically not feasible in the short run given next year’s election. Meanwhile, in
transition towards market prices, the government is considering introducing a mechanism for
limiting consumption of subsidized fuels. Along with further steps to improve expenditure
efficiency and revenue enhancements for the remainder of this year, the government is
confident that the deficit for fiscal year 2008 can be contained at 1.9 percent of GDP, lower
than that approved in the revised budget. Looking ahead, the 2009 budget will remain
prudent with a deficit expected at around 1.5-2.0 percent of GDP, which is consistent with
the declining path of public debt and growth target of 6.0-6.4 percent.
7.
Reforms for strengthening public financial management have continued
progressing well. As well documented in the Selected Issues Paper, the reforms to improve
the efficiency and effectiveness of fiscal institutions have been successfully completed.
Further reforms in the fiscal area are continuously underway. They include comprehensive
tax administration reforms through establishing small taxpayer offices, modernizing tax and
custom administrations with the use of IT, and bureaucracy reform in tax offices and
customs. A national single windows system in the customs was introduced to expedite the
processing of both import and export documents. This is also complemented by a provision

3
of fast track facilities for importers and exporters with a good track record in regulatory
compliance.
Progress towards implementation of a treasury single account is also encouraging. On the
fiscal transparency, the government started to publish a fiscal risk statement in the 2008
budget document, making Indonesia one of the pioneers in fiscal risks analysis among
emerging market countries.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
8.
Bank Indonesia (BI) has shifted to tightening monetary policy mode to preemptively contain the inflationary pressures. In fact, BI has raised its policy rate by 75 bps
from 8 to 8¾ percent since May 2008. The major sources of inflation in 2008 are the impacts
of the increases in domestic fuel and food prices. However, the central bank is also
monitoring closely inflationary pressures stemming from domestic demand as well as from
inflation expectations following the second round effects of fuel price increase. BI will stay
the course and stand ready to adjust its policy interest rate consistent with the aim to bring
down the inflation towards a designated range of target in 2009. BI shares the staff’ view not
to revise the inflation target for 2008, but intends to make a public statement on the missed
target.
9.
To strengthen the monetary policy effectiveness, BI has steadily improved its
operating framework with an expanded range of monetary instruments and
strengthened communication and transparency. Since June 2008, the central bank
changed its monetary operational target from 1 month Bank Indonesia Certificate (SBI) rate
to the overnight inter-bank rate. Available monetary instruments have been supplemented by
the launching of fine tune operations (FTOs), narrowing implicit standing facility, and
progressive improvements in liquidity projections and management. Indeed, with the new
operating framework, the interbank interest rate has increased by 400 bps since December
2007, further reinforcing the tightening monetary policy mode that BI has adopted. To
strengthen the credibility of monetary policy, BI has revamped its monetary policy
communications and transparency with the use of press releases and publication of monthly,
quarterly and annual economic reports, while also holding seminars and discussion programs.
10.
With regard to exchange rate policy, our authorities remain committed to a
flexible exchange rate regime. In this regard, exchange rate movements are mainly
determined through market mechanisms. As such, the current level of exchange rate is
considered appropriate and relatively consistent with the fundamentals. Interventions in the
foreign exchange market are confined to smoothing abrupt movements in the exchange rate
without targeting any specific exchange rate level. In this context, the recent recycling
official foreign exchange receipts is aimed to limit the exchange rate volatility, particularly
when the supply of foreign exchange in the market is limited. Our authorities have taken note
the staff’s suggestion to adopt an automatic mechanism for recycling foreign exchange

4
receipts, but they view that such a rule-based intervention would not be appropriate under the
current condition of the foreign exchange market in Indonesia.
Financial Sector Issues
11.
Indonesian financial sector is resilient and well placed to weather the current
global turmoil. Financial soundness indicators show that the banking system has performed
favorably, with strong credit growth, well-capitalized, and liquid. Despite the strong credit
growth, the loan quality continued to improve, with NPL falling to 4% in May 2008. The
authorities’ recent stress-test confirms that in general bank capital is strong enough to
overcome the various simultaneous shocks, including interest rate increase, exchange rate
depreciation, a fall in the government bond prices, and rising NPLs. Non bank financial
institutions and capital markets continued to grow amidst pressures stemming from global
market fallouts. Looking forward, our authorities remain vigilant, particularly over the rapid
growth of consumer loans and will continue to monitor closely.
12.
Our authorities have taken further steps to strengthen institutional aspects of
the banking system aimed at building the resilience of the banking system in the face of
global competition. BI continues to play a facilitating role in the merger process for the
banking consolidation program, particularly for systematically important banks. Steps have
also been taken by the central bank to accelerate development of financial markets and
instruments in order to create a sound, robust financial sector. Moving ahead, the authorities
are planning to gradually implement Basel II in 2008 with a differentiated pace across banks.
On the bank governance, banks are required to be fully compliant with good corporate
governance (GCG), including disclosure of their GCG in reports to the public. At the same
time, the central bank requires banks to enhance transparency of their banking products
towards the public.
13.
To strengthen coordination among agencies in a crisis management, our
authorities are planning to enhance legal aspects of financial crisis management. The
draft of Financial Safety Net Act as a legal basis for bank resolution is being prepared by the
authorities. The authorities are also preparing a financial crisis management protocol that
outlines procedures and clarifies the responsibility of agencies in the event of financial crisis.
In addition, coordination among financial agencies will be improved by strengthening the
role of the Financial Stability Forum.
Structural Reforms
14.
Reforms for improving investment climate remain the government’s top
priority. Following the implementation of the government’s comprehensive June 2007
economic policy package, business perceptions of Indonesia’s investment climate have
shown some improvements, as reflected in the stronger growth of investment.[1] To further

5
expedite private investment and spur economic growth, our authorities recently issued a new
policy package on investment climate, acceleration of infrastructure development,
empowerment of small medium enterprises, and financial sector development. Other key
policies in the package include improvement of the management of the country’s natural
resources, environment, and agriculture sector, and reform of labor and transmigrations. The
policy package also addresses energy supply, upgrading infrastructure, and speeding up the
preparations toward ASEAN economic integration.
Conclusion
15.
The Indonesian economy has shown strong performance, with high growth
and sound macroeconomic stability, despite the current unfavorable global economic
environment. While this remarkable performance has been attributed to sound
macroeconomic policies and continued reforms over the past years, the authorities are
determined that further broad based reforms are needed to secure the high quality and
sustainable growth path over the medium term. In particular, our authorities underscore the
need to be more vigilant and stand ready to adjust their economic policy mix to ensure that
macroeconomic stability remain kept in check under the current challenging situations.
Finally, the Indonesian authorities remain committed to transparency and consent to the
publication of the staff reports, with necessary deletions of market sensitive information.
[1] The recent World Bank’s business survey also suggests that business perceptions of investment climate in
Indonesia show some improvement in recent years, with significant improvement in the business perception on
policy predictability and macroeconomic stability.
