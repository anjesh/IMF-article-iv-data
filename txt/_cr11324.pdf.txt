STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 6, 2011

KEY ISSUES
Setting: Growth resumed in 2010 but is expected to remain modest both in the near
and medium-term due to lack of strong growth drivers to substitute for the decline in
agriculture and weak competitiveness.
Proceeding with fiscal consolidation: While appropriately supportive during the
crisis, fiscal policy is increasingly constrained by deteriorating debt dynamics. Staff
commends the authorities’ intention to start withdrawing the fiscal stimulus in the fiscal
year 2011, and underscores the need to sustain the adjustment effort to return to the
long-standing primary surplus target of 2.4 percent of GDP over the next few years.
Clear plans for achieving the target need to be formulated and should focus on reining
in current spending, safeguarding revenues, and ensuring sustainability of the
adjustment effort through structural reforms.
Safeguarding against financial stability risks: Tremors in the regional financial
systems, to which Dominica is heavily exposed, have underscored the need for
increased vigilance and close monitoring of the financial sector. Recent reforms have
gone a long way in this direction, but renewed efforts to identify and counteract
sources of risks in the banking and non-banking financial sector will be critical.
Improving growth prospects: To boost growth prospects and improve social
conditions, structural reforms should focus on increasing the country’s capacity to
attract private investment, especially through swift reforms of its regulatory
environment, and on creating fiscal space for a well-designed infrastructure investment
program.

the crisis has served the authorities well,
affording them room for supportive fiscal
policies during the crisis. Entering the crisis
with a relatively strong fiscal position—a
primary surplus of 3¾ percent of GDP and a
debt of 72 percent of GDP—allowed the
authorities to inject a significant fiscal stimulus
during FY 2007–09 by: (i) doubling investment
spending relative to historical averages, first

The high unemployment rate reflects in part the
inclusion of discouraged unemployed in the labor force,
similar to the practice in many ECCU countries, but
contrary to the more generally-accepted definition.
Excluding discouraged persons from the labor force
reduces estimated unemployment to about 10 percent in
2009.

POST-CRISIS POLICY CHALLENGES
Against the background of an incipient recovery, poor growth prospects and a weakened
fiscal position, discussions focused on key challenges going forward: (i) withdrawing the
fiscal stimulus and returning to fiscal sustainability, while preserving space for needed
infrastructure investment; (ii) ensuring that weaknesses in the financial system do not
pose a threat to macrostability; and (iii) boosting the country’s growth prospects.

The triennial negotiations of public sector wages for the
period FY 2009–11 concluded only partially in September
2010, when the unions accepted a 3 percent increase
corresponding to FY 2009. A retroactive payment was
made in early 2011 covering the wage increase for the
period July 2009-December 2010. Negotiations for the
remaining two years are still ongoing, leaving open the
possibility for further wage increases.

crisis. The January 2009 collapse of the
regional insurance company CL Financial
Group has exposed Dominica to relatively
large potential losses.9 Latest estimates put the
net liabilities of the group in Dominica (after
accounting for loss provisioning) at about
11½ percent of GDP, the bulk of which are in
non-traditional insurance instruments
(“annuities”). These are not likely to have any
substantial backing either from existing assets

soundness indicators suggest that domestic
banks coped relatively well with the weak
macroeconomic environment. Modest credit
expansion prior to the crisis and ample
liquidity limited the accumulation of
nonperforming assets. This, together with
weaker provisioning against loan losses,
explains the resilience of banks’ capital ratios,
which strengthened to 10.3 percent by end2010, above the 8 percent minimum regulatory
requirement (although significantly below
average capitalization levels in the ECCU).

DOMINICA
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

July 6, 2011

Approved By

David Vegara and
Jan Kees Martijn

Prepared by the Staff of the International Monetary Fund in
consultation with the World Bank Staff

The rapid decline in Dominica’s public debt during 2001–08 has halted during the recent
global crisis, as fiscal policies turned expansionary in support of economic activity. In the
event, the underlying fiscal position has weakened and, in the absence of a stronger
adjustment effort, debt would decline only slowly over the medium term, from
67.3 percent of GDP in FY 2010 to below 60 percent in FY 2020. Given the country’s
vulnerability to external and natural disaster risks, this profile does not provide sufficient
assurances that debt would remain on a downward path under a series of plausible
shocks.
The debt outlook has deteriorated relative to previous assessments. For public debt, this is
due to a weaker fiscal position, and for external debt, due to a revision in the stock of
external debt and to weaker prospects for non-debt inflows to finance the large current
account deficit. The risk of public external debt distress, however, remains moderate as
most debt and debt service thresholds are respected in the baseline and stress scenarios.1

restructuring (2004), and concerted efforts to
shift public financing towards grant and
concessional borrowing—supported by two IMF
programs during 2002–06. As a result, debt
declined from 100 percent of GDP in mid-2002 to
67.3 percent in mid-2011, helped by primary
surpluses that averaged 3 percent of GDP over
the past eight years.3

management prior to the crisis allowed the

Debt composition. Dominica has never

accessed bond markets to date. About ⅔ of its
debt is held externally by multilateral and bilateral
lenders, with the remainder held largely by
Dominica Social Security, domestic banks, and
private individuals (Table 1). The composition of
debt has increasingly shifted towards bilateral
donors due to the growing role of China and
Venezuela, who hold slightly over 5 percent of
GDP in Dominica’s debt.

Of the three remaining holdout creditors that chose
not to participate in the 2005 debt restructuring until
end-2010, a telecommunications company has recently
accepted the terms of the renegotiation, with two more
holdouts (foreign banks) remaining. The government
continues its good-faith efforts to reach agreement with
these creditors and continues its practice of depositing
interest payments on the restructured terms into an
escrow account at the ECCB, to be paid out once these
creditors agree to the new terms.

Exchange rate arrangement: Dominica is a member of the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union,
which has a common central bank (the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank) and currency (the
Eastern Caribbean dollar). Since July 1976, the Eastern Caribbean dollar has been pegged to the
U.S. dollar at the rate of EC$2.70 per U.S. dollar. Dominica has accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4, and maintains an exchange rate free of restrictions on the
making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.

Based on existing use of resources and present holdings of SDRs.

Safeguards Assessment: Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the Eastern
Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), of which Dominica is a member, is subject to a full safeguards
assessment under a four year cycle. The most recent assessment was completed in July 2007,
and concluded that the ECCB continues to have appropriate control mechanisms in place, which
have strengthened since the first safeguards assessment completed in 2003. ECCB management
places emphasis on good governance and sound controls, and has enhanced the bank's
transparency and accountability since the last assessment, including the publications of financial
statements that comply with International Financial Reporting Standards. The assessment made
some recommendations to sustain the ECCB's safeguards framework going forward.

VIII.

Article IV consultation: The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board
on May 10, 2010; the relevant document is IMF Country Report No. 10/261. Dominica is on a
12-month cycle.

IX.

Technical assistance: Dominica has received significant technical assistance from Caribbean
Regional Technical Assistance Center (CARTAC) and the IMF. Technical assistance missions
focused on tax reform, revenue administration, expenditure rationalization, financial sector, and
Public Financial Management (PFM):

FSAP: A joint IMF/World Bank team performed an assessment of the financial sector of the
member states of the ECCU, in two missions—September 1–19 and October 20−31, 2003. The
principal objective of the missions was to assist the authorities in assessing the development
needs and opportunities for the financial sector and identifying potential vulnerabilities of
financial institutions and markets to macroeconomic shocks, as well as the risks to
macroeconomic stability from weaknesses and shortcomings in the financial sector. A detailed
assessment of the AML/CFT regimes of Dominica was conducted in September 2003 by the
Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF). The Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA)
was discussed by the Executive Board on May 5, 2004, and subsequently published on the IMF’s
external website, including the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) on
Banking Supervision.

DOMINICA

APPENDIX III. DOMINICA: RELATIONS WITH THE
CARIBBEAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (CDB)
(As of December 31, 2010)
The CDB has played a significant role in
Dominica’s development process. Bank
support has been provided through the
provision of investment loans and technical
assistance grants, as well as special economic
stabilization loans during a crisis in 2003–2004.
The Bank has also extensively utilized its Basic
Needs Trust Fund for poverty reduction
interventions. These resources have gone
towards boosting the productive capacity of
the economy, strengthening human resource
development and, in particular, improving
economic management systems, expanding
agricultural output, improving critical
economic infrastructure, upgrading ecotourism
sites, promoting shelter development and
supporting development in the territory
reserved for Dominica’s indigenous people,
the Kalinago. Disaster rehabilitation works
have also been a frequent element of
interventions.
Total loans and grants approved over the
period 1970–2010 amounted to
USD205.4 million, making Dominica the eighth
largest beneficiary among the Bank’s
18 borrowing members. At end-2010, CDB’s
loan exposure to Dominica was
USD85.4 million, which represented
5.5 percent of CDB’s total disbursed debt

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

outstanding, down from 6.1 percent at
end-2009.
Following unusually high disbursements in
2003 and 2004, which represented CDB’s
support to Dominica during the crisis period,
lending to the country stagnated, with net
resource flows turning negative from 2006
(Table). This downtrend reflects some caution
on the part of the Dominican government to
borrow after a debt restructuring in 2004,
particularly as efforts to maintain prudent fiscal
policies and enhance debt sustainability have
been facilitated by strong inflows of grant
resources in recent years. However, positive
net resource flows from CDB to Dominica
resumed in 2010, amid reduced grant inflows.

reflecting the implementation of key

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation
with Dominica
On July 22, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Dominica, and considered and endorsed the staff appraisal without a
meeting.1
Background
Dominica has made significant progress over the past decade in strengthening its
macroeconomic policy management. Prudent fiscal management in the years leading up to the
crisis has served the authorities well, leading to primary surpluses that average 3 percent of
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) over the past eight years and to a significant reduction in public
debt, to about 67 percent by mid-2011. Social indicators have also improved, with a major fall in
unemployment and poverty levels, although these remain high at 14 percent and 29 percent,
respectively, as of 2009.
Dominica is emerging from the crisis. The decline in global activity led to a relatively mild
contraction due to a strong countercyclical fiscal response and limited reliance on tourism.
Growth turned positive in 2010, but tepid demand and the needed fiscal consolidation will weigh
on the near-term prospects, with activity projected to growth at 0.9 percent in 2011. Near-term
risks to growth are tilted to the downside on account of a potentially stronger impact of a slowing
demand in advanced economies and weaker performance in agriculture, manufacturing and
trade.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board.

2
High world commodity prices are expected to put some pressures on inflation and the balance
of payments in 2011, but these should be manageable and should subside in line with world fuel
and food prices.
The financial system has weathered the crisis, although tremors in the regional financial
markets, to which Dominica is heavily exposed, have heightened solvency and liquidity risks.
Modest credit expansion prior to the crisis limited the accumulation of nonperforming loans and
preserved capital ratios, but the financial system remains exposed to the failed regional
insurance companies, other impaired investments in the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union
(ECCU), and potential spillovers across segments of the financial system.
With regard to macro policies, the weakening of the fiscal position during the past two years is
set to reverse in fiscal year (FY) 2011 that started in July. The proposed budget for FY 2011
targets a primary balance of 0.6 percent of GDP, an adjustment of almost two percentage points
of GDP, the brunt of which falls on investment. As the achievement of the budget target hinges
critically on the ability to raise revenue from house sales, which has proven difficult in recent
years, staff projects that under current policies the primary balance would remain marginally
negative in FY 2011 and debt will remain broadly unchanged in GDP terms.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2011 Article IV consultation with Dominica, Executive Directors endorsed
staff’s appraisal, as follows:
Dominica has managed the crisis well, but the recovery has been lackluster and growth
prospects remain weak. The fiscal stimulus during the crisis helped the country avoid a deep
recession, but tepid demand in advanced countries (Dominica’s main tourist source), weak
competitiveness and lack of clear growth drivers have led to a slow recovery and will constrain
future growth.
While appropriately supportive during the crisis, fiscal policies need to be returned to a sounder
footing to correct the weakening fiscal position. Staff welcomes the authorities’ plan to start
withdrawing the fiscal stimulus in FY 2011 but underscores the importance of a close monitoring
of fiscal developments with a view to ensuring that the budget’s primary deficit target of
0.6 percent of GDP for FY 2011 will be achieved. Given weakening revenues, staff believes that
achieving the authorities’ target will necessitate additional fiscal measures beyond those
envisaged in the budget. In this context, staff urges the authorities to contain the growth in
current spending, as this reduces space for investment critical for future growth and makes
further fiscal corrections more difficult in light of the likely permanent nature of the spending
increase.

3
The adjustment effort will need to continue over the next few years, as debt levels remain
uncomfortably high and current policies do not provide sufficient assurances that debt would
remain on a downward path given the country’s exposure to external and natural disaster
shocks. In this regard, staff welcomes the authorities’ commitment to the primary surplus target
of 2.4 percent of GDP by FY 2013 and encourages them to develop a clear plan for achieving it.
This long-standing fiscal objective has served the authorities well in the past and achieving it will
help put the public debt back on its downward path, preserve the hard-earned confidence in the
country’s fiscal management, and improve its ability to cope with future shocks. In this context,
staff suggests focus on reining in current spending, safeguarding revenues, and ensuring
sustainability of the adjustment efforts through structural reforms. Achievement of the FY 2011
fiscal targets will be an essential stepping stone and will boost fiscal policy credibility.
Increased vigilance is needed to safeguard against financial stability risks. Impaired investments
in the failed insurance companies and other regional institutions are creating solvency and
potential liquidity pressures. The authorities’ efforts to improve the regulation and supervision of
nonbank institutions are commendable, but renewed efforts to identify and counteract sources
of risks in the financial system are needed, including through (i) strengthened monitoring of
credit unions, and a stricter enforcement of the newly legislated provisioning and capital
requirements; and (ii) improved information-sharing arrangements with the Eastern Caribbean
Central Bank, the bank supervisor, to allow the authorities to monitor risks in the banking
system.
Improving growth prospects will require wide-ranging structural reforms. These should focus on
increasing the country’s capacity to attract and absorb private investments, especially through
swift reforms of the regulatory environment for investments. The upcoming review of the
government’s medium-term Growth and Social Protection Strategy will provide a good
opportunity to articulate a strong strategy of dealing with existing obstacles to growth.
Increased engagement with the Fund may be useful. While Dominica does not face an
immediate financing need, the narrowing space to handle economic and natural disaster shocks
and the need for policy correction suggest that such an engagement could be beneficial. Staff
indicated that it stands ready to engage should the authorities deem appropriate.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
