Sudan: 2007 Article IV Consultation and Staff-Monitored Program—Staff Report;
Staff Statement; Public Information Notice on the Executive Board Discussion; and
Statement by the Executive Director for Sudan
Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. In the context of the 2007 Article IV consultation and staff-monitored
program with Sudan, the following documents have been released and are included in this package:
•

The staff report for the 2007 Article IV consultation and staff-monitored program, prepared
by a staff team of the IMF, following discussions that ended on June 28, 2007, with the
officials of Sudan on economic developments and policies. Based on information available at
the time of these discussions, the staff report was completed on August 6, 2007. The views
expressed in the staff report are those of the staff team and do not necessarily reflect the
views of the Executive Board of the IMF.

•

A staff statement of September 4, 2007 updating information on recent developments.

•

A Public Information Notice (PIN) summarizing the views of the Executive Board as
expressed during its September 7, 2007 discussion of the staff report that concluded the
Article IV consultation.

•

A statement by the Executive Director for Sudan.

The policy of publication of staff reports and other documents allows for the deletion of market-sensitive
information.

Approved by Adam Bennett and Adnan Mazarei
August 6, 2007
Mission dates: June 13–28, Khartoum. The mission met with Mr. Ahmed Elhassan El Zubair
(Minister of Finance and National Economy), Dr. Mohamed Hassan Sabir (Governor of the Central
Bank of Sudan), other senior officials, and representatives of the business and donor communities.

attended the policy meetings.
Exchange system: Sudan accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 on
October 8, 2003, and has (until June 2007) maintained an exchange system that is free of restrictions
on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. On June 4, 2007, the
Central Bank of Sudan introduced a cash margin requirement on letters of credit and import credit
that constitutes an exchange restriction and multiple currency practice under Article VIII, Section 2(a)
and 3. Sudan has maintained a managed float exchange rate system since May 2003, and a de facto
peg since January 2007.
Fund relations: The Executive Board completed the 2006 Article IV Consultation on May 3, 2006.
The staff report and PIN were made available at: www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2006/cr06182.pdf
on May 24, 2006.
Fund surveillance: In recent consultations, the Fund’s advice has focused on fiscal prudence,
transparency, exchange rate flexibility, and structural reforms to reduce market rigidities and maintain
competitiveness. This advice has been partly followed. While Sudan did take some key fiscal
measures—such as reducing fuel subsidies—the overall deficit increased in 2006, largely due to
revenue shortfalls. The exchange rate was allowed to appreciate, but downward flexibility in the face
of shifting fundamentals has been lacking. Progress has been made on fiscal transparency, but some
major weaknesses remain. Reforms to ensure external competitiveness have been slow, but may
accelerate in line with a new 5-year plan.
Data: Bank of Sudan (http://www.bankofsudan.org), Ministry of Finance and National Economy
(http://www.mof.gov.sd/English/index.htm). Despite some weaknesses, data provision is adequate for
surveillance. Sudan participates in the GDDS.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
Sudan has maintained close cooperation with the Fund over the last eight years, as
evidenced by good performance under successive staff monitored programs (SMPs) and by
making payments in excess of obligations falling due. Performance under the 2006 SMP was
mixed, however, reflecting a number of new challenges to economic management, and some
weaknesses in the policy framework.
Macroeconomic imbalances emerged in the latter half of 2006 and early 2007.
Expansionary fiscal policy, combined with lower oil revenues, resulted in a buildup of
government arrears, a deterioration of financial sector indicators, and exchange rate
pressures.
Focus of discussions and main policy recommendations
The Article IV and SMP discussions focused on (i) policies to ensure macroeconomic
stability and growth; (ii) fiscal reforms to increase the revenue base; and (iii) financial sector
reforms to strengthen financial intermediation and increase investment. The main elements of
an 18-month SMP (July 2007–December 2008) are:
•

A tightening of the fiscal stance. The authorities agreed to reduce the 2007 fiscal
deficit by about 2 percent of GDP in the second half of 2007, to 3.8 percent of GDP.

•

A prudent monetary policy targeting single digit inflation, combined with
greater exchange rate flexibility. The central bank will limit foreign exchange
intervention and target an increase in international reserves.

•

Fiscal reforms to increase the revenue base and improve public finance
management. Critical measures to be implemented include: (i) establishing a
Treasury Single Account; (ii) enacting controls that limit expenditures; (iii) halting
the use of nontraditional forms of financing; (iv) adopting 2001 GFSM classification
for the 2008 budget; (v) reducing VAT exemptions and income tax holidays; and
(vi) improving tax administration.

•

Financial sector reforms to address current weaknesses and promote
development. In particular, an audit of Omdurman Bank will be done in preparation
for a resolution/restructuring plan for the bank.

The main risk remains waning political support for reforms, given Sudan’s concern with
the lack of progress on debt relief.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Sudan has maintained close cooperation with the Fund over the last eight years,
as evidenced by generally good performance under successive staff monitored programs
(SMPs) and by making payments in excess of obligations falling due. This positive track
record is notable given a rapidly changing economic landscape as well as international
political pressures associated with a post-conflict environment. Performance under the 2006
SMP was mixed, however, reflecting a worsening economic situation and weaknesses in the
policy framework.
2.
Sudan’s economy has significant potential if concerns related to policy
management and security can be improved. The major challenges discussed were:
(i) policies to ensure macroeconomic stability in the context of significant structural changes;
(ii) recent fiscal performance and the need for further reform of public financial management,
tax policy, and tax administration; and (iii) financial sector reform and development.
Agreement was reached on an 18-month SMP (July 2007–December 2008), which balances a
prudent macroeconomic framework with fiscal reforms to increase the revenue base, and
financial sector reforms to strengthen financial intermediation.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER THE 2006 SMP
3.
The Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) is being implemented, and
progress is being made in a number of key areas. Most of the commissions mandated in
the CPA have now been formed. However, three critical commissions—the National Human
Rights Commission, the Electoral Commission, and the Land Commission—have yet to be
created. Draft bills on these bodies will be discussed when the National Assembly
reconvenes in October. Importantly, the National Assembly recently passed legislation to
establish the National Audit Chamber. The nationwide exchange to a new national currency
(the Sudanese pound) was also largely completed as of end-June 2007 (a limited exchange is
available for a few additional months in remote parts of the country).
4.
Darfur remains Sudan’s single most difficult political issue. Recent developments,
however, suggest room for some guarded optimism. Sudanese negotiators agreed on June 12
in Addis Ababa to the deployment of the full 23,000 strong UN/African Union hybrid force
in Darfur. There remains the significant risk that this achievement will be short-lived if it is
not followed by domestic and international political dialogue to address the root causes of the
Darfur crisis.

services. However, the 12-month rate of inflation nearly tripled from 5.6 percent in 2005 to
15.7 percent in 2006. A substantial portion of the price surge was linked to an increase in
administered prices (fuels and transportation) in the third quarter of 2006. The rate of
inflation declined to 8–9 percent by February–March 2007 (largely due to a drop in food
prices), and has remained in this range through June.1
6.
Oil production was below target in 2006, and the performance of a new crude
(Dar blend) on international markets was initially disappointing. Average daily
production rose from 287,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2005 to 364,000 bpd in 2006. While
this increase in output was notable, it was well below projected levels of 492,000 bpd
envisioned at the beginning of the year. Technical problems delayed production of Dar blend
from new fields until the fourth quarter. Further, marketing problems with Dar blend (which
is highly acidic and difficult to process), resulted in substantial discounts in international
markets. Many of the technical problems continued into the first part of 2007, limiting
production and exports. By the end of the second quarter, however, key infrastructure
problems had been resolved, and Dar blend had found wider acceptance in international
markets, resulting in a substantial increase in price.2
7.
The fiscal position deteriorated substantially in 2006, reflecting mostly
revenue shortfalls. The overall deficit is estimated to have widened to over 4 percent of
GDP (2 percentage points higher than targeted in the revised 2006 SMP—Text Table 2).
Shortfalls in oil revenue played a key role. Non-oil revenues were also lower than projected,
however, due to administrative deficiencies and wide use of tax exemptions—notably in the

but declined to 6.3 percent by June 2007.

By May-June, the discount on Dar blend relative to dated Brent had narrowed from about US$34 per barrel (at
the beginning of the year) to US$25 per barrel.

(OSA), issuance of government bonds,
and central bank credit. The deficit on a commitment basis was larger due to accumulation of
arrears and the nonrecording of expenditure financed by the issuance of promissory notes
(“sanadats”). Some of the loss of fiscal discipline also appears linked to fulfilling
commitments under the various peace agreements in the absence of anticipated donor
funding.
8.
Many of the fiscal difficulties that emerged in 2006 carried over into the first
quarter of 2007. With continued difficulties in the production and sale of Dar blend, oil
revenues again fell short of projections. With expenditures remaining largely in line with the
budget, the overall deficit for the first quarter was roughly 6 percent on an annualized basis.
Critically, the shortfall in oil revenue is having a direct impact on the public finances not
only of the national government (the Government of National Unity—GNU), but also on the
Government of Southern Sudan (GOSS). Most of GOSS’s income derives from the share of
oil revenues accorded to the South under the Wealth Sharing provisions of the CPA. The
shortfall in production and export of Dar blend in the first quarter (relative to GOSS
expectations) has resulted in the emergence of a substantial deficit for GOSS and the need for
either considerable cuts in expenditure or additional donor financing.3
9.
The external current account worsened significantly in 2006, reaching a deficit
of roughly 13 percent of GDP. While exports of crude oil rose by some 70 percent in
volume terms, the extremely low price received for Dar blend resulted in an increase of only
24 percent in value terms. Nonoil exports, meanwhile, declined by some 11 percent in dollar
terms—with notable drops in cotton, gum arabic, and livestock products. The strong
appreciation of the dinar appears to have had some impact, but an increasingly costly
business environment also appears to have been a factor. Imports—particularly of capital
goods—surged over the course of the year, reflecting strong foreign investment and capital
spending. The large current account deficit contributed to a sharp drop in net international
reserves of the central bank, which fell by almost one-third (from US$1.9 billion at end-2005

to less than US$1.4 billion by end-2006). The loss in international reserves also resulted from
increased foreign exchange sales to mop up excess dinar liquidity associated with fiscal
expansion and the injections into state-owned Omdurman Bank, and to bring the dinar to a
soft landing after two years of steady appreciation.
10.
Monetary policy was largely accommodative during the first half of 2006, but
was tightened in the latter part of the year. Broad money growth (year-over-year) peaked
at 45 percent by July 2006—roughly in line with end-2005 levels. Growth of credit to the
private sector was notably more rapid, however, reaching almost 90 percent by July, which
added to pressure on prices and international reserves. Money and credit growth slowed
dramatically in the final three months of the year, however, due largely to corrective actions
by the central bank, a decline in deposits linked to the difficulties in Omdurman Bank, and
central bank sales of foreign exchange. Broad money growth ended the year at 27 percent,
while private sector credit growth declined to 45 percent. Data for the first five months
of 2007 show a continuation of this trend. Broad money growth as of end-May stood at
5 percent—the lowest level in more than five years—reflective of the continued drop in net
foreign assets. Private sector credit growth has also slowed further to 16 percent as of endMay (Figures 1 and 2).

within a very narrow range—and the exchange rate system is now a de facto peg. The
stability of the dinar relative to the dollar has been facilitated by continued ample sales of
foreign exchange by the central bank, leading to a further decline in net international reserves
to an uncomfortably low level of US$563 million (less than three weeks of imports) as of
end-May 2007 (Figure 3).
12.
Financial sector indicators (FSIs) have deteriorated markedly, reflecting fiscal
expansion, rapid credit growth, the accumulation of government arrears, and the
intervention of state-owned Omdurman Bank (Text Table 3 and Table 10). Although
banks’ capitalization levels remain above statutory requirements (set at 12 percent of riskweighted assets), financial soundness indicators have notably weakened. Additionally, due to
the existing low provisioning levels it is possible that banks are de facto undercapitalized.
Between 2005 and 2006, the ratio of nonperforming loans (NPLs) to assets almost tripled,
reaching a level of 19.4 percent at end-2006. In the first few months of 2007, NPLs rose
further and stood at 23.9 percent of loans in April 2007. Much of the downturn in FSIs is
linked to the state-owned Omdurman Bank.4 Prolonged mismanagement, regulatory

13.
Performance under the 2006 SMP was uneven—representing a break from
Sudan’s usual good track record. Two of the five quantitative targets (payments to the
Fund and the ceiling on nonconcessional borrowing) were met (Table 7). The remaining
three targets (net international reserves, net domestic assets, and domestic financing of the

government) were not met. A major factor in this regard was the need to meet commitments
under various peace agreements in the absence of disbursements from donors. Another factor
was a shortfall relative to projected revenues from oil exports. Most structural reforms under
the program were implemented, although some with delays. Only three of the benchmarks—
fiscal reporting on a GFSM 2001 basis, publishing of financial audits of state oil company
Sudapet, and formulation of a program to revamp investment incentives under the Investment
Encouragement Act—were not met (Table 8).
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Overview
14.
In light of the above issues, the discussions focused on (i) policies to ensure
macroeconomic stability and growth; (ii) short and medium-term reforms to improve public
financial management, tax policy, and tax administration; and (iii) financial sector reform
and development.
B. Macroeconomic Policies
15.
The economic outlook for 2007–08 should be favorable if recent imbalances can
be addressed, but would be subject to risk in the absence of substantial policy
adjustment. The macroeconomic framework envisages real GDP growth of about 11 percent
in both 2007 and 2008, and average inflation of 8 percent and 6.5 percent, respectively. With
the completion of a long-delayed marine terminal and pipeline, oil production and exports are
expected to pick up in the second half of 2007, bringing annual daily production above
500,000 bpd,6 with a modest increase to 565,000 bpd in 2008. Nonoil GDP growth is
expected to be in the range of 8 percent in 2007, reflecting government efforts to reign in the
fiscal deficit, the effects of lower credit growth, and some slowing of foreign investment.
Non-oil growth is projected to pick up again in 2008, however, assuming a resumption of
private sector credit, buoyant activity in construction and services, and a resumption of
foreign capital inflows.
16.
Fiscal adjustment is central to the government’s plan to ensure macroeconomic
stability and to address the imbalances that emerged in the last part of 2006 and
early 2007. The authorities are keenly aware of the impact that fiscal expansion has had on
inflation, and how nontraditional financing of the deficit (in the face of repeated revenue
shortfalls) has negatively affected corporate and banks’ balance sheets. The authorities
agreed on the need to more closely align expenditures with available resources, and in this
6

The program’s assumptions on production are somewhat conservative, and include an adjustor so that oil
revenues in excess of program would accrue to the OSA. If oil revenues are below program levels, the shortfall
will be compensated (to the extent that such resources are available) by drawing from the OSA, or otherwise
through a reduction in spending so as to maintain the fiscal deficit unchanged.

11
context the discussion centered on ways to bring the 2007 fiscal deficit to 3.8 percent of
GDP, compared with an estimated deficit under the approved budget of 5.6 percent of GDP
(see MEFP, ¶20). While this implies a significant of level adjustment, the program target still
allows for a 20 percent increase in nominal terms in primary expenditures (excluding interest
payments and the fuel subsidy), and protects spending related to government commitments
under the various peace agreements. Importantly, this target is consistent with a monetary
policy framework aimed at ensuring single digit inflation, and an acceptable level of nonbank
financing. A similarly prudent approach on the fiscal side is envisioned for 2008 (a deficit of
about 3 percent of GDP), while also allowing room for greater transfers to the states in
support of fiscal decentralization.
17.
Most of the fiscal adjustment is from expenditure cuts, but several revenue
measures are also being implemented. The authorities agreed to implement measures to
control expenditures and improve budget execution. They intend to reduce expenditures in
the second half of 2007 by 1.6 percent of GDP relative to the approved 2007 budget.7 There
was concern that further expenditure cuts could impact either the government’s commitments
under the peace agreements, or result in the accumulation of arrears. The government also
increased the VAT rate from 10 percent to 12 percent, effective June. The authorities also
agreed to reduce tax incentives/holidays in the context of the 2008 budget (see below and
MEFP, ¶21–23). The authorities also indicated their intention to hold off on any further tariff
reductions in 2007.8
18.
Monetary policy has sought to contain recent risks to macroeconomic stability,
but the limits and costs of the current strategy are recognized. Staff argued in this context
that macroeconomic and empirical analysis indicated that the dinar had become overvalued
by end-2006 (although more recent data suggest the degree of overvaluation has
diminished—see Box 1), and that greater exchange rate flexibility should have been allowed
to facilitate adjustment and protect reserves. The authorities highlighted that macroeconomic
stability is a relatively recent phenomenon in Sudan. They saw as critical the need to contain
the impact of fiscal expansion and the intervention of Omdurman bank, and ensure minimal
spillover onto inflation and the exchange rate. In this context, the central bank sold sufficient
foreign exchange to mop up domestic liquidity and to provide a soft landing for the exchange
rate after several years of steady appreciation (particularly given the introduction of a new
currency, which was completed in July 2007). The authorities viewed this strategy as largely
successful, but having come at the cost of lower net international reserves. Moreover, they

To meet the overall expenditure envelope, the authorities will restrain spending on goods and services
(0.3 percent of GDP), other current spending (0.4 percent of GDP), transfers to states (0.3 percent of GDP), and
capital spending (0.6 percent of GDP).

Staff will follow-up on a resumption of the tariff reduction program in the context of discussions on the 2008
budget.

Box 1. Resource Inflows, External Competitiveness, and the Exchange Rate
Oil has brought both benefits and challenges to Sudan. Government revenue and the balance of payments
have reaped considerable benefits from the oil sector in terms of exports, domestic sales, and related foreign
investment. The spending of these resources and the scale of investment, however, have led to upward
pressures on the real effective exchange rate (REER), which has appreciated by about 40 percent since
January 2005 (Figure 1). The flow of resources into Sudan is likely to continue over the medium term, and with
it the challenges of maintaining economic stability and promoting non-oil sector growth—both of which will be
critical in addressing widespread poverty and unemployment.

The value of the dinar has historically been closely tied to oil prices, but has recently deviated from this
trend. Sudan’s REER has been closely correlated with oil prices since the start of oil production (Figure 3).
This is consistent with typical models used to examine the real exchange rate for oil-exporting countries, after
accounting for Sudan-specific characteristics—such as the low-level of non-oil exports and the strong
correlation between oil prices and the non-oil fiscal balance as a share of non-oil GDP. Based on a simple
regression (which should be treated with caution given the small sample), the real effective exchange rate of the
dinar (dashed line in Figure 3) started to deviate from its historical trend (solid line in Figure 3) in the second
half of 2006. This was largely on account of higher inflation (relative to trading partners) and the continued
nominal appreciation of the dinar, and suggests that the dinar was likely overvalued by the end of 2006. Since
that time, however, the REER has moved back toward the implied trend (ie, the degree of misalignment has
declined) due to (i) a drop in inflation; (ii) a steady nominal rate vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar (a de facto peg since
January 2007); and (iii) rising oil prices. Figure 4 plots the deviation of the real exchange rate from the trend
against non-oil exports. The negative correlation suggests that the real appreciation of the dinar may have
negatively affected external competitiveness.

Increasing productivity will be key to ensure external competitiveness and non-oil growth. The World
Bank’s “Doing Business” (2006) survey highlights the difficulty with respect to hiring and firing, obtaining
credit, and enforcing contracts. Structural reforms to remove these rigidities will be necessary to increase
productivity and stimulate investment to ensure growth.

13
noted that the cash margin requirement on sight letters of credit was introduced primarily for
prudential reasons given the rise in NPLs, but also to more tightly limit the demand for
foreign exchange.
19.
Looking forward, it was agreed that rebuilding foreign exchange reserves should
be a priority (see MEFP, ¶17–18). The authorities recognized that international reserves of
the central bank had fallen to unacceptably low levels, and that rebuilding a sufficient
cushion should be a priority for 2007 and 2008. In this context, they agreed to target an
increase in net international reserves to US$1.3 billion (1.4 months of imports) by end-2007
and to US$1.8 billion (1.7 months of imports) by end-2008.9 The authorities also recognized
that exchange rate flexibility would be an essential element to this strategy, even if this
implied some depreciation. They agreed that the central bank should more closely limit its
interventions to servicing the market for current international transactions and smoothing
short-term volatility. In this context, the mission suggested greater use of indirect instruments
(GMCs and GICs), rather than sale of foreign exchange, to manage liquidity—consistent
with allowing for greater flexibility in the exchange rate. In this regard, the authorities noted
that central bank holdings of government securities are currently about two-thirds of excess
reserves, and that these instruments could be used for liquidity management purposes. The
authorities intend to remove the cash margin on sight letters of credit and import credits by
the end of 2007.
20.
Also critical from the authorities’ perspective was a monetary program that
allowed for a resumption of credit to the private sector. While aware of the need to
rebuild reserves, keep a lid on inflation, and reduce NPLs, the authorities stressed that it was
important to have greater liquidity available to the private sector—particularly given the
credit crunch evident in the first part of the year. In this context, the authorities agreed on
reserve money and broad money growth targets of 18 percent and 24 percent, respectively
(see MEFP, ¶18). The broad money target is consistent with projected economic growth,
inflation, and money demand growth resulting from issuance of the new common currency.
These targets will also allow for ample private sector credit growth (albeit less rapid than in
recent years) of near 40 percent by end-2007. The program for 2008, which will be discussed
in more detail in subsequent missions, targets reserve and broad money growth of 20 percent
and 25 percent, respectively.

9

Preliminary data indicate that the central bank began to accumulate reserves in June 2007.

14
C. Structural Reforms
Growth and external competitiveness
21.
Maximizing Sudan’s potential will require a balancing of macroeconomic
policies and structural reforms to ensure competitiveness, poverty reduction, and nonoil growth. Oil production, and accompanying capital inflows, have already had a significant
impact on the structure of Sudan’s economy, and brought new challenges to macroeconomic
management (Box 1). These flows are likely to be a feature of Sudan’s economic landscape
over the medium and long term. A commitment to fiscal prudence and a flexible approach to
exchange rate and monetary policy will help ensure macroeconomic and external stability,
but these policies must be complemented by attention to infrastructure, regulatory, and other
bottlenecks that may impede investment and non-oil growth.
22.
The authorities are aware of the challenges for medium and long-term growth,
and are committed to a process of review and reform. A new five-year plan (2007–11)
recently drafted by the National Council for Strategic Planning, highlights a number of areas
for attention. Key among them are: (i) physical infrastructure—particularly electricity and
transport; (ii) irrigation projects and prioritizing agriculture sector expenditures;
(iii) improving production and management processes in the agricultural and industrial
sectors to meet international standards; (iv) aligning training and education outputs to labor
market needs; (v) modernizing and developing the judicial system; and (vi) simplification of
administrative and legal procedures to facilitate domestic and foreign investment. The
authorities have also committed to producing a draft PRSP by March 2008.
Fiscal reforms
23.
A key pillar underlying the government’s fiscal reform effort is a set of measures
to improve public financial management. A significant amount of the financial stress
evident in late 2006 and early 2007 stemmed from the inability to adjust public expenditures
in the face of revenue shortfalls, and resort to nontraditional forms of public finance—
including issuance of promissory notes and the accumulation of arrears. The authorities
recognized the negative impact that these practices were having on growth, confidence, and
macroeconomic balances. They have started to implement measures to put public finances on
a firmer footing, and more closely align expenditures with available resources, including (see
MEFP, ¶21–23): (i) establishing a Treasury Single Account (TSA); (ii) enacting commitment
controls that limit expenditures by line ministries to monthly or quarterly cash plans;
(iii) halting the use of sanadats, standing orders, and other nontraditional forms of finance;
and (iv) adopting the full economic and functional classifications of the Government
Financial Statistics Manual (GFSM) 2001.
24.
Over the medium term, emphasis must be given to improvements in tax policy
and administration, with a view to creating a more stable revenue base and lessening
dependence on volatile oil earnings. Despite significant progress in tax policy and
administration in recent years, the authorities shared the staff’s view on the need to make
further improvements in these areas (Box 2), and agreed to broaden the tax base by reducing

15
VAT exemptions and income tax holidays. At the same time, the authorities believed that the
scope for a significant reduction in tax exemptions was limited as most exemptions were on
capital goods. Moreover, the authorities were concerned that eliminating tax incentives may
harm investment.
Box 2. Tax Reform in Sudan
Sudan has undertaken a number of tax reforms since 2000, including introduction of a VAT (2000),
imposition of an excise tax on benzene, and improvement of the tariff structure. As a result, tax revenue
rose from 5.8 to 8.6 percent of non-oil GDP during 2001–04. More recently, however, tax revenue fell to
7.4 percent of non-oil GDP

administration.
Tax policy is impacted by exemptions and incentives for businesses. Under the Investment
Encouragement Act (IEA), businesses can enjoy five- to ten-year exemptions (renewable) from the business
profits tax and customs in a large array of activities at an estimated cost of 2.0 percent of GDP. The VAT
exempts a wide range of goods at an estimated revenue cost of 1.2 percent of GDP. The personal income tax
(PIT) base is very narrow, with a large number of allowances. Almost all government employees and about
80 percent of private-sector workers are exempt.
A number of revenue administration reforms have been introduced, but challenges remain. Key
reforms included establishing the large taxpayer office (LTO)—which accounts for 70 percent of domestic
tax collection—and the medium taxpayers office (MTO); and raising the VAT threshold to SD 10 million.
On the other hand, the 2007 budget enacted a number of ill-advised tax measures. These include raising the
VAT rate on telecommunication services from 10 percent to 15 percent (which fragmented the VAT
system) and exempting agricultural inputs from custom duties.
Fiscal decentralization poses further challenges to tax policy and revenue administration. Greater
clarity is needed on assignment of tax authority and revenue collection between the GNU, the GOSS, and
the various state governments. For instance, the base of the PIT is not yet harmonized between the GNU
and the states. The assignment of customs collection authority at the borders needs to be clarified, as there
appears to be two different systems in place between North and South.
Addressing these challenges will require bold steps. In terms of tax policy, the authorities would gain by
replacing the incentives under the IEA with a system of accelerated depreciation, unifying the business
profit tax at around 20 percent, scaling back VAT and customs exemptions, and broadening the personal
income tax base. In terms of revenue administration, there is a need to restructure the network of tax
offices and establish a function-based headquarter structure; adopt a simple, transparent criterion for the
selection of taxpayers administered by the LTO and MTO; and improve compliance programs to support a
proper self-assessment system. Without these steps, current initiatives, such as major IT investments, could
fall short of the authorities’ objectives.

16
Financial sector reforms
25.
Continued financial sector reform and development is an essential pillar for
Sudan’s medium and long-term prospects. While progress has been made in deepening
financial intermediation, Sudan’s financial system remains relatively underdeveloped
(Box 3). In the short-term, improvements to ensure the soundness of the banking system will
likely dominate. Over the medium and long-term, however, there are a range of reforms that
Sudan could undertake to achieve a more efficient channeling of savings to investment, and
more closely integrate the financial systems of the North and South.
Box 3. Financial Sector Intermediation
Sudan’s financial system is relatively small
compared with countries at a similar level of
development (Table 1). There is no interbank
market; the equity and foreign exchange markets
are shallow, and nonbank financial institutions are
small. Sudan remains underbanked, given the low
ratios of deposits and credit to GDP. Only a small
share of the population has access to bank services,
and enterprises often face difficulties in obtaining
funding from banks or the capital markets.

The financial system is dominated by commercial banks, which accounted for 97 percent of the sector’s total

low level of competition, spreads and profitability indicators tend to be higher than in other economies.

deepening and facilitate Sudan’s financial

26.
The authorities agreed that there was ample room for modernization and
development of the financial system, and highlighted the progress that has already been
made in a relatively short period. Commercial banking only appeared in Sudan in
the 1960s, and almost entirely in the form of subsidiaries of foreign banks (with different
operating procedures and standards). In 1999, however, the Bank of Sudan launched a
comprehensive banking reform policy aimed at bringing the banking sector in line with
international standards, including the recommendations of the Basle Committee. Reforms

17
focused on capital adequacy, banking structure and improvement of human resources,
statistics and accounting, and bolstering the central bank’s supervisory capacity. Now
entering a second generation of reform, a second round of recapitalization is currently
underway, and additional reforms are focused on mergers, modernization of information
technology, development of an interbank market, building capacity for supervision of
conventional banking in the South, and implementation of the Islamic Financial Services
Board (IFSB) standards (equivalent to Basle II for Islamic banks).
27.
Regarding specific actions for 2007–08, an audit of Omdurman Bank will be
done by a local affiliate of one of the internationally recognized auditing firms. Based on
the findings of the audit, the central bank will prepare a plan for resolution/restructuring of
the bank (see MEFP, ¶25). Also, commercial banks are being required to submit wellspecified action plans to achieve compliance with existing regulations on capitalization and
provisioning.
D. External Debt and Relations with Creditors
28.
Sudan’s external debt overhang remains a serious concern. The end-2006 stock of
public and publicly-guaranteed debt is estimated at US$27 billion in nominal terms, up by
about US$9 billion since end-2000. The bulk of the increase reflects primarily a further
buildup of arrears (approximately US$6 billion) to Paris Club and non-Paris Club creditors. It
also includes new drawings of some US$520 million from Arab multilateral and bilateral
creditors, as well as from China and India. In NPV terms, the end-2006 stock of external debt
was equivalent to roughly 55 percent of GDP and 340 percent of exports. The authorities
expressed concern that, after nearly a decade of cooperation on policies and payments, no
concrete progress has been made on alleviating Sudan’s external debt burden—despite debt
relief provided to other countries in similar circumstances—severely limiting Sudan’s
prospects for meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
29.
A debt sustainability analysis (DSA) based on the joint Bank-Fund Low-Income
Country Debt Sustainability Framework was prepared and discussed with the
authorities. The results for the baseline scenario suggest that, even assuming prudent
macroeconomic policies and further increases in oil revenues, most of Sudan’s debt ratios
remain above the indicative thresholds for sustainability. Moreover, with its heavy reliance
on oil, Sudan is highly vulnerable to both oil production and price shocks. The analysis also
suggested that Sudan will be at a much lower risk of further debt distress if it curtails
recourse to any additional nonconcessional borrowing.
30.
The authorities agreed that they needed to minimize nonconcessional borrowing.
The authorities emphasized that contracting of such loans had been limited in recent years,
that these loans were principally in the form of supplier credits, and that they were generally
tied to specific development projects (Box 4). The financial implications will also be
monitored by the respective debt units of the Bank of Sudan and the Ministry of Finance and

18
National Economy. They authorities argued that limited fiscal space, the lack of access to
more traditional forms of concessional finance, and pressing development needs associated
with the various peace agreements and unification left nonconcessional borrowing as a
necessity. But they intended to limit contracting of nonconcessional borrowing to
US$700 million annually in 2007 and 2008 (see MEFP, ¶28).
Box 4: Nonconcessional Borrowing
Sudan has made recourse to nonconcessional financing in recent years mainly from China and India,
reflecting the limited access to concessional loans because of the difficulties in resolving its debt and
arrears situation. The authorities signed US$589 million and US$125 million of nonconcessional loans
in 2006 and the first quarter of 2007, respectively (Table).
Most of the contracted loans have been used to finance infrastructure and social development projects such
as power, water supply and transportation. Debt units at the central bank and the ministry of finance are in
charge of monitoring and compiling data on disbursements and repayments of all external borrowing.

31.
Cooperation with the Fund will likely continue to be strong, but the authorities
do not see the current approach of token payments as a solution to the arrears issue.
The authorities paid in excess of their commitment for 2006, and intend to make minimum
annual payments of US$50 million in 2007 and 2008 (see MEFP, ¶29). The authorities
wished to convey their intent to continue cooperating with the Fund in this regard, but
highlighted that such token payments are not a meaningful solution to Sudan’s obligations to
the Fund—the lion’s share of which is in overdue charges rather than original principal.
Resolving Sudan’s overdue financial obligations remains a high priority for the government.
To this end, the authorities believe that debt relief under HIPC and MDRI initiatives will play
a crucial role in helping Sudan to normalize its relations with the Fund and other multilateral
and bilateral donors.

19
E. Data Issues and Technical Assistance
32.
Sudan’s economic data are sufficient for surveillance and program monitoring,
but some inadequacies remain. The quality of Sudan’s economic data has improved in
recent years—in part because of participation in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination
System. Monetary and financial sector statistics are comprehensive and generally timely, and
information on oil production, shipments, pricing, and transfers of revenue are available
regularly. Significant progress is also being made on fiscal reporting, and should culminate in
the adoption of GFSM 2001 classification for the 2008 budget. However, regular data on
domestic debt (particularly standing orders, promissory notes (sanadats and letters of
guarantee), and arrears) is uneven. This highlights the need to press ahead with a centralized
domestic debt office in the MOFNE. CPI and national accounts data remains weak, but
should improve with the completion of the national census and the household budget survey.
33.
The authorities emphasized the need for continued technical assistance from the
Fund. Priorities for the short-term include further training on GFSM 2001 methodology,
assistance on improving public financial management (commitment control and treasury
single account), tax policy and administration, and fiscal federalism. Improving bank
supervision is also seen as critical (particularly in the context of a dual banking system). In
this context, the Fund is providing technical assistance to the South in the areas of currency
exchange and supervision of conventional banking systems. The authorities also reiterated
their desire for an FSAP update as soon as possible.
IV. RISKS TO THE OUTLOOK
34.
Sudan’s economic prospects continue to be good, but significant risks remain.
The main risk for reforms remains waning political support, given Sudan’s concern with lack
of progress by the donor community on debt relief. From the authorities’ perspective, Sudan
has made a good faith effort to cooperate with the Fund and the international community on
economic policies, even when such actions were politically costly. The authorities accept that
such actions were in the best interest of macroeconomic stability and development, but also
point out that there has been no corresponding action on debt relief or donor financing. Other
risks include volatility in oil production and prices as well as capital flows, weaknesses in
public financial management, and failure to move quickly and decisively to improve
financial sector indicators. It will be critical for macroeconomic stability to forcefully
implement the policies outlined in the attached MEFP.
V. STAFF-MONITORED PROGRAM
35.
The 18-month program aims at addressing the institutional and policy
weaknesses underlying the emergence of macroeconomic imbalances in 2006–07,
ensuring the safety and soundness of the financial system, and laying the groundwork
for medium-term macroeconomic stability and growth. The proposed semi-annual
quantitative targets for end-December 2007, end-June 2008, and end-December 2008, as well

20
as the structural benchmarks are detailed in Table 1 and Table 2 of the attached MEFP. Semiannual staff assessments are envisaged under the program.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
Sudan must navigate a challenging course over the next few years with many
competing objectives. These include implementation of various peace agreements,
addressing development needs with limited resources, and maintaining macroeconomic
stability in the face of a rapidly changing economic landscape.
37.
The 18-month staff-monitored program aims at sustaining the recent record of
high growth, preserving macroeconomic stability, and meeting the country’s
development and poverty reduction needs. The program balances a prudent fiscal
framework with fiscal reforms to increase the revenue base for financing needed
expenditures and financial sector reforms to strengthen financial intermediation and increase
investment.
38.
Meeting the twin objectives of higher expenditures for development needs and
macroeconomic stability will require better expenditure management and bold fiscal
reforms to increase revenues. Serious imbalances emerged in the latter half of 2006 and
early 2007 resulting in arrears buildup, deterioration of financial sector conditions, and
exchange rate pressures. Staff welcomes the authorities’ recent decision to tighten fiscal
policy while maintaining peace commitments to the various regions. Conservative revenue
forecasting, improved expenditure management, and more transparent budget execution are
key to maintaining macroeconomic stability and preventing a recurrence of the problems
observed in 2006 and early 2007. It is noteworthy that the authorities agreed to lower the
budget deficit by about 2 percent of GDP in the second half of 2007 and to take important
measures to control expenditures and improve budget execution.
39.
Fiscal reforms are needed to improve the revenue base. Sudan’s tax-to-GDP ratio
is relatively low compared to other countries at a similar level of development. This is largely
on account of generous tax incentives/holidays, but also weak tax administration. Generous
tax incentives may encourage some foreign investment, but macroeconomic stability, a
transparent and predictable tax structure, and a good infrastructure base are far more
important to potential investors. In turn, a stronger revenue base will be needed to finance
infrastructure spending in a noninflationary manner. In this regard, the authorities’ recent
decision to broaden the tax base by reducing VAT exemptions and income tax holidays is a
step in the right direction. Staff also welcomes the authorities’ recent efforts to improve tax
administration. Although not likely to raise significant revenue in the short-term, these and
other revenue measures will be an important component in the fiscal outlook for 2008
onwards.

21
40.
The conduct of monetary policy will likely be more challenging than in the past.
Shifting FDI and other capital flows, volatility in oil-related foreign exchange movements,
aid disbursements, and the monetization of the south make it particularly important to closely
monitor monetary developments to ensure that money growth remains in line with the
inflation objective. The conduct of monetary policy will also need to increasingly rely on
open market operations—with an emphasis on indirect monetary policy instruments—as well
as on greater coordination between the finance ministry and the central bank. In this regard,
staff welcomes the central bank’s decision to acquire government securities from the banking
system. The trading of these instruments could, in future, be used to meet liquidity
management objectives, rather than relying on sales of foreign exchange.
41.
Greater exchange rate flexibility will be needed to buffer the economy from
external shocks and protect reserves. The central bank has had the difficult job of trying to
achieve a soft landing for the dinar in an environment of expansionary fiscal policy and
lower-than-expected oil revenues. Staff notes the authorities’ concern that excessively rapid
adjustment in the exchange rate could have had a disruptive impact on the economy,
particularly given that the shortfall in oil production was temporary. However, this resulted
in an uncomfortably low level of reserves. Further, although difficult to quantify the exact
magnitude, staff analysis suggests that the level of the exchange rate may have become
somewhat overvalued by end-2006 (although the magnitude of misalignment has since
diminished). Accordingly, staff welcomes the authorities’ decision to allow greater exchange
rate flexibility and to rebuild foreign exchange reserves to more comfortable levels. Staff also
welcomes the authorities’ decision to eliminate the exchange restriction and multiple
currency practice arising from imposing a floor on cash margins for letters of credit and
import credit. In light of this, staff recommends the approval of this restriction and multiple
currency practice until end-2007.
42.
To address concerns about external competitiveness, the authorities must press
ahead with structural reforms to increase productivity. It is difficult to assess to what
extent the real appreciation of the dinar in 2005–06 has negatively impacted non-oil exports.
However, indications are that structural rigidities and low labor productivity have played a
more fundamental role in the weakening of external competitiveness than the recent
appreciation of the exchange rate. Improving the business climate will be necessary if recent
strong growth is to be sustained.
43.
Sustaining strong growth will also require a greater role for the financial sector
to channel savings into needed investment. Notwithstanding the progress made over the
past few years in developing Sudan’s financial system, financial intermediation is still
relatively low. Moreover, financial sector indicators have recently deteriorated. In this
regard, it will be important to prepare a resolution/restructuring strategy for Omdurman Bank
based on the results of the forthcoming independent audit. The central bank must also more
actively enforce prudential standards and ensure that banks comply with existing regulations
on capitalizations and provisioning, based on credible and independent loan assessments.

22
44.
Sudan’s external debt problem continues to constrain access to external
development financing. Sudan’s record of cooperation on economic policies and payments
to the Fund augur well for the clearance of Sudan’s arrears at the appropriate time. In the
meantime, the authorities should minimize contracting nonconcessional debt as such
borrowing threatens debt sustainability and could delay the process of securing creditors’
participation in a potential debt-relief operation. In this regard, the staff underscores that it
will be critical for creditors and Sudan to treat all such new borrowing under the Enhanced
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries’ initiative. This will ensure that any eventual relief
provided under the initiative is sufficient to restore debt sustainability.
45.
While the proposed level of nonconcessional borrowing implies that in this area
the program does not meet the standard of upper-credit tranche conditionality, the
SMP is a valuable tool to support the reform momentum. The program contains
important actions to reduce the budget deficit by 2 percent of GDP, address critical
weaknesses in public financial management, rebuild international reserves, and tackle
difficult problems in the banking system. It also provides a framework within which donors
can support the peace process and afflicted areas. Except for the high level of
nonconcessional borrowing, the staff considers that the 2007–08 SMP continues to be
equivalent in strength to a Rights Accumulation Program.
46.
While Sudan’s economic prospects are good, important risks exist. The main risk
is a weakening of political resolve to maintain macroeconomic stability, advance critical
reforms, foster Sudan’s integration with the world economy, and resist political pressures—
particularly in the context of forthcoming elections. It will be crucial for the authorities to
implement the envisioned fiscal adjustment in order to maintain macroeconomic stability.
47.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Sudan be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

2/ Outstanding stock at end-2005, except for external nonconcessional debt and payment to the Fund which are in flow
terms.
3/ As specified in the Technical Memorandum of Understanding (CR/06/182, Attachment I), three program targets for
December 2006 have been adjusted as follows: i) The target on net domestic assets of the central bank has been
increased by the difference between programmed and accrued government oil revenue (SDD 136 billion) and increased
by the (non-programmed) change in bank claims on the Government of Southern Sudan (SDD 17 billion). ii) The target on
net international reserves has been reduced by the difference between accrued and programmed government oil
revenue (US$677 million) and reduced by the (non-programmed) change in central bank claims on the Government of
Southern Sudan (US$84 million). iii) The target on the domestic financing of the central government has been increased
by the difference between accrued and programmed government oil revenue (SDD 136 billion). In addition, the central
bank's NDA outturn in June and December 2006 is valued at the program exchange rate.

ATTACHMENT I. SUDAN: LETTER OF INTENT
July 27, 2007
Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
Dear Mr. de Rato:
Sudan has maintained close cooperation with the IMF over the past many years. This cooperation has
helped us implement economic policies that aim at maintaining economic stability, fostering growth,
and reducing poverty—which are necessary to promote peace and reconciliation throughout the
country.
The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) sets forth our policy
intentions under an 18-month Staff Monitored Program (SMP) covering July 2007 through
December 2008. We are committed to maintaining macroeconomic stability and advancing the reform
agenda, which will focus on fiscal reforms to increase the revenue base for financing needed
expenditures and financial sector reforms to strengthen financial intermediation. The Government
believes that the policies and measures set forth in the attached MEFP are adequate to achieve the
objectives of the program, but it stands ready to take additional measures that may be appropriate for
this purpose. The Government intends to make these understandings public and authorizes the IMF to
publish this letter, the attached MEFP, and the IMF staff report.
We are committed to a process of economic integration, both within Sudan and with the international
community. But our success depends also on the support we get from multilateral institutions and
development partners. In this regard, we look forward to the IMF’s Executive Board’s discussion of
the SMP and to the resolution of Sudan’s debt and arrears problems in the future. In the meantime, we
will intensify our efforts to obtain financing assurances from creditors for arrears clearance and debt
relief under the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries and the Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiatives.
Sincerely yours,
s/
Al-Zubeir Ahmed Al-Hassan
Minister of Finance and National Economy

ATTACHMENT II. SUDAN: MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES
July 27, 2007
1.
This memorandum sets out the economic policies and objectives of the Government
of National Unity (GNU) for the period July 2007 to December 2008. These policies will be
pursued in the context of an IMF staff-monitored program (SMP).
I. PERFORMANCE UNDER THE 2006 SMP
2.
Program performance under the 2006 SMP was uneven, due in large part to a number
of unforeseen factors and challenges related to implementation of peace agreements. Two of
the five quantitative targets (payments to the Fund and the ceiling on nonconcessional
borrowing) were met. The remaining three targets (net international reserves, net domestic
assets, and domestic financing of the government) were not met. Critical in this regard was
the need to meet commitments under various peace agreements in the absence of
disbursements from donors. Also a factor was a shortfall relative to projected revenues from
oil exports. With respect to net international reserves, the need to absorb excess domestic
liquidity—generated mainly by fiscal expansion and intervention in Omdurman Bank—and
lower oil revenues resulted in a substantial decline in foreign exchange reserves of the central
bank in the last quarter of the year. Most structural reforms under the program were
implemented, although some with delays. Only three of the benchmarks—fiscal reporting on
a GFSM 2001 basis, publishing of financial audits of state oil company Sudapet, and
formulation of a program to revamp investment incentives—were not met.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
A. Developments in 2006
3.
Despite the numerous challenges in implementing various peace agreements, the
government has endeavored to maintain a focus on ensuring high levels of economic growth
within an environment of macroeconomic stability. For the most part, we have been
successful in these objectives. Growth was robust in 2006, and Sudan was one of the region’s
strongest countries in terms of attracting investment. With rapid growth have come new
challenges—some have related to volatility in oil production and pricing, while others have
stemmed from the need for greater flexibility and coordination in implementing
macroeconomic policy.
4.
The Sudanese economy achieved a growth rate of about 11.8 percent in 2006—
largely in line with program expectations. A substantial increase in oil production (albeit less
than hoped) contributed to this robust performance. Nonoil growth was also strong, however,
at an estimated 10.3 percent—due in large part to a continued recovery in agriculture, and
vibrant activity in construction, trade, and services. Average inflation was 7.2 percent.
However, there was a steep rise in end-period inflation to 15.7 percent—stemming from the
government’s decision to reduce subsidies on domestic fuel products. Reflecting strong

37
capital inflows, the dinar rose by some 12 percent in nominal terms vis-à-vis the US dollar.
Given the surge in inflation in the second half of the year, the dinar rose by some 21 percent
in real effective terms during 2006.
5.
Despite a substantial rise in oil production, the external current account position
deteriorated. Exports of crude oil in 2006 increased by roughly 70 percent in volume terms
over 2005, due almost entirely to production from new fields. In dollar terms, however, oil
exports increased by only 24 percent. Marketing problems and the low quality of a new crude
(Dar blend, which has a high level of acidity) resulted in a substantial discount relative to
prevailing international prices and lower than expected export receipts. Nonoil exports,
meanwhile, declined by some 11 percent in dollar terms—with notable declines in cotton,
gum arabic, and livestock products. Imports—particularly shipments of capital goods—
surged over the course of the year, reflecting a strong increase in foreign investment. As a
result, the external current account deficit expanded from 8 percent of GDP in 2005 to
roughly 13 percent in 2006. Net international reserves of the central bank declined by almost
one-third, although this mainly reflected increased foreign exchange sales to mop up excess
dinar liquidity associated with fiscal expansion and the injections into state-owned
Omdurman Bank.
6.
Fiscal performance in 2006 was weaker than programmed. The overall deficit is
estimated to have widened to over 4 percent of GDP (2 percentage points higher than
targeted in the revised 2006 SMP). This was in large part due to shortfalls in oil production
and government oil revenue. Although total production (at some 132 million barrels) was
substantially higher than in 2005, it was still much less than had been anticipated in
formulating the budget. Low prices for Dar blend also had a negative impact, as did lower
than projected non-oil revenues. Overall expenditures were in line with program
commitments. Excess capital expenditures was compensated for by restraint in current
spending. The higher fiscal deficit was financed by depletion of resources in the oil savings
account, issuance of government bonds and promissory notes, central bank credit, and
accumulation of domestic arrears.
7.
Broad money growth (on an annual basis) remained around 40 percent through most
of the year. Credit to the private sector grew at a rapid pace through much of the first half
of 2006—peaking at just over 80 percent on a 12-month basis in July. The second half of the
year was marked by a deceleration of this expansion. Broad money growth declined sharply
to 27.4 percent by end-December, with a similar drop in growth of private sector credit, to
about 45 percent. These sharp declines, which took place largely in the last quarter, were due
to corrective actions by the central bank (principally foreign exchange sales to mop up
domestic liquidity), a decline in deposits linked to the Omdurman Bank, and the emergence
of government arrears which impacted banks’ balance sheets. Reserve money growth was
broadly in line with program targets at about 28 percent.

38
8.
Important structural reforms were completed in the past year. Of particular
importance has been ongoing work on fiscal management and transparency with respect to
the oil sector. During 2006, the fiscal framework of the national government was converted
to GFSM 2001 format, and presented to parliament for information—a critical step forward
in public financial management. Also key was the compilation and public release of data on
oil production, trade, and related transfers to the Government of Southern Sudan. Finally, a
difficult but necessary reduction in domestic fuel subsidies was accomplished in August.
B. Developments in 2007
9.
A number of the challenges that emerged in the final months of 2006 carried over into
the first part of 2007—highlighting the need for a comprehensive approach to resolve
emerging imbalances while simultaneously maintaining macroeconomic stability. Revenues
in the first quarter were below the levels hoped for in the budget. While a weak first quarter
performance in non-oil revenue (particularly tax revenue) is not unusual, oil revenues again
failed to meet anticipated levels. Production and export of Dar blend crude were hampered
by technical problems related to completion of a new pipeline and marine terminal. Prices for
Dar blend in the first few months of the year were also lower than expected, running at an
average of US$19 per barrel during January-March. Government expenditures, meanwhile,
remained in line with budget allocations. As a result, the overall government deficit in the
first quarter reached SD 143.6 billion (1.5 percent of annual GDP).
10.
While inflation has remained in single digits and the exchange rate has been steady,
monetary growth has decelerated. The 12-month rate of broad money growth fell to about
8 percent by April, due in large part to continued monthly declines in net foreign assets and
less credit to the private sector. Given the expansion in government spending and imports,
the use of foreign exchange reserves to mop up domestic liquidity and bring the exchange
rate to a soft landing was seen by the central bank as the most prudent option.
III. MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK AND CHALLENGES
11.
Meeting Sudan’s medium-term challenges will require macroeconomic stability, a
strong commitment to reform, and flexibility in dealing with a rapidly changing economic
landscape. We would highlight in this context that Sudan has only recently emerged from a
long period of civil conflict. The demands of implementing the Comprehensive Peace
Agreement (CPA), the Eastern Peace Agreement (EPA), and the Darfur Peace Agreement
(DPA) are substantial, and the commitments made under these agreements must be met
regardless of whether the international community fulfills earlier pledges of support. The
demands in this area are likely to increase given the need to proceed with demobilization, as
well as providing support to the joint AU-UN peacekeeping force. Meeting these obligations
while simultaneously undertaking critical infrastructure and pro-poor spending limits our
maneuverability on economic policies. The situation would be improved considerably with
greater donor support and recognition of our accomplishments.

39
12.
The medium-term macroeconomic framework envisages growth of about 910 percent, based on prudent macroeconomic policies designed to ensure single digit
inflation and a rebuilding of international reserves. Increasing production of oil will provide
one source of growth, but we also anticipate robust activity in non-oil sectors—including
construction, manufacturing, transport, and services. We will also seek to boost the
performance of our agricultural sector through market reforms and removal of transport,
finance, and input bottlenecks.
13.
Structural reforms and flexibility in labor and capital markets will be essential to
maintain competitiveness over this period. The external position is likely to improve over
time, with the external current account (cash basis) projected to stabilize at a deficit of 45 percent of GDP. Fiscal policy will focus on the difficult task of balancing expenditure
needs with maintaining a fiscal stance consistent with macroeconomic stability. Monetary
policy will continue to target a broad money growth rate consistent with inflation and growth
objectives. Financial sector stability and development, in conjunction with prudent regulation
and oversight, will be critical components in enhancing the prospects for medium and longterm growth of the Sudanese economy.
14.
In addition to targeting high and sustainable levels of growth, the government’s
medium-term policies will focus on poverty alleviation and development. To this end, we
have developed a work plan to prepare a national Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP).
A request for funding under the Technical Assistance Facility is pending. We expect the final
PRSP to be ready by March 2008. The PRSP will place heavy emphasis on relevant and
flexible policies to ensure a macroeconomic framework consistent with post-conflict
challenges, decentralization, an enabling environment for private sector growth, and capacity
and institution building. We are also pleased to report that the Bank of Sudan, in cooperation
with the World Bank, has initiated a microfinance unit. The unit will focus on creating
financial access for the poor, setting up the legislative and organizational framework for
microfinance work, and establishing an information network for microfinance providers.
IV. POLICIES FOR 2007-08
15.
Recognizing the seriousness of imbalances which emerged in the latter half of 2006
and the first quarter of 2007, the government has already implemented several corrective
actions. On expenditure management, starting in June, the Bank of Sudan is coordinating
payments for priority expenditures (wages, expenditures already committed and financed by
standing orders, guarantees, and development sanadats), via direct transfer from current
revenues. Remaining expenditures are based exclusively on remaining cash revenues, and
will be executed by a committee including the State Minister of Finance, the Under Secretary
of Finance (as co-chair), the Director of the Budget, and the Director of the Chamber of
Accounts.

40
A. Real Sector
16.
The program envisages real economic growth of 11.2 percent in 2007 and
10.7 percent in 2008. Oil GDP is expected to grow by about 39 percent in 2007 (reflecting
the additional output from Blocks 3 and 7), and by nearly 12 percent in 2008 as production
stabilizes. Non-oil growth is expected to moderate somewhat in 2007, but remain at a robust
level of 8 percent in real terms. The moderation in growth will reflect fiscal consolidation,
the need to tighten monetary policy to stem reserve outflows, weakness in the financial
system during the first part of the year, and more moderate growth in agriculture and
livestock production—which grew sharply in 2005–06.
B. Monetary/Exchange Rate Policy
17.
With respect to monetary policy, the central bank will—in the context of a managed
float exchange rate system—maintain a focus on price stability as its central mandate. The
pound will be allowed to move in line with fundamental forces, and sales of foreign
exchange will focus primarily on serving government and market needs. Given the lumpiness
of foreign exchange movements related to oil production and FDI flows, occasional limited
intervention may be needed to smooth short-term volatility. However, in light of the need to
rebuild foreign exchange reserves to prudent levels, the room for further intervention will be
limited. The central bank will avoid resisting sustained and fundamental pressures on the
pound. We will also remove, by end-December 2007, the floor on cash margins for sight
letters of credit and import credits.
18.
The program will target a broad money growth rate of 24 percent in 2007, and
25 percent in 2008, consistent with GDP growth and inflation objectives, and an increase in
money demand reflecting the reintegration of the south. The monetary target and the
projected increase in foreign exchange reserves will allow for an appropriate growth of credit
to the private sector. The conduct of monetary policy will be challenging given the changing
economic landscape, but will seek to be flexible in the face of shifting FDI and other capital
flows, volatility in oil-related foreign exchange movements, and aid disbursements.
Accordingly, we will closely monitor monetary developments during the program period to
ensure that the broad money growth rate remains in line with the inflation objective.
19.
The conduct of monetary policy will increasingly rely on open market operations,
with an emphasis on indirect monetary policy instruments. In the coming months, the central
bank will acquire government securities from the banking system in order to increase its
stocks of indirect monetary policy instruments. The trading of these instruments could in
future be used to meet liquidity management objectives, rather than relying on sales of
foreign exchange.

41
C. Fiscal Policy
20.
The fiscal deficit for 2007 will be contained to no more than SD 359 billion on a cash
basis, and to no more than SD 326 billion (2.9 percent of GDP) in 2008. The 2008 budget
parameters will be reviewed later in 2007, as the preparation of the 2008 budget advances.
All standing orders, guarantees, sanadats, and other obligations coming due will be paid, and
no new arrears will be created in 2007 and 2008. Fiscal revenues are expected to reach
SD 1,748 billion in 2007. This revenue will include some SD 56 billion (US$280 million) in
license fees and payment of past obligations from Mobitel. Oil revenues are projected to
reach 9.7 percent of GDP in 2007. The increase in oil revenues will reflect a rise in
government share, as well as a narrowing discount on Dar blend relative to international
prices. Total central government expenditures are programmed to be SD 2,107 billion
in 2007. The government is fully aware of the risks associated with oil revenue projections
given the volatility of international oil prices, and the uncertainties with respect to production
and shipment. Flexibility and frequent review of expenditures and commitments will thus be
required to ensure that the deficit stays at or below the agreed level. Specifically, if oil
revenues are lower-than-programmed, we will (to the extent that such resources are
available) compensate for the revenue shortfall by drawing from the Oil Saving Account
(OSA), or otherwise reduce spending to maintain the fiscal deficit unchanged. If oil revenues
exceed programmed levels, the additional revenue will be deposited in the OSA.
21.
To meet the programmed revenue targets and to raise revenues over the mediumterm, fiscal reform measures we intend to undertake in 2007-08 are as follows:
•

The VAT rate was raised from 10 percent to 12 percent effective June 1, 2007.

•

Reduce VAT exemptions granted by ministerial decree to achieve an
additional SD 15-20 billion in revenue on an annual basis, effective
December 2007.

•

The Ministry of Finance will prepare a program by October 2007 to
progressively reduce income tax holidays for new investments under the IEA.

•

Recommendations of the above program will be incorporated and
implemented as part of the 2008 budget.

•

Implement an accelerated depreciation mechanism, and agree to adopt a single
profit tax rate in 2009.

•

Existing exemptions will be grandfathered, but eliminated at the time of
expiration (no renewal).

•

Continue to suspend the granting of any new VAT or income tax exemptions.

42
•

Improve tax administration through introduction of self-assessment for
business income tax (BIT) for taxpayers covered under the Large Taxpayer
Office (LTO) by end-January 2008.

22.
Fiscal expenditure has risen significantly in recent years, reflecting priority
reconstruction needs and increases in transfers to states in an effort to support greater
decentralization. While continuing to support these objectives, expenditure policies for 200708 will focus on maintaining a tighter balance between spending and available resources.
Specific actions we will undertake in this regard are as follows:
•

To further bolster expenditure management and preclude the emergence of
domestic arrears, the ministry of finance will implement a zero-balance
Treasury Single Account (TSA) by August 15 2007.

•

Implement commitment controls that limit expenditures by line ministries to
monthly or quarterly cash plans, which reflect likely cash availability rather
than budgeted allocations.

•

The MOFNE will issue a decree by July 15, 2007 establishing that line
ministries cannot undertake spending commitments without the permission of
the MOFNE. Reports will also be prepared on a quarterly basis for accounting
data on expenditure committed and expenditure paid, by main budgetary items
and chapters.1

•

Formulate contingency measures for expenditure cuts in the event that
projected revenues (oil and non-oil) fail to materialize.

23.
Critical to the effective implementation of fiscal policy is a renewed commitment by
the government to transparency and sound public financial management. The resort to
nontraditional forms of financing in 2006-07 complicated both fiscal and monetary
management and made analysis of the true fiscal position difficult. To address this problem
and to increase transparency, we intend to take the following measures:
•

1

Halt the use of sanadats, standing orders, and other nontraditional forms of
finance, and to carefully monitor the existing stock of such instruments with a
view to their eventual extinction. Issuance of letters of guarantee in the second
half of 2007 will not exceed SD 20 billion.

These two measures will help ensure that line ministries will not be able to independently commit amounts
under their allocations, and that they would be bound by actual measures under the cash plan.

43
•

Establish in MOFNE a centralized domestic debt unit by September 2007 that
will compile and monitor on a monthly basis the stock of domestic debt, and
on a quarterly basis the stock of domestic arrears (payments due for over 3
months) by debt instrument and provide on a quarterly basis accounting data
on expenditure committed and expenditure paid, by main budgetary items and
chapters.

•

Adopt for the 2008 budget the full economic and functional classifications of
the Government Financial Statistics Manual (GFSM) 2001.
D. Balance of Payments / External Debt

24.
The external current account deficit (cash basis) is expected to narrow significantly to
some 9 percent of GDP, compared with a deficit of 13 percent in 2006. The improvement
mirrors a sharp increase in oil exports, as difficulties with oil production and shipment are
expected to be resolved by mid-year. Critically, Dar blend crude appears to have found
broader acceptance in international oil markets, and thus prices are likely to be more stable in
the future. Transfers are also expected to rise. Imports are expected to rise by about
6 percent—mainly in the form of materials and capital goods required for the implementation
of large scale projects financed by loans from official creditors and FDI. With the net
increase in foreign exchange inflow, we anticipate being able to rebuild net international
reserves of the central bank to a level of about US$1.3 billion (1.4 months of imports) by the
end of 2007 and US$1.8 billion (1.7 months of imports) by end-2008.
E. Financial Sector
25.
We will continue our plans to restructure and strengthen the banking system. A
strategy for resolving recent problems with Omdurman Bank is being implemented. An audit
of the bank will be started by December 2007 by a local affiliate of one of the internationally
recognized auditing firms. The audit will be consistent with international good practices and
follow international audit standards. Based on the findings of the audit, we will prepare a
plan for resolution/restructuring of the bank by June 2008. Similarly, rehabilitation plans for
Saudi Sudanese Bank will be implemented. The CBOS will actively enforce prudential
standards and ensure that banks comply with existing regulations. Commercial banks will
submit to the central bank by end-December 2007 well-specified action plans to achieve full
compliance with existing regulations on capitalization and provisioning.
F. Other Reforms
26.
With the rise in oil production has come greater demands for oil sector transparency.
A number of positive steps have been made in the last year with respect to publication of oil
sector and oil revenue data, but much remains to be done. With a view to increasing the level
of cooperation and transparency, the government will provide to the IMF the 2004 and 2005
audits of Sudapet by October 2007. The government will also publish (on the MOFNE

44
website) data on volume of oil production, total volume of crude oil exports, volume of
government oil exports, volume of input to refineries, volume of petroleum product
production, and import/export of petroleum products.
V. RELATIONS WITH THE FUND AND OTHER CREDITORS
27.
External debt issues. In 2007, Sudan’s debt service capacity will be constrained by
revenue shortfalls, the need to rebuild foreign exchange reserves, the burden of implementing
the various peace agreements, and the need to address critical poverty and reconstruction
requirements. Further shortfalls or delays in donor assistance or a significant negative shock
to oil prices would further limit our capacity to service our obligations. Based on the
available data, the end-2006 stock of public and publicly-guaranteed debt is estimated at over
US$27 billion in nominal terms, up by about US$9 billion since end-2000. This increase
largely reflects a US$6.3 billion buildup in arrears to official bilateral (Paris Club and nonParis Club) creditors, and new drawings of some US$520 million from Arab multilateral and
bilateral creditors as well as from China and India. Sudan has been making debt service
payments to almost all multilateral creditors and selected bilateral creditors that have
provided new financing in recent years. We wish to convey to the international community
that Sudan has made every effort at cooperation on policies and payments for many years,
and in that context met all the conditions and requirements for debt relief. We remain hopeful
that the international community will recognize our track record, and take concrete action on
debt relief for Sudan comparable to that provided to numerous other countries.
28.
External financing. Sudan continues to suffer from limited access to concessional
loans because of the difficulties in resolving our debt and arrears situation. We are unable to
put critical infrastructure, reconstruction, and social development projects on hold
indefinitely, however. These projects are an essential component of our strategy to unite the
country after the signing of multiple peace agreements. Consequently, we have had to make
recourse to nonconcessional financing in recent years. We are keenly aware of the concern of
other creditors regarding this borrowing, and of the risks it may pose over the medium- and
long-term. We will therefore seek to limit the contracting of such obligations as much as
possible. For 2007, we will limit such contracting to US$700 million, and will impose a
similar limit for 2008.
29.
Payments to the Fund. In addition to cooperation with the Fund on matters of
economic policy, Sudan’s payments to the Fund have exceeded program levels under the
SMP, and in this context we achieved a small reduction in the stock of external obligations.
Payments to the Fund have continued in the first half of 2007, even in the absence of a staffmonitored program. The Fund’s preferred creditor status will be maintained by ensuring that
our payments continue in the remaining months of 2007 and 2008 by ensuring that our
payments continue to exceed obligations falling due. To demonstrate our continued
cooperation, we will make minimum payments of US$50 million in 2007 and at least
US$50 million in 2008. Further, it is our intention to move to a monthly payment basis. We

45
would hasten to point out, however, that these payments—while demonstrating our good
intentions—are not a solution to Sudan’s arrears to the Fund. We appeal to the international
community in this context to recognize our accomplishments, act in accordance with the
principle of equal treatment, and work toward a rapid resolution of Sudan’s debt and arrears
problem.
VI. PROGRAM TARGETS AND MONITORING
30.
The proposed semi-annual quantitative targets for the periods up to end
December 2007, end-June 2008, and end-December 2008 are set forth in Table 1, and the
structural benchmarks are detailed in Table 2. We will closely monitor financial and
economic developments in coming months and will implement any measures that may be
needed to safeguard macroeconomic stability in consultation with the Fund staff. It is
proposed that there will be semi-annual staff assessments of the program.
31.
To ensure the effective monitoring of the program, the relevant ministries, the CBOS,
and the Central Bureau of Statistics will compile and share with the Fund staff all economic
and financial data necessary, on a timely basis, as specified in the attached TMU.

ATTACHMENT III. SUDAN: TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
1.
This memorandum specifies the understanding reached with the Fund staff regarding
quantitative targets, structural benchmarks, and reporting for the 2007-08 staff-monitored
program (SMP).
2.
The SMP relies on six quantitative indicative targets for up to end-March and endSeptember and an equal number of quantitative targets for end-December 2007, endJune 2008 and end-December 2008. The targets are (i) ceilings on the change in net domestic
assets of the Central Bank of Sudan (CBOS); (ii) ceilings on the domestic financing of the
fiscal deficit; (iii) floors for the buildup of net international reserves of the central bank;
(iv) ceilings on new nonconcessional external loans contracted or guaranteed by the
government or the central bank; (v) floors for payments to the Fund; and (vi) change in
domestic arrears. Broad money, reserve money, and total government revenues from crude
oil exports will be monitored as memorandum items. Some of these targets are subject to
adjustors depending on the financial position of the government of South Sudan and total
government oil export revenue performance. The definitions of these variables and the
adjustors are set out below. All the quantitative targets and structural benchmarks are
displayed in Tables 1 and 2 of this attachment.
3.
Net domestic assets (NDA) of the CBOS are defined as the sum of the Net Domestic
Credit of the CBOS, the net issue of money market instruments and other items net. Net
Domestic Credit is defined as net credit to the central government (i.e. Government
Musharaka Certificates (GMCs), Government Investment Certificates (GICs), and any other
form of central bank credit to the central government minus total central government
deposits) plus net central bank claims on state and local governments, central bank claims on
public enterprises, and claims on banks, and minus Central Bank Ijara Certificates (CICs).
The definition of the central government comprises all accounts of line ministries and
agencies controlled by the government (corresponding to Group no. 11, Group no. 12, and
some accounts of the Group no. 19 in the CBOS general ledger), the Zakat funds (recorded
under Group no. 13), and margin deposits placed with the CBOS by the central government
against letters of credit issued by the CBOS. The definition includes all oil-related accounts
controlled by the government. To evaluate program targets, the dinar equivalent values of
foreign exchange denominated items in the balance sheet of the central bank will be
calculated at the program exchange rate.
4.
Domestic financing of the fiscal deficit is defined as total net domestic borrowing
by the central government, including net borrowing from the banking system (including
GMCs and GICs), net sales of GMCs and GICs outside the banking system, promissory
notes (ie, standing orders, letters of guarantee, and sanadats), and revenues from
privatization and changes in government cash deposits of the BOS. The definition of central
government for the purpose of this criterion is the same as the one applied for the NDA of
the central bank.
5.
Net international reserves (NIR) are total gross non-earmarked official foreign
reserve assets on active accounts plus reserve assets of the government of Southern Sudan in

49
the central bank minus official short-term liabilities (i.e. no more than one-year maturity).
The assets are maintained on accounts with overseas correspondent banks and foreign
exchange banknotes in the vaults of the central bank. Short-term liabilities include IMF
deposit accounts, nonresident deposits, and (overdrawn) foreign correspondents accounts.
6.
Limits on contracting or guaranteeing of nonconcessional external debt apply to
all forms of debt of more than one-year maturity contracted or guaranteed by the government
or the CBOS. The limit applies not only to debt as defined in point no. 9 of the Guidelines on
Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt (Decision no. 12274-(00/85),
August 24, 2000), but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not
been received. The degree of concessionality of debt will be calculated as specified in the
Guidelines.1
7.
Broad money is defined as the sum of local currency circulating outside of the
banks, banks’ demand, and time and savings deposits. It also includes transferable deposits
and margin deposits against letters of credit placed by state and local governments,
nonfinancial public enterprises, and the nonbank private sector with the CBOS. Reserve
money is defined as the sum of local currency circulating outside of the banks, total reserves
(required and excess) for banks, and deposits at the CBOS included in broad money.
8.
Adjustor on the financial position of the government of South Sudan (capped).
The program target for changes in the NDA of the central bank will be reduced (increased)
and the international reserve target will be increased (reduced) by the amount of any decline
(increase) in net central bank claims on the government of South Sudan. The adjustor will
not apply if the stock of net claims on the government of South Sudan turns positive.
9.
Oil revenue adjustor (symmetric). The programmed government oil revenue from
crude oil exports is based on the program’s assumptions about oil prices (f.o.b. Port Sudan)
and quantities expected to be exported (see Table below). Accrued revenue is the cumulative
government oil revenue inflows based on actual shipments at current international prices
(f.o.b. Port Sudan). Oil revenue for use in the 2007 and 2008 budgets is estimated at a
projected international average quarterly price of oil as indicated in Table 1 (benchmark
prices).2 The accrued government oil revenue in excess of the planned budgeted amounts is
deposited in an oil saving account (OSA), a locked sub-account within net credit to the
government at the CBOS. The programmed OSA accumulation for 2007 is zero.
1

For program purposes, a loan is considered concessional if the grant element is at least 35 percent calculated
using a discount factor based on the Commercial Interest Reference Rates (CIRRs) published by the OECD
plus margins depending on the loan maturity. The margins are 0.75 percent for repayment periods of less than
15 years, 1 percent for 15–19 years, 1.15 percent for 20–29 years, and 1.25 percent for 30 years or more. The
average of the CIRRs over the last ten years will be used for loans with a maturity of at least 15 years and the
average of the CIRRs for the preceding six months will be used for shorter maturities.
2

The projected prices for 2008 will be revisited in the context of preparing the 2008 budget, based on the latest
information available regarding international prices and the discounts applied to Nile blend and Dar blend.

50
The oil revenue adjustor will work as follows:
•

If the accrued government revenue from crude oil exports exceeds the programmed
amount (either because the price and/or volume exceed the programmed levels), these
proceeds will also be deposited in the OSA. The program targets for domestic
financing of the budget deficit and NDA will be reduced, and the international
reserves target will be increased, by the difference between the accrued and the
programmed amounts.

•

If the accrued government revenue from crude oil exports falls short of the
programmed amount, the program targets for international reserves target will be
reduced by the difference between the programmed and the accrued amounts.

•

If within a given quarter the accrued oil revenue that goes to the budget falls below
the planned amount, appropriate amounts will be withdrawn from the OSA (subject to
these resources being available) to ensure that cumulative oil revenues for use in the
budget match the cumulative amounts planned in the fiscal program. If such resources
are not available from the OSA, the government will undertake appropriate
expenditure adjustment to ensure that the deficit does not exceed the targeted level of
SD 359 billion in 2007 and SD 326 billion in 2008.

SUDAN
Joint World Bank/IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by the staffs of the International Development Association and
the International Monetary Fund
Approved by Vikram Nehru and Sudhir Shetty (World Bank)
and Adam Bennett and Matthew Fisher (IMF)
August 6, 2007

Based on the joint Bank-Fund Low-Income Country Debt Sustainability Framework, this
note assesses the sustainability of Sudan’s total public debt.1 The results confirm that the
country is in debt distress. Under the baseline scenario, all debt ratios, except those for debt
service, remain above their indicative thresholds over the medium- to longer-term, despite
reasonably prudent macroeconomic policies and assumed higher oil revenues over the
projection period. Moreover, with its heavy reliance on oil, Sudan is highly vulnerable to
both oil volume and price shocks as illustrated by a lower oil price scenario. Finally,
Sudan’s debt indicators would decrease if it curtails recourse to any additional
nonconcessional borrowing. It will therefore be critical for Sudan to maintain sound policies
consistent with a prudent borrowing strategy for the medium and long term.

This DSA has been jointly prepared by the Fund and World Bank staff and in collaboration with the Sudanese
authorities.

2
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This is Sudan’s first debt sustainability analysis (DSA) prepared under the new
joint Bank-Fund Low-Income Country (LIC) Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF).
The framework follows a clear methodology for assessing the risk of debt distress in LICs,
based on projections of five debt burden indicators (under both baseline and standardized
stress-test scenarios), namely the net present value (NPV) of external debt-to-GDP ratio; the
NPV of external debt-to-export ratio; the NPV of external debt-to-revenue ratio; debt serviceto-export ratio; and debt service-to-revenue ratio.2 Empirical evidence suggests low-income
countries with a better quality of policies and institutions can sustain a higher level of
external debt. The LIC DSA framework, therefore, compares forecasts of these debt burden
indicators with policy-dependent thresholds using the World Bank’s Country Policy and
Institutional Assessment (CPIA).3
2.
Despite the numerous challenges in implementing various peace agreements,
Sudan has endeavored to maintain a focus on ensuring high levels of economic growth
within an environment of macroeconomic stability. Economic growth was strong in 2006,
reflecting a substantial increase in oil production (albeit less than expected) and a vibrant
non-oil sector. However, 12-month inflation nearly tripled to some 16 percent on account of
an increase in administered prices (fuels and transportation) in the third quarter of 2006, but
the rate declined to single digits by the first quarter of 2007. Partly as a result of the increase
in inflation, the dinar appreciated by some 21 percent in real effective terms in 2006. The
fiscal position deteriorated markedly in 2006 to a deficit of 4.2 percent of GDP, reflecting
mostly a shortfall in oil revenue (relative to budget) linked to Dar blend crude. Similarly, the
external current account position also deteriorated to a deficit of 13.1 percent of GDP
in 2006, contributing to a notable drop in foreign exchange reserves of the central bank,
which in turn led to a slowdown in money and credit growth in the second half of 2006.
II. EVOLUTION AND STRUCTURE OF TOTAL EXTERNAL DEBT
3.
Despite Sudan’s strong economic growth over the last seven years, its external
debt, most of which is in arrears, remains high. Based on the available data, the end-2006
2

Resolving Sudan’s debt overhang remains a high priority for the government. The authorities believe that debt
relief under the HIPC Initiative and the MDRI will play a crucial part in helping Sudan to normalize its relations
with creditors and assume a path to achieving sustainable development goals. This DSA does not address HIPC
eligibility. Sudan is potentially eligible for HIPC and MDRI debt relief. However, determining whether or not it
qualifies for HIPC debt relief will require a HIPC-specific analysis that will be carried on at an appropriate time
in the dialogue with Sudan.

3

The CPIA ranks Sudan as a poor performer, with a 2004–06 average score of 2.6. The policy-dependent debt
burden thresholds for countries in this category are: (a) NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio of 30 percent; (b) NPV of
debt-to-export ratio of 100 percent; (c) NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio of 200 percent; (d) debt service-to-export
ratio of 15 percent; and (e) debt service-to-revenue ratio of 25 percent.

3
stock of public and publicly-guaranteed debt is estimated at US$27 billion in nominal terms
This increase largely reflects a US$6.3 billion buildup in arrears to official bilateral (Paris
Club and non-Paris Club) creditors, and new drawings of some US$520 million from Arab
multilateral and bilateral creditors (mainly from China and India). Sudan has been making
partial debt service payments to almost all multilateral creditors. Sudan has also paid selected
bilateral creditors that have provided new financing in recent years.
4.
The structure of Sudan’s external debt has remained broadly unchanged
since 2000, although there has been an increase in nonconcessional borrowing, mainly
from China and India. In nominal term, roughly two-thirds of end-2006 total external debt
was owed to official bilateral creditors (Text Table 1), which was almost equally divided
between Paris Club and non-Paris

5.
Sudan contracted US$589 million of new nonconcessional loans in 2006, which
adds to the already unsustainable debt burden of the country. Of this contracted total,
US$392 million was from India, US$182 million from China, and a small amount from
Turkey. The total amount of contracted nonconcessional loans was below the IMF staffmonitored program ceiling of US$700 million. Of these contracted loans, only
US$286 million was actually disbursed in 2006. However, the authorities note that their
strategy to foster national unity and peace agreements with Darfur and the eastern region
calls for undertaking substantial infrastructure and investment projects, and that given the
limited fiscal space and lack of access to concessional financing, they have little choice but to
resort to other less desirable means of financing.
III. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
Baseline scenario
6.
The baseline scenario (Tables 1 and 2 and Figure 1), shows that Sudan is in debt
distress. This scenario is based on a set of reasonably prudent macroeconomic assumptions
and oil sector developments presented in Boxes 1 and 2, respectively. The baseline results
indicate that apart from the ratio of NPV of debt-to-revenue from 2009 onwards, all three
debt-burden indicators are expected to remain above their policy-dependent thresholds in the
period 2007–17. The NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to decline from 47 percent
in 2007 to 34 percent in 2017, which is still 4 percentage points higher than the indicative
threshold. The NPV of debt-to-exports is expected to fall from 284 percent in 2007
to 203 percent in 2009, but to increase thereafter to 429 percent in 2017, which is

4
substantially higher than the indicative threshold of 200 percent; this more or less reflects the
projected path of oil exports that shows a noticeable steady decline after 2009. The NPV of
debt-to-revenue is projected to decline from an average of about 240 percent a year in 2007
and 2008 to remain below its threshold of 200 percent through much of the forecast period
through 2012, but is expected to breach the threshold by 7 percentage points in 2017. The
two debt service indicators (debt service-to-exports ratio and debt service-to-revenue ratio)
are expected to remain below their policy-dependent thresholds throughout the forecast
period 2007–27. However, these indicators are misleading in that the macroeconomic
framework for the baseline assumes servicing of only new obligations falling due, including
highly concessional multilateral debt, and no servicing of the more than US$24 billion in
arrears. For example, in 2006, Sudan paid US$352 million in debt service, while accruing
some UD$124 million in additional arrears.
Standardized sensitivity analysis
7.
Under the new sustainability framework, the various standard stress tests
conducted are distinguishable between alternative scenarios, based on permanent
modifications of key baseline assumptions, and bound tests, representing temporary
deviations—although some with permanent level effects. There are two alternative
scenarios: (A1) a historical scenario in which the main variables that determine debt
dynamics (namely, real GDP growth; inflation, measured by changes in the U.S. dollar GDP
deflator; the noninterest external current account in percent of GDP; and nondebt-creating
flows in percent of GDP) are assumed to remain at their 10-year historical averages. This
allows for a realistic comparison of the baseline projections with the country’s own history.
The second alternative scenario (A2) is a financing scenario in which new borrowing is
assumed to be on less favorable terms (a 2 percentage points higher interest rate) throughout
the projection period. The bound tests (B1 through B6) apply two-period/one standard
deviation negative shocks to the key macroeconomic variables (the above-mentioned
parameters plus export growth, a combined one-half deviation shock, and a one-time
30 percent depreciation of the Sudanese pound). The impact of these various stress tests for
the key debt-burden indicators are presented in Table 2 and illustrated in Figure 1.

5

Box 1. Sudan: Macroeconomic Assumptions 2007–27
Real GDP is assumed to grow at an annual average rate of about 12 percent a year
during 2007–09, boosted by further increases in oil production and a continued strong
recovery (10 percent) in the non-oil economy. However, after the strong oil GDP growth, (an
average 26 percent) during the period, the average GDP growth is forecast to fall to
5½ percent per annum during 2010–27. The non-oil sector will benefit in this period from
wide-ranging macroeconomic and structural reforms, especially the financial, social, and
infrastructure improvements, which will help remove impediments to growth and speed up
diversification of the domestic economy. Some of the macroeconomic assumptions are on the
optimistic side, suggesting that the debt situation could be even worse than what is projected
in the analysis.
Exports are projected to grow at a rate of 30 percent a year during 2007–09, reflecting
largely strong oil export performance, and will decline thereafter at an average rate of about
2½ percent per year through 2027. Similarly, oil exports are projected to grow at an average
annual rate of 26½ percent during 2007–09, and then decline at an annual average rate of
almost 12 percent a year through 2027. Although it would peak in 2009, oil is expected to
continue to be the dominant element through much of the forecast period. Its share in total
exports is projected to fall from 95 percent in 2009 to 50 percent in 2021, and further to
17 percent in 2027.
Imports are projected to grow by about 12 percent annually through 2009, reflecting sharp
increases in capital spending, but the average rate is expected to fall to under 6 percent a year
thereafter.
The current account deficit is projected to average about 8½ percent of GDP annually
during 2007–09, but will improve markedly thereafter to an annual average of 3 percent of
GDP through 2007. The improvement in the current account after 2009 is expected to come
from lower imports and stronger net external transfer inflows, mostly driven by remittances.
Meanwhile, net international reserves of the central bank are expected to increase sharply
from US$1.3 billion (1.4 months of imports) in 2007 to US$6.3 billion (3.9 months of
imports) in 2017, and the import coverage is forecast to increase to 4.6 months through 2027.
Debt assumptions include continued repayment of selected creditors on outstanding debt
(and continued accumulation of arrears on other outstanding obligations), and scheduled
amortization and interest obligations on new borrowing. Disbursement of new loans is
projected at about US$300 million per year in the medium term (2008-12) and about
US$380 million on average over the long term (2013-27), with a grant element of just under
35 percent.

6

Box 2. Sudan: Oil Sector Developments
Oil is a dominant sector in Sudan, accounting for almost two-thirds of GDP. Average daily
production rose from 287,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2005 to 364,000 bpd in 2006. While
this increase in output was notable, it was well below the expected level of 492,000 bpd
envisioned at the beginning of the year. Technical problems caused delays in production of
Dar blend from new fields until the fourth quarter of 2006. Many of the technical problems
continued into the first quarter of 2007, limiting production which is now projected to
average about 505,000 (bpd). Assuming some new discoveries, oil production is expected to
average about 730,000 bpd in 2010–13, and the level of output is projected to start a gradual
descent to reach 292,000 bpd by 2027.
Oil currently accounts for about 95 percent of exports and about 50–60 percent of
government revenue. Government oil revenue reached US$4.2 billion in 2006, compared
with US$2.3 billion in 2004, reflecting increases in both production and international prices.

8.
Holding the key debt-dynamics parameters constant over the long term at their
historical averages (scenario A1) produces some deterioration in the downward path of
both debt and debt service indicators relative to the baseline. This reflects the recent
improvement in key macroeconomic aggregates in the past few years (particularly GDP and
export growth) relative to the past decade. Over the projection period, a 2 percentage points
higher interest rate (scenario A2) somewhat flattens the downward path of debt and debt
service ratios in all indicators, except in NPV of debt-to-export ratios which show a marked
deterioration after 2010 through 2017, mapping the declining path of oil exports during this
period. Under these alternative scenarios, however, all of the debt ratios continue to remain
above the indicative thresholds over the next decade.
9.
Among the bounded tests, the one-time 30 percent nominal depreciation relative
to the baseline in 2008 (B6) proved to be the worst scenario for two of the three debt
indicators (the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio and the NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio). It
would cause the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio to reach 60 percent in 2008, before gradually
declining to 34 percent in 2027, which is still 9 percentage points higher than the baseline
and 4 percentage points above the indicative threshold. Similarly, this scenario would cause
the NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio to reach 301 percent in 2008, gradually declining thereafter
to 228 percent in 2027, which is 63 and 28 percentage points above the baseline and
indicative threshold, respectively. In the case of debt- and debt service-to-export ratios, the
most challenging outcome would result from lowering the export value growth at its
historical average minus one standard deviation in 2008–09 (B2). It would result in the ratio
of NPV of debt-to-export to first rise to 370 percent in 2008, reaching 1037 percent in 2017,
before falling to 996 percent in 2027, which is still 535 percentage points above the baseline

7
and some 896 percentage points higher than the indicative threshold. The debt service
indicator produces a similar pattern, climbing to 26 percent (20 and 11 percentage points
above the baseline and the threshold, respectively) in 2017, before falling to 19 percent
(4 percentage points above the indicative threshold) in 2027.
10.
These results indicate that under various shocks, the debt situation would
remain precarious over the next decade, and that there is little room for any slippages
in the implementation of the planned reforms in the fiscal and structural areas. In
addition, in the coming period, improving the debt indicators would depend on obtaining
concessional financing, rather than relying on the more expensive nonconcessional
borrowing.
Customized sensitivity analysis
11.
Oil prices are inherently uncertain and volatile. The baseline scenario uses IMF
World Economic Outlook projections for future oil prices, which are significantly higher
than oil price projections from the World Bank. To analyze the debt dynamics under a
scenario using oil prices closer to the World Bank projections, an additional stress test is
performed using a 20 percent shock to the baseline oil price (scenario A3).
12.
Under this customized scenario, Sudan’s external debt indicators worsen
significantly (Figure 2). Most notably, the debt-to-revenue ratio would remain above
its 200 percent threshold in this case over the entire period through 2017, suggesting longerterm downside risks. Although debt service indicators remain below their thresholds, they
increase significantly due to higher exceptional financing on nonconcessional terms.
IV. TOTAL PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
13.
Under the baseline scenario (Table 3), although the total public sector debt starts
at a relatively high level in 2006 (75 percent of GDP), it falls over the medium term to
reach 55 percent in 2012. This is mainly due to the contribution from high real GDP growth
envisaged for 2007–12, but also from a reduction in the fiscal deficit over the same period.
Public sector debt stocks in NPV terms start at 64 percent in 2006, but falls to 49 percent of
GDP in 2012, and to 39 percent in 2027. The debt service-to-revenue ratio is projected to fall
from 6 percent in 2006 to 5 percent in 2012 and then stay around 5–6 percent thereafter.
14.
Alternative scenarios (Table 4, Figure 3) show that improving Sudan’s public
debt indicators depend on the implementation of reforms to improve the fiscal deficit
and growth, particularly in the non-oil economy. The main results are the following:
•

Under the no reform scenario, where the primary balance is kept unchanged
from 2007 onwards, the NPV of debt-to-GDP would increase to 65 percent in 2017
and the debt service-to-revenue ratio would increase steadily to 11 percent.

8
•

Under the most extreme stress test, where the real GDP growth is at its historical
average minus one standard deviation, the NPV of debt-to-GDP would increase to
81 percent in 2017 and the debt service-to-revenue ratio would increase to 16 percent.
V. CONCLUSIONS

15.
Despite its considerable economic progress since 2000 Sudan is in debt distress.
Sudan’s external debt ratios are well above the country-specific indicative thresholds during
the complete period of analysis. The stress tests indicate that the debt indicators are sensitive
to shocks. The sustainability analysis of total public debt strengthens this assessment. The
vulnerabilities highlighted by the DSA need to be effectively addressed in the coming period
through both proactive public debt and financial management policies.

Sudan should reconsider its external borrowing strategy in light of the future
debt service burden that would follow if it took on high volumes of nonconcessional
debt. Further recourse to such borrowing could also jeopardize Sudan’s access to possible
debt relief.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and r = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that NPV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the NPV of new debt).

Source: Staff projections and simulations.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the
baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after
the shock (implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Exchange Rate Arrangements

The legal tender is the Sudanese dinar, which replaced the Sudanese pound in proportion
SDD 1=LSd 10 in 1999. Since 1998, the exchange rate system has been unified—market
participants trade freely within a unified regulatory framework. In 2001, the Central Bank of
Sudan (CBOS) introduced a formal band of +1.5 percent (later broadened to 2 percent) around the
official rate and began auctioning its foreign exchange within the band. Since May 2003, the
CBOS adopted a managed-floating exchange rate regime with no pre-announced path for the
exchange rate. The formal exchange rate band was abandoned and the auction system was
replaced with direct transactions in the interbank market. The CBOS established an internal limit
of +2 percent in intraday trading in the average daily market rate. In 2004, the CBOS changed the
permissible intraday exchange rate fluctuation from +2 percentage points to +3 percentage points.
Sudan maintains one inoperative bilateral payment agreement with Egypt and an inoperative
payment clearing account with the former Soviet Union. Sudan has maintained a managed float
exchange system since May 2003, and de facto peg since January 2007. The exchange rate system
has been free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions2 until the Bank of Sudan introduced an exchange restriction and multiple currency
practice by imposing a floor on cash margins for letters of credit and import credit in June 2007.
The Bank of Sudan intends to eliminate the measure by end-year.
VIII.

Article IV Consultation

Sudan is on a 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation discussion was
completed by the Executive Board on May 3, 2006 (Country Report No.06/182).

1

The projection of charges and interest assumes that overdue principal at the report date (if any) will remain
outstanding, but that forthcoming obligations will be settled on time.

2

In November 2005, the authorities removed two remaining exchange restrictions subject to Fund approval
under Article VIII, Section 2(a) and 3 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. At that time, they lifted the
exchange restriction that prohibited importers in arrears with valid import licenses from executing payments and
transfers for import transactions and eliminated the multiple currency practice arising from the use of a historic
buying rate for the resale of export proceeds.

IX.

FSAP Participation

The FSAP work took place during October 9–14, 2004 and was completed during December 1–
14, 2004. The Financial System Stability Assessment report was discussed by the Executive
Board on April 29, 2005.
X.

Resident Representative

The Fund’s resident representative office in Khartoum was opened in October 2005, as a
shared post with Djibouti. It was converted to a full post in September 2006.
XI.

Technical Assistance

In January 1995, the Executive Board decided to resume Fund technical assistance to Sudan.
The following table contains a summary of the technical assistance provided since 2002. This
assistance has been provided both from headquarters and from the IMF’s Middle East
Technical Assistance Center (METAC).

ANNEX II. SUDAN: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK1
(As of July 24, 2007)
1.
The World Bank’s International Development Association (IDA) has no active
lending portfolio in Sudan because of Sudan’s default on its financial obligations to IDA,
which led to the suspension of disbursements in April 1993. After discussions between the
Bank and the Sudanese authorities on the need for Sudan to take steps toward normalizing its
relations and establishing a track record with the Bank, the authorities have been making
small, intermittent debt service payments since mid-1999. The amount of payments has not
been sufficient to prevent a continued accumulation of arrears, which stood at about
US$438 million as of July 9, 2007 (from US$145 million at the end of 1999). Sudan’s
outstanding Bank debt, including arrears, is approximately US$1.3 billion.
2.
The Bank was mostly absent from Sudan between 1992 and 2002. In the 1970s
and 1980s, the Bank was a major player in the reconstruction of Sudan, following the Addis
Ababa peace agreement of 1972. As the prospects for peace with the South rose in 2003, the
Bank formulated a strategy for reengaging with Sudan in the event of peace. This strategy,
described in the 2003 Sudan Country Reengagement Note (CRN), emphasized knowledge
generation and sharing, capacity building to support policy reform, demonstration projects to
improve delivery of social services, and the issue of Sudan’s debt overhang.
3.
Following the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), signed on January 9, 2005 by
the Government of Sudan (GoS) and the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM), the
Bank has administered two large Multi-Donor Trust Funds (MDTFs) that support the CPA,
and built up its program of nonlending support. Sixteen international partners2 have pledged a
total of US$561 million to the MDTFs.3 MDTF-supported projects have experienced major
implementation challenges, as have all development and recovery programs in Sudan, but
performance has steadily improved. Significant results are being seen on the ground, though
daunting challenges remain—most notably low capacity, especially at the state level and in
the South.
4.
The World Bank has prepared a Sudan Interim Strategy Note which is scheduled for
discussion by the Bank’s Board on July 31, 2007. The Interim Strategy aims to support the
1

Sudan, Tel. (202) 458-8321.

Netherlands, Norway, UK, EC, Sweden, Germany, Finland, Denmark, Italy, Iceland, Greece, Canada, the
World Bank, France, Egypt, and the Arab League. The World Bank has contributed US$10 million to the
MDTFs through an IDA grant funded out of net income.

7
Government of National Unity (GoNU) and the Government of Southern Sudan (GoSS) to
sustain peace and help reduce conflict by meeting the commitments contained in the
Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA), and Eastern
States Peace Agreement (ESPA), particularly in the areas of governance, basic services, and
pro-poor economic growth—especially in war-affected and marginalized areas. Within its
17 month time frame, the ISN is expected to contribute toward the achievement of the
longer-term strategic vision enshrined in the CPA: promoting the unity of Sudan by making it
attractive through development, shared prosperity, and a reformed and fully developed
system of governance in which all Sudanese are equal stakeholders.
5.
The entry points for Bank support—through management of the MDTFs and
nonlending activities—vary according to the diverse conditions facing different regions of
Sudan. At the National level (excluding Darfur), a focus on stabilizing peace entails a major
role for analytical work and policy dialogue on implementing key provisions of the CPA
(pro-poor growth, good governance and decentralization, empowerment), and—in the Three
Areas and the East—on demonstration projects and building capacity for local service
delivery. In Darfur, the Bank will work with partners, as security allows, to assess
development and recovery needs and to prepare rapid impact interventions for the eventual
end of conflict. In the South, the main focus is on helping to build a strong and viable
government in Southern Sudan based on good governance, rule of law, and transparency,
while promoting efforts to empower and decentralize service delivery to the states, counties,
and communities. Substantial financial support through the MDTFs as well as Bank’s
analytical and advisory services will be mobilized to meet this objective.
6.
IDA’s financial reengagement requires clearance of Sudan’s outstanding arrears. The
clearance of these arrears can only be undertaken once a firm and comprehensive agreement
among preferred creditors is in place. Following the eventual clearance of IDA arrears, which
currently stand at US$438 million, an exceptional IDA allocation for Sudan as a post-conflict
country would be sought, and the Bank would prepare another strategy document which
would include, inter alia, a pipeline of projects. World Bank staff are working with the IMF
and other multilateral creditors to maintain a current database in anticipation of preparing a
comprehensive arrears clearance plan.
7.
Major nonlending products planned or under way include an Investment Climate
Assessment (ICA) focusing on the needs of small firms, a Diagnostic Trade Study, an
Environment and Natural Resources study, and a Country Integrated Fiduciary Assessment
(CIFA), which is particularly important in the context of harmonizing donor practices
regarding public procurement and financial management. The Bank is proposing to undertake
in collaboration with the government a new Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) on propoor growth in an oil economy. The Bank has just completed a Public Expenditure Review
(PER) focusing on increasing pro-poor spending at state and local levels; IMF staff have
contributed to the preparation of the report. The Bank and Fund are also collaborating in the

8
preparation of an updated Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) for Sudan, and Bank staff have
participated in the Fund’s Article IV consultation missions to Sudan.

9
ANNEX III. SUDAN: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Available economic data are sufficient for program monitoring purposes. However,
there are many areas where further improvements are needed, particularly in compiling
national accounts, state budgetary data, and external trade and financial statistics. This
appendix discusses outstanding statistical issues by sector.
2.
As a participant in the Department for International Development (DFID) project for
Anglophone African countries, Sudan has been receiving technical assistance in various
statistical issues. DFID financed three STA missions in June–July 2003 (monetary and
financial statistics, balance of payments statistics, and the General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS) metadata completion), contributing to participation in the GDDS starting in
August 2003. An anniversary letter was sent in August 2005 requesting the authorities to
provide updates to the GDDS metadata. In early 2004, Sudan also received assistance for the
initial stages of preparation of a strategic plan for the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). In
May 2005, an STA/METAC mission assessed the technical assistance needs in
macroeconomic statistics and identified emerging statistical priorities in the statisticsproducing agencies. Since then, follow-up missions on monetary and financial statistics,
balance of payments and national account statistics visited Khartoum to assist the authorities
in further implementing the action plan developed by the mission in 2003.
I. REAL SECTOR
3.
Practices in the production of the monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) have been
commendable in recent years. Monthly CPI data for the Khartoum area are provided shortly
after the end of each month, while the CPI including other states is provided with a threemonth lag. The CBS plans to conduct new household income and expenditure survey in 2007
and will construct the new CPI based on the survey. The new CPI is expected to be released
in 2009.
4.
The compilation of the national accounts is subject to delay. The national accounts
statistics suffer from a lack of basic information for many sectors, including oil, livestock,
horticulture, and most services. On the expenditure side, data are lacking on final
consumption by households, investment, and changes in stocks. There are no national
accounts or industrial production data at sub annual frequencies. There is an urgent need to
increase funding to the CBS and rebuild its capacity. Priorities include introducing
the 1993 System of National Accounts, conducting a census of agricultural production,
carrying out a household survey, producing poverty statistics, and improving coordination
between the CBS, the Ministry of Finance and National Economy (MOFNE), the Ministry of
Energy and Mining, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock. A peripatetic real sector
expert provided some assistance on national accounts, through end-2003.

10
II. FISCAL SECTOR
5.
Government finance statistics reported to MCD are broadly adequate for program
monitoring, with the main revenue, expenditure, and financing items reported on a monthly
basis with a lag of about one month. The reported statistics are for the central government
only, and do not include the states and publicly owned corporations. Data are submitted using
an economic classification and, while the allocation of resources by MOFNE to the various
ministries is reported, their actual expenditures are not. There is an urgent need to improve
accounting and reporting procedures at the MOFNE, introduce the GFS classifications
according to guidelines provided in Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM) 2001,
and implement the technical assistance recommendations on GFS. Data reported for the
Government Finance Statistics Yearbook are weak and cover only budgetary central
government up to 1999. Monthly and quarterly fiscal data are not reported for the
International Financial Statistics (IFS).
III. MONETARY SECTOR
6.
Sudan has received significant technical assistance to improve the collection,
compilation, and dissemination of monetary and financial statistics. The most recent STA
monetary and financial statistics mission took place in July 2007. It conducted a training
course in monetary statistics methodology, and assisted the Bank of Sudan (BOS) in
implementing the ongoing action plan, including the development of data reporting to STA in
the format of the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs) and of a framework for incorporating
data from South Sudan in the monetary statistics for Sudan. The weekly flash report on the
activities of the BOS is consistent with relevant components in the depository corporations
survey as recommended in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual.
7.
In general, the monetary statistics compiled by the BOS are broadly acceptable for
monitoring purposes. However, BOS should complete the harmonization of accounting codes
and network connections as this would further improve the data collection and compilation.
Also, it should work with MOFNE to review and reconcile government accounts held with
the banking system to ensure their appropriate classification in the monetary statistics, and
continue the work on implementing the framework for incorporating South Sudan’s banking
activities into the monetary statistics. Another follow-up mission on monetary and financial
statistics will be considered after the authorities have completed the priority actions
recommended by the July 2007 mission.
IV. EXTERNAL SECTOR
8.
Daily exchange rate data are reported to the Fund with minimal lags. There are
several areas for improvement in the external accounts, particularly with regard to foreign
direct investment, trade, and oil statistics. The BOS’s foreign exchange balances include
reserves earmarked for particular purposes such as medicine, oil, and spare part imports, but

11
the composition of these reserves and their potential usability in the event of a balance of
payment need is not clear. The authorities need to provide clarification on items that qualify
as international reserves in general, and those earmarked reserves in particular, and should be
encouraged to begin compiling the data template on international reserves and foreign
currency liquidity. In this regard, assistance is needed in preparing a detailed foreign
exchange cash flow of the central bank, which will serve as a valuable official reserve
management tool for the monetary authorities.
9.
Regarding import statistics, there are significant discrepancies between the reports
from customs and the BOS. The July 2003 STA mission identified some possible causes and,
in collaboration with the authorities, attempted to reconcile the data. Following up on
the 2005 STA/METAC mission, in September 2006 METAC provided technical assistance in
improving the quality of international investment position (IIP) data. The authorities now
report partial IIP data for 2003-2006 to STA for publication in IFS and BOPSY. Staff from
the BOS participated in a METAC IIP statistics seminar in Cairo in April 2007. The mission
examined progress made in compiling foreign direct investment (FDI) statistics. Inadequate
institutional arrangements for the collection of FDI, including the lack of survey data,
continue to affect the compilation of important balance of payments and IIP data. The
mission also provided training in external debt statistics.
10.
Medium-term oil production projections and data on amortization of private sector
debt need substantial improvement. The authorities have made some progress in improving
oil projections, but appear reluctant to provide more detailed information on the phasing-in
and expected production levels of new blocks and on amortization of debt in the oil sector.

Statement by the Staff Representative
September 7, 2007
1.
The following information has become available since the issuance of the staff report
on August 7. It does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Broad and reserve money growth in July were in line with program targets, but the
growth of credit to the private sector was lower than envisaged, suggesting that the
deterioration of financial sector indicators continues to impact the intermediation function of
the banking system. Net international reserves rebounded by about US$300 million since
May 2007 in line with the target under the staff-monitored program. This increase, which
took place in an environment of a broadly stable nominal exchange rate, suggests that market
pressures have mostly subsided and that central bank intervention in the foreign exchange
market has reverted to replenishing reserves. As of July, 12-month inflation was 8.2 percent.
3.
Preliminary June data show an improvement in the fiscal position during the second
quarter of 2007. The annualized overall deficit decreased from 6.0 percent of GDP at endMarch to 4.8 percent of GDP at end-June. This reflects better revenue performance in the
second quarter, mainly in oil revenues, as well as lower-than-budgeted expenditures.
4.
Finally, the authorities have started to move forward on expenditure control reforms
with the establishment of a Treasury Single Account and the implementation of an interim
agreement between the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank to control current
expenditures while commitment control procedures based on quarterly cash ceilings are
being established in line with FAD recommendations.

Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 07/121
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
October 2, 2007

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with
Sudan
On September 7, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Sudan.1
Background
Economic growth continued to be strong in 2006. Overall real GDP increased by
12 percent, despite a lower growth in oil production than previously projected. Non-oil
GDP increased by roughly 10 percent—buoyed by a continued recovery in agriculture
and strong activity in manufacturing, construction, and services. However, the 12-month
rate of inflation nearly tripled from 5.6 percent in 2005 to 15.7 percent in 2006. A
substantial portion of the price surge was linked to an increase in administered prices
(fuels) in the third quarter of 2006. The rate of inflation declined to 8 percent by
February–March 2007 (largely on the back of a drop in food prices), and has remained
in this range through June.
The fiscal position weakened in 2006, reflecting mostly oil revenue shortfalls. The
overall deficit is estimated to over 4 percent of GDP. Shortfalls in oil revenue—mainly
linked to Dar blend crude—played a key role. However, non-oil revenues were also
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary
is transmitted to the country's authorities.

2
lower than projected due largely to wide use of tax exemptions—notably in the VAT,
customs, and business profit tax. Many of the fiscal difficulties that emerged in 2006
carried over into the first quarter of 2007, due largely to the continued difficulties in the
production and sale of Dar blend oil.
The external current account position deteriorated in 2006, reaching a deficit of roughly
13 percent of GDP. While exports of crude oil rose by some 70 percent in volume terms,
the extremely low price received for Dar blend resulted in an increase of only 24 percent
in value terms. Nonoil exports, meanwhile, declined by some 11 percent in dollar terms.
Imports—particularly of capital goods—surged over the course of the year, reflecting an
increase in foreign investment.
In 2006, monetary growth remained high in the first half of the year but was tightened in
the latter part of the year. Broad money growth ended the year at 27 percent, bolstered
by strong economic growth and further monetization. The dinar appreciated by nearly
13 percent in nominal terms vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, due to the fiscal expansion and
strong capital inflows. In 2007, however, the dinar has remained broadly unchanged.
Important structural reforms were completed in 2006. The fiscal framework of the
national government was converted to GFSM 2001 format, and presented to parliament
for information—a critical step forward in public financial management. A difficult but
necessary reduction in domestic fuel subsidies was accomplished in August 2006.
Executive Board Assessment
Following several years of good performance, policy slippages contributed to weaker
fiscal and external sector positions in late 2006 and early 2007, and significant risks to
Sudan’s macroeconomic and financial stability emerged. Against this background,
Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to implement the necessary corrective
measures envisaged in the new 18-month staff-monitored program (SMP), which aims
at restoring fiscal discipline and ensuring stability while supporting continued strong
economic growth. Directors stressed that successful implementation of the peace
agreement will be crucial for the social and economic advancement of Sudan.
Directors noted that the authorities’ program to meet the twin objectives of boosting
expenditures to address development needs while maintaining macroeconomic stability
will require improved expenditure management and more transparent budget execution,
combined with bold fiscal reforms to increase revenues. They welcomed the authorities’
recent efforts to tighten fiscal policy, including through reducing fuel subsidies.
Broadening the tax base by reducing exemptions and incentives and improving tax
administration, as well as conservative revenue forecasting, will be key to ensuring
macroeconomic stability. Directors called for improved transparency in oil sector
revenues.

3
Directors considered that the conduct of monetary policy going forward will likely be
challenging in the context of higher and more volatile capital inflows and oil revenues.
They urged the authorities to monitor developments to ensure that money growth
remains in line with the inflation objectives. The conduct of monetary policy will also
need to rely increasingly on open market operations, with an emphasis on indirect
monetary policy instruments.
Directors noted that over the past year Sudan’s de facto exchange rate regime shifted
from a managed float to a peg, which required heavy central bank intervention and led
to an uncomfortably low level of foreign exchange reserves. Against this background,
Directors welcomed the authorities’ decision to allow greater exchange rate flexibility
and to rebuild reserves. They welcomed the authorities’ intention to eliminate the
exchange restriction and multiple currency practice arising from the imposition of a floor
on cash margins for letters of credit and import credit before the end of 2007.
Directors underlined the importance of implementing structural reforms aimed at
strengthening competitiveness, reducing poverty, and bolstering non-oil growth. In
particular, they welcomed the authorities’ plans to modernize the judicial system and
simplify legal and administrative procedures to improve the climate for domestic and
foreign investment. Directors looked forward to the completion of the draft PRSP in early
2008.
Directors considered that sustained economic growth will require deeper financial
intermediation and, in this context, expressed concern about the deterioration in
financial sector indicators. They stressed the importance of preparing a
resolution/restructuring strategy for the state-owned Omdurman Bank based on the
results of the forthcoming independent audit. Directors also called on the central bank to
actively enforce prudential standards and ensure that banks comply with regulations on
capitalization and provisioning.
Directors welcomed Sudan’s record of cooperation on economic policies and payments
to the Fund, and a number of Directors called for a further increase in repayments. A
number of Directors urged the authorities to allocate their payments to cover the
General Resources Account (GRA) charges as they arise, while recognizing Sudan’s
right to attribute such payments to overdue GRA principal. While acknowledging
Sudan’s considerable reconstruction and development needs, many Directors urged the
authorities to minimize nonconcessional borrowing in view of Sudan’s already
unsustainable external debt burden and to avoid complications in a potential debt-relief
operation. A number of Directors would have preferred a zero ceiling on
nonconcessional borrowing in the SMP. Directors recalled that under the HIPC Initiative,
all creditors will be expected to contribute to the restoration of debt sustainability.
Directors generally considered that the new SMP would serve as a valuable tool to
support the reform momentum, and welcomed the program’s measures to reduce the
budget deficit, address critical weaknesses in public financial management, rebuild

4
international reserves, and tackle difficult problems in the banking system. A number of
Directors noted that the expected reliance on nonconcessional borrowing would not
allow them to consider the SMP as constituting part of a satisfactory track record for
HIPC or MDRI purposes. However, some other Directors felt that Sudan’s performance
under successive SMPs should be reflected in the timetable for arrears clearance, and
called for a timely and clear road map in this respect.

Statement by Peter Gakunu, Executive Director for Sudan
and Ebson Uanguta, Advisor to Executive Director
September 7, 2007
1.
The Sudanese authorities are appreciative of the Fund’s engagement and support.
They reiterate their commitment to maintaining sound macroeconomic stability and
advancing the ambitious reform agenda, which focuses on fiscal and financial sector reforms.
They appreciate the candid exchange of views with staff during the 2007 Article IV
Consultation and the Staff-Monitored Program discussions. They find the staff report as
informative, fair and well balanced on the country’s economic policies, challenges and
prospects.
Progress on Implementation of the CPA and Darfur Negotiations
2.
The authorities continue to make significant progress in the implementation of a
number of key areas of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA). All the commissions
mandated in the CPA have now been formed, except three, namely the National Human
Rights Commission, the Electoral Commission, and the Land Commission which are in
process. The draft bills on these bodies have already been finalized and are waiting to be
tabled to the National Assembly scheduled to reconvene in October 2007. The introduction
of the new currency at the beginning of this year which was completed as of end-June 2007
is an important step to integrate fully the economy of the South Sudan with the rest of the
country and further consolidate reform and broaden macroeconomic management. The recent
agreement by the authorities on the deployment of the UN/AU hybrid force in Darfur
demonstrates the authorities’ commitment in finding a long-lasting peace in Sudan.
3.
However, it is important to recognize that the implementation of the peace
agreements has been delayed partly by some key donor partners who fail to fulfill their
pledges of support to the peace process. Consequently, since mid-last year the need to fulfill
peace commitments was putting intense pressure on the meager resources of the
Government. In this regard, the fiscal expenditures started rising which partly resulted in the
unprecedented high budgeted deficit for the fiscal year 2007. Nevertheless, the authorities
managed to make the necessary adjustment to reduce the estimated deficit to less than 4
percent of GDP.
4.
Completion of the HIPC process and MDRI would go a long way in assisting the
country to normalize its relations with creditors and assume a path to achieving sustainable
development goals. Sudan’s strong track record on policy implementation under successive
SMPs and continuous cooperation in payments to the Fund augur well for a comprehensive
approach to solve arrears problem.

2
Recent Economic Developments and Prospects
5.
Notwithstanding numerous challenges in implementing various peace agreements, the
Sudanese authorities have endeavored to maintain a focus on ensuring high levels of
economic growth within an environment of macroeconomic stability. Growth has been
robust, inflation kept under control, and the country remains one of the strongest in terms of
attracting foreign investment. The Sudanese economy achieved a growth rate of about
11 percent in 2006, driven mainly by increase in oil production. Non-oil growth was also
strong, due in large part to a continued recovery in agriculture, and vibrant activity in
construction, trade, and services. Average inflation was contained at 7.2 percent. However,
the strong fiscal expansion prompted the monetary authority to use foreign exchange reserves
to mop up domestic liquidity and that partly contributed to low level of reserves ( less than a
month of imports), in addition to lower oil revenues and intervention in Omdurman bank.
The recent developments of reserves build up to more than one month of imports, positive
adjustment in expenditures and further decline in inflation during the month of June 2007
confirm the authorities’ commitment to restore and further consolidate macroeconomic
stability.
Fiscal Policy
6.
The authorities are faced with the challenges of meeting the twin objectives of higher
expenditures for development needs and macroeconomic stability. They remain committed to
maintaining prudent fiscal policies to ensure macroeconomic stability and to address the
imbalances that emerged in the last part of 2006 and early 2007.
7.
On the revenue side, the authorities are fully aware of the risks associated with oil
revenue projections given the volatility of international oil prices, and the uncertainties with
respect to production and shipment. It is for this reason that the Oil Saving Account has been
established to smoothen out risks and volatility and to help improve expenditure and revenue
management. The authorities are committed to raising revenues over the medium–term
through specific fiscal reform measures, including raising VAT rate, reduction of the VAT
exemptions and income tax holidays, among others. The general organizational structure
reform of Tax Chamber, including the establishment of revenue collection centers countrywide would also be complementing these revenue enhancing efforts.
8.
Fiscal expenditure has risen significantly in recent years, reflecting priority
reconstruction needs and increases in transfers to states in an effort to support
decentralization. While continuing to support these objectives, they are cognizant of the
likely adverse impact of fiscal expansion on macroeconomic stability. The expenditure
policies for 2007-08 will focus on maintaining a tighter balance between spending and
available resources. A number of measures would be put in place to bolster expenditure
management, including controls that limit expenditures by line ministries to cash plans rather

3
than budgeted allocations; centralized Treasury Single Account, and contingency measures
for expenditure cuts in the event that projected revenues fail to materialize. The authorities
also agreed to halt the use of sanadats, standing orders and other nontraditional forms of
finance, and to carefully monitor the existing stock of such instruments with a view to their
eventual extinction.
9.
Despite Sudan’s strong economic growth over the last seven years, its external debt,
most of which is in arrears, remains high. In this light, resolving Sudan’s debt overhang
remains a high priority for the authorities. The authorities noted that notwithstanding Sudan’s
superb economic performance and satisfactory cooperation with the Fund, the progress
towards resolving the debt problem has been slow, uneven and frustrating to say the least.
The authorities believe that debt relief under the HIPC Initiative and the MDRI will play a
crucial part in helping Sudan to resolve its debt and enable them to assume a path to
achieving sustainable development goals.
10.
On the structural issues, the authorities are committed to further strengthen public
expenditure management, through recently adopted measures to control expenditures and
improve budget execution, as well as implementing the full economic and functional
classification of the GFSM 2001 for 2008 budget. The authorities view the continuing
Technical Assistance as important as it supports the effective implementation of planned
measures. Required TA should therefore be made available from the Fund, World Bank and
other stakeholders.
Monetary, Exchange Rate, and Financial Sector Policies
11.
The authorities will continue to maintain a focus on price stability as their central
mandate, in the context of a managed float exchange rate system. The Sudanese Pound will
be allowed to move in line with fundamentals, with intervention being limited to smoothing
transitory overshooting of the exchange rate. My authorities will be moving away in the
coming months from the use of direct instruments and rely more on open market operations
with an emphasis on indirect monetary policy instruments. As part of this process the central
bank will acquire government securities from the banking system to consolidate its stocks of
indirect monetary policy instruments. They will continue to monitor closely the monetary
developments to ensure that broad money growth rate remain in line with the target and
inflation objective.
12.
The authorities agree with staff’s assessment that sustaining strong growth will
require a greater role for financial sector to channel savings into needed investment.
Continued financial sector reform and development is an essential pillar for Sudan’s medium
and long term prospects. The short term reforms would be dominated by improvements to
ensure the soundness of the banking system. The authorities have already undertaken
measures to restructure the banking system, including implementation of an overhaul strategy
for one of the largest bank in the country, Omdurman Bank. The swift response from the
authorities through liquidity injection, replacement of the board and executive management

4
restored confidence in the Omdurman bank and prevented the experienced by the bank from
spilling-over to the rest of the banking system. The Central Bank of Sudan has put in place
measures to strengthen and enforce prudential standards and ensure that banks comply with
existing regulations. The medium to long term financial reform in Sudan will focus on
measures to achieve a more efficient channeling of savings to investment, and the integration
of the financial sector of the North and South. The introduction of the new currency
constitutes an important step toward realizing these objectives.
Non-Concessional Borrowing
13.
One of the challenging issues confronting the Sudanese authorities is lack of access to
concessional borrowing. The authorities do not consider it prudent to borrow on nonconcessional terms. However, their limited fiscal space, the lack of access to more traditional
forms of concessional finance, and pressing development needs associated with various
peace agreements and unification make nonconcessional borrowing the only feasible
recourse. The authorities also see a gradual improvement in terms of concessional borrowing
compared to three years ago.
14.
They emphasize that most of the non-concessional borrowing contracted was directly
linked to financing infrastructure development and social development projects, such as
power, water supply and transportation. They have been very transparent on the use of all
non-concessional loans. The provision of these services is an essential component for the
overall strategy to unite the country after the signing of multiple peace agreements.
Recognizing the risks this kind of borrowing may pose to medium and long term prospects as
well as the possibility of jeopardizing the country’s access to possible debt relief, the
authorities agreed on the borrowing limit ceiling of US$700 million, which was fulfilled for
2006 and they are committed to imposing and complying with a similar limit in 2007 and
2008.
Structural Reforms
15.
The fiscal reforms undertaken by the authorities to improve the revenue base,
including reduction of VAT exemptions and income tax holidays is a step in the right
direction. The authorities agree that improvement in tax policy and administration would not
only create a more stable revenue base and lessen dependence on volatile oil receipts, but
will also enable government to address major economic challenges on infrastructure
development and poverty reduction.
16.
Lack of external competitiveness cannot be entirely blamed on strong domestic
currency alone; productivity factors also play a major role. In this regard, the authorities are
committed and are already undertaking measures to address some of these structural
problems affecting the non-oil exports, including poor quality, enhance the role of the
National Agency for Insurance and Exports Financing and rigidity in labor market, among

5
others. The Green Revolution project launched recently by the government should go a long
way towards transforming agriculture from subsistence and traditional ways of farming to a
commercial exports competitive sector.
Conclusions
17.
The authorities reaffirm their strong commitment to prudent macroeconomic policies
aimed at sustaining growth, employment creation and poverty reduction. They recognize the
challenges in balancing the expenditure needs of the peace process and maintaining
macroeconomic stability as crucial for Sudan in going forward. The country’s debt overhang
continues to remain a thorny issue in the efforts to address critical poverty and reconstruction
needs. They remain, however, hopeful that the international community will recognize
Sudan’s track record, and take tangible actions on debt relief for Sudan comparable to that
provided to other countries in similar circumstances.
