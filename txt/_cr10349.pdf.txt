Executive Summary
Focus: Following the expiration of their previous PSI, the authorities have requested a
15-month PSI supported program, which will allow the new government to assess the form
of its future engagement with the Fund after elections in 2011. The authorities remain firmly
committed to macroeconomic stability and view the program as a useful macroeconomic
anchor, which would focus on keeping net domestic debt low and building international
reserves.
Assessment: Cape Verde weathered the global economic crisis relatively well because of the
fiscal and reserves buffers built before the crisis and due to counter-cyclical macroeconomic
policies. Their temporary public investment boom, which is mainly foreign-financed, makes
use of the concessional resources that are available over the next few years as the country
transitions to a middle-income economy. Staff supports the request for a new PSI supported
program.
Policy discussions:


Fiscal policy. The key policy challenge will be to execute the public investment program
efficiently, and exit from the fiscal stimulus over the next few years as planned to
maintain debt sustainability.



Monetary policy. Despite a large spread with the Euribor, the central bank remains
cautious of monetary easing as it seeks to stabilize inflows of emigrant deposits and to
reinforce the buildup of foreign exchange reserves.



Structural reforms. Reforms will focus on improving debt management capability;
strengthening monetary operations; and safeguarding financial sector stability.

Exchange rate regime: Conventional peg to the euro.

Discussions took place during September 15–28, 2010. The team comprised Valerie Cerra (head), Abdullah AlHassan, Fabiano Bastos, and Jean-Baptiste Le Hen. The mission met with Cristina Duarte, Minister of Finance;
Carlos Burgo, Governor of the Bank of Cape Verde; other government officials; and representatives of the private
sector. The mission conducted outreach activities with the press and other members of the local community.

INTRODUCTION

1.
Performance under the 2006–10 Policy Support Instrument (PSI) was strong.
International reserves grew to over four months of imports and net domestic debt declined to less
than 20 percent of GDP. A prudent fiscal stance during the first years of the program allowed
effective counter-cyclical policies in 2008–09 when the global crisis hit.
Box 1. Successes of the Previous PSI
In 2006, after completion of a three-year PRGF arrangement, Cape Verde obtained a
three-year PSI supported program, which was extended by one year in 2009. Under this
previous PSI, covering the period 2006–10, policy measures enhanced macroeconomic
performance in several areas, including: (i) reducing public debt, (ii) building
international reserves, (iii) improving tax policies and public financial management, and
(iv) strengthening regulatory capacity in the financial sector.
A key reason for the success of the previous PSI was the authorities‘ ability to leverage its
own reform agenda taking advantage of the technical discussions, structural benchmarks,
and performance criteria associated with the program. PSI-supported policies helped to
consolidate macroeconomic stability, which is at the center of the government‘s poverty
reduction strategy.

2.
The authorities are requesting a new 15-month PSI. Legislative and presidential
elections are scheduled for early 2011, and the authorities have requested a 15-month PSI
supported program, which will allow the new government to assess the form of its future
engagement with the Fund after elections in 2011. With only a notional budget for 2011, they
consider the macroeconomic framework and conditionality of the PSI supported program as
useful policy anchors.2 The new program would continue to focus on macroeconomic stability,
and build on the successes of the previous program.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK

A. Recovering from the Global Slowdown
3.
Economic growth in 2010 shows signs of a solid recovery. In recent months, both
quantitative and qualitative economic indicators point to clear signs of recovery in economic
activity. Leading economic indicators, such as the economic climate indicator and confidence
indicators by economic sectors, reveal a favorable performance in the first half of 2010. Lower
prices in the tourism industry have sustained growth in hotel nights and visiting guests. In the
transportation sector, passenger arrivals and cargo activities have been robust. High growth in

The national assembly will not vote on a budget for 2011 until the new government is formed, which is unlikely
until mid–2011. In the meantime, budget execution will follow the medium term fiscal framework (MTFF) that was
included in the budget write up and attached to the submission of the 2010 budget to the national assembly.

Inflation edged up in recent months, but remains low and the real value of the
escudo remains competitive. Inflation has increased to 3.0 percent in the 12 months to August
2010, mainly because of higher prices in service activities (i.e. restaurants and transportation
sectors) and food. The implementation of the public investment program (PIP) should continue to
have little effect on domestic inflation due to the high import content of investment in terms of
inputs of goods, labor, and other services. The nominal effective exchange rate depreciated
slightly in recent months due to the peg to the euro, which has depreciated relative to the dollar.
The real effective exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals (Box 2).

International trade and financial inflows are improving in the first half of 2010.
Merchandise imports grew by approximately 5 percent when compared to the same period of the
previous year. Service exports grew modestly, but hotel operators are reporting high advanced
booking rates through the high season in the remainder of the year. Merchandise exports have
achieved substantial growth (around 70 percent, although from a small base), mainly driven by
fishery products. In the financial account, FDI has stabilized and strong pace of official
disbursements should contribute to a positive overall balance of payments in 2010.

Box 2. Assessment of the Exchange Rate
Cape Verde has a fixed exchange rate regime, with a peg to the euro. The competitiveness of the
escudo was assessed using three alternative approaches based on the IMF‘s methodology, adapted
for Cape Verde‘s specific circumstances, and using medium-term fundamentals (projections for
2014).3 Although the analysis has a high degree of uncertainty and is sensitive to methodological
differences, the evidence shows that the escudo is broadly aligned with its fundamentals.

The equilibrium real exchange rate approach (ERER) estimates a reduced-form relationship
between the REER and macroeconomic fundamentals (e.g. relative productivity as proxied by GDP
at a purchasing power parity exchange rate per unit of labor; terms of trade; government
consumption to GDP; Net Foreign Asset (NFA); aid inflows; and remittances). The ERER suggests
the exchange rate is undervalued by about 12.5 percent.
The macro-balance approach (MB) estimates an equilibrium current account balance (i.e. norm)
as function of macroeconomic fundamentals (e.g. relative old age dependency; relative
population growth; relative income; relative income growth; relative fiscal balance; oil trade
balance; initial NFA; aid inflows; and remittances) and estimates the change in the exchange rate
necessary to adjust the underlying current account to the norm. This approach suggests a small gap
of -2.4 percent of GDP between the current account norm and the underlying current account in
2014, implying an exchange rate overvaluation of 9 percent. Large negative current account norm is
due to low level of NFA and relatively young population, which reduce national savings and hence
current account balance.
The external sustainability approach (ES) computes the current account needed to stabilize the
net foreign position at a benchmark level, and then estimates the exchange rate change required to
adjust the underlying current account to this norm. Based on the medium-term average projections
for real growth, the ES suggests a small gap of -1.6 percent of GDP, implying an exchange rate
overvaluation of 6.2 percent.
An appropriate assessment of Cape Verde’s external competitiveness also needs to take into
account the country’s main export industry: tourism. During the depths of the global financial
crisis, the tourist industry demonstrated its considerable price flexibility as hotels slashed prices to
adjust to the demand shock and, in doing so, maintained solid growth in number of hotel nights.
Cape Verde‘s export growth potential in the tourist sector hinges on alleviating bottlenecks in
supporting infrastructure, particularly ports, airports, electricity, and water.

3

The exchange rate assessment used a template and dataset by Burcu Aydin (2010), IMF working paper 10/162,
which extends the CGER methodology to include a few fundamentals specific to Africa.

7
B. Risks to the Outlook
6.
Risks to the outlook are broadly balanced. Growth is projected to pick up in 2010 and
gather momentum over the medium term as global conditions improve. Private capital inflows,
particularly FDI, are expected to improve, but the current account balance will likely decline
significantly in 2010–11 due to the high import content of the PIP. The PIP should nonetheless
support medium-term growth, with a significant upside potential for crowding in private sector
investment, especially in the tourist industry. However, Cape Verde has strong links to Europe
through official lending, tourism, FDI, and remittances. Thus, the deterioration of European
conditions in recent months has amplified downside risks, and austerity measures in donor
countries could have some negative effects on tourism as well as disbursements and approval of
new projects.
III.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS: REBUILDING BUFFERS AND DEVELOPING MARKETS
A. Improving Infrastructure While Maintaining Fiscal Sustainability

Accelerating the public investment program
7.
Large fiscal and current account deficits over 2009–12 reflect a temporary
acceleration of the public investment program as counter-cyclical stimulus. The authorities
have taken advantage of a transitional window for concessional external financing following
graduation to middle-income status and the need for countercyclical stimulus to accelerate their
PIP.4 The PIP aims to alleviate infrastructure bottlenecks, including those that hinder
development of the tourism sector, and to support progress on social policies. The IMF has
supported this strategy, which is contributing to a temporary deterioration of fiscal balances
relative to those planned before the crisis (e.g., the fifth PSI review in 2008).5 Likewise, the large
temporary current account deficits reflect higher imports associated with public investment.
Despite this temporary deterioration of fiscal and external balances, Cape Verde‘s
macroeconomic fundamentals are broadly stable and sustainable, and meet the PSI requirements:
(i) the large fiscal and current account deficits are financed by one-off concessional resources;
(ii) absent any capital spending financed externally (through loans and grants), Cape Verde
would realize fiscal surpluses and small current account deficits, in line with PSI requirements,
and would compare favorably with other PSI cases; (iii) the feasibility study show that the
projects should bring significant value added and revenues in the medium term.

4

With Cape Verde‘s graduation from least-developed-country status, donors have provided a transitional period for
concessional funding over several years. The authorities are using this window of opportunity to finance as much as
possible of the infrastructure investment needs on favorable terms. The World Bank and outside consultants have
appraised large projects.
5

The deterioration also reflects lower revenue associated with the economic slowdown. Domestic revenue is
approximately 1½ percent of GDP lower in 2010–11 in the current projections relative to projections from the fifth
review in 2008, and is only partially offset by lower domestic expenditures.

8
8.
The authorities are confident of a high rate of project implementation in 2010.
Preliminary data suggest an execution rate of public investment of 46 percent at end-August. The
authorities expect the implementation rate to accelerate through the remainder of the year and
they project capital spending at 22.6 percent of GDP for 2010.

1/ All foreign financing (grants and

loans) related to the public investment is taken out over the entire period.
This highlights the weight of externally-financed investment on the fiscal and external balances.

9.
The public investment program aims to achieve national development objectives for
increasing growth, diversifying the economy, and protecting vulnerable groups. The
authorities have completed cost-benefit assessments for all projects, most often in partnership
with donors or lenders. Staff supports the objectives of the investment program, noting that many
of the projects should enhance competitiveness by relieving infrastructure bottlenecks that act as
a cost to business. Staff nonetheless underscores the need for judicious selection and transparent
implementation of projects. Thus, staff advised the authorities to exercise caution in agreeing to
foreign loans with procurement requirements tied to the donor in order to minimize costs and to
crowd in domestic provision from the private sector.
Maintaining external debt sustainability
10.
The authorities are cognizant of the need to manage external debt well and
safeguard debt sustainability (MEFP ¶ 5). They are committed to taking advantage of their

9
window of opportunity for obtaining concessional financing for the public investment program.
Indeed, with low interest rates and long grace periods and maturities, debt service ratios remain
very low, minimizing liquidity and solvency risks. The rapid implementation of the PIP during
2009–12 would attenuate the impact of the global slowdown and would provide the foundation
for sustained medium-term growth, which should enhance repayment capability. Nonetheless,
given the prospect of a gradual move to non-concessional financing in the medium run, the
authorities wish to make debt management a key element of the new PSI supported program.
Staff concurs, but also emphasizes the need to rebuild fiscal policy buffers following the rise in
debt stocks relative to before the crisis. Thus, to provide fiscal space for adjusting to future
shocks, staff stressed that the authorities should avoid incurring any new foreign borrowing
beyond that already planned and included in the current debt sustainability analysis (see DSA
supplement). Scaling back spending in the medium-run would also provide breathing space to
ensure that the current investment generates the expected growth dividends.
B. Supporting the Exchange Rate Peg
Keeping domestic debt low
11.
Fiscal policy contributes to protecting the peg by keeping net domestic debt low
(MEFP ¶ 4). Cape Verde made commendable progress in reducing the stock of net domestic debt
below 20 percent of GDP during the 2006–10 PSI. The authorities achieved their objective two
years ahead of schedule. Staff projects net domestic debt to stay below 20 percent of GDP in
2010 and 2011, but the debt ratio increases slightly. Staff agreed with the need to keep net
domestic debt low, and advised resisting pressure on domestic borrowing as external financing is
scaled back over the medium term.
12.
Faced with weak revenue, the government has been holding current expenditure
below budget in 2010 to minimize the need for domestic borrowing. Despite an acceleration
in VAT collection, tax revenues have been below budget through August, reflecting weaker
activity than foreseen at the time of the MTFF and 2010 budget preparation. In response, the
authorities have stepped up the collection of tax arrears (MEFP ¶ 6). They also took bold
measures to curb current spending—despite pressures during an election year—including by
freezing new hiring in the public sector. The authorities have held down spending on wages and
salaries, and domestically financed capital spending, but they have protected social spending such
as pensions and subsidies to the poor. In the remaining months of the year, domestic revenues are
expected to accelerate slightly and additional budget support from the European Union should
contribute to higher grants.

Monetary policy is geared toward
8
maintaining the euro peg. The BCV raised
its policy rate during the international crisis
6
reflecting heightened global risk premia. In
4
spite of the severe shock, foreign reserves fell
2
only marginally and the peg held firm. Global
risk indicators (such as the EMBI spread)
0
subsequently dropped, but the BCV has been
cautious in its response. It reduced its policy
Euribor (2 week)
rate only in January 2010 by one percentage
point to 4.25, and the spread with the Euribor remains large.

EMBI global spread

14.
To support the peg, monetary policy focuses on ensuring gradual reserve
accumulation (MEFP ¶ 9). The BCV has set a high minimum reserve requirement and a policy
rate well above Euribor. The authorities view this restrictive monetary stance as necessary to
encourage inflows of emigrant deposits, which respond gradually and at long and variable lags to
interest rates, and to restrain private sector credit that would fuel imports. They are cautious
about lowering the policy rate and reserve requirements until foreign reserve accumulation is
definite and the global environment rebounds.6 Staff supports the BCV‘s cautious monetary
stance given the benefit of further building foreign reserve buffers and the current uncertain
global environment. Staff also agreed to support efforts to better understand the monetary
transmission mechanism, particularly the impact of interest rate changes on emigrant deposits
and foreign reserves, to improve policy effectiveness. Staff advised to closely monitor the

11
composition of capital flows and adopt macro-prudential regulations to minimize risks associated
with interest-rate sensitive inflows. To reduce distortions to financial intermediation, staff also
recommended to reduce the minimum reserve requirement or allow treasury securities to satisfy
part of the requirement.
15.
The BCV considers their monetary framework to be procyclical. An economic
slowdown in Cape Verde‘s main trading partners in Europe would call for a tighter monetary
stance at home to offset the impact of sluggish export growth on the balance of payments and
reserves. Thus, even though limited capital mobility may provide some scope for independent
monetary policy, the BCV cannot exploit it given the required focus on stabilizing the balance
of payments. While agreeing that a larger reserve buffer should be accumulated at the rate of
0.1 month of imports per year, staff argued that prudent fiscal policies should be the main
instrument for reserve accumulation.
C. Safeguarding Financial Stability and Developing Markets
16.
Though the onshore banking sector remains sound, the crisis spawned some
vulnerabilities. The overall capital adequacy ratio of onshore banks stood at about 12 percent at
end-June 2010 (Table 8). Two banks fell below the minimum regulatory capital requirements,
due to connected lending and off-balance sheet transactions. Asset quality and profitability
sharply deteriorated because of spillover effects from the global crisis, which affected foreigners‘
second-home real estate market and the construction sector. 7 Higher provisions also contributed
to the decline in profitability. However, funding held up well. Emigrant deposits—which
constitute about 37 percent of the total banking sector deposits and originate predominately from
Portugal, France, and the United States—remained steady and grew by over 5 percent (y-o-y).
Although the first and third largest domestic banks are majority-owned by a Portuguese state
bank, which had a favorable result in the recent European Union stress tests, parent funding of
domestic banks is relatively small.
17.
The authorities are making progress to safeguard financial stability (MEFP ¶ 12–13).
The draft new banking law, under discussion by the council of ministers, would bring all banks
under a single banking law; thereby leveling the playing field and increasing competitiveness
within the sector. The BCV is in the process of producing the first financial stability report on an
annual basis. The regulatory and supervisory framework is being improved by: (i) establishing a
macroprudential unit within the BCV; (ii) moving gradually toward risk-based supervision;
(iii) enhancing both the off-site and on-site supervision procedures; (iv) strengthening the skills
of the banking supervision staff; (v) developing prudential regulations on interest rate, foreign
exchange, and credit risks; and (vi) strengthening IT systems to facilitate effective supervision.
Staff supported the BCV‘s plan to expand and formalize the standing financial stability
committee to include the Ministry of Finance (MoF) in a memorandum of understanding (MoU).
7

NPLs should be interpreted with caution since a loan is considered nonperforming if it is only one day overdue.
For instance, as of May 2010, NPLs of one of the commercial banks would decline from 7.6 percent to 4 percent if
restated according to the common practice of 90 days overdue.

12
The MoU should set out an action plan to distribute duties for financial stability between the
BCV and MoF and develop an effective public communication strategy.
18.
Staff urged the BCV to continue to enhance banking supervision. The short-lived
episodes of non-compliance with the regulatory capital requirements are a source of concern.8
One bank was marginally under-capitalized, while another bank (with relatively small market
share) was under corrective actions. The BCV should enhance its supervisory framework to allow
for detection of potential banks weaknesses and take corrective actions at an early stage. A
deeper understanding of each bank‘s strategy and business model should complement current
compliance-based supervision. Additionally, with high interest rates, onshore banks have started
attracting non-resident deposits, which are exempt from reserve requirements. The authorities
and staff agreed on imposing a punitive minimum reserve requirement and adopting prudential
regulations to minimize any destabilizing capital inflows.9
19.
The authorities continue to develop primary and secondary markets for government
securities, and enhance monetary operations (MEFP ¶ 10–11, Box 3). Issuing fungible
securities at a uniform price in the primary market and publishing the auction calendar well in
advance are important steps for fostering a liquid debt market. Staff also supports the authorities‘
fiscal-monetary coordination agreement to use treasury securities as the main instrument of
monetary policy, and thereby enhance the effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism.
Furthermore, as the National Social Security Institute (INPS) dominates and distorts the primary
market for government securities, staff urged the authorities to improve the process of auction
assignment by allowing the INPS to participate in the non-competitive group. Equally important,
the INPS should finalize its investment policy guidance, including investing some of its portfolio
abroad, and set up an investment committee.

BCV‘s recognition of these lapses was impeded by the transition to the International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS), which was completed only in June.

Emigrant deposits are classified as resident deposits.

Box 3. Liquidity Management and Monetary Operations
Although the fixed exchange rate regime limits the room for conducting independent
monetary policy, the BCV can still play a role in liquidity management. High and volatile
excess liquidity in the banking sector has complicated liquidity management, and discourages
interbank transactions. The BCV has relied on open-market operations to sterilize excess
liquidity using BCV bills, and has set high reserve requirements (16 percent of deposits).
A liquid debt market and market-based instruments could facilitate liquidity
management and monetary operations. Government bonds are still not fungible, and the
primary market is dominated by the INPS, thereby creating market fragmentation and limiting
liquidity in the secondary market. The recent reforms to improve the government primary
market and use the treasury securities as the main instrument for monetary operations (MEFP ¶
10 and 13) will help foster a liquid debt market. In addition, a sound liquidity management
framework will encourage financial market development and enhance the monetary
transmission mechanism. To accomplish this, the deposit and lending facilities at the BCV
could be improved by allowing repo and reverse repo operations (using treasury securities) to
absorb and inject liquidity in the financial system. The interest rates on those facilities would
set a corridor on market interest rates. Additionally, the BCV could consider allowing treasury
securities to satisfy part of the required reserves and/or remunerate required reserves.

D. Reducing Fiscal Risk in State-Owned Enterprises
20.
The fiscal risk arising from state owned enterprises is still a challenge that needs to
be addressed (MEFP ¶ 7). The government has undertaken reforms to the loss-making public
electricity and airline companies, but with no drastic improvement in profitability. The recent
Law of State Enterprises and Public Managers provides a framework for better management of
SOEs. To reap the benefit of the framework, the authorities plan to introduce and enforce
managerial incentive contracts linked to enterprise performance. Short-term efforts will also
focus on improving operational and commercial efficiency within the firms.10 The staff urged
authorities to move forward with this reform agenda. Staff considered that private sector
involvement can also help to restore profitability, as long as public-private contracts are well
designed and appropriately share costs and risks.
E. Social Policies to Protect the Vulnerable
21.
PSI-supported policies contributed to the strong record of social development in
Cape Verde (Box 4). Cape Verdean authorities have a long-standing commitment to social
development. The Poverty Reduction Strategy documents have reaffirmed this commitment by
pursuing a multi-pronged development approach to address priority areas such as social cohesion
and human development (MEFP ¶ 8).11 The authorities emphasized that macroeconomic stability

is expected to be submitted to the Board before the first review.

14
is at the core of the country‘s multi-pillar development strategy. As a result, PSI-supported
policies continue to play an important role in the overall reform framework.
F. Sustaining Medium-term Growth
22.
The PIP is central to sustaining medium-term growth in Cape Verde not only
because of its overall reach and size, but also due to its relevance at the project-level. The
PIP specifically addresses fundamental infrastructure bottlenecks to economic activity in Cape
Verde. These include: insufficient wharf space for vessels, inadequate port equipment for cargo
handling, deficient airport facilities across islands, lacking logistics to support intermodal
transportation, underinvestment in energy generation and water production. Tackling such issues
is expected to reduce costs to private sector investment, boosting the country competitiveness and
growth prospects.12
23.
Over the medium-term, the tourist industry has the potential to act as an engine of
growth. Secular trends are favorable: as global growth rebounds and as increasing numbers of
the global population reach retirement age, the tourist industry has the potential to expand faster
than other industries. Government efforts to improve infrastructure and private initiatives such as
transportation should help reduce constraints in the industry, but challenges still remain.
Additional infrastructure needs are likely to arise, particularly in transportation; education and
training will need to be targeted to the skills required in the tourist and other growth industries;
and land registration will need to be improved to facilitate reliable and sustainable development
zones. Moreover, staff and the authorities agreed on the importance of integrating the tourist
industry with the domestic economy to ensure balanced broad-based growth.
24.
Staff and the authorities agreed that policies should further encourage
competitiveness and diversification. The authorities emphasized that their PIP will create
conditions for diversifying the economy. Additional regulatory improvements (e.g. in
Information and Communications Technologies) could help spur diversification into other
potential export industries. Staff view price and wage flexibility as well as inter-island mobility
are useful to preserve growth and employment against any negative demand shocks, but consider
that existing labor market restrictions may hinder a competitive business environment and deter
formal employment growth. While tax incentives may have helped nurture a nascent tourist
industry, the objective over the medium-run should be to create a level playing field with all
industries contributing efficiently and equitably to finance development.

12

―The average annual GDP growth rate in Cape Verde during the decade before the global crisis (1998–2007) was
7.3 percent. The main sectors driving growth were construction, tourism, transportation and commerce, fueled by
strong investment and consumption growth coming from the private sector. The PIP will boost supply by further
increasing returns from private sector investment in the medium-run while contributing to stronger aggregate
demand in the more immediate future as the economy recovers. Annual GDP growth is projected to average
5.9 percent in the post-crisis period (2010–2020), in line with long-term historical growth rates.‖.

Social policies have focused on fostering labor market participation and providing direct assistance
to vulnerable groups (unprivileged children, poor elderly individuals, females who are head of
households, those in chronic poverty and with disabilities). Some key social programs include:
Education. Policy has focused on improving quality, ensuring equity, and achieving measurable
results. A gradual decentralization in the management of programs has also contributed to the
recent strong record: Elementary school is mandatory for six years and net enrollment rate
increased from 53.9 percent in 2001 to 62 percent in 2008. Transition rates from elementary to the
next school cycle increased from 70.7 percent in 2001 to 82.9 percent in 2008. Recently, local
universities have been constructed and will allow youth the option of pursuing undergraduate
studies in the country.
Health. Policy aims to achieve an accessible and encompassing coverage for treatment and
preventive care. The National Health Services is being re-organized to guarantee that the strong
performance of health indicators are maintained and continue to support human capital
development. Additionally, the country continues to build capacity for public health surveillance to
deal with risks such as dengue fever and other diseases.
Job creation and empowerment. A number of initiatives target the youth, who have high rates of
unemployment. The objective is to create an integrated system linking general education,
professional training and employment, through (i) active labor market policies such as
apprenticeship, internship and first-job programs, and (ii) private sector involvement in training.
The initiatives help match training with labor demand and allow youth to directly benefit from the
development process.
School feeding program. This internationally-recognized program provides free meals to nearly
80,000 children in the country, contributing to improved nutrition and human capital development.
Social pension. Non-contributive pension payments are available to those in need. The
government, with support from municipalities and the civil society, screen and identify candidates
for the program.
Gender equality. Implementation of public policies to democratize access to education across
gender has led Cape Verde to achieve gender parity in primary and secondary education.
Water, sanitation and social housing. The government is carrying out public investment to
guarantee access to basic public services and decent living conditions.

16
IV.

PROGRAM MONITORING AND RISKS
A. Program Monitoring

25.
For monitoring performance under the program, quantitative assessment
criteria, quantitative indicative targets, and structural benchmarks have been proposed
(MEFP Tables 1 and 2). The assessment dates will be end-March 2011 and end-September
2011 with corresponding semi-annual reviews.13 The quantitative targets include ceilings on
net domestic borrowing of the central government, net domestic assets of the BCV, and
accumulation of non-concessional external debt; and a floor on net international reserves of
the BCV. Targets to be monitored on a continuous basis include ceilings on accumulation of
domestic and external arrears, non-accumulation of short-term non-concessional external debt
and a floor on the regulatory capital of commercial banks. Structural benchmarks aim at
strengthening the tax base, the debt management, the financial sector, the fiscal-monetary
coordination, the government securities market, and promoting fiscal accountability.
B. Statistical Issues
26.
Progress has been made in improving economic and financial statistics, though
further improvements in data are needed. The data are broadly adequate for surveillance.
The production-based GDP is compiled by the National Statistical Institute (INE) with long
delays, and labor market data on unemployment is published only on an annual basis. The
ongoing efforts by the INE to finalize the 2010 census should assist other government
agencies in adopting sound policies. Staff agreed that there is a need to strengthen the national
accounts, and consider technical assistance in this area as a priority.
C. Program Risks
27.
The main program risks consist of renewed adverse external shocks and fiscal
pressures ahead of elections. Worsening economic conditions in Europe could spill over
through a decline in tourism, second home purchases of foreigners, FDI, remittances, and
official bilateral support, which thereby could weaken the economic recovery and build up of
reserves. On the domestic front, the forthcoming elections are expected to be close, creating
incentives for a short-term boost in spending. However, the authorities stressed their
commitment to holding spending to budget, and have strongly implemented this commitment
so far this year.

13

The first program review is expected to be completed by July 31, 2011 (rather than the customary six months
after approval) to provide sufficient time for review following the March 31, 2011 assessment date.

17
V.

STAFF APPRAISAL

28.
Cape Verde has demonstrated notable economic and policy resilience. In the face
of adverse global shocks, the government used its policy buffers to provide macroeconomic
stimulus. The economy is now rebounding strongly and is poised for solid growth over the
medium term.
29.
The authorities should complete the public investment program underway, but
limit new external borrowing in order to restore fiscal buffers. The temporary acceleration
of the public investment program is appropriate, given the need to improve infrastructure, the
availability of funding on concessional terms, and usefulness of countercyclical stimulus.
However, foreign-financed spending would need to be scaled back without resorting to new
foreign borrowing, to rebuild fiscal buffers against negative shocks. Foreign-financed projects
should be selected exclusively on the basis of pro-growth or pro-poor objectives .
30.
The peg to the euro continues to serve Cape Verde well. This arrangement provides
a stable anchor for economic stability, while allowing some flexibility in the escudo‘s
exchange rate vis-à-vis currency cross rates. Staff analysis shows that the escudo‘s real
effective value against other currencies is broadly in line with its fundamentals.
31.
The government should maintain low domestic debt as the main instrument to
support the peg. A continued low level of domestic borrowing will be required to sustain a
gradual accumulation of foreign exchange reserves. Net domestic debt should be kept below
20 percent of GDP, including by tightly controlling recurrent spending, improving tax
administration, and rationalizing tax exemptions. Stronger efforts are also required to address
fiscal risk arising from a few public enterprises.
32.
The monetary policy stance is appropriately cautious, but the framework could
be improved in the medium term. Given the weak global environment, the BCV‘s emphasis
on shoring up reserve accumulation is well placed. However, a bias toward restrictive
monetary policy introduces other risks. Persistent interest rate differentials between Cape
Verde and international markets will inevitably invite speculative inflows, increasing
vulnerability. In addition, discouraging lending to the private sector can stifle economic
diversification and reduce potential growth. Over the medium term, restoring fiscal and
reserve buffers will help provide space to counteract shocks and reduce the need for an active
monetary policy.
33.
Monetary operations and the monetary transmission mechanism could be
enhanced. A better understanding of how changes to reserve requirements and policy rates
impact bank rates and economic activity would help to calibrate policy actions. To reduce
inefficiencies in financial intermediation, high minimum reserve requirements should be
reduced or treasury securities allowed to satisfy part of the requirement. The BCV should also
improve its standing facilities by using repo and reverse repo operations.

18
34.
The BCV should step up efforts to safeguard the financial system and develop the
government securities market. Staff supports the draft new banking law and ongoing efforts
to enhance banking supervision. Further efforts are needed to increase staff and training, and
strengthen the supervisory capacity for early detection of vulnerabilities. Recent reforms to
enhance liquidity in government securities are welcome. Nonetheless, the authorities should
reduce the distortion created by the INPS in the government primary market by including
INPS in the non-competitive group for auctions and diversifying the INPS‘s investment
portfolio.
35.
While data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance, the authorities are
encouraged to continue to improve economic and financial statistics in order to facilitate
better monitoring and analysis of developments to guide policy formulation.
36.
Staff recommends approval of Cape Verde’s request for a new 15-month PSI. The
agreed program will build on the macroeconomic success and structural reforms of the
previous PSI supported program, and will help maintain macroeconomic discipline through
the forthcoming election period.
37.
Risks to the program appear manageable. The authorities have demonstrated their
ability to preserve macroeconomic control and stability in the face of election pressures and
adverse economic shocks. Staff is confident of their continued commitment to program
implementation.
38.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation take place within
24 months, in accordance with the decision on consultation cycles in program countries.

The data since 2008 are based on the IFRS, which are provisional as the BCV is finalizing comparability of data.

2

The NPL ratio for the four onshore banks increased in 2007 because of new stricter loan classification criteria. Thus, the
NPLs should be interpreted with cautious since a loan was considered nonperforming if it is only 1 day overdue

Liquid assets include cash in vault and marketable securities. Short-term liabilities include demand deposits.

APPENDIX I. LETTER OF INTENT
November 9, 2010
Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20431
USA
Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn
In July 2010, the government of Cape Verde completed its program supported by the IMF
under the Policy Support Instrument (PSI). The PSI provided firm support for our policies for
macroeconomic stability, economic growth, and poverty reduction. Looking ahead, the
government is seeking to continue its close policy dialogue with the IMF and believes that
Cape Verde is well-suited to the PSI: macroeconomic stability has been achieved; financial
resources from the Fund are not needed; but the PSI would support the government‘s ongoing
efforts to strengthen policy performance and signal its commitment to sound policies to the
international community.
The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) sets out the
government‘s objectives and policies for 2010–11, for which it requests support under a new
15-month PSI supported program, which will allow the new government to assess the form of
its future engagement with the Fund after elections in 2011. Key elements of this program
include a prudent management of domestic government debt, a further increase in international
reserves, and structural reforms to improve debt management, rationalize tax incentives,
enhance monetary operations, and strengthen the financial sector.
The government believes that the policies outlined in the MEFP are adequate to achieve the
objectives of the successor PSI-supported program. Under the PSI, the government will
regularly update the IMF on economic and policy developments and will provide the data
needed for adequate monitoring of the program. During the period of the PSI, Cape Verde will
consult with the IMF on adoption of any measures that may be appropriate at the initiative of
the government or whenever the Managing Director of the IMF requests such a consultation.
We authorize the IMF to publish this letter of intent, the attached MEFP, and the related staff
report.
Sincerely yours,
/s/
Cristina Duarte
Minister of Finance

32
ATTACHMENT I. MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES
Recent economic developments
1.
Cape Verde’s highly open economy has been quite resilient to the impact of the
global recession.


Real GDP growth slowed in 2009, but remained strong compared to global economic
growth. This relative moderation in growth stems from a global slowdown in tourism,
FDI flows, and private construction, offsetting fiscal stimulus policies. Leading
indicators, such as the confidence barometer, show signs of recovery in 2010; and the
growth rate in 2010 should pick up on account of public investment–fueled
construction sector, and transportation. The growth rate should then gradually rise in
the medium term.



The fiscal stimulus implemented in 2009, including subsidies, tax cuts, and
accelerated investment spending, helped Cape Verde weather the crisis and protect
the poor. We used the policy space created by prudent fiscal policies in recent years
and additional inexpensive external financing to accelerate the public investment
program that was already in place.



Inflation declined from 6.8 percent (annual average) in 2008 to 1 percent in 2009 and
should remain around 3 percent in the medium term.

2.
The 2006–10 policy support instrument (PSI) has been very supportive of the
Cape Verdean reform agenda and growth policy. The PSI helped consolidate
macroeconomic stability, build international reserves buffers, improve public finance
management, reduce fiscal risk from state-owned enterprises (SOEs), strengthen the control
and supervision of the financial sector, and strengthen the national institutional framework
through structural and legislative reforms. The PSI also had a catalytic role in donor support
and strengthened the credibility of government policies. During the PSI, Cape Verde joined
the World Trade Organization (WTO), graduated from Low Developed Country (LDC)
status, and was accepted as a special partner of the European Union (EU). As a facilitator of
reforms, the PSI helps to advance the objectives of our Poverty Reduction and Growth
Strategy. Cape Verde is on track to achieve most of the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) by 2015, including halving the 1990 poverty level.
3.
Challenges remain for Cape Verde to benefit from the current window of highly
concessional financing while ensuring debt sustainability. The rapid implementation of
our mostly externally financed investment program is ongoing. During recent years, we have
worked to mobilize concessional external financing for our investment program. This work
has improved our project implementation ratio from below 60 percent earlier in the decade to
around 90 percent currently. The pace of our investment program is expected to continue in
2011–12, but should return to more moderate levels after the completion of current large

33
infrastructure projects. The investment program is intended to support long-term private
growth based on services exports in line with the Cape Verde Poverty Reduction and Growth
Strategy. It addresses critical infrastructure bottlenecks in roads, airports, sea ports, and
electricity and water supply. Project appraisals carefully prepared with the help of our
development partners confirm that the economic and social return from these projects should
be high. The external financing of the investment program, even though on highly
concessional terms and on long maturities, has added to the total debt burden, especially the
present value (PV) of debt to GDP. Cape Verde‘s repayment capacity remains strong, the
debt service to revenues or export ratios staying well below the thresholds. Cape Verde‘s
strong policies and institutions should help ensure that the growth dividends from the
accelerated public investments do materialize and help consolidate debt sustainability in the
medium term.
Macroeconomic objectives and policies
4.
The new 15-month PSI will continue to build foreign reserves and keep the
domestic debt stock low to support the exchange rate peg. Net domestic borrowing will
be contained to protect international reserves. In addition, fiscal policy will be orientated
toward gradual exit from the current counter-cyclical fiscal measures. As the pace of public
investment slows, fiscal deficit is expected to decrease from 13.5 percent of GDP in 2010 to
8 percent in 2012, and decline thereafter. External borrowing will continue, mostly on
concessional terms, and will be scaled back to past levels after the completion of the current
large infrastructure projects.
Fiscal policy
5.
In 2010–11, fiscal policy will remain anchored on implementing the mediumterm public investment program and minimizing and prudently managing debt
accumulation.


In order to protect international reserves and keep net domestic debt level below
20 percent of GDP, net domestic borrowing in 2011 will continue to be kept low.



Debt management will be strengthened. A Medium-Term Debt Strategy (MTDS)
describing the debt level, composition, and desirable trend will be presented to the
Council of Ministers in June 2011. Because the concessional debt window will likely
decrease as our income rises, we will increasingly borrow on nonconcessional terms,
and the MTDS will help us to prudently manage our debt portfolio. In the medium
term, the main objective will be to bring down the PV of debt to GDP.



To achieve the debt stock alleviation goal, externally financed public investments will
have to be scaled back to more modest levels after the current acceleration. Public
capital expenditures financed with foreign loans are expected to decline from

34
12.3 percent of GDP in 2010 to 4.7 percent in 2013. Moreover, growth dividends
from the public investments program should materialize and help achieve the goal of
a reduced PV of debt to GDP.
6.
Authorities will continue to improve public financial management and
strengthen the tax base.


As usual, we will conduct a mid-year fiscal review for 2011, and we will confirm that
the external borrowing is consistent with debt sustainability and with the mediumterm debt stock alleviation objective.



The government has prepared new individual and corporate income tax bills and is
revising related legislation to further reduce and streamline the tax incentives and
exemptions. The government intends to submit these tax bills to the National
Assembly by end-June 2011.



We will continue to enforce tax collection, especially the 2009–2010 unpaid
corporate income taxes and VAT.

7.
The government will continue to address contingent liabilities arising from stateowned enterprises (SOEs). To avoid the emergence of fiscal risks, the government has
enacted Law of State Enterprises, Public Managers, and Corporate Good Governance. These
measures aim to improve the control and monitor of the sector, by establishing a set of rules
and procedures which will serve as a framework for the regulation of sector, permitting a
re-structuring of the public enterprises in order to become an instrument for economic
policies. Moreover, they will allow a change of paradigm in the management of the
parastatals, to become result/objective oriented. The electricity company, Electra, and the
airline company, TACV, have been put on a restructuring plan to end their structural losses
or implicit subsidies. The strategy for Electra—to stabilize costs and reduce reliance on oil
imports—is to substitute photovoltaic and wind power (using a public-private partnership)
instead of fossil-based generation. After downsizing its staff, TACV improved the quality of
its services and renewed its IATA certifications. The TACV presented an improved income
statement in 2009 and has recently cleared its arrears to private providers accumulated
through 2009. The TACV has signed an agreement with the National Company for Airports
and Security (ASA) to repay its arrears and the payment plan is in place. The government is
committed to increasing transparency regarding implicit subsidies between SOEs, by making
any unpaid claims between SOEs explicit in the contingent liabilities report by June 2011.
8.
In accordance with its poverty reduction strategy, the government is committed
to safeguarding priority spending. Active public policies targeting vulnerable individuals
continue to be implemented at a strong pace. Those policies aim at supporting sustainable
solutions to unemployment and at fostering the integration of the most needy into the
economic and social life of the country. Examples include the reform of the social security
system, the intensification of programs to combat poverty, the implementation of the

35
National Equality and Gender Equity Plan, and adoption of measures to ensure social
reinsertion for children and adolescents in situations of risk. Additionally, the Government is
investing heavily in the provision of training that caters to current labor market needs,
particularly among the youth. Skills development are also being supported by investments on
housing, health, water and sanitation, all of which conducive to a better and more productive
life for Cape Verdeans.
Monetary management and financial sector policies
9.
The Bank of Cape Verde (BCV) will safeguard the exchange rate peg by
continuing to accumulate foreign reserves and enhancing monetary operations. With a
largely open capital account, monetary policy will be geared toward stabilizing short-term
external capital flows and domestic liquidity. Thus, the BCV lowered its policy rate by 100
basis points to 4.25 percent in January 2010, as foreign reserves built up and the global risk
premium narrowed. The BCV will continue to closely monitor capital flows and assess
implications for domestic interest rates and credit growth.
10.
We are committed to developing a liquid and dynamic government security
market. We will address gradually market distortions in the primary government security
market. We intend to: (i) issue fungible government bonds, Obrigacoes do Tesouro, to reduce
market fragmentations and foster liquidity in the secondary market; (ii) use uniform-price
auctions in the primary market; (iii) enhance the auction mechanisms by publishing issuance
calendars one year in advance to foster a competitive, credible, and transparent public
securities market; And (iv) use e-banks, internet, and ATMs to permit individuals to buy the
securities in the secondary market.
11.
The government is committed to strengthening the coordination of fiscal and
monetary policy to support the exchange rate peg. Under the new PSI, the Ministry of
Finance (MoF) and the BCV will sign a fiscal-monetary coordination agreement. Under the
agreement, the BCV will use treasury securities systematically as the main instrument for
monetary operations. We will enhance the joint MoF-BCV liquidity committee to assess the
implications of fiscal financing needs on the monetary aggregates and international reserves.
12.
We will continue to strengthen the financial sector, taking into account some
weaknesses identified in the 2008 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP)
recommendations.


The BCV is committed to enhancing the regulatory framework and supervisory
capacity. The BCV will ensure sufficient resources to its supervisory body to
effectively enhance onsite and offsite inspections. It will continue to strengthen
compliance for capital adequacy and update the IMF if any bank falls below
regulatory capital requirements. Additionally, though the BCV supervises the
insurance sector, in the medium term, it will aim to extend its supervisory perimeter

36
to other nonbank financial institutions, including the INPS, according to FSAP
recommendations.


Commercial banks have completed migration and compliance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) on bank accounting.



The BCV is working on issuing a financial stability report on a regular basis, starting
in the first half of 2011.



The draft legislation of the new banking law, which will harmonize prudential norms
between onshore and offshore banking activities, will be submitted to the National
Assembly for approval by end June 2011.

13.
We will expand the existing standing financial stability committee at the BCV to
include MoF by signing a memorandum of understanding (MoU). The MoU will be
signed by minister of finance and the governor of the BCV. It will formalize cooperation
arrangements for crisis preparedness and contingency planning and ensure that all members
have their own contingency plan and are well-trained. The MoU will: (a) develop a
coordinated communication strategy; (b) define common principles for crisis management;
(c) describe how agreed procedures are activated in times of crisis; and (d) define channels
for information exchange.
Program monitoring
14.
Implementation of the program will be monitored through semiannual reviews
conducted by the IMF Executive Board on the basis of quantitative indicators and
structural benchmarks. These indicators are defined in the attached TMU. The quantitative
indicators for end-March 2011 and end-September 2011 will be assessment criteria, and the
quantitative indicators for end-December and end-June will be indicative targets. The
program will cover November 2010–November 2011. The first review of the program will be
based on the end-March 2011 assessment criteria and is scheduled for completion by endJuly 2011. The second review of the program will be based on the end-September 2011
performance criteria and is scheduled for completion by end- January 2012.
15.
To ensure that the program is effectively implemented, the government has set
up a PSI monitoring committee. The PSI monitoring committee created for the 2006–10
PSI, under the aegis of Ministry of Finance and BCV—will monitor the implementation of
the program for 2010–11. This MEFP will be disseminated within the government,
government agencies, public entities, and Cape Verdean society.

amended on August 31, 2009), but also commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not been received. Excluded from this performance criterion are debt rescheduling and debt reorganization,
the Portuguese credit line, and borrowings from the Fund.

The term “debt” has the meaning set forth in point No. 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt (Decision No. 12274-(00/85), August 24, 2000, as amended on August 31,
2009). Excluded from this performance criterion are rescheduling arrangements, the Portuguese credit line, borrowings from the Fund, and import-related financing.

The floor on net international reserves of the Bank of Cape Verde will be adjusted downward by the cumulative upward deviation in external debt service, by the cumulative downward deviation in external
financial assistance, project loans and budget loans relative to program assumptions, and by the costs of restructuring state-owned enterprises up to a limit of 13.6 million euros. The floor will be adjusted
upward by the cumulative downward deviation in external debt service relative to program assumptions. Additionaly, in the case Cape Verde participates in any SDR allocation(s) between June 30, 2009 and
the test date, the floor on net international reserves will be adjusted upwards by the equivalent of the amount of the cumulative additional SDR allocation(s) up to the test date measured at program exchange
rates.
8
The floor on banks' regulatory capital ratios is an indicative floor for all test dates. This indicative target is continuous.

ATTACHMENT II. TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
1.
This memorandum sets out the understandings between the Cape Verdean authorities
and the IMF staff regarding the definition of assessment criteria and indicative targets and
reporting requirements for the seventh and eighth reviews under the Policy Support
Instrument.
I. QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT CRITERIA AND INDICATIVE TARGETS
A. Net Domestic Borrowing Excluding for Clearance of Arrears and Net Late Payments
2.
The central government includes all units of budgetary central government. It does
not include local government (municipalities) and public corporations
3.
Net domestic borrowing excluding for clearance of arrears and net late payments
is defined as the cumulative change since the start of the calendar year of the net credit to the
central government from the banking and nonbanking sectors less (1) the cumulative clearance
during the calendar year of the stock of arrears as of the end of the previous year and (2) the
cumulative payments during the first three months of the calendar year of expenses authorized
by the previous year‘s budget, plus the expenses accrued during the current year that will be
paid during the first three months of the next calendar year as provisioned for in the budget
law (late payments or atrasados).


The ceiling will be adjusted upward by
 the cumulative upward deviations in external debt service, by
 the cumulative downward deviations in nonproject external financial assistance and
land sales relative to program assumptions, and by the costs of restructuring stateowned enterprises up to a limit of CVE 1.5 billion.



The ceiling will be adjusted downward by
 the cumulative downward deviation in external debt service and by
 the cumulative upward deviation in land sales relative to program assumptions.

4.
Net credit to the central government from the banking and nonbanking system is
defined as the overall position of the main central government institutions vis-à-vis the
banking and nonbanking system—that is, the stock of all outstanding claims on the central
government (loans, advances), and all other government debt instruments, such as long-term
government securities, held by the BCV, commercial banks, and nonbank institutions, less all
deposits held by the central government with the BCV and with commercial banks. The INPS
is not included in central government accounts. Net credit to the central government excludes
claims on the Trust Fund (TCMFs).
5.
Reporting requirements. Data on the implementation of the budget compiled by the
Ministry of Finance and Public Administration will be provided on a quarterly basis, to be

40
submitted no later than five weeks after the end of each quarter, including (i) government
domestic revenue by category; (ii) external budget support grants; (iii) government
expenditure, including primary current expenditure, domestic and external interest payments,
and capital expenditure, including domestically and budget support financed capital
expenditure and estimates of externally project financed capital expenditure; (iv) the gross
payment and gross accumulation of domestic accounts payable (atrasados); (v) the gross
payment and gross accumulation of domestic payments arrears; (vi) external loan receipts and
principal payments; (vii) external arrears payments and accumulation; (viii) bank and nonbank
financing; (ix) privatization and land sale receipts; and (x) any other revenue, expenditure, or
financing not included above.
6.
For the purposes of this memorandum, privatization and land proceeds will be
understood to mean all monies received by the government from the sale or concessioning of a
public company, organization, or facility to a private company or companies, organization(s),
or individual(s), as well as any proceeds generated from the sale of government land and the
liquidation of a public company, less restructuring costs.
B. Net Domestic Assets of the Central Bank
7.
The ceiling on the cumulative change, from the beginning of calendar-year 2009, in net
domestic assets of the BCV constitutes an assessment criterion. Net domestic assets (NDA) of
the BCV are defined as reserve money minus net foreign assets of the BCV, evaluated at the
current end-of-period exchange rates.



The program ceilings for NDA will be adjusted upward by
the cumulative upward deviations in external debt service, by


the cumulative downward deviations in external financial assistance, and project
and budget loans relative to program assumptions, and by the costs of restructuring stateowned enterprises up to a limit of CVE 1.5 billion.

The ceiling will be adjusted downward by the cumulative downward deviation in
external debt service relative to program assumptions.
For purposes of calculating the adjusters, these flows will be valued at current exchange rates.
Reserve money comprises bank reserves and deposits of the monetary institutions and private
sector with the central bank, as well as cash in circulation.
8.
Reporting requirements. The preliminary monthly balance sheets of the BCV and the
consolidated commercial banks will be transmitted on a monthly basis, with a maximum delay
of five weeks. The definitive version of the monthly balance sheet of the BCV will be
provided as soon as available.

41
C. Ceiling on Nonconcessional External Debt Contracted or Guaranteed
by the Central Government
9.
External public debt (long-term, medium-term, and short-term) is defined as debt to
nonresidents contracted or guaranteed by the central government.1 The external public debt
comprises the external debt of the central government, the Bank of Cape Verde, and the
external debt of the official sector entities and state owned enterprises (SOEs) guaranteed by
the central government. External public debt also includes the private external debt to
nonresidents for which official guarantees have been extended.
10.
Under the program, ceilings on medium- and long-term, as well as on short-term,
nonconcessional external debt constitute assessment criteria. The ceilings on nonconcessional
external debt are on a continuous basis. Nonconcessional external debt is defined as debt
contracted or guaranteed by the central government with a grant element of less than
35 percent, calculated using currency-specific commercial interest reference rates (CIRRs)
published by the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD). Debt rescheduling and debt reorganization are
excluded from the limits on nonconcessional external debt. The assessment criteria on new
nonconcessional external debt contracted or guaranteed by the central government (excluding
borrowing from the Fund) are specified in Table 1 of the Letter of Intent. Nonconcessional
external debt excludes normal short-term (less than one year) import-related financing. The
Portuguese government‘s precautionary credit line (the ―Portuguese credit line‖) in support of
the exchange rate peg is also excluded from the definition of nonconcessional external debt.
The assessment criteria on external indebtedness applies not only to debt as defined in point
No. 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt (Decision
No. 12274-(00/85), 8/24/00, as amended August 31, 2009) but also to commitments contracted
or guaranteed for which value has not been received.
11.
Reporting requirements. The government of Cape Verde will consult with Fund staff
before assuming any liabilities in circumstances where they are uncertain whether the
instrument in question falls under the assessment criterion. Details of all new external debt
(including government guarantees), indicating terms of debt and creditors, will be provided on
a quarterly basis within five weeks of the end of each quarter.
D. Net International Reserves of the Central Bank
12.
The floor on the cumulative change, from the beginning of calendar-year 2009, in net
international reserves (NIR) of the BCV constitutes an assessment criterion under the program.
The NIR of the BCV are defined as gross international reserves of the BCV net of its external
reserve liabilities, calculated at the current exchange rates. Gross reserves of the BCV are
1

At the time of the first PSI review, the definition of external public debt will be broadened to include the five
public enterprises currently covered by the government‘s contingent liabilities report, and the ceiling on nonconcessional external debt will likewise be increased to account for the broader coverage.

42
those that are readily available (i.e., liquid and marketable and free of any pledges or
encumbrances), controlled by the BCV and held for the purposes of meeting balance of
payments needs and intervening in foreign exchange markets. They include gold, holdings of
SDRs, the reserve position at the IMF, holdings of foreign exchange and traveler‘s checks,
demand and short-term deposits at foreign banks abroad, fixed-term deposits abroad that can
be liquidated without penalty, and any holdings of investment-grade securities. External
liabilities of the BCV comprise liabilities to nonresidents contracted by the BCV with an
original maturity of less than a year, any net off-balance-sheet position of the BCV (futures,
forwards, swaps, or options) with either residents and nonresidents, any arrears on principal
and interest to external creditors and suppliers, and purchases from the IMF.



The program floors for the NIR will be adjusted downward by
the cumulative upward deviations in external debt service, by


the cumulative downward deviations in external financial assistance, and project
and budget loans relative to program assumptions, and by the costs of restructuring state
owned enterprises up to a limit of € 13.6 million. For purposes of calculating the adjusters,
these flows will be valued at current exchange rates.

The floor will be adjusted upward by the cumulative downward deviation in external
debt service relative to program assumptions. Additionally, in the case Cape Verde participates
in any SDR allocation(s) between June 30, 2009 and the test date, this floor will be adjusted
upwards by the equivalent of the amount of the cumulative additional SDR allocation(s) up to
the test date measured at program exchange rates.
13.
Reporting requirements. A table on the NIR prepared by the BCV will be transmitted
on weekly basis, with a maximum delay of two weeks.
E. Nonaccumulation of New Domestic Payments Arrears
14.
As part of the program, the government will not accumulate any new domestic
payments arrears. This will be monitored through the monthly execution of the cash-flow plan
and the corresponding release of budget appropriations. For programming purposes, a
domestic payment obligation to suppliers is deemed to be in arrears if it has not been paid
within the normal grace period of 60 days (30 days for government salaries and debt service)
or such other period either specified by the budget law or contractually agreed with the
supplier after the verified delivery of the concerned goods and services, unless the amount or
the timing of the payment is subject to good faith negotiations between the government and the
creditor.
15.
Reporting requirements. The Ministry of Finance and Public Administration, through
the D.G.T., will submit on a quarterly basis a detailed table of the stock of domestic payments
arrears, including the accumulation, payment, rescheduling and write-off of domestic
payments arrears during the quarter. The data are to be provided within four weeks after the
end of the quarter.

43
F. Nonaccumulation of External Payments Arrears
16.
As part of the program, the government will not accumulate any new external
payments arrears on a continuous basis. This will be monitored through the monthly execution
of the cash-flow plan and the corresponding release of budget appropriations.
17.
External arrears are defined as total external debt-service obligations of the government
that have not been paid by the time they are due, except where agreements between the
government and creditors explicitly provide for a grace period after such obligations falling
due. External arrears exclude arrears on external debt, pending the conclusion of debtrescheduling agreements.
18.
Reporting requirements. Data on (i) debt-service payments; and (ii) external arrears
accumulation and payments will be transmitted on a quarterly basis by the Ministry of Finance
and Public Administration, within five weeks of the end of each quarter. In addition, the
government will inform the Fund staff immediately of any accumulation of external arrears.
G. Regulatory Capital Ratio
19.
The floor is defined as the minimum ratio of regulatory capital to risk-weighted assets
following the IMF Financial Soundness Indicators Compilation Guide. This will be monitored
through the monthly regulatory capital to risk-weighted assets for each individual bank in the
financial soundness indicators of the banking sector. The regulatory capital ratio of individual
banks will be provided to the IMF on a monthly basis within six weeks after the end of each
month.
II. OTHER DATA REQUIREMENTS
20.
Data on exports and imports, including volume and prices and compiled by the
Director of Customs and the BCV, will be transmitted on a quarterly basis within five weeks
after the end of each quarter. A preliminary quarterly balance of payments, compiled by the
BCV, will be forwarded within five weeks after the end of each quarter.
21.
The Statement of Other Economic Flows as defined in the IMF Manual GFSM2001
relative to holding gains/losses of the previous year with Enapor, Electra, ASA, TACV, and
IFH will be transmitted on an annual basis within three months after the end of the following
year (15 months after the closing date).
22.
The consolidated balance sheet of Electra, Enapor, ASA, TACV and IFH relative to the
previous year will be transmitted on an annual basis within three months after the end of the
following year (15 months after the closing date).
23.
The table of Financial Soundness Indicators will be transmitted to the IMF on a
monthly basis within six weeks after the end of each month. The nomination of individual
banks is optional.

Appendix II. Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by the Staff of the International Monetary Fund
In consultation with the World Bank Staff
November 9, 2010
The debt sustainability outlook for Cape Verde is broadly unchanged compared to the 2009
DSA, but debt levels have increased significantly from the 2008 DSA. The temporary
acceleration of external borrowing for investment to address growth and export impeding
infrastructure bottlenecks increased debt trajectories relative to projections in the 2008 DSA.
As a result, the PV of external debt-to-GDP ratio approaches the risk threshold in 2012
under the baseline and breaches it in some stress tests. However, most of the debt is highly
concessional and on terms longer than 10 years, maintaining the debt service ratios far
below their thresholds. To restore buffers against future shocks, Cape Verde will need to
(i) reduce external borrowing from 2012 onwards, (ii) mobilize domestic revenue, and
(iii) keep domestic borrowing low to accumulate foreign reserves and reinforce the
credibility of the currency peg.

BACKGROUND

1.
This report updates the debt sustainability analysis (DSA) prepared in 2009
(IMF Country Report No. 09/328). The baseline scenario reflects the latest IMF discussions
with the authorities (September 2010). Since the 2008 DSA, Cape Verde has been adversely
affected by the global crisis through lower exports (mainly services) and FDI. These
developments reduced GDP growth and contributed to a weakening of the balance of
payments and the fiscal accounts. However, economic growth shows clear signs of a
recovery in 2010 and is expected to strengthen over the medium term.

45
2.
The DSA is based on end-2009 data provided by Cape Verde’s authorities. The
debt data currently covers central government external debt, publically-guaranteed debt, and
domestic debt.
3.
Public debt is mostly external and highly concessional, and the recent increase in
the stock is driven by both multilateral and bilateral creditors. The World Bank Group and
the African Development Banks are the major external creditors (more than 60 percent of
the total outstanding debt). The debt is mainly denominated in euros and SDRs.

Composition of public external debt - 2009

4.
The 2009 increase in external debt in percent of GDP ends a five-year decline,
from 63 percent in 2003. The substantial rise in 2009 is due to a higher fiscal deficit, but also
to the planned acceleration of foreign-financed public investment, in response to the
international crisis. However, the 2009 outturn for in public investment was slightly lower
than scheduled in the 2008 DSA, as some projects were delayed. Nominal external debt at the
end of 2008 and 2009 was 47.3 percent of GDP, with an average maturity of 25 years. A
downward revision of historical nominal GDP numbers has mechanically increased the debt
ratio in percent of GDP. The appreciation of the dollar in 2009 was unfavorable to Cape
Verde, given its peg to the euro, increasing the ratio of foreign debt to GDP. However,
authorities have recently canceled or postponed the implementation of a few non-priority

46
projects, in order to curb debt accumulation. The share of commercial external debt is only
1 percent.
5.
Public debt data does not include a share of the debt of state owned enterprises
(SOEs). SOE debt includes loans contracted through the government and already taken into
account in the DSA framework. However, SOEs also have arrears to providers and credit
lines from banks that are included in contingent liabilities in the risks to the debt outlook.
The authorities‘ report on contingent liabilities to the Council of Ministers in August 2009
estimates the total liabilities owed by the airline, TACV, and the water and electricity
company, Electra (both SOEs) at 13 percent of GDP (although the estimated amount needed
to recapitalize these firms would be lower, at around 5 percent of GDP).
6.
Domestic debt is kept low, in order to protect the peg to the euro. Domestic debt
represents one third of total debt and is composed mostly of long-term bonds owed to
domestic banks and the public pension fund. It has declined significantly since 2005 as a
result of the strong fiscal consolidation under the PSI, which is anchored on keeping
domestic borrowing low to build external reserves.

THE DSA BASELINE SCENARIO

Relative to the previous DSA, the macroeconomic framework incorporates the
impact of the crisis and the policy response, but remains broadly unchanged regarding
the medium and long-term perspectives.

47

Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions for the Baseline Scenario
Real GDP growth slowed due to the global crisis, but is expected to recover over the medium term.
Despite the acceleration of infrastructure spending and the lower tax rates, the slowdown in FDI could
keep growth below its historical average for some time. The acceleration of public infrastructure
spending is unlikely to boost contemporaneous growth because of the small fiscal multipliers caused by
high import leakages and because it is not fully offsetting the demand effect of the decline in private
investment. While the global shock worsened the near-term growth outlook, Cape Verde‘s mediumterm growth prospects remain strong.
The acceleration of the public investment program decided in 2009 as a policy response to the crisis
is reflected in the short-term growth rate of the construction sector. However, the second order impact
of public investment, such as higher competitiveness or positive externalities in the private sector, are
not taken into account in the baseline medium and long term growth assumptions.
Inflation is assumed to remain subdued. Given the high import component of domestic demand and
the peg to the euro, GDP deflator and consumer price inflation are assumed to be low in the medium
and long term.
Current account balance: Imports are assumed to remain broadly flat as a share of GDP. Imports of
intermediate goods for tourism are assumed to grow, but this will be largely offset by a decline in other
imports. The deceleration of FDI is holding back imports in the near term, and completion of the
current large investment projects will contain imports of capital goods in the long run: construction
material, equipment, and labor are mostly imported. In addition, as Cape Verde gets wealthier,
emigration will slow and the share of remittances and other current transfers in GDP should slowly
decline.
Government balances: After a temporary shortfall due to lower activity and tax rate reductions as a
policy response to the crisis, tax revenues are assumed to gradually increase and stabilize at around
24 percent of GDP. As the country climbs the income ladder, the informal sector should shrink and the
individual and corporate income tax are assumed to increase slightly to reach 8 percent of GDP. At the
same time, as a consequence of Economic Partnership Agreements and other Free Trade Agreements
(FTA), international trade taxes are decreasing to 4.5 percent of GDP, from 5.5 percent before the
crisis. Grants are assumed to gradually decline to 1 percent of GDP. After a peak above 40 percent in
the short term on account of accelerated public investment, total expenditures should stabilize around
33 percent, with a wage bill at 12 percent and capital spending at 11 percent. The overall balance
(including grants) should fall from a deficit of 15 percent of GDP in 2010 and stabilize at a 2 percent
deficit in the medium term. The primary basic balance (excluding grants, interest, and foreign-financed
expenditure) is expected to be slightly positive (on average) in the long run.
External assistance: Cape Verde will progressively borrow on less concessional terms. The baseline
scenario assumes that the concessionality of new loans will decline in the medium term. With Cape
Verde‘s graduation from least-developed-country status in 2008, it acquired ―blend‖ status with
multilateral development agencies, notably the EIB, ADB, and the IBRD. It is now eligible to borrow
from their non-concessional windows, and, after a transition period, access to concessional funds will
shrink.
Domestic borrowing: The baseline assumes that the authorities will continue to keep domestic
borrowing low to support accumulation of foreign reserves and protect the exchange rate peg. Fiscal
policy is geared toward accumulation of reserves to 4.5 months of current-year imports in the medium
term, and stabilization thereafter.

48
The assumption is maintained that fiscal revenue (including grants) will remain relatively flat
in the medium and long term, with a substantial shortfall in the short term, reflecting weaker
activity and tax cuts in response to the global economic turmoil. Tax revenues are expected
to increase slightly in the long run, and will balance the probable decline in external grants.
New public borrowing (both domestic and external) is assumed to be moderate over the
medium term, reflecting the progressive closing of the concessional external financing
window, as well as the commitment to protect the stock of reserves.
III.

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

Baseline scenario
8.
The LIC debt sustainability framework is guided by country-specific debt
burden thresholds for external debt, based on the strength of a country’s policies and
institutions. Cape Verde now ranks as a ‗top performer‘ under the joint IMF/World Bank
debt sustainability framework, based on its three-year moving average CPIA score. The
indicative external debt burden thresholds for countries in this category are a present value
(PV) of debt-to-exports ratio of 200 percent, a PV of debt-to-revenue ratio of 300 percent, a
PV of debt-to-GDP ratio of 50 percent, and debt-service-to-exports and revenues ratios of
25 and 35 percent, respectively.

commitment is embedded
in the MTFF (Medium Term Fiscal Framework) submitted to the National Assembly with
the 2010 budget proposal, and in the revised MTFF submitted to staff in September 2010.
While the debt-to-GDP ratio will nearly reach the debt burden threshold in 2012, all other
debt ratios will remain well below their thresholds, including the debt service ratios.
Furthermore, Cape Verde benefits from a large and steady flow of remittances that can
increase the repayment capacity of the country. Remittances have averaged 12 percent of
GDP over the past ten years and the projections conservatively assume an average of
8 percent of GDP over the next 10 years.

49
Alternative scenario and stress tests
10. Alternative scenarios and bound tests show that all debt indicators except the PV
of debt-to-GDP remain well below their thresholds through 2030. The breach of the PV
of debt-to-GDP threshold under the growth shock (B1) is minor (the deviation only amounts
to 1 percent of GDP) and lasts for only two years. Other shocks have a more sustained
impact. For instance, the export shock (B2) and US deflation shock (B3) result in breaches
of 6 percent of GDP in 2012 and last several years. Under the exchange rate shock (B6),
which assumes a 30 percent devaluation of the escudo, the PV of the debt-to-GDP ratio
breaches the threshold during several years.
11. The other debt ratios provide assurances that Cape Verde’s repayment capacity
remains strong. Given the high export-to-GDP ratio (over 40 percent) and the strong
capacity to collect taxes (the tax collection rate is far above regional standards), the debt-toexport and debt-to-revenue ratios remain well below the thresholds even under extreme
scenarios. Moreover, all of Cape Verde‘s external debt has maturities that are typically
longer than 10 years, which alleviates cash flow pressures and limits rollover difficulties.
This lessens concerns about the country‘s ability to repay its debt.
12. A high-growth and a low-growth scenario were constructed to test the sensitivity
of debt ratios to growth assumptions. Each scenario assumes that growth will deviate
from the baseline by +/–1.0 percentage points in 2011–16. As in the baseline, the lowgrowth scenario implies that nominal GDP will be permanently below its pre-crisis trend
(the 2011–16 deviations in growth rate are permanent shocks to the GDP level). Because the
high-growth scenario assumes growth slightly above its pre-crisis average, GDP will
eventually surpass the trend.
13.
During the low-growth scenario, the debt service dynamics remain sustainable.
The PV of external debt-to-GDP remains below its threshold, with a peak in 2012. The ratios
decline slowly thereafter, ending at 36 percent of GDP in 2029, compared with 30 percent of
GDP under the baseline scenario. Under the low-growth scenario, the borrowing space would
be very limited in the near-term. Given the assumption that borrowing will continue at long
maturities, the debt ratios will stay low even in the low-growth scenario. This should dispel
any concerns about the country‘s ability to repay its debt.
14.
Under the high growth scenario, with a higher growth dividend than
conservatively assumed under the baseline, the debt stock ratios would decline rapidly
after 2012. If the higher growth dividend materializes, the ensuing strong tax revenues will
help contain the deficit, reduce debt, and further expand public expenditures.

IV.

PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

15.
The DSA baseline shows that public debt sustainability will be preserved, since
the trajectory of total public debt mirrors external debt and yields the same conclusion
(Table 4). The PV of total debt-to-GDP peaks at 67 percent of GDP in 2012 and declines
thereafter in line with the authorities‘ commitment in the MTFF to reduce external borrowing
from 2012. External borrowing is determining the trajectory of total public debt because net
domestic debt (gross domestic debt net of deposits in the BCV and commercial banks) is
projected to be kept below 20 percent of GDP. The debt-to-revenue and debt service-torevenue ratios will remain broadly stable.
16.
Alternative scenarios and bound tests indicate that debt sustainability indicators
remain on paths similar to the external public debt. Only the scenario of an unchanged
primary balance from 2010 leads to an unsustainable situation, but it is not relevant since
2010 is an exceptional year, characterized by fiscal stimulus and an accelerated public
investment program.
17.
Other risks to the debt outlook include a currency mismatch and contingent
liabilities of state-owned enterprises. A depreciation of the euro could raise the debt ratios.
The current cost to recapitalize Electra and TACV is estimated at 5 percent of GDP.
V.

CONCLUSIONS: DEBT SUSTAINABILITY BROADLY UNCHANGED

18.
The debt sustainability outlook is broadly similar to the 2009 DSA. However,
compared to the 2008 DSA, the external and public-sector debt sustainability analysis reveals
increased vulnerability as external debt ratios are higher. This reflects an acceleration of
public investment, a depreciation of the euro (and thus the CVE) compared to the dollar, and
the technical downward revision of the historical nominal GDP numbers.
19.
Staff assesses Cape Verde’s debt as sustainable. The PV of debt-to-GDP ratio
breaches its threshold under half of the stress tests. However, Cape Verde‘s strong policies
and institutions should help ensure that the growth dividends from the accelerated public
investments materialize, and help restore buffers in the medium term. Moreover, the long
maturities and high concessionality of the existing debt ensure that liquidity risks are low, as
shown by debt service indicators.
20.


Still, increased debt vulnerabilities call for caution. In particular:
The current debt assessment is based on several assumptions, including (i) the
authorities‘ commitment to decelerate external borrowing in 2012 and thereafter;
(ii) the authorities‘ capacity to raise revenue in the medium term; (iii) the authorities‘
ability to contain expenditures; (iv) a rebound in economic growth.



New borrowing should continue to be mostly at long maturities and on concessional
terms. Long maturities will ensure low debt service obligations relative to Cape
Verde‘s export and revenue ratios. If maturities are shorter, and concessionality lower
compared to the baseline, the risks to the debt outlook would worsen.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the
baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the
shock (implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.
7/ Assumes growth rates respectively 1 percentage points above and below the baseline in 2011-16.

IX. Safeguards Assessments
In response to a request from the Bank of Cape Verde's (BCV), a voluntary safeguard
assessment with respect to the Policy Support Instrument (PSI) approved on July 31, 2006
was completed in 2008. The previous safeguards assessment of the BCV, which was
completed in December 2002, concluded that substantial risks may have existed at the time

59
in the bank's financial reporting framework, its internal audit mechanism, and system of
internal controls. The 2008 assessment concluded that, while the BCV has taken some
measures recommended in the 2002 assessment, there are still significant outstanding
vulnerabilities, notably in the system of internal control, internal audit, and transparency and
publication of the financial statements.
X. Exchange Arrangements
The de facto and de jure exchange rate arrangement of Cape Verde is a conventional fixed
peg. The escudo has been pegged to the euro at a rate of CVE 110.265 per €1 since
January 4, 1999. Cape Verde accepted the obligations of Article VIII of the Articles of
Agreement effective July 1, 2004. It maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions
on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.
XI. Previous Article IV Consultation and PSI Reviews
Discussions for the 2006 Article IV consultation and on a medium-term economic program
that could be supported by a three-year PSI were held in Praia April 28–May 16, 2006.
The Executive Board concluded the Article IV consultation and approved the request for a
PSI on July 31, 2006 (Country Report No. 06/334); the first PSI review on January 19, 2007
(Country Report No. 07/44); the second PSI review on May 7, 2007 (Country Report
No. 07/223); the third PSI review on December 21, 2007 (Country Report 08/37); the 2008
Article IV consultation and the fourth PSI review on June 30, 2008 (Country Report 08/248);
the fifth PSI review on December 22, 2008 (Country Report 09/14); the sixth PSI review on
June 19, 2009 (Country Report 09/198); the seventh PSI review on December 18, 2009
(Country Report 09/328); and the eight PSI review on July 19, 2010 (Country Report
10/218).
XII. Technical Assistance
Since 1985 the Fund has provided technical assistance to the BCV, the Ministry of Finance,
and more recently the National Institute of Statistics in several areas: (i) MCM provided
technical assistance to the BCV on organization and methods, management of external debt,
monetary and banking statistics, accounting, credit, foreign exchange operations,
management of public debt, and the separation of the functions of the Bank, as well as on the
choice of exchange rate regime. BCV has also received technical assistance from STA on
monetary and balance of payments statistics. (ii) The Ministry of Finance has received
technical assistance from FAD on organization and budgetary procedures, budgeting, tax
policy, and tax administration; from STA on fiscal accounting; and from LEG on tax
legislation. (iii) The National Institute of Statistics has received technical assistance in
national accounts and price statistics. Cape Verde is a participant in STA‘s GDDS Regional
Project for Lusophone Africa, and its metadata were posted on the DSBB in February 2004.
It is now receiving technical assistance to implement the GDDS plan for improvement.
Most recently, technical assistance has been provided in the following areas:

ANNEX III. CAPE VERDE—STATISTICS ISSUES
1.
Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
There is a need for substantial improvements in the areas of government finances, national
accounts, and balance of payments. The country has participated in the GDDS since
February 2004. Cape Verde‘s plans for improvements of its statistical system are posted on
the Fund‘s DSBB; the metadata of the monetary and financial sector were updated in
August 2007. The country has benefited from STA technical assistance under the GDDS
project for Lusophone Africa.
2.
The authorities are taking steps to strengthen statistics, but the statistical system
still suffers from a shortage of financial and human resources. A comprehensive master
plan has been developed under the direction of the National Statistical Institute (INE), which
assesses the need for upgrading the agencies that constitute the statistical system and outlines
steps to broaden and improve all areas of statistics. The country‘s development partners have
already committed a substantial part of the estimated US$15 million required to implement
the plan through 2010.
Real sector statistics
3.
Although some improvements have been made to the national accounts,
significant weaknesses remain, including a lack of reliable demand-side GDP. The
timeliness of the data has not been improved, with the INE releasing production and
expenditure-based GDP data for 2005–07 in 2010 and providing production-based GDP
estimates for 2008 to the AFR mission in September 2010. However, the lag is still lengthy
by international standards. In addition, the base year for the constant price estimates is
outdated. INE is receiving technical assistance from Brazil and Spain in developing business
indicators and national accounts.
4.
INE is currently working on a complete overhaul of the national accounts. It is
updating the national accounts benchmark and base years from 1980 to 2002 and adopting
the 1993 SNA. The objective is timely compilation of GDP by industry and expenditure
categories at current and constant prices as well as institutional sector accounts.
5.
INE will also introduce Tourism Satellite Accounts. These accounts will measure
upstream linkages between the tourism sector and the rest of the economy and the import
content of tourism exports.
6.
Full implementation of the 1993 SNA would require a substantial improvement
in source data collection, for which capacity is currently lacking. The 2006 STA mission
found a critical need to improve the timeliness and accuracy of national accounts source data,
in particular the business survey. The capacity of INE staff working on national accounts was
found to be overstretched; they assess in detail and correct individual source data entries—

64
something not undertaken in most countries by national accounts compilers. The statistical
master plan will address many of these challenges.
7.
A revamped CPI with new methodology was launched in February 2008. The
previous official CPI was based on weights dating back to 1989, four years before imports
were liberalized. Import liberalization considerably changed consumption patterns. INE has
had assistance from the National Statistics Institute of Portugal and benefited from STA CPI
missions in May–June, 2006, October 2006, and October 2007, to support the introduction
and dissemination of the revised CPI. The new index has new weights and an updated
commodity basket.
8.
INE publishes labor market statistics only on annual basis with long delays.
Recently, it published annual unemployment data, which is comparable to EUROSTAT and
AFRISTAT. INE is in the process of finalizing the 2010 census. There is no data on wages in
different sectors.
Government finance statistics
9.
Fiscal data have been improved. Benefiting from TA under the GDDS project
for Lusophone Africa, the Government Finance Statistics (GFS) compilation system is
being upgraded. Most deposits previously held with commercial banks have been
consolidated at the central bank. SIGOF, the Integrated Online Budget Management System,
has been expanded to cover all semi-autonomous institutes and most municipalities by the
end of 2007. The authorities have started reporting GFS for publication in the GFS Yearbook.
10.
However quality is a serious concern. The fiscal accounts are subject to statistical
discrepancies, flows and stocks are not always consistent. Significant delay in donor
reporting of project financing also affects the accuracy of fiscal data. Despite the recent
revision of external debt data, significant weaknesses affect preparation of debt sustainability
analyses, especially regarding the PPG debt of state owned enterprises. Multilateral debt
statistics regularly differ from data received by creditors, and debt service projections cannot
be reconciled with the debt stock.
Monetary and financial statistics
11.
The quality of monetary and financial statistics is adequate, in terms of both
accuracy and timeliness. There has been some delays in publishing the BCV quarterly
economic and financial statistical bulletin due to the migration of the banking sector to the
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).An STA mission undertaken in March
2007 helped Banco de Cabo Verde (BCV) to finalize the standardized report forms (SRFs)
for reporting monetary statistics to STA. SRF-based monetary data have been published in
the IFS Supplement since June 2007. These data are fully aligned with the recommendations
of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. The integrated monetary database that
meets STA, AFR, and BCV statistical needs is now in place. Currently, there are gaps in

65
tracking the source and direction of changes in emigrant deposits, which cause difficulties in
assessing their interest sensitivity and gauging the appropriateness of the monetary policy
stance.
External sector statistics
12.
With technical assistance from STA, the accuracy, periodicity, and timeliness of
balance of payments statistics compiled by BCV have continued to improve. A greater
use of surveys, combined with the International Transactions Reporting System implemented
by the BCV, has permitted a significant expansion of data sources and statistical coverage,
which to a large extent follow the recommendations of the 5th edition of the Balance of
Payments Manual. However, gaps in the tracking of large external flows—notably FDI,
emigrant deposits, and remittances—remains. Dissemination of quarterly BOP data on the
BCV website has been regular and in 2007 the BCV resumed regular and timely transmission
of these data to STA for publication in International Financial Statistics and in the Balance
of Payments Statistics Yearbook. However, the BCV does not compile an International
Investment Position statement.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 2, 2010

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
Cape Verde
On November 22, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Cape Verde.1
Background
Cape Verde sustained strong economic growth during 2006-08, reduced the poverty rate and
graduated from the UN least-developed country (LDC) status. During this period, the
government built up fiscal buffers, which it used for fiscal stimulus in 2009 to limit the impact of
weaker external demand from the global crisis.
The authorities’ economic program of 2006–10 was supported by an arrangement with the IMF
under the Policy Support Instrument (PSI). Policy implementation was strong, with some
assessment criteria met ahead of schedule. Following the expiration of this program in July
2010, the government has requested that its economic policies for 2011 be supported by a new
15-month PSI program. The government’s medium-term development strategy is set out in the
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), which focuses on further reducing poverty and
promoting private sector-led growth.
Leading economic indicators point to a solid rebound in activity, with GDP growth projected at
about 5½ percent in 2010. Inflation has edged up to 3 percent in the 12 months to August 2010,
mainly because of higher prices in service activities and food. In the first half of 2010,
international trade grew moderately and foreign direct investment stabilized. The outlook for
service exports in the second half of 2010 is favorable, as tourist establishments report high
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares
a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this
summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can
be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
reservation rates for the high season. Over the medium term, growth rates of exports and
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) are expected to pick up as global conditions improve.
Fiscal policy aims at improving infrastructure while maintaining fiscal sustainability. Fiscal
deficits of 6.3 percent of GDP and 13.5 percent of GDP in 2009 and 2010, respectively, reflect
the temporary acceleration of the public investment program as counter-cyclical stimulus. The
pace of public investment spending is projected to slow over the next couple of years in order to
ensure debt sustainability. Fiscal policy continues to support the peg, and domestic debt is kept
below 20 percent of GDP.
The Bank of Cape Verde (BCV) raised its policy rate in late 2008 against the backdrop of higher
global risk premia associated with the international crisis. Following a decline in global risk
indicators, the BCV reduced its policy rate by one percentage point, to 4.25 percent, in January
2010, keeping the spread with the Euribor wide. To support the peg, monetary policy focuses on
ensuring gradual reserve accumulation by encouraging inflows of emigrant deposits and
restraining private sector credit that would fuel imports.
On the structural front, the government’s reforms focus on reducing the fiscal risk arising from
state owned enterprises. The authorities have put the public electricity company, Electra, and
the airline company, TACV, on a restructuring plan to address their structural losses.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Cape Verde authorities on the recent strong
macroeconomic performance and the substantial progress toward achieving the MDGs.
Directors welcomed the economy’s resilience to recent adverse shocks and the signs of a solid
recovery in 2010. Prudent macroeconomic management permitted the implementation of
effective counter-cyclical policies and supports the implementation of the government’s
medium-term development strategy. The new PSI-supported program will help the authorities
build on their strong performance by maintaining macroeconomic discipline through the
upcoming election period and further reducing vulnerabilities to economic conditions in trading
partners.
Directors supported the authorities’ fiscal stance as being appropriately balanced between the
implementation of the ambitious public investment program and the need to safeguard debt
sustainability. They stressed the importance of making judicious use of available concessional
funds and selecting foreign-financed projects on the basis of pro-growth or pro-poor objectives.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to unwind the expansionary fiscal stance starting
from 2011 and to scale back foreign borrowing in order to rebuild fiscal policy buffers, while
developing a medium-term debt strategy by June 2011. They called for continued reform efforts
to strengthen public revenues and to improve the performance of loss-making state owned
enterprises.
Directors noted the staff assessment that the escudo remains broadly aligned with its
fundamentals while recognizing that the analysis is subject to a high degree of uncertainty.
They stressed the importance of prudent fiscal management to support the exchange rate peg
and continued structural reforms to foster productivity growth in the private sector to boost
competitiveness.

3
Directors agreed that the monetary stance is appropriate, and noted that, given the fragile
global environment, shoring up reserve accumulation by stabilizing remittance inflows is
justified. Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to improve liquidity management and
monetary operations, which should enhance policy effectiveness. They noted that an improved
monetary transmission mechanism would allow the authorities to better influence market
interest rates, which should be brought in line with the Euribor over time to mitigate the risks
of speculative inflows.
Directors were encouraged by the recent measures taken by the BCV to safeguard financial
stability. They welcomed the new draft banking law and the improvements to the regulatory
and supervisory framework. Directors looked forward to further measures to boost supervisory
capacity and to continue progress with the implementation of Financial Sector Assessment
Program recommendations.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

IMF Executive Board Approves a 15-Month Policy Support Instrument for Cape Verde
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved on November 22,
2010 a 15-month Policy Support Instrument (PSI) for Cape Verde. The IMF's framework for
PSIs is designed for low-income countries that may not need IMF financial assistance, but
still seek IMF advice, monitoring, and endorsement of their policy frameworks. PSIsupported programs are based on country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted in a
participatory process involving civil society and development partners. (See Public
Information Notice No. 05/145).
The PSI for Cape Verde aims to consolidate macroeconomic stability, and achieve sustained
broad-based growth. The authorities’ program will build on the macroeconomic success and
structural reforms of the previous PSI supported program, and will help maintain
macroeconomic discipline.
Following the Executive Board’s discussion of Cape Verde, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:
“Cape Verde is rebounding from the global economic crisis, driven by a pickup in tourism
and construction. Inflation is low and the real value of the escudo remains competitive. The
authorities’ strong record of policy implementation over the past several years succeeded in
building fiscal and reserves buffers, which provided room for counter-cyclical
macroeconomic policies to moderate the impact of the global slowdown.
“The policies supported by a new 15-month Policy Support Instrument will pursue national
development objectives for increasing growth, diversifying the economy and making
progress on social policies. Given these objectives, the authorities have implemented a
temporary acceleration of the public investment program, which is mainly financed with
concessional external resources. In order to rebuild fiscal buffers against future adverse
external shocks, the authorities have committed to scale back foreign-financed spending from
next year and to enhance debt management capacity. In response to weaker-than-expected

2
revenue, they have also restrained non-priority spending while protecting social spending on
vulnerable groups. These policies are welcome, as prudent fiscal management is crucial in
supporting the exchange rate peg.
“Given the fragile global environment, the Bank of Cape Verde is appropriately focused on
shoring up reserve accumulation by stabilizing inflows of emigrant deposits. Improving the
monetary transmission mechanism will allow the authorities to better influence market
interest rates, which should be brought in line with the Euribor over time to mitigate the risks
of speculative inflows. The authorities’ intention of bringing all banks under a single banking
law is welcome. Continued efforts to enhance banking supervision and to develop the
government securities market, in line with FSAP recommendations, will help safeguard
financial system soundness and enhance the transmission of monetary policy”, Mr. Portugal
added.
ANNEX
Recent Economic Developments
Cape Verde weathered the crisis well. Growth slowed in 2009, but remained strong
compared to global trends. The global slowdown had the largest impact on tourism, FDI
flows, and private construction. The authorities used the policy space created by prudent
fiscal policies in recent years and additional inexpensive external financing to accelerate the
public investment program that was already in place. Inflation declined from 6.8 percent
(annual average) in 2008 to 1 percent in 2009 and should remain around 2 percent in the
medium term. There are signs of recovery in 2010; and the growth rate in 2010 should pick
up as the public investment program and the global recovery favorably affects the
construction, tourism, and transportation sectors. Growth should then gradually rise in the
medium term.
The challenge for Cape Verde is to take advantage of the current window of highly
concessional financing while ensuring debt sustainability. The pace of the investment
program is expected to continue in 2011–12, but should return to more moderate levels after
the completion of current large infrastructure projects. The investment program is intended to
support long-term private growth based on services exports in line with the Cape Verde
Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy.
Program Summary
Cape Verde’s PSI will continue to build foreign reserves and keep the domestic debt stock
low to support the exchange rate peg. In order to protect international reserves, net domestic
borrowing will be contained. Fiscal policy will be orientated toward gradual exit from the
current counter-cyclical fiscal measures. In 2010–11, fiscal policy will remain anchored on

3
implementing the medium term public investment program and minimizing and prudently
managing debt. As the pace of public investment slows, fiscal deficit is expected to decrease
from 13.5 percent of GDP in 2010 to 7.7 percent in 2012. External borrowing will continue,
mostly on concessional terms, and will be scaled back after the completion of the current
large infrastructure projects. The government will continue to address contingent liabilities
arising from state owned enterprises (SOEs). In accordance with its poverty reduction
strategy, the government is committed to safeguarding priority spending. In this regard, the
authorities will implement active policies aimed at supporting sustainable solutions to
unemployment and at fostering the integration of the most vulnerable into the economic and
social life of the country. The government will invest heavily in the provision of training that
caters to current labor market needs, particularly among the youth. Skills development are
also supported by investments on housing, health, water and sanitation, all of which
conducive to a better and more productive life for Cape Verdeans.

Statement by Lauren W. Rutayisire, Executive Director for Cape Verde
November 22, 2010
The 2006-10 Policy Support Instrument (PSI) served Cape Verde well, notably by playing a
valuable catalytic role in support of the authorities‘ policy and reform agenda and efforts to
improve the country‘s market access. As noted in the staff report, performance was strong
under the PSI. This paved the way for increased macroeconomic and financial stability,
sustained economic growth, and significant poverty reduction. While these positive
achievements reflect primarily the authorities‘ strong commitment to good economic
governance, they were also facilitated by the valuable policy advice and technical assistance
provided by the Fund.
In order to consolidate these achievements, the authorities request a 15-month PSI. The
proposed PSI-supported program is geared toward sustaining macroeconomic stability,
strengthening public finance and debt management, providing adequate support for the
exchange rate peg, and ensuring continued financial sector stability and development.
To achieve these objectives, the authorities will continue to make inroads in containing
domestic debt and strengthening debt management, sustaining comfortable level of foreign
reserves, and implementing prudent macroeconomic policies. Cape Verde‘s strong
performance under the last PSI arrangement augurs well for the implementation of the
proposed program supported by the PSI. At the same time, the country‘s macroeconomic
fundamentals meet the PSI requirements, as noted in the staff report. In particular, the
country‘s fiscal deficit is expected to decline steadily going forward after having increased
significantly in recent years, as the authorities seized a time-bound opportunity to finance
highly profitable infrastructure projects with concessional resources.
Policy and Reform Agenda for 2010 Onwards
Sound macroeconomic policies played a key role in mitigating the impact of the global crisis.
Amid the recent global crisis, the authorities‘ prudent economic management paid off,
providing space for much-needed countercyclical policies and pro-poor spending. Going
forward, the authorities will persevere in the implementation of the policy and reform agenda
set forth to achieve the objectives of PSI-supported policies.
Fiscal Policy and Reforms
The authorities are committed to the continuation of prudent fiscal management, notably
through strict control over expenditures. Going forward, the fiscal stance is expected to
improve significantly as the rapid implementation of the ongoing public investment program
recedes. In this regard, the overall fiscal deficit is forecast to decline by about 5 points of
GDP within the next two years. At the same time, care will continue to be taken to protect
priority spending, particularly those in favor of the poorest segments of the population. In

2
this connection, a broad range of pro-poor initiatives are being implemented, including social
security reform, training programs, and investments in social sectors.
Significant strides will be made in advancing the fiscal reform agenda. In 2011, the
authorities will continue to adhere to the established practice of conducting a mid-year fiscal
review. As part of the fiscal reform agenda, the draft individual and corporate income tax
bills are scheduled to be submitted to the National Assembly by the end of the first half of
2011.
The authorities‘ reform agenda also encompasses the reform of state-owned enterprises with
a view to containing fiscal risks emanating from their operations. Key among the steps taken
to facilitate the successful restructuring of public enterprises was the recent enactment of the
Law of State Enterprises, Public Managers, and Corporate Good Governance which
improved the regulatory framework for managing SOEs. Furthermore, the restructuring plan
for the electricity company Electra that is underway is expected to help contain operating
costs and promote private sector involvement. The airline company TACV registered last
year a marked improvement in its income situation and proceeded recently to the clearance of
its arrears to private providers. For the purpose of ensuring increased fiscal transparency and
accountability, a report will be prepared that summarizes contingent liabilities emanating
from SOEs as well as cross debt that exists between them.
Debt Management
Going forward, debt management will be geared toward reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio.
Domestic debt is expected to remain below 20 percent of GDP, thus providing support for the
exchange rate peg by helping maintain international reserves at comfortable levels. The
authorities intend to develop a medium-term debt strategy (MTDS) that will be presented to
the Council of Ministers in June 2011. The MTDS is expected to be instrumental in helping
manage public debt, especially since borrowing on nonconcessional terms is anticipated to
increase amid the increasingly limited availability of concessional resources that is expected
to result from Cape Verde‘s graduation from least-developed-country status.
As previously noted, the authorities are thus taking advantage of the time-bound availability
of concessional resources to implement ongoing large infrastructure projects. While
pressures on debt ratios are anticipated as a result of the implementation of these projects, the
high profitability of these projects which is illustrated by studies with the assistance of the
country‘s partners is expected to further strengthen debt sustainability in the medium term. It
is also noteworthy that upon completion of the ongoing PIP, capital spending financed by
external loans will be expected to decrease sharply.

3
Monetary Policy and Financial Sector Reform
Monetary policy will continue to be conducted by the Bank of Cape Verde (BCV) with a
view to supporting the exchange rate system and stabilizing the economy in the context of a
largely open capital account. Its conduct will benefit from the authorities‘ stated commitment
to improve the coordination of fiscal and monetary policy. In this regard, fiscal and monetary
authorities plan to sign by the end of this year an agreement by which the BCV will make
treasury securities the key instrument for monetary operations. It is also the authorities‘
intention to take necessary measures to develop the government security market notably
through the issuance of treasury bonds and recourse to auctions and information technology
to facilitate securities transactions.
Preserving financial stability will continue to rank high on the authorities‘ agenda. In this
respect, the BCV will work toward further strengthening its regulatory and supervisory
framework. From 2011 onwards, it plans on issuing regularly a financial stability report. At
the same time, it will keep monitoring closely banks‘ soundness indicators in line with
established practice. Going forward, financial stability will also be served by the planned
harmonization of prudential norms between onshore and offshore banking activities. The
draft legislation that will be prepared to this effect is scheduled to be submitted to the
parliament by the end of June 2011. In the meantime, the Finance Minister and the BCV
Governor intend to co-sign a MOU that will allow the finance ministry staff to integrate the
BCV standing financial stability committee. It is expected that this MOU will define formally
crisis management and information-sharing mechanisms to be put in place by the two
institutions whenever appropriate to address a crisis situation in an effective and
collaborative manner.
In light of Cape Verde‘s continued strong program and economic performance, we call on
Directors to consider favorably the authorities‘ request for a new PSI arrangement.
