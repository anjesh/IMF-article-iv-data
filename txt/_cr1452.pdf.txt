STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
January 27, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Context. Economic performance has been weak and public debt is high. Foreign reserves
are under pressure as fiscal and external imbalances widened in 2012 and further in 2013.
Recognizing the need for urgent action, the authorities announced ambitious budget
consolidation proposals in 2013 aimed at strengthening the fiscal position and arresting
the slide in reserves.
Focus of the consultation. The authorities stated clearly their desire and intention to
preserve the exchange rate peg―a position supported strongly by the private sector
and civil society in Barbados. In this context, discussions focused on the fiscal measures
needed to address immediate pressures, making monetary policy consistent with the
nominal exchange rate anchor, a medium-term fiscal framework, and reforms to boost
competitiveness.
Outlook and risks. Recent fiscal measures, if fully implemented, should stabilize debt levels
by 2016. However, downside risks are considerable and failure to implement corrective
policies could result in a disorderly adjustment process. Even with full implementation,
fiscal financing pressures and external sector sustainability would remain challenging.
Policy recommendations: A comprehensive and sustained fiscal effort is needed to reduce
vulnerabilities and lower public debt. To this end:


There is scope to raise tax revenues by strengthening revenue and customs
administration and by reducing widespread exemptions. However, spending
reductions will be critical, especially targeting the wage bill and inefficiencies in
public enterprises (where stronger governance is needed).



The social safety net must be preserved, but benefits should be better targeted to
strengthen protection for the most vulnerable, raise efficiency and lower costs.



A medium-term fiscal anchor is needed to guide policy formulation and
accountability. A debt-to-GDP target of 85 percent is recommended by 2018/19.



Monetary policy should be more consistent with the fixed exchange rate regime.



Closer monitoring of the financial system is required in view of elevated nonperforming loans (NPLs) and the risk of a deeper sovereign-financial feedback loop.



The growth strategy should focus on reducing business and labor costs.

INTRODUCTION
1.
The last Article IV consultation with Barbados was concluded in December 2011. At
that time, staff stressed that the widening fiscal deficit and debt were the key policy issues, and
encouraged the authorities to implement policies to deliver a credible fiscal consolidation plan.
The authorities requested a delay in the subsequent Article IV consultation because of general
elections, which were held in February 2013. The Democratic Labor Party was re-elected at that
time with a one-seat majority in the House of Assembly.
2011 Article IV Staff Report: Recommendations
The main recommendations included:
i)
ii)
iii)
iv)

reduce the deficit by lowering the wage bill and cutting transfers to public enterprises;
pursue a credible monetary policy by avoiding monetization of the deficit;
reduce reliance on the NIS for financing; and
maintain a positive interest rate differential vis-à-vis U.S. rates.

Despite some progress, many of the main recommendations were not addressed.

2.
Barbados is one of the most developed islands in the Caribbean. Economic activity
relies heavily on tourism and the offshore business sector. Per capita income is US$16,150 and
Barbados has the best human development indicators in the region, a testament to the country’s
high standards of equity and social protection. For decades the country has benefited from a
strong tradition of consultation and cooperation among labor, government and the private
sector, though this is now being tested by the challenging economic circumstances.
3.
The 2008 global financial crisis hit Barbados hard and performance has been weak
since then. The economy has contracted, on average, by 0.6 percent a year since 2008. Growth is
highly correlated with that of the U.K., and tourism from there has not recovered from the sharp
drop in 2009. Expansionary fiscal policies and weak revenues have led to a surge in public debt
and fiscal financing pressures. Under the exchange rate peg and with monetary policy
accommodative, foreign reserves declined through 2013 and confidence waned. In response, the
authorities announced fiscal consolidation proposals in August 2013 and more ambitious
measures in December aimed at arresting the slide in reserves and strengthening the fiscal
position.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
4.
Economic performance deteriorated in 2013. Output is estimated to have fallen by
about 0.7 percent in 2013, with weakness across both the traded and non-traded sectors. During
the period January–November 2013, long stay tourist arrivals fell by 5.5 percent, though this was
partially offset by longer average stays and a 12 percent increase in cruise passengers. Inflation

fell during the course of 2013 on the back of low commodity prices—the principal factor behind
price movements in Barbados—and also weak demand, dipping to 2 percent (y/y) at endOctober. Unemployment was recorded at 11.7 percent in September compared to 10.8 percent a
year earlier.
5.
The government’s fiscal problems go back several years. While the fiscal balance has
been in deficit since the early 2000s, the structural budget balance started to deteriorate in the
mid-2000s as spending and investment was ramped up for various capital projects, including
preparations for the Cricket World Cup in 2007, just prior to the onset of the global financial crisis.
The deficit has widened since then—except in 2011—as the government first applied counter-

cyclical policies to offset the impact of the global recession, then more recently (2012–13) as
revenues plummeted. Tax revenues fell by 6.5 percent in 2012/13 (fiscal year ending March) and
by 11 percent in the period April-September 2013. Moreover, financing estimates suggest that
the operating deficit of public enterprises has not improved in recent years, notwithstanding
higher transfers from the central government.1 There is evidence of public sector arrears
accumulation, with estimates ranging between 2–7 percent of GDP. Barbados was downgraded by
Moody’s and S&P in 2012 and by two notches (to Ba3 and BB- respectively) late in 2013.
6.
Public debt and fiscal financing pressures have been challenging. Central government
gross debt has risen sharply since 2009. The debt-to-GDP ratio has climbed from under
60 percent in 2009 to 94 percent at end-September 2013; including government securities held
by the National Insurance Scheme (NIS), it rose from about 80 percent to 128 percent. The gross
financing requirement in 2013/14 is 15.4 percent of GDP, or 39 percent of GDP including the
rollover of short term debt. The deficit has been financed increasingly with short-term funds from
domestic sources. In the first six months of 2013/14, domestic financial institutions and the central
bank provided the bulk of the financing in the form of T-bills, while the NIS provided about
1

11 percent in the form longer term debentures. NIS holdings of government paper are estimated
at about 67 percent of its portfolio, above the guideline recommended in the 13th actuarial review
to limit holdings in government securities to no more than 57 percent. Going forward, the
capacity of the NIS to absorb new government debt will be limited by balance sheet constraints
as the operating surplus has declined to near balance.
7.
Monetary policy has not been consistent with the fixed exchange rate framework.
A new interest rate policy was instituted in 2013 that made the 3-month Treasury-Bill rate the
benchmark rate and directed the central bank to intervene in the auction market. Under this
policy, the CBB absorbed about 44 percent of T-bills issued in the first 11 months of 2013 and
short term interest rates fell by about 50 basis points. Credit to the private sector, which had been
contracting since 2011, nonetheless continued to fall. The impact on liquidity has been eclipsed
by the decline in NFA, but monetization of the deficit has created uncertainty and confusion
about the primary objective of monetary policy.
8.
External stability has come under threat as the balance of payments incurred a large
deficit in 2013. The current account deficit is expected to have widened to 11.4 percent of GDP
in 2013 compared to a deficit of 10.1 percent of GDP in 2012. Receipts from tourism and goods
exports declined, and inflows of long-term private capital dropped to the lowest level since 2004,
implying a loss of confidence (Figure 3, Table 4). Foreign reserves have in recent years benefited
from two large asset sales. After a decision by the government in October to withdraw a planned
international bond offering, reserves dipped, reaching US$434 million by early December. Foreign
reserves were boosted subsequently by new commercial borrowing of US$150 million and
represented 3.2 months of imports at end-December 2013. This new loan, at an interest rate over
8 percent, offers the possibility of an additional US$75 million in 2014.
9.
Despite relatively strong structural indicators of competitiveness, export
performance data point to problems. On the one hand, Barbados scores well in regional nonprice competitiveness rankings (Box 3), and wages have been contained in recent years.
According to CBB data, real wages have declined by about 12 percent since 2009. The Fund’s
CGER analysis suggests only a moderate overvaluation of 2–8 percent (Annex II). In addition,
tourist arrivals from the U.K., the biggest market, are reportedly picking up this winter as growth is
finally strengthening there. On the other hand, overall tourism arrivals, exports, and growth have
been among the weakest in the region in recent years, and Barbados’ share of the Caribbean
tourism market fell from 3.0 percent of the total in 2007 to 2.65 percent in 2012, a 12 percent
decline. The real effective exchange rate (tourism weights) has appreciated by about 7 percent
since 2009.2
10.
As laid out in the accompanying FSSA, the domestic financial system appears to be
well capitalized, but credit quality and profitability have weakened. All banks in Barbados are

The real effective rate has appreciated by over 20 percent since 2008, but the U.S. dollar itself appreciated by
16 percent in real effective terms over the period March 2008–February 2009.

BARBADOS

foreign-owned: three are from Canada, two from Trinidad & Tobago, and one from the U.S. The
assets of Canadian banks account for 75 percent of the total. The overall capital adequacy ratio
(CAR) is high at 21.5 percent. The non-performing loan (NPL) ratio has risen steadily to
13.9 percent in June 2013 while provisions declined to 36 percent of NPLs from 60 percent in
2008 (Figure 5). Profitability has fallen as the share of loans in assets and the interest rate spread
have both shrunk. Claims on the government have risen to 20 percent of total domestic assets.
Barbados also has an important non-bank sector. Credit unions’ NPLs have increased from
5¼ percent of total loans in 2008 to over 8 percent in June 2013. Two Barbados-based financial
conglomerates have substantial external linkages, mainly through their operations in commercial
banking, insurance, and asset management in and outside of the Caribbean region. The FSAP
found that the large offshore financial sector does not appear to be a major source of risk given
that it is prevented by law from carrying out financial transactions with domestic residents.
11.
By May 2013, the authorities recognized the need for urgent action. After
consultation with their social partners, the authorities announced consolidation measures in
August, and more drastic measures in December. Staff estimate that the two packages would
yield a combined adjustment of about 6 percent of GDP over the period, or an improvement in
the primary balance of about 4.8 percent of GDP from 2013/14–2014/15. About three fourths of
the adjustment will come from expenditure cuts. The December announcement included a
reduction in the size of the civil service in 2014/15 by about 3,500, or 15 percent of the total,
further downsizing by attrition of about 500 positions per year until 2018/19, wage cuts for
elected and appointed officials, and a two year nominal wage freeze, among other measures (see
Box 1).3

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
12.
The sustainability of the debt hinges on the government’s ability to implement
timely and vigorous fiscal consolidation, but even then considerable risks remain. Based on
revenue performance and spending outturns this year, the fiscal deficit is projected to reach
9.6 percent of GDP in 2013/14, but is forecast to fall sharply to 5 percent of GDP in 2014/15 as the
full effect of budget measures is felt (Box 1). Central government debt is expected to peak at
95 percent of GDP in 2015. Interest expenses are expected to be the largest contributor to debt
accumulation, though improvements in the primary balance would play a major role in turning
around the debt trajectory. The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) highlights the vulnerability of
debt and financing needs to shocks to interest rates, GDP growth, the primary balance, and the
real exchange rate. There are also sizable downside risks from greater reliance on short term debt,
which adds to refinancing and interest rate risks, and contingent liabilities, which are not well
monitored and could be sizeable (see Annex I).

13.
Growth faces headwinds from fiscal
consolidation and weak competitiveness. Output is
projected to fall by 1.2 percent in 2014 before recovering
modestly in 2015. This forecast takes into account the
impact of current budget measures (Box 1), offset slightly
by positive growth effects from several large capital
investment projects. While the face value of these exceeds
10 percent of GDP, staff have projected their contribution
to growth to be limited given uncertainty about their
timing, scale, and in some cases limited impact on
employment. Looking forward, the baseline scenario
incorporates nominal wage restraint that, together with a
benign inflation outlook relative to trading partners,
envisions a real depreciation of about 7 percentage points
over the projection period.

14.
External sector sustainability would remain precarious. Fiscal consolidation and
weaker demand are expected to help lower the current account deficit in 2014 to 7.8 percent of
GDP, but it would remain above 6 percent of GDP in the medium term. The capital account will be
supported by larger inflows related to specific investment projects, but foreign reserves would
remain below desired comfort levels, and Barbados would require external financing in later years
to maintain reserves above a notional threshold of 3 months of imports (see “Unidentified
Financing”, Table 4). As a small state subject to higher macro volatility and vulnerable to external
shocks, Barbados would benefit from a much stronger reserve cushion to strengthen resilience.
15.
The government faces a considerable financing challenge. The total government
financing requirement in 2013/14 is high at 39 percent of GDP and is forecast to rise to about
50 percent of GDP by 2018/19 (Annex I). The increase in short-term debt raises concerns about
vulnerabilities in the debt profile, though risks are mitigated in part by the fact that it is
domestically held. Rollover risks will be helped in the near term because of liquidity in the
financial system, a smooth debt service profile, and the need for official approval of large capital
flows under capital account regulations. However, while there appears to be sufficient liquidity in
the system, most of the banks are not willing to raise their exposure to the sovereign much
further, balance-sheet constraints limit more government debt purchases by the NIS, and the
central bank may itself need to sell government bonds into the market to raise interest rates and
tighten monetary policy. Overall, risks appear manageable in the short term (¶32).
16.
Materialization of adverse risks in Barbados could have important spillovers in the
region, particularly in the ECCU. In the event of a disorderly adjustment or credit event, the
effects could spread to the region through both the trade and financial channels. The region
absorbs about 26 percent of Barbados’ exports and accounts for 11 percent of tourist arrivals.
Countries in the ECCU are considered to have an exchange rate that is over-valued, and financial
sectors are fragile due to capital shortfalls and high NPLs. Instability originating in Barbados could

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BARBADOS

spread via inter-connected financial systems, including via two large Barbados-based financial
entities. Materialization of sovereign risks in Barbados would likely have financial implications for
these conglomerates, with direct effects on policy holders (and shareholders) who are widely
dispersed across the Caribbean.
17.
The following risks would aggravate vulnerabilities and could trigger a disorderly
adjustment process (see RAM, Annex III, for these and other risks):


Delays or failure to implement planned fiscal measures. These risks are not negligible (e.g.
there is ongoing pressure from labor unions to unwind layoff decisions).4 A continuation of
policy trends could lead to further monetization of the deficit, drop in investor confidence,
further reserves losses, and pressure on the currency peg.



Heightened global financial market volatility, which could lead to increases in particular to
non-investment grade sovereign risk premia. This could impinge on Barbados’ access to
market financing, both domestically and externally, engender reserve losses, and again put
pressure on the currency peg.



A further decline in tourism receipts related to slower growth in the main advanced country
source markets. This would hurt growth, revenues and the balance of payments.



A fiscal shock in the U.S. or a shock in the U.K. or Trinidad & Tobago—Barbados’ three
biggest trade partners. One of the largest banks in Barbados is based in Trinidad (Box 5).

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
18.
The authorities face the challenging task of raising foreign reserves and reducing
the fiscal deficit in an environment of low growth, high debt, and a fixed exchange rate.
While adjustments in these circumstances often rely on currency devaluations, staff encountered
universal support across all stake-holders for maintaining the current exchange rate peg. Notably,
discussions with labor unions reaffirmed this position, even at the expense of job losses or wage
cuts. The authorities are cognizant of the costs and trade-offs of this approach, having observed
the difficult experience in other countries attempting internal devaluation in recent years, but also
having implemented themselves a steep and fairly successful internal devaluation in the early
1990s. At that time, Barbados underwent a fiscal adjustment of 7 percent of GDP in one year
accompanied by sizeable real wage reductions over several years, in addition to structural reforms
to raise productivity. While painful, the program restored balance to external flows quickly and
the government sustained primary surpluses between 2–4 percent of GDP for about ten
successive years. While recognizing this experience, staff cautioned that Barbados in 2014 carries
a much higher debt burden and faces limited financing options and a weaker growth
environment. Staff stressed that downside risks are considerable and the consequences of

while proposing other budget cuts to generate savings consistent with the government’s adjustment needs.

BARBADOS

insufficient action would be great and could lead ultimately to a costly and disorderly adjustment
process.
19.
The discussions centered on policy options to support the authorities’ objectives
and constraints. Specifically, the focus was first on immediate policy priorities to reduce the
deficit in the short term, help take pressure off foreign reserves, and reduce gross financing
needs. This was cast in the context of a medium-term strategy built around a fiscal anchor and
aimed at restraining wage policies and boosting productivity so as to strengthen external
competitiveness over time. The authorities agreed with staff that deep reforms will be needed
over the coming years to restore external and fiscal sustainability, and to raise growth.
Immediate Policy Priorities
In view of existing macro pressures, staff discussed with the authorities immediate priorities aimed at
supporting the peg by reducing domestic absorption and raising confidence in fiscal and monetary policies:
1. Implement some significant spending cuts and/or tariff increases in the coming weeks.
2. Cease central bank financing of the fiscal deficit, which aggravates pressures on foreign reserves.
3. Raise interest rates to align monetary policy with the exchange rate anchor and raise confidence.
4. Ensure that regulations on capital outflows would be effective in the event of an emergency.
5. Work with labor unions to develop wage arrangements that lower real labor costs over time.
6. Announce plans to design a credible medium-term fiscal strategy, anchored by a gross debt target.

A. Fiscal Adjustment to Restore Sustainability
20.
The authorities recognize the need for front-loaded fiscal adjustment to alleviate
financing pressures and reduce domestic absorption. In the staff’s view, a stronger and more
front-loaded strategy would reduce pressure on outflows, put reserves at more comfortable levels
sooner, and help reduce gross financing needs in the near term. This approach would also
leverage the current political momentum for consolidation and reform. The staff warned about
the impact on growth of stronger adjustment, indicating that growth would decline further in
2014, but noted that options were limited under prevailing constraints.
21.
Staff advocated for additional adjustment in order to reduce downside risks and
secure more durable growth. Staff recommended additional fiscal tightening of 1.1 percent of
GDP over the next five years, achieved through measures that return tax revenues back to their
pre-global crisis level of about 25 percent of GDP, coupled with further cuts in transfers to public
enterprises of around 0.3 percent of GDP. This scenario is presented in Table 7. In the staff’s view,
this additional fiscal effort would yield benefits by raising confidence sooner whilst accelerating
the process of rebalancing the economy away from government consumption to more privatesector led growth. The short-term cost in terms of lower growth would be offset in the mediumterm by higher reserves, lower domestic financing needs, and more durable growth. The private
sector would in turn have access to a greater pool of capital that would otherwise have been
absorbed by the government. Overall, these effects put the debt-to-GDP ratio on a steeper

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BARBADOS

downward trajectory, reaching about 85 percent by 2018/19.
22.
Expenditures will have to bear much of the fiscal adjustment burden in the short
term. Prospects for near-term revenue growth are constrained by capacity constraints in revenue
administration and structural weaknesses related to the design of domestic taxation. Spending
cuts should be distributed across functional and economic spending categories. Staff focused
attention on transfers to public enterprises (next section), the wage bill, and social safety net
considerations:

Wage bill. The central government wage
bill in Barbados had risen to 10.3 percent
of GDP in 2013, the highest in the
Caribbean. The authorities opted in
December for a major reduction in the
public sector workforce (including
employees at public enterprises) effective
Q1 2014, sending a strong signal about
their commitment to deficit reduction. At
the time, the team discussed the
alternative of downsizing by attrition and
implementing a wage formula to freeze
the average wage per worker. This would
have had the advantage of lowering
economy-wide labor costs, which is
needed to raise external competitiveness.

2004/05



Social spending. Barbados has a long-standing and much admired tradition of economic
equity and social justice (Figure 6). Healthcare and education in Barbados are provided free of
charge. Benefits to the unemployed include payments equivalent to 60 percent of salary, with
a nominal wage ceiling of B$4,200 per month, with benefits lasting 26 weeks (or 52 at partial
payment). The unemployed are also eligible for other benefits through the National
Assistance Board (NAB), which provide welfare services, including food vouchers and housing
assistance, to citizens on low income. The mission felt that it would be imperative to the
success of Barbados’ fiscal adjustment to maintain an adequate social safety net. In this
context, staff saw scope to strengthen the provision of social benefits with better targeting. In
some areas including child care, transport and the provision of low income housing, the
provision of services is not well targeted and may be benefiting middle and higher income
groups at the expense of the most needy. This leads to rationing based on non-economic
factors. There is also some duplication in the programs being provided. Staff proposed several
measures to improve the targeting of social benefits, including shifting to cash transfers (low
income housing) and also introducing means testing and raising tariffs accordingly (child care,
transport). This could bring about cost savings, ensure support for the most needy, and
generate secondary benefits for efficiency and resource allocation.

There is ample scope to raise domestic tax revenues over time:



Taxation. The tax base has been significantly eroded by waivers and exemptions. For example,
tax waivers by the Customs and Excise Department are estimated at over 5.5 percent of GDP
in 2012/13. In addition, there is significant revenue forgone from applying below-standard
rates to some taxpayers. Some of the 2013 measures move away from the goal of expanding
the base, and concessions to specific tourism projects in late 2013 further erode the tax base
and create a non-level playing field. The tax system would benefit from a comprehensive
review with the aim of broadening the base, improving equity, and reducing distortions and
the scope for discretion. The authorities have requested Fund technical assistance to review
domestic taxation, which is expected in 2014.



Revenue administration. Fund TA on revenue administration has identified needed reforms.
In addition to revenue losses from tax expenditures, staff analysis found gaps in revenue yield
caused by weaknesses in collection, including for example a low ratio of tax collected to tax
payable at the Inland Revenue administration and weak control and audit functions. In
addition, both revenue administrations lack management reports that could be used to
improve performance monitoring. Reducing this gap and strengthening revenue and customs
administration should be key pillars of the authorities' adjustment efforts in 2014. TA from the
Fund in recent months has provided guidance on ways to reform customs administration and
port activities.

24.
Problems with arrears signal a need to strengthen public financial management
(PFM). Staff collected partial information regarding the accumulation of arrears, including those
owed by the central government on tax refunds, by statutory boards to the private sector, and
between state entities, some of which were incurred years ago. In addition, a report on Public
Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) is being prepared by a CARTAC expert and
preliminary findings point to problems with the budget process, including participation and
adherence to a fixed calendar, poor availability of data for monitoring the stock of expenditure
payment arrears, insufficient reporting on government operations, including liabilities, the
absence of a medium-term perspective underlying fiscal planning, and ineffective payroll controls.
These issues will need to be addressed. At the same time, and following an audit and validation of
arrears, clearance of arrears should be a priority. This would unblock the flow of funds in the
system, boosting the cash flow of some firms, and mitigate some of the adverse consequences of
the fiscal adjustment program. Staff suggested adding an above-the-line provision in the 2014/15
budget for the clearance of some arrears.5
25.
Staff urges the ministry of finance to implement improvements in fiscal reporting as
soon as possible. As a starting point, the ministry of finance should begin producing regular
quarterly budget execution reports containing outturns on revenues and expenditures, including
5

This is not incorporated into the baseline pending more reliable data, including on inter-government arrears.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BARBADOS

those of statutory bodies, and financing incurred. Reports on the performances of the tax and
customs administrations should also be prepared on a regular basis. All of these should be
published on the ministry of finance website.
26.
Staff advocated for a medium term fiscal anchor to guide policy formulation and
accountability. The absence of a clear and comprehensive medium-term fiscal framework has
contributed to excessive deficits and public sector borrowing, and the gradual expansion of the
state into productive sectors. Staff recommended establishing a clear fiscal anchor—public sector
debt—to guide policy formulation and expectations. In the view of staff, a simple debt-to-GDP
target would present the most pragmatic and workable form of fiscal anchor. While a fiscal rule
may also be advisable in due course, further analysis would be needed on the suitability and type
of fiscal rule that would benefit Barbados, and on the administrative or legislative elements
needed for its implementation. For a debt target to be effective, staff noted that coverage would
need to be sufficiently comprehensive (encompassing activities related to public enterprises), and
reporting would have to be improved as noted above. Staff recommended a medium-term debtto-GDP target of 85 percent. As discussed above, reducing central government debt (excluding
NIS holdings) to below 85 percent of GDP by 2018/19 represents a reasonable pace of adjustment
that could be achieved without strangling growth while giving enough time to the authorities to
fully develop needed fiscal structural reforms. Longer-term, a lower debt ratio would be desirable.

Authorities’ views
27.
The authorities concurred with some of the team’s expenditure recommendations.
They felt very strongly about the need for large up-front measures that would deliver a strong
message about commitment to deficit reduction. They listened to staff’s proposal of strict
attrition, but believed that immediate measures were needed to reduce the government’s near
term cash needs and pressures on the balance of payments, as well as to demonstrate policy
resolve and raise confidence. They did include attrition and wage restraint in their medium-term
measures, to the extent possible within constitutional constraints. The authorities were receptive
to the need for a more targeted approach to social spending, but did not commit to measures
before taking broader decisions in the context of reform of statutory bodies. They acknowledged
the build-up in arrears, are taking stock and plan to outline a strategy and timetable for clearance.
They stated that total arrears were much lower than the high end of estimates reported.
28.
In other areas, the direction of policy will be formulated in the coming months. The
authorities were particularly interested in the team’s revenue analysis, which highlighted the
impact of weaknesses in tax administration. They have been working for several years with
CARTAC and the Caribbean Development Bank to establish a central revenue authority to remove
the administrative fragmentation that exists in the system. While the scheduled implementation of
April 1, 2014 is expected to be met, considerable work will ensue before integration will become
operational. The authorities were less receptive to examining issues related to tax expenditures,
particularly those related to tourism, but were willing to consider reductions in waivers not related
to foreign exchange producing sectors, and did so in the December measures (Box 1). They are

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

BARBADOS

anxious for a review by FAD of the domestic taxation system and acknowledged the need to
reform the administration of tax expenditures. They acknowledged weaknesses in technical
capacities at the Ministry of Finance in the area of revenue administration, macro fiscal analysis,
and the monitoring of public enterprises. They did not disagree with the need for a medium-term
fiscal framework or a debt target of 85 percent of GDP, but were not willing to go as far as a fiscal
rule to help set medium-term policy and considered that further analysis would be needed.
Finally, the authorities are working on a formal medium-term debt management strategy. The
strategy aims to complement adjustment efforts, and has been supported by Fund TA. Their
current strategy seeks to maximize domestic borrowing and limit international capital market
borrowing, with the aim of covering maturing international bond payments while building up
international reserves.

B. Reform of Public Enterprises Critical for Managing Public Finances
29.
Reforms to PEs are needed to support the consolidation effort. Oversight and
accountability with respect to the operations of the statutory bodies is lacking (Box 4). The
ministry of finance confirmed that most PEs have not submitted financial reports for several years,
undermining the fiscal planning framework and the integrity of the budget process. The decision
to reduce transfers to PEs is welcome but these must translate into reforms at PEs in order for the
adjustment to be effective. In particular, new business plans are needed to inform resource
allocation, staffing, whether to spin off commercial activities, how to improve targeting of support
to the vulnerable groups, and whether to raise tariffs.
30.
Staff recommend establishing a high-level committee to strengthen oversight of
PEs. While operating deficits appear manageable, the non-financial public sector currently poses
a risk to fiscal adjustment efforts. Supplementary budget requests from PEs are routine and
several may arise in the coming months. The committee proposed by staff should report to
cabinet, under the guidance of the minister of finance, to ensure enforcement of reporting
requirements. A calendar specifying the documents to be submitted for review should be
established; the committee should monitor monthly expenditure commitments to PEs; the
Accounting Unit should receive the resources and technical skills necessary to carry out its
oversight tasks; and the authorities should prepare a financial summary annex of the aggregate
PE sector in the 2014/15 budget. More fundamentally, recent developments suggest that
Barbados needs a stronger legislative framework—covering reporting, audit and accounting
provisions, management and board selection and removal provisions, and sanctions for failure to
comply—to underpin the operations and accountability of PEs.

Authorities’ views
31.
The authorities welcomed staff recommendations regarding the management and
accountability of PEs. They noted the lack of compliance with existing rules mandating
submission of audited financial statements by PEs to their oversight boards in a timely fashion.
There is some concern that the governing Boards of PEs are not well informed of their oversight
duties (and staff questioned whether they were sufficiently removed from political interference).
14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BARBADOS

The authorities were interested in the suggestions by staff noted above. They requested technical
assistance, which CARTAC will begin in early 2014, and have begun initiatives to address
corporate governance of PEs.

C. Monetary Policy Should Be Consistent with the Exchange Rate Regime
32.
Monetary policy should be consistent with the nominal exchange rate anchor. The
authorities wish to retain the nominal exchange rate anchor, yet monetary policy has not been
supportive of this aim. The CBB could clarify the monetary framework by reiterating that the
primary objective of monetary policy is to safeguard the exchange rate anchor and making
international reserves the operational target. The policy stance should be reoriented to better
support the peg by allowing short-term rates to more closely reflect market conditions that
embody a credible sovereign risk premium. Based on the trends preceding the CBB’s new interest
rate policy and recent developments in perceived credit risks, an increase in short term rates of at
least 100 basis points could help to raise confidence, contribute to containing incentives for
capital flight, and entice the domestic financial system to hold more government securities.
33.
The CBB should end direct financing of the government. The scale of intervention in
the T-bill market should be limited and interest rates allowed to rise in the short term. This will
provide reassurance that monetary policy is consistent with the currency peg and signal
operational independence of the CBB. Staff assesses that this can be done without undermining
government financing prospects, as the reduction in gross financing needs in 2014/15 under the
baseline would roughly offset the decline in central bank financing. Since the authorities’
adjustment policies will take time to restore external stability and rebuild buffers, they may need
to tighten the implementation of existing capital controls in the event of significant market
turbulence and outflows.6 Against this backdrop staff recommended carefully reviewing existing
regulations and their efficacy. Staff noted, however, that these policy tools can only help in the
short term and must be complemented by measures to address fundamental fiscal imbalances.

Authorities’ views
34.
The CBB recognized the need to cease direct financing of the government. The
authorities acknowledged that monetization of the deficit could be exacerbating pressures on
reserves. The central bank noted that interest rate decisions aim to follow the medium term trend
in comparable U.S. rates, plus a CBB-determined country premium. Monetary policy decisions are
also driven by considerations about the level of liquidity in the financial system, domestic demand
conditions, and the government’s cash position. The CBB is concerned that higher interest rates
could raise financing costs for the government, strengthen banks’ bias towards short term
lending, and increase the debt service burden of the private sector, which would hurt investment
and raise NPLs.
6

Barbados has not introduced any measures that would give rise to exchange restrictions or multi-currency
practices subject to Fund approval.

BARBADOS

D. Raising Growth a Challenge, But There Is Room for Action
35.
Efforts to reinvigorate growth will be a critical element of medium term adjustment.
After stabilization of the macro situation, the staff and authorities both attach high priority to the
growth imperative, which will be essential for overcoming medium term debt dynamics. Both
tourism and the international business sector face greater competition from the region. Barbados
lowered off-shore tax rates in 2011 to match competing centers, but new licenses decreased
again in 2012 (Figure 1). A key impediment to investment cited by the private sector is the
inefficiency and low quality of public services.
36.
The key tourism sector could benefit from a more cohesive strategy, covering both
supply and demand considerations. Staff views the objective of revitalizing the tourism sector
as appropriate given the country’s geographical endowment, its role as a foreign exchange earner
and its importance for the Barbados “brand”. Recent measures to expand supply include an
expansion in cruise passenger arrival capacity, generous tax incentives for an all-inclusive resort,
and airline promotions, including for low-cost airlines. As these initiatives appear to move away
from attracting the high-end tourist, further market research may be warranted on Barbados’
niche market and identifying new sources of demand, particularly in light of supply expansion
elsewhere in the Caribbean. This would have important implications for key investment, taxation
and marketing decisions.
37.
To facilitate investment, the growth strategy should focus more on measures to
strengthen competitiveness by reducing the costs of doing business and raising
productivity. Staff cautioned that the growth strategy should rely less on government spending
and incentives, particularly those that create new tax expenditures and contingent liabilities for
the state. The capital stock has declined in recent years and domestic investment is not projected
to rise significantly in the medium term. Based on recent international surveys and discussions
with the private sector, reforms should focus first on addressing refund tax arrears, streamlining
customs processes and reducing bureaucratic procedures at the port—administrative changes
with limited budget cost and that could raise incentives for private investment. Recommendations
in key areas have already been prepared and staff urge the authorities to implement them with
high priority. The authorities will need to work closely with their social partners to develop
innovative approaches to lowering labor costs.
38.
Labor market reforms would help strengthen the supply response to fiscal
adjustment, and facilitate the re-absorption of surplus public sector workers. The authorities
have programs in place to assist workers who face redundancy, including through counseling and
retraining. There are also programs to orient skills development toward those sought by the
market. However, the rules imposed under many collective labor agreements, for example on
working hours permitted, and the lengthy process required under legislation to permit dismissal,
are rigidities that raise costs and discourage employment. They also hinder the economy’s supply
response, which should be a priority given the need to improve resource allocation and lower
domestic production costs. The authorities should urge labor representatives to reassess the
impact of these regulations on employment growth.
16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BARBADOS

39.
Agriculture presents a potential new source of growth. There could be scope to raise
agriculture output and employment given a growing demand for fresh, local produce coming
from the cruise ship and hotel markets. However, efforts are needed to help modernize
agriculture processes, including adapting crop management, strengthening technology and
processing methods to meet international quality standards, strengthening management
practices, and integrating the production chain with the tourism sector. The IDB is providing
assistance in this area.
40.
Divestment of some state assets could help lower debt and raise private sector
investment and growth. The authorities may wish to consider divestment of non-strategic assets
to help reduce the nation’s debt burden while at the same time contributing to productivity.
These could include selling shares in some public enterprises, real estate holdings, and eventually
some of the transport activities. Sales which involved FDI would be particularly helpful by
removing potential constraints to enterprises financing their investments.

Authorities’ views
41.
The authorities are aware of potential competitiveness challenges. While they did not
disagree with the possible benefits of lowering domestic prices, they are confident in the quality
of the Barbados brand and the desirability of Barbados as a tourist destination stemming from its
high levels of human capital, good infrastructure, and a safe, business-friendly environment. They
referred to a paper by the CBB (Worrell et al) showing that competitiveness in the tradable
sectors, including tourism, has improved. The study attempted to establish a broader measure of
competitiveness in the Caribbean and Central America by constructing an index of price and nonprice indicators, including using domestic sectoral price indices relative to regional competitors.7
The authorities believe that growth will be higher than predicted by staff, based on their robust
growth strategy.
42.
The government is pursuing an ambitious agenda of capital investment projects.
Their growth strategy is built on revitalizing the tourism sector, moving to green energy sources,
promoting the international business sector, and expanding growth in the agriculture and
manufacturing sectors. More specifically, they propose improving product quality, developing
new markets for existing products and services, developing green energy, and promoting private
sector investment. As noted earlier, this will entail public and private projects in infrastructure
(pier marina, cruise terminal, roads), tourism (hotel construction, refurbishment and marketing),
support for alternative energy development and cane sugar restructuring. Some of these involve
official external financing, while others are privately financed. These should help to offset the drag
on growth from fiscal adjustment, but some of these projects may involve state guarantees, which
will add to the country’s already high debt burden.
7

Staff could not substantiate the findings because of the absence of sectoral deflators and inconsistencies in the
national accounts statistics and deflators. See paragraph 46.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BARBADOS

E. Maintaining Financial Stability Will Need Close Monitoring, Stronger
Supervision
43.
Staff highlighted the importance of maintaining close monitoring of the financial
system. While the FSAP concluded that the onshore financial system could withstand
considerable shocks, vulnerabilities arise under various severe shocks, including liquidity shocks
(Box 5). Banks’ capital levels may be overstated given uncertainty about collateral valuations as
well as less stringent provisioning requirements than in other countries. Staff encouraged the
authorities to improve the monitoring of commercial banks’ credit risks and collateral values, and
to revise the provisioning schedule to align it with international norms. In the credit union sector,
a two-tiered supervisory approach should be established in view of the significant heterogeneity
across credit unions and resolution procedures should be strengthened. In particular, the two
large credit unions merit “bank-like” supervision in terms of frequency and detail which would
require strengthening the onsite supervision departments at the FSC. In the insurance sector,
further progress is needed to strengthen liability valuations, capital adequacy standards and
cross-border group supervision. While there is a solid legal basis and good cross-border
communication within the Caribbean, crisis management plans should be finalized and should
include detailed plans to deal with a crisis in the non-bank sector. The mandate and tools of the
Financial Oversight Management Committee (FOMC) should be clarified and improved.
44.
Stress tests conducted as part of the FSAP Update reveal the financial sector’s
vulnerability to shocks. (A summary of the main risks is presented in Box 5). Given the sector’s
sizable and growing holdings of government securities, a sovereign credit event could have
adverse (direct and indirect) implications for banks’ capital positions. Under a bottom-up solvency
test, the direct impact of a severe shock would drive the system’s CAR down to 13.7 percent.
However, under a severe macro shock scenario that involves second-round effects on private
loans and an eventual deposit run, the banking system’s CAR would decline to 8 percent, with two
banks falling below the regulatory minimum. A large insurance company has also considerable
exposure to sovereign bonds, representing about 25 percent of its total assets.

Authorities’ views
45.
The authorities generally agreed with the FSAP recommendations. In response to
advice to strengthen the monitoring of credit risks, they are considering revisions to the CBB Act
and the Financial Institutions Act, and are keen to introduce some other measures, such as
establishing a credit bureau. They are participating in regional supervisory colleges and intend to
further strengthen monitoring of key financial indicators in the region. The CBB also stepped up
communication with the Canadian authorities to strengthen cooperation between supervisory
institutions. While acknowledging elevated credit risk, the authorities project the NPL ratio to
drop soon from 13.9 percent to 10–11 percent after one large hotel loan recently became current,
and another NPL on a large hotel property will be paid off following its acquisition by the
government.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BARBADOS

OTHER
46.
A number of data shortcomings have emerged in recent years. The Barbados Statistics
Service (BSS) compiles the nominal GDP series and the CBB the real series, and these are not
compatible. Staff noted the major differences in the direction of the GDP deflator and CPI index
since 2009 and, in the projections, have derived the real GDP series based on the consumer price
index. Thus there is not a reliable deflator, nor are there deflators by sector (Barbados does not
prepare a full expenditure-based GDP series). With the assistance of CARTAC, the BSS has begun
to prepare a constant price GDP series by industry, using 2006 as a base year, which is expected
to be available in 2014. With respect to the fiscal sector, recent data on the financial performance
of public enterprises is not available, and there are no official estimates of arrears accumulation.
There are a few unexplained discrepancies in the monetary statistics, including a large “Other
Items Net” entry. Some of these data are macro-critical and, if they persist, could impede the
staff’s ability to conduct effective surveillance.
47.
Barbados is not contributing to reducing tax competition in the Caribbean. Fiscal
incentives in the tourism sector, including subsidies to airlines, have proliferated as governments
in the region are drawn into the practice of offering generous tax concessions to tour operators
to encourage their foreign direct investment and to secure long term contracts to operate
facilities. In aggregate, the most productive sector in the region may be benefitting from the
lowest effective tax rates, implying a wealth transfer away from residents towards tourists and
foreign tourism operators. Countries would benefit from a regional approach to reduce or limit
the trend. The Fund plans to do some research into the issue for the next Caribbean conference.

STAFF APPRAISAL
48.
Adjustment is urgently needed to avoid an external crisis. The authorities face the
challenging task of raising foreign reserves and reducing the fiscal deficit in an environment of
low growth, high debt, and a fixed exchange rate. Recent fiscal measures, if fully implemented,
should stabilize central government debt levels by 2016, but downside risks would still be
considerable and failure to implement corrective policies could result in a disorderly adjustment
scenario. Even with full implementation, fiscal financing pressures and external sector
sustainability would remain challenging. A more comprehensive and sustained effort is needed to
lower public debt and raise economic growth. Accordingly, staff recommended additional fiscal
tightening of 1.1 percent of GDP over the next five years in order to reduce vulnerabilities and
raise confidence sooner whilst accelerating the process of rebalancing the economy away from
government consumption to more private-sector led growth. Short-term costs in terms of lower
growth would be offset in the medium term by higher reserves, lower domestic financing needs,
and more durable growth. Overall, this scenario would put the debt-to-GDP ratio on a steeper
downward trajectory, reaching about 85 percent by 2018/19.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

BARBADOS

49.
There is scope to raise tax revenues. The tax base has been eroded by waivers and
exemptions over the years. The tax system would benefit from a comprehensive review with the
aim of broadening the base, improving equity, and reducing distortions and the scope for
discretion. TA from FAD is expected in 2014. TA recommendations on improving tax and customs
administration, port procedures and public finance management should be adopted promptly.
50.
Expenditures will bear most of the burden of adjustment. The central government
wage bill in Barbados is the highest in the Caribbean (excluding public employees at state
enterprises). With layoffs of 15 percent of the public sector, the authorities are sending a strong
signal of commitment to deficit reduction. Staff recommends that these workers have full access
to unemployment support and programs for re-employment. Cuts in transfers will also be
possible with reforms to public enterprises and social spending.
51.
New business plans and improved governance of PEs are needed to support fiscal
consolidation. The non-financial public sector currently poses a risk to fiscal sustainability.
Oversight and accountability with respect to the operations of the PEs is weak, eroding the fiscal
planning framework and integrity of the budget process. A fundamental review of PEs should
assess their purpose, raise efficiency, and improve governance and accountability. A high-level
committee to strengthen oversight of PEs could report to cabinet, under the guidance of the
Minister of Finance, to ensure enforcement of reporting requirements.
52.
Preserving an adequate social safety net will be crucial. With the increase in
unemployment projected in the short-term, the authorities should ensure that the social safety
net contains targeted provisions that allow the unemployed sufficient time and retraining
opportunities to rejoin the labor market. In the areas of child care, transport and low income
housing, the provision of services is not well targeted and may be benefiting middle and higher
income groups at the expense of the most needy. Improving the targeting of social benefits,
including shifting to cash transfers, and introducing means testing and raising tariffs accordingly,
would bring about cost savings, ensure adequate resources to support the most needy (while
eliminating rationing), and generate secondary benefits for efficiency and resource allocation.
53.
Arrears should be resolved transparently and promptly. While the government is
taking stock of the situation, staff encourage the authorities to add a provision in the 2014/15
budget for clearance of some or all arrears. This would unblock the flow of funds in the system
and mitigate some of the adverse effects of fiscal consolidation.
54.
A medium-term fiscal anchor would help to guide policy formulation and
accountability. In order to better manage recurrent expenditures and anchor fiscal expectations,
spending cuts should be set within the context of the medium term fiscal framework. Establishing
a clear fiscal anchor—public sector debt below 85 percent of GDP—would better guide policy
formulation and expectations.
55.
Monetary policy should be consistent with the fixed exchange rate regime. The CBB
could reiterate the primary objective of monetary policy is to safeguard the exchange rate anchor

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BARBADOS

and stop direct financing of the government. The scale of intervention in the T-bill market should
be limited and interest rates allowed to rise in the short term to reflect a credible country risk
premium. This will provide reassurance that monetary policy is consistent with the currency peg
and signal operational independence of the CBB.
56.
The growth strategy should focus on reducing the costs of doing business. The
growth strategy should rely less on spending initiatives and government incentives, particularly
those that create new tax expenditures and contingent liabilities for the state while promoting
unhelpful regional tax competition, and more on improving revenue administration, addressing
tax arrears, streamlining customs processes and reducing bureaucratic procedures at the port. TA
recommendations in these areas should be implemented promptly. The objective of revitalizing
the tourism sector is appropriate, but further consideration may be warranted on the best “target
market” for Barbados in the 21st century.
57.
Labor market reforms would improve the supply response of the economy, and help
absorb surplus public sector workers. The rules imposed under many collective labor
agreements, for example on working hours permitted, and the lengthy process required under
legislation to permit dismissal, are rigidities that raise costs and discourage employment. The
authorities should urge labor representatives to reassess the impact of these regulations on
employment growth and suggest options for their removal.
58.
Divestment of some state assets might help lower debt whilst raising growth. The
authorities may wish to consider divestment of commercial assets to help reduce the nation’s
debt burden while at the same time enhancing productivity.
59.
Maintaining financial stability will require close monitoring of the financial system.
The risk of a negative sovereign-financial feedback loop warrants close monitoring. Consistent
with the recommendations of the FSAP Update, the authorities should align the provisioning
requirements with international norms and strengthen supervision of credit unions and insurance
companies. Crisis management plans should be finalized and include detailed plans to deal with a
crisis in the non-bank sector. The mandate and tools of the Financial Oversight Management
Committee (FOMC) should be clarified and improved.
60.
A number of data shortcomings should be addressed. In particular, inconsistencies in
the nominal and real GDP series, expenditure-based GDP, data on financial performance of public
enterprises, and discrepancies in the monetary statistics should be resolved promptly.
61.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Barbados be conducted
on the standard 12-month cycle.

Box 1. Barbados: Fiscal Adjustment Measures in 2013
In August 2013, the authorities presented a 19-month fiscal consolidation program to arrest the slide in
reserves and strengthen the fiscal position. The August proposals were complemented by more drastic
measures in December 2013. Staff estimates that the two packages would yield a cumulative adjustment
equivalent to about 6 percent of GDP by 2014/15, mainly from expenditure measures (see Table below). The
authorities’ objective is to reduce the overall fiscal deficit from 8 percent of GDP in 2012/13 to less than
3 percent of GDP in 2014/15, and to less than 2 percent of GDP by 2020/21.
Staff project fiscal deficits to remain somewhat higher than the authorities’ targets because of higher
interest rates/payments and a weaker projected yield of announced measures (due in part to weaknesses in
revenue administration, especially the control and audit functions) and the likelihood of some difficulties at
achieving the targeted savings in the context of weak growth.
Revenues. Measures are aimed at stabilizing declining revenues in a way that shares the burden across
society. They include a temporary high-income surtax, lottery tax, end of car excise rollback, tax on bank
assets, tobacco excise tax, “waste” tax on property, and reduction in certain waivers, especially those not
related to the foreign exchange earning sectors. There is also a reduction in the VAT rate for tourism that will
lower revenues. All of these measures are at various stages of implementation and staff predict that their
cumulative contribution to fiscal adjustment could amount to about 1.5 percent of GDP by 2015/16.

Box 1. Barbados: Fiscal Adjustment Measures in 2013 (continued)
Expenditures. Measures are aimed at reducing current spending by cutting: (i) personal emoluments,
mostly by retrenchment of 2,000 employees and a strict program of attrition across the central government
combined with a freeze on the payment of increments in fiscal years 2014-2015; (ii) subsidies and transfers,
including to public enterprises, starting with the retrenchment of 1,000 employees in statutory entities, a
reduction in the number of statutory entities, and introducing tuition payment for tertiary education; and
(iii) goods and services, including through energy savings and better procurement practices. Implementation
of these measures could pose some legal and political challenges.
Staff projections include small allowances for retrenched workers in the form of departure grants (equivalent
to about one month of salary). Projections did not itemize their potential retraining costs, but significant
savings could still be generated on various spending lines, especially transfers, to finance such costs. Staff
estimate that, if implemented as planned, the measures could yield a cumulative contribution of about
4.5 percent of GDP by 2015/16.

Box 2. Fiscal Multipliers, Fiscal Consolidation, and Growth
Multiplier values for the Caribbean countries are estimated to be below one and low.1 Recent empirical
estimates for the Caribbean found that cumulative fiscal multipliers are less than 0.3 after 24 quarters and
for Barbados reached a maximum of 0.20 after 24 quarters.
Low multipliers in the Caribbean are related to a high degree of openness, with domestic demand primarily
satisfied through imports. Additionally, a high current public debt level in Barbados is likely to dampen the
impact of government spending through concerns over future tax rises or, more seriously, government
solvency. Despite the real possibility of small multipliers in Barbados, a slowing economy coupled with a
large fiscal consolidation could exacerbate the downturn, creating a negative feedback-loop worsening the
debt-to-GDP ratio. One lesson from the financial crisis in 2008–09 suggests that spending multipliers are
highly nonlinear, varying over the economic cycle.

Guidance Note on Fiscal Multipliers, IMF (November 2013)
http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/spn/2009/spn0911.pdf

The extent to which fiscal consolidation affects real output also depends on the degree to which adjustment
falls on revenues or expenditures. If fiscal adjustment falls primarily on taxes, this may yield a smaller effect
on real output than if much of the consolidation were to fall on spending, which, in general, has been shown
to have higher multipliers than net taxes by around 50 percent. However, this needs to be tempered by
earlier empirical evidence finding that cuts in current expenditure have been the most growth friendly in
small states, and the most durable (IMF, 2007).
If adjustment is to occur on the expenditure side then focusing the cuts on government consumption, as
opposed to investment, will help lessen the impact on real output. Cuts to government investment both
squeeze aggregate demand effect and reduce aggregate supply effect via production and the marginal
productivity of capital and labor, as well as by reducing complementarities with private investment. That
said, the argument is somewhat academic since Barbados has already cut capital spending over the past few
years so the focus would be on defining current spending.

Box 2. Fiscal Multipliers, Fiscal Consolidation, and Growth (continued)
Adjustment scenario
Projecting the effect of a multi-year fiscal consolidation on real output growth is undertaken using the
2

template in Bi, Qu and Roaf (2013). The estimates are derived on an assumed multiplier of between 0.3 and
1.0 and a fiscal consolidation program, as laid out in staff’s illustrative adjustment scenario (Table 7),
equivalent to an adjustment in the primary budget balance of 6.8 percent of GDP over the next five years,
lowering the debt-to-GDP ratio to about 85 percent of GDP by 2018.
With fiscal consolidation being front-loaded and
large in size, the estimates show that, in the short

30

108

term, output declines below potential and below
the real growth path forecast in the baseline
scenario.

Box 3. Barbados: Competitiveness Indicators
Barbados continues to rank well in the region in terms of broad-based indicators of overall competitiveness
and in the tourism sector in particular. Barbados is favored by a strong business, institutional and legal
environment, well-developed infrastructure, a stable socio-political environment, and well-educated
populace.
The World Economic Forum’s (WEF) 2013-14 global competitiveness rankings place Barbados 47th out of a
total of 148 countries, slightly below its rank in 2012-13 (44). It fares well compared with other small
Caribbean states. Barbados also scores well on the WEF’s tourism competitiveness ranking, at 27 out of
140 countries, the top ranking of any Caribbean country. Barbados caters towards the higher-end of the
tourist market, and tour operators, hotel operators and government tourism officials acknowledge that they
have a higher cost structure and do not compete on price with other high volume Caribbean destinations
such as Cancun and the Dominican Republic. Barbados also supports a vibrant international business sector
and offshore financial center, comprising more than 4,000 licensed entities in 2012, including 45 offshore
banks.
Nevertheless, a number of indicators point to an erosion in Barbados’ competitive position, and it is unclear
whether the tourism development model that focuses on high-end clientele—at higher costs—is adequate
to maintain its international competitiveness:


The Barbados dollar has been pegged to the U.S. dollar since 1975. The real effective exchange rate has
appreciated by about 12 percent (INS weights) since 2009, but by about 22 percent since 2008, the year
the US dollar appreciated sharply against most advanced market currencies.



An analysis of the real exchange rate, indicates a moderate overvaluation. The three standard CGER
methodologies (Annex II) indicate a moderate overvaluation, within a range of 2.5–8.0 percent from its
equilibrium level.



Despite its rank in the WEF tourism competitiveness index, Barbados has been losing market to other
Caribbean destinations, and in terms of visitor expenditures. Total tourist arrivals to Barbados fell to
2.7 percent of the Caribbean total (2012), representing a steady decline from 3.0 percent in 2007, and a
larger decline since the early 1990s, when its share was about 4.5 percent. The Caribbean share of world
tourism has also fallen over this period.



Barbados slipped 7 spots in the World Bank’s Doing Business ranking from 84 in 2013 to 91 in 2014, out
1

of 189 countries . While Barbados outperforms on average other Caribbean and Central American
countries and does relatively well on some measures, it performed poorly on protecting investors,
registering property, paying taxes, and resolving insolvency.

Box 4. Public Enterprises in Barbados1
The activities of public enterprises (PE) in Barbados
have expanded steadily in recent years. The operations

revenues and expenditures of the government. With

Barbados Water Authority (BWA)*

the exception of the Barbados National Oil Co. (BNOC)
and Barbados Water Authority (BWA), expenses
exceed revenues, including after receiving direct
transfers from the central government. Allocations to
PEs are legislated in advance in the annual budget
ratified by parliament, but PEs can and do submit
“supplemental budget appropriation” requests during
the fiscal year. Many PEs have not reported financial
results to the Ministry of Finance for several years, nor

do they have recent audited financial statements. There is little in terms of sanctions should PEs fail to
comply and submit, as demanded by the law, audited financial accounts in a timely manner. These practices
adversely affect the budgeting process and raise questions about the management, governance, and
accountability of PEs.
The most recent financial reports available from 2011 record an aggregate deficit of about 2.5 percent of
GDP, after transfers from the central government. Deficits after transfers have been financed with short-term
debt, loans from the NIS, loans guaranteed by the government, or by arrears. The lack of up-to-date
financial information means that a significant element of the public finances is not being reflected in the
government’s fiscal planning. These include contingencies to the central government resulting from offbalance sheet activities, implicit loan guarantees, and the accumulation of arrears to suppliers.
PE reform will be an essential part of Barbados’ efforts to reduce the public sector borrowing requirement,
develop a sustainable fiscal position, and to manage domestic demand—a critical tool in a small open
economy with a fixed exchange rate. Equally important would be the impact of PE reform on economic
growth given the size and influence of PEs in the Barbados economy and the need for a growth strategy
focused on raising productivity and innovation in the economy. A task force commissioned by the
government has reportedly concluded that up to 18 PEs could be closed or merged based on duplication
and inefficiency.
In order to reduce the fiscal deficit, August budget measures announced cuts in transfers to PEs by five
percent and the December measures imposed a further 1,000 job redundancies from PEs and a two year
nominal wage freeze. PEs are also now spending less on goods and services and many have also introduced
attrition policies.
Without knowing the conclusions of the task force noted above, a strategic review of the rationale for the
public provision of services is warranted, starting with the ten biggest PEs.

There are over 200 public “agencies”, of which about 40 are “public enterprises” and/or “statutory boards”. All are
defined as public enterprises (PEs) in this box.

28

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BARBADOS

Box 4. Public Enterprises in Barbados (continued)
In the near term, there are low hanging fruits that could produce some savings and efficiencies. First, the
services provided by many PEs are heavily subsidized, the prices of which have steadily declined in real
terms. For example, the cost of child care provided by the Child Care Board has not changed for 20 years
and is rationed in a non-economic manner. Second, many services, including those provided by the
Transport Board, are not means tested. This suggests that scarce resources may be benefiting middle or
higher income groups at the expense of the most needy. Third, average wages in PEs are reportedly higher,
as much as two times higher, than in comparable jobs in the private sector. This is supported by the very low
turnover of employees. Fourth, activities in some PEs have evolved into areas that could arguably be
considered commercially viable.
Staff recommend the following near term priorities:


strengthen financial reporting, including possibly establishing an independent, high level committee
to ensure follow through;



strengthen the budget process to make off-budget activities related to PEs more transparent;



undertake a management review of the largest PEs to align activities with stated mandates;



reduce duplication of services and rationalize operations, including outsourcing; and



explore the scope for tariff reforms to improve the targeting of benefits in keeping with Barbados’
long tradition of social equity.

The authorities have requested technical assistance from CARTAC towards reform of PEs, which is expected
to start in early 2014.

Box 5. Barbados 2013 FSAP Update: Findings and Recommendations
While the banking system in Barbados appears well capitalized and supported by strong foreign parent
banks, there are important macro-financial risks. Credit quality and profitability have weakened considerably
and could be worse than reported due to unrecognized collateral weaknesses. Banks’ non-performing loan
(NPL) ratio has risen from 3.5 percent in 2008 to 13.9 percent in June 2013 and provisions have declined.
Capital may be viewed as overstated in view of the higher share of assets in government securities (with a
zero risk weighting). Overall, the interaction of the financial system with the weakening sovereign and the
protracted slowdown risk an adverse sovereign-financial-real economy feedback loop.
That said, the onshore financial system could withstand considerable shocks based on the results from the
FSAP analysis. Under the stress-testing exercise, domestic banks are resilient to large shocks, although
vulnerabilities arise under severe scenarios. With large capital buffers (CAR: 21.5 percent in June 2013) and
adequate liquidity, banks can withstand large to severe shocks without breaching regulatory requirements.
Vulnerabilities are concentrated in a branch of a foreign bank, and in the credit union sector, which does not
benefit from foreign parents or have access to safety nets. The largest credit unions can withstand moderate
shocks.
The offshore sector is large, but its risk to the financial system appears limited. Assets of the 45 offshore
banks licensed in Barbados amount to B$89 billion, in excess of 1,000 percent of GDP. Offshore banks are
mostly non-deposit takers and dedicated to treasury and trust management. Their financial transactions are
restricted exclusively to non-residents, segregating the sector from the onshore financial system.
Barbados has improved its regulatory and supervisory frameworks in recent years. Consolidated risk-based
supervision was introduced in the banking sector. Established in April 2011, the Financial Services
Commission (FSC) took over supervisory responsibilities for all non-bank financial institutions. The FSC has
been active in upgrading supervisory independence and effectiveness, as evidenced by the issuance of key
guidelines and methodologies and the hiring and training of staff.
Potential vulnerabilities in the insurance sector are emerging. Inadequate liability valuation standards and
lack of data on foreign affiliates prevent an effective assessment by the FSAP team. The presence of a major
regional holding based in Barbados and significant expansion of its non-insurance financial operations
create the potential for vulnerabilities.

30

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BARBADOS

Box 5. Barbados 2013 FSAP Update: Findings and Recommendations (continued)
Recommendations:
1)

CBB independence should be strengthened significantly. Current provisions contained in the CBB Act
empower the Ministry of Finance to overrule policies or corrective measures taken by the CBB. While
these powers have never been used, they should be removed.

2)

On regulation, concerns remain regarding the adequacy of enforcement actions and loan loss
provisioning, and the intensity of AML/CFT oversight in the offshore banking sector.

3)

The supervisory function needs strengthening, particularly specialized onsite examinations.

4)

There is a need to strengthen group supervision, cross-border coordination, and crisis management,
particularly in the insurance sector. The CBB carries out group supervision for banks, and the FSC is
responsible for insurance groups. Priority should be given to improving data on cross-border linkages
and enhancing supervisory colleges.

5)

While there is a solid legal basis and good cross-border communication among Caribbean countries,
crisis management plans should include detailed plans to deal with a crisis in the non-bank sector. The
mandate and tools of the Financial Oversight Management Committee (FOMC) should be clarified and
improved.

6)

Financial safety nets should also be upgraded, including strategic plan for the deposit insurer, which
would include setting a target funding ratio and improved payout procedures, and a policyholder
protection scheme (PPS) for the insurance sector. Safety nets should be extended to credit unions, but
only after establishing adequate prudential oversight.

1/ The 2013/14-2014/15 data includes layoffs of 3500 public employees effective Q1 2014.
2/ Staff have identified inconsistencies in the constant and current price GDP series. The Barbados Statistics Service is working to
address these issues.
3/ Private sector credit growth in 2012 is mostly due to the merger of a commercial bank and a trust company.
Excluding this impact, credit to the non-financial private sector decreased by 1.9 percent.
4/ Fiscal year is from April to March. For example, 2008 refers to April 2008 to March 2009.
5/ Includes short-term and long-term flows, and errors and omissions (including adjustments related to misclassification
of exports).

Annex I. Barbados MAC-DSA Summary
Barbados’ public debt sustainability risks are significant, even after incorporating the 2013 fiscal
adjustment measures. Public debt is projected to remain above 90 percent of GDP in the medium
term under the baseline scenario. The definition of public debt used in this assessment is central
government gross debt, excluding government securities held by the NIS. Public debt has risen
rapidly in recent years and the financing needs generated under the baseline scenario point to
continued debt accumulation until 2016. Gross financing needs are forecast to remain between
10–16 percent over the medium term, excluding rollover of short-term debt, which is projected to
sharply increase from 23 percent of GDP in 2013 to almost 40 percent of GDP by 2018. There are
sizable downside risks, including from low growth, greater reliance on short term debt, and
contingent liabilities. The baseline debt path remains vulnerable to unfavorable shocks from real
interest rates, real GDP growth, and the primary balance.
Barbados is classified as a “High Scrutiny” case. The public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to rise
from 92 percent in 2013 to 95 percent in 2015 before declining to 91 percent by 2018. The key
driver is the impact of the real interest rate in an environment of low inflation and increasing
reliance on short-term funding. Public debt dynamics are driven favorably by the primary balance,
which is expected to improve. This underscores the importance of the authorities’ ongoing fiscal
consolidation program and the need for more comprehensive measures to lower vulnerabilities
and improve public resource allocation.
Financing needs, comprised mostly of short-term debt rollover, would increase from 39 percent of
GDP in 2013/14 to more than 50 percent of GDP by 2018. The NIS and CBB would continue to
provide an important share of domestic financing. The estimated debt-stabilizing primary balance
after 2018 would be 3.5 per-cent of GDP excluding debt-reducing resources (NIS), or 1.4 percent
of GDP including the NIS. This is in line with the authorities’ fiscal adjustment plans, which are
projected to raise the primary balance to a surplus of 3.3–3.4 percent of GDP by 2016–2018.
Alternative scenarios show that the debt path and financing needs would be worse if the primary
balance were to remain constant at its 2013 level.
The stress test scenarios confirm the vulnerability of debt and financing needs to shocks to real
interest rates, real GDP growth, the primary balance, and the real exchange rate, with the greatest
sensitivity to shocks coming from real interest rates and real GDP growth. With the exception of
the real exchange rate shock, all other stress tests would push the debt-to-GDP ratio above
94 percent by 2018, with shocks to real interest rates alone pushing it to about 100 percent by
2018, and shocks to real GDP growth to 103 percent by 2015. Financing needs would rise to
about 60 percent of GDP under these two shocks. Shocks to the primary balance and exchange
rate would moderately worsen the debt path and financing needs.
The heat map also highlights significant risks to the debt profile, namely the rapid increase in
short-term debt and its share in total debt. That this debt is mostly held domestically helps to
mitigate somewhat the risks from external shocks.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BARBADOS

In the past, staff projections of GDP growth and the primary balance have been slightly optimistic,
though forecasts errors have been in line with the median IMF staff forecast errors. Current
projections have taken this bias into account. Projections of inflation have been more realistic on
average. The fiscal adjustment projected is clearly ambitious as illustrated by the 3-year
adjustment in the cyclically-adjusted primary balance (CAPB) and the 3-year average level of the
CAPB, for which Barbados has a high percentile rank of 7 percent and 18 percent respectively.
Nonetheless, this adjustment can be achieved if measures taken by the authorities are well
implemented.
External Debt
External public debt is relatively low, but moderately sensitive to shocks to the non-interest
current account and the exchange rate. While risks from foreign currency debt remain moderate,
recent external borrowing by the state warrants close monitoring, in view of vulnerabilities
imposed by the overall debt load. (Absent data on private external debt, the external DSA was
limited to that for external public debt.)

3/ The cell is highlighted in green if country value is less than the lower risk-assessment benchmark, red if country value exceeds the upper risk-assessment benchmark, yellow if
country value is between the lower and upper risk-assessment benchmarks. If data are unavailable or indicator is not relevant, cell is white.
Lower and upper risk-assessment benchmarks are:
200 and 600 basis points for bond spreads; 5 and 15 percent of GDP for external financing requirement; 0.5 and 1 percent for change in the share of short-term debt; 15 and 45
percent for the public debt held by non-residents; and 20 and 60 percent for the share of foreign-currency denominated debt.
4/ Long-term bond spread over U.S. bonds, an average over the last 3 months, 21-Sep-13 through 20-Dec-13.
5/ External financing requirement is defined as the sum of current account deficit, amortization of medium and long-term total external debt, and short-term total external debt at
the end of previous period.

1/ Public sector is defined as central government, excluding NIS holdings. Fiscal year (April to March) data.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over U.S. bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Annex II. Barbados: Exchange Rate Assessment,
Reserve Adequacy
Three standard CGER methodologies were used to assess Barbados’ real exchange rate: the
Macroeconomic Balance (MB), External Stability (ES), and Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate (ER). These
indicate a moderate overvaluation, within a range of about 2.5–8 percent from its equilibrium level.
The estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty and data shortcomings, including in particular
the lack of consistent data on net foreign assets. The assessment is nonetheless consistent with the
lackluster export and tourism performance by Barbados relative to most of its Caribbean competitors.

The MB approach indicates the real effective exchange rate would need to depreciate by about
2.5 percent to bring the 2018 current account (CA) balance into line with the estimated equilibrium
CA. The MB approach calculates the difference between the CA balance projected over the medium
term (2018) at prevailing exchange rates, and an
4%
estimated equilibrium CA “norm” based on a set of
Macro Balance Approach
(percent of GDP)
macroeconomic fundamentals that include fiscal and oil

Underlying CA
CA Norm
balances relative to GDP, demographic variables, and
relative income and output variables. The exchange rate
-4%
adjustment that would eliminate this difference over the
-8%
medium-term horizon is calculated using Barbados’
estimated CA elasticity with respect to the real exchange
-12%
rate. In this case, the estimated baseline CA deficit of
-6.3 percent of GDP in 2018 is about 0.7 percentage
-16%
points lower than the equilibrium CA balance estimated
(-5.6 percent), implying an overvaluation of 2.4 percent
using the elasticity of -0.3.
External Stability Approach

The ES approach points to overvaluation of the exchange rate by about 6 percent. This approach
calculates the difference between the actual CA balance and the balance that would stabilize the
NFA position at a benchmark level.1 Based on an assumed growth rate of 2.3 percent and inflation of
2.6 percent, stabilizing Barbados’ NFA at the estimated 2012 level of -92 percent of GDP requires a
CA deficit of 4.4 percent, or roughly 2 percentage points lower than projected in 2018.

Owing to the lack of consistent data on net foreign assets (NFA), cumulative Current Account deficits are used as a
proxy for NFA.

reserves would need to reach about US$800 million to
hit a “comfortable” level.

Annex III. Barbados: Risk Assessment Matrix
Main Threats

Continuation of policy
trends, or delays/ failure
to implement fiscal
consolidation.

Further decline in
tourism and exports
related to a protracted
period of slower growth
in advanced economies
(owing to larger than
expected deleveraging
or negative surprises on
potential growth).

Acute fiscal financing
pressures.

Side-effects from global
financial conditions:
surges in global
financial market
volatility (related to
UMP exit), leading to
economic and fiscal
stress, and constraints
on country policy
settings.

United States:
protracted failure to
agree on a credible plan
to ensure fiscal
sustainability (mediumterm)

58

Likelihood of Realization
of the Threat

Expected Impact if
Threat is Realized

Medium
The authorities are committed to fiscal
consolidation, but vigilance will be
needed. Full efforts should be deployed to
secure timely implementation.

High
This could lead to a bigger drop in
confidence, forex shortages, capital
flight and reserves losses and
pressure on the exchange rate peg;
a forced devaluation or disorderly
adjustment process would be likely.

Medium-High
A protracted period of weak demand
could take a toll on productive capacity
across advanced economies. In Europe in
particular, the risk of deflation has
increased and the risk of a protracted
period of slower growth is high.

High
Europeans comprise about
40 percent of Barbados’ tourism
market; Europe, the U.S, and Canada
make up 80 percent of the total.

Tourism trends are worrisome but strongly
affected by UK growth, which is expected
to recover this year.
High
Government borrowing requirement was
about 16 percent of GDP in 2013/14 (39
percent including short term rollover). It is
forecast to fall to 34.6 percent of GDP in
2014/15.
Domestic financial sector has little
appetite for additional government paper.
High
Higher-than-expected increases in longterm rates, a reversal of capital flows into
risk assets, the unwinding of
overvaluations in some countries, and an
intensification of liquidity strains on
sovereigns are high risks.

This would also lead to reserve
losses, pressure on the peg, and
possibly a devaluation.

High
Would lead to further financial
repression and/or monetization of
the deficit, pressure on the exchange
rate peg.

High
Could exclude Barbados from access
to market financing; lead to further
financial repression and/or
monetization of the deficit, pressure
on the exchange rate peg.

Government borrowing requirement is
high and financing of deficit by domestic
sources may be reaching its limit.
Low
Signs are that the US economy continues
to recover, but setbacks, possibly arising
from domestic fiscal policy errors, cannot
be ruled out.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Medium
A fiscal shock in the U.S., accounting
for 25% of tourism arrivals, could
have substantial adverse effects,
weakening tourism. This would
pressure the balance of payments,
causing reserve coverage to fall.

BARBADOS

Shock caused by
adverse development in
the U.K., or Trinidad &
Tobago.

Protracted period of
slower growth in
emerging economies,
owing to earlier
maturing of the cycle
and incomplete
structural reforms.

Risk from the financial
system

Other risks, including
weather-related natural
disasters and a possible
increase in crime (as is
occurring elsewhere in
the Caribbean).

Low
Growth outlook for the U.K. and T&T has
improved in recent months. Aside from
the U.S., these are the biggest sources of
tourism flows and biggest goods export
markets. Also, one of the biggest banks in
Barbados is Trinidad-based, and there are
other financial sector ties (insurance).

Medium
Could have adverse effects on
Barbados through both trade and
capital flows, financial instability.
This would put pressure on the
balance of payments. Fiscal deficits
would remain elevated as the
revenue base narrows.

Medium
Trend growth would be lower as a result
of weaker than expected productive
capacity and human capital, in addition to
cyclical forces.

Low
Tourism relies on advanced country
market and the Caribbean region.

Medium
The non-performing loan (NPL) ratio
remains high. Commercial banks’
exposure to the government has
increased, suggesting that deteriorating
fiscal performance could pose risks to the
financial system.

Low
NPLs that have remained on banks’
balance sheets for prolonged
periods could gradually result in
higher provisioning and write-offs,
dragging down future profitability.
Higher sovereign risk premiums
would depress the economic value
of government bonds and adversely
affect banks’ capital positions.

Low
Weather related disasters are limited in
Barbados because of its latitude; and the
country has always been considered one
of the safest destinations in the Caribbean.

Low
Weather related disasters are limited
in Barbados but strong storms can
cause damage. Crime is relatively
low, but, this could change if the
recession persists and social
tensions rise.

However, forward looking strategy
aims to expand arrivals from EM
countries. Also, the negative impact
could be tempered by an
accompanying decline in fuel prices.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of December 30, 2013)
Barbados graduated from World Bank financing in 1993, but has continued to borrow on an
exceptional basis. Two regional HIV/AIDS projects were approved in 2001 and 2008. The second
HIV/AIDS Project (US$35 million) is the only active loan which became effective in January 2009; this
project supports the implementation of the 2008–2013 Barbados National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan,
specifically to promote: (i) adoption of safe behaviors, in particular amongst the most vulnerable
groups; (ii) access to prevention, treatment and social care, in particular for the most vulnerable
groups; (iii) capacity of organizational and institutional structures that govern the NAP; and (iv) use
of quality data for problem identification, strategy definition and measuring results. The
performance of this project has notably improved over the last 12 months, and disbursements have
accelerated. The project closing date of November 30, 2013 has been recently extended for one
year, to November 30, 2014, in order to support the achievement of the Project Development
Objective and allow the Government to complete four critical activities that have been started under
the Project.

(As of December 31, 2013)
The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) has a portfolio of eleven loans to Barbados totaling
US$202 million of which US$40 million has been disbursed, leaving US$162 million remaining to be
disbursed. This portfolio includes only investment loans with the last approved policy-based loan of
$70 million (Support for Sustainable Energy Framework for Barbados II) fully disbursed in 2011. The
portfolio is relatively ‘young’ with seven operations, amounting to 78 percent of the portfolio in
value terms, having been approved since December 2009. Execution of this portfolio of operations is
programmed to take until early 2017.

In addition to the loan portfolio, the IDB has an active non-reimbursable technical cooperation
portfolio of thirteen operations totaling US$12.2 million: four of which are Multilateral Investment
Fund grants amounting to US$0.6 million; one of which is a Project Specific Grant totaling
US$7.7 million (PSSE co-financing from the European Union); and one of which is an investment
grant from the Global Environment Fund (GEF) totaling US$1 million.
2014 Lending Program
There are currently no loans in pipeline for 2014. The IDB is currently in dialogue with the
Government of Barbados to include new investment loans which will target foreign-exchange
earning sectors such as tourism and the private sector at large in the 2014 pipeline. A new Country
Strategy for the period 2014–2018 is currently being prepared.
Net Cash Flow
Barbados has experienced a negative net cash flow with respect to the IDB over much of the past
decade, averaging negative US$13 million during 2003-08, and reaching a low point of negative
US$20 million in 2006. Following a significant rise in disbursements between 2009 and 2011 mainly
due to policy-based loans disbursements, the net cash flow turned positive and reached a high
point of US$54 million in 2011. Net cash flow turned negative again in 2012 and is expected to be in
the vicinity of zero in 2013 due to a noteworthy increase in disbursements resulting from
improvements in the execution of the investment loan portfolio.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. However, there are number of shortcomings
that should be addressed by the time of the next Article IV consultation, particularly as regards
national accounts GDP data and reporting on the non financial public sector.
Real Sector
Currently, the Barbados Statistical Services (BSS) compiles current price GDP according to the 1993
system of national accounts. Constant price GDP estimates, compiled by the Central Bank of
Barbados (CBB), have an outdated 1974 base year; and are not consistent with the current price GDP
series that BSS produces. Therefore, there exist no meaningful GDP deflator data linking both series,
which adds uncertainty to GDP analyses and projections.
The BSS, with the assistance of CARTAC, began compiling constant price GDP by industry using 2006
as a base year began in 2011. Recently, preliminary constant price estimates by industry were
completed, and the data are expected to be publicly available in early 2014. From that point, the BSS
will be in charge of compiling annual constant GDP data which were previously published by CBB. In
an effort to improve source data, the BSS will continue to utilize administrative data for the
generation of economic indicators. The BSS plans to develop quarterly constant price estimates by
industry. As a medium term goal, the BSS should also consider constructing GDP by expenditure,
both quarterly and annually.
With ongoing improvements of national account estimates, the compilation of export and import
price indices is expected to be completed and publicly available in the first quarter of 2014. This will
enhance the ability of the BSS to develop the expenditure side of gross value added at constant
prices.
The BSS, with support from CARTAC, has continued working on developing producer price indexes
(PPI). The PPI sample includes 27 industries and 68 establishments that represent 80 percent of
manufacturing output. Monthly price collection for the PPI sample of establishments continues.
Monthly and Quarterly Bulletins should be published during the first quarter of 2014.
Although quarterly employment statistics are published by CBB, a survey-based wage index is not
currently available and the BSS does not compile one. The wage index, including both the private
and public sector, could provide an important indicator of factor costs and measure of
competitiveness.
Despite recent initiatives to update the consumer price index and the index of industrial production,
potential misalignments in real estate prices are not addressed due to the absence of a systematic
index of property prices. The consumer price index uses an expenditure basket for 1998–99 for its
July 2001=100 series introduced in January 2002. The index of industrial production was published
in 2006, based on the industrial census published in 1996. The BSS is currently working towards a
new index with base year 2014.

Government Finance Statistics
Fairly comprehensive and up-to-date above-the-line data are available for the general government,
but government transfers are reported with a lag. As a result of the incomplete coverage of offbudget transactions, a discrepancy exists between the overall balance and financing data in some
years. Public enterprises and other statutory bodies have not submitted financial reports for several
years, with some dating back to 2007 or 2009. They submit estimates in the budget process through
line ministries, but accounting is generally not provided on outturns. Arrears are not well monitored,
neither for the general government nor for statutory bodies. Financial sector data on public sector
net domestic borrowing usually cannot be fully reconciled with above-the-line fiscal data, partly
because of limited availability of nonbank financial sector information. This reduces the degree of
certainty about the actual fiscal position. The authorities introduced accrual accounting of public
finance in April 2007.
The fiscal analysis is based on March 2013 data, received from the Debt Management Unit at the
Ministry of Finance (MoF). The CBB also presents debt data which differs from data provided by MoF
for several reasons, including the timing of recording of payments and disbursements and the use of
different sources in some cases such as domestic loan data. Staff practice has been to use data
provided by one source—the MoF.
Monetary and Financial Statistics
Currently, monetary data are available on the CBB website. However, the CBB uses the central bank’s
and commercial banks’ data for the monetary survey. The February 2009 STA mission recommended
expanding the coverage to include data for other deposit taking institutions and the three largest
credit unions. However, this recommendation has not been implemented yet. As a result, actual
monetary data are underestimated. Interest rate data (e.g., T-bill rate, various deposit and lending
rates) are available on the CBB website. The CBB publishes financial stability reports, which analyze a
range of financial soundness indicators for commercial banks and other financial institutions, as well
as balance sheet and income trends.
External Sector Statistics
The authorities are making efforts to provide more comprehensive quarterly estimates of balance of
payments data, which is hampered by lags in the compilation of merchandise trade data (based on
annual survey data), and incomplete information on the activities of the offshore sector. The quality
of the current and capital account estimates needs to be improved, based on the large errors and
omissions needed to balance the accounts. Barbados now provides estimates of its international
investment position (IIP); however, these data do not appear to be consistent with balance of
payment data. The Central Bank of Barbados should draw on available CARTAC assistance to review
the IIP data. Data on official reserve assets, which are not disseminated on a timely basis nor
according to a fixed schedule, should be circulated on a monthly basis within one to four weeks
after the end of the reference month (GDDS).

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Barbados

On February 10, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the 2013 Article IV consultation with Barbados.1
Barbados is one of the most developed islands in the Caribbean, with per capita income at
US$16,150 and the best human development indicators in the region. The country was strongly
affected by the global financial crisis in 2008 and macroeconomic performance has been weak
since then. The economy is estimated to have contracted by 0.7 percent in 2013, with weakness
across both the traded and non-traded sectors. Long stay tourist arrivals, which are highly
dependent on the U.K. and North American markets, were down by 5.2 percent in 2013. Inflation
dropped sharply to 1.9 percent by end-November, while unemployment rose to 11.7 percent.
Expansionary fiscal policies and weak revenues have led to a surge in public debt and fiscal
financing pressures. The central government deficit widened to 8.1 percent of Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) in 2012/13 (year ending March) and is expected to reach 9.6 percent of GDP in
2013/14. Central government gross debt (excluding holdings of securities by the National
Insurance Scheme) rose to 94 percent of GDP at end-September 2013 from under 60 percent of
GDP in 2009. Weak tourism and export receipts contributed to a widening in the external current
account deficit to an estimated 11.4 percent of GDP in 2013. Together with a sharp drop in
private capital inflows, foreign reserves declined during 2013 to close out the year at US$578
million, equivalent to about 3.2 months of imports. The financial system appears to be well
capitalized, but credit quality and profitability have suffered with the prolonged downturn.
Recognizing the need for urgent action, the authorities announced ambitious fiscal consolidation
measures during the second half of 2013 aimed at strengthening the fiscal position and arresting
the slide in reserves. These measures included a reduction in the size of the civil service by about
13 percent, further downsizing by attrition, wage cuts for elected and appointed officials, and a
two year nominal wage freeze. If fully implemented, and assuming slippages are corrected with
offsetting measures, these actions could lower the fiscal deficit to 4.9 percent of GDP, and would

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

help to restore stability to external flows. Output is projected to fall by 1.2 percent in 2014 before
recovering modestly in 2015, supported by capital inflows to finance tourism and energy related
projects. The debt-to-GDP ratio could level off by 2015/16 and decline slowly thereafter, though
foreign reserves would remain below desirable levels.
However, the near term outlook will depend on vigorous and timely implementation of the
proposed adjustment measures, and the consequences of policy slippage would likely be
significant.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors noted that Barbados has not succeeded in recovering from the adverse
consequences of the global financial crisis, and faces considerable challenges including low
growth, a high fiscal deficit and debt, and declining foreign reserves. Downside risks are
significant, and strong and prompt adjustment is crucial. Directors were encouraged by the
authorities’ determination to undertake the measures needed to stabilize the economy and resume
a sustainable growth path. They looked forward to sustained implementation.
Directors agreed that a frontloaded fiscal consolidation is necessary in the current circumstances
and stressed the importance of reining in spending and clearing arrears. They welcomed the
measures announced in the second half of 2013 and urged their prompt implementation, which
should raise confidence, stem the government’s cash flow needs, and increase foreign reserves.
For the coming years, Directors encouraged the authorities to consider additional tightening,
focusing on growth-friendly measures, to put debt on a steeper downward trajectory. They noted
that a debt-to-GDP target could serve as a useful medium-term anchor. Directors saw scope for
raising revenues by broadening the base, reducing tax exemptions, and improving tax and
customs administration. They also stressed the need for public enterprise reforms, particularly to
improve oversight and accountability. In light of ongoing efforts to rein in the wage bill,
Directors stressed the importance of preserving an adequate and well-targeted social safety net.
Directors noted the authorities’ commitment to the nominal exchange rate anchor. They
encouraged the central bank to reorient monetary policy towards supporting the exchange rate
peg by curtailing direct financing of the government, and allowing domestic short-term interest
rates to rise to a level that reflects a credible country risk premium.
Directors underscored the need for a growth strategy focused on improving the business climate
while preserving Barbados’s long-standing tradition of equity and social cohesion. While
Barbados fares reasonably well in international surveys of competitiveness, Directors
encouraged efforts to strengthen competitiveness in the tourism and international business
sectors, and to lower labor costs. They noted that pending large investment projects should help
to raise productivity and support reserve levels. They encouraged the authorities to divest some

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

of the government’s commercial assets, tackle labor market rigidities, and reduce the cost of
doing business, while reducing reliance on tax incentives.
Directors commended the strides made by the authorities in improving financial sector regulatory
and supervisory frameworks. While domestic banks appear resilient to shocks, Directors noted
the risks posed by a negative sovereign-financial feedback loop as well as weakening asset
quality. They stressed the importance of continued close supervision of both banks and non-bank
financial institutions, and looked forward to implementation of the recommendations of the
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) update.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Barbados
February 10, 2014
1.
This statement summarizes economic developments in Barbados since the
issuance of the staff report. The additional information does not change the thrust of the
staff appraisal.
2.
The reduction in the public service announced by the authorities in December is
proceeding. Of the 3000 layoffs planned, 1,800 were enacted by January 31, including
1,000 from public enterprises, and the remainder are expected to take place before March 31.
The central government wage bill for 2013/14 is likely to be higher than predicted in the staff
report since staff understood from the December announcement that the retrenchments would
occur in January. In addition, the government recently approved a measure to grant severance
payments to retrenched workers with over two years of service.
3.
The central government deficit for 2013/14 could be higher than projected.
Parliament recently approved “supplementary” requests for budget transfers, including to
public enterprises, totaling BDS$146 million (1.7 percent of GDP), although the extent to
which these reflect “new” extra-budgetary spending is unclear.
4.
Central bank holdings of Treasury-bills have not increased since end-November.
Short-term interest rates have risen from 3.2 to 3.3 percent since December.
5.
Foreign reserves declined by about US$35 million in January. The provisional
figure at December 31, 2013 is US$580 million, slightly higher than staff’s estimate of
US$565 million. Reserves declined to US$545 million by January 28 (3.2 months of
imports), owing mainly to large fuel-related payments and external debt service.
6.
The authorities estimate that real GDP growth declined by 0.2 percent in 2013.
At this time, staff retain their estimate of a 0.7 percent contraction in light of statistical
discrepancies in the compilation of the national accounts data (see paragraph 46, and
Supplement 1, page 10). Staff will update projections upon receiving more detailed
information.
7.
Non-performing loans (NPLs) have declined and the capital adequacy ratio
(CAR) has risen. NPLs as a share of total loans fell to 11.3 percent in September 2013 from
13.9 percent in June 2013. This decline is due mostly to the repayment of one large corporate
loan in the hotel sector. The CAR rose to 22.6 percent in September 2013 from 21.5 percent
in June 2013.

Statement by Mr. Hockin, Executive Director for Barbados and
Mr. Dalrymple, Advisor to Executive Director
February 10, 2014
Our Barbadian authorities appreciate the ongoing policy dialogue with, and advice from,
the Fund. They are especially grateful for the detailed analysis in the Staff Report for the
2013 Article IV and are equally pleased with the consultations and outcome of the
Financial Sector Stability Assessment (FSSA). The Staff assessment is very candid about
the performance of the economy, as well as the medium-term challenges facing the
authorities. They broadly agree with the proposals and have already begun to implement
the necessary fiscal measures and structural changes to mitigate the attendant risks and
assure the resumption of sustainable growth over the medium term. The authorities are
fully cognizant of the magnitude of the challenges they face, and based on their
reputation are determined to restore fiscal balance and economic growth.
The Barbados Growth and Adjustment Strategy
The recovery of the Barbadian economy from the international economic shock of 2008
has been slow and uncertain; real output contracted by an estimated 0.2 percent in 2013
and real GDP remains 3 percent below the 2008 level. However, the economy has
become more resilient over the years; in the recessions of the early 1980s and 1990s the
economy contracted by 7 percent and 14 percent, respectively. The unemployment rate
(11.2 percent) and inflation rate (2 percent) are both lower than those observed in earlier
recessions.
The Barbados economy is more competitive than its Caribbean and Central American
neighbors in most of the factors that influence investment decisions. In the Global
Competitiveness Report 2013-14, Barbados outperforms the region in institutional
strength, infrastructure, health, education, labor market efficiency, financial market
development, and technological readiness. Barbados is on par with the region in business
sophistication and innovation. The two elements with respect to which Barbados is less
competitive are market size and the macroeconomic environment. Although the prices of
Barbados' tourism, international business and finance, agriculture and manufacturing
have risen since the mid-2000s, inflation of competitors' prices has been more rapid, and
Barbados has become more competitive on price than the average Caribbean and Central
American country.
The Barbados growth strategy focusses on increasing the country's share of the market in the
activities in which Barbados has established its international competitiveness, viz tourism,
international business and finance, agro-processing, and green energy. Although the country
has lost ground in tourism and international business and financial services (IBFS) since the
onset of the current international crisis, the country's shares of spending in those markets are
higher than they were in 2000. The initiatives to regain market share include product
enrichment, development of new and ancillary products, exploration of new markets,
increasing sophistication and targeting of market segments, investing in product upgrades
and new capacity, and implementing measures to improve labor productivity and service

2
efficiency. About US$1.5 billion of already known investment is projected over the next
three years.
The Barbados Government supports the growth strategy, which is propelled by the
private sector, by providing appropriate fiscal incentives, acting as catalyst for private
investment projects, improving infrastructure, jump-starting priority investment projects
by providing government support, and improving the facilitation of business and the
efficiency of the government.
The authorities are in full agreement that urgent measures are necessary, and a frontloaded adjustment of the required magnitude is already in place to address the external
imbalance. In addition, the analysis presented by the staff indicates that the measures
already implemented are sufficient to restore external balance. Moreover, Barbados’
institutional strength, and the authorities’ capacity for monitoring economic performance
and effecting prompt course correction, all reduce the risk of a disorderly adjustment.
Fiscal Policy
In our view, the staff statement that the government "first applied countercyclical policies
to offset the impact of the global recession" is inaccurate because Barbados’ import
propensity is so high, countercyclical fiscal policies always result in a decline of foreign
exchange reserves. The country's foreign reserves increased in 2009, and remained above
2008 levels until April of 2013, which provides prima facie evidence that there was no
countercyclical fiscal expansion.
The immediate objective of fiscal policy in Barbados is to contain aggregate spending in
light of the projected performance of the foreign exchange sectors, so that the demand for
imports does not exceed foreign exchange inflows. Fiscal discipline served to maintain
Barbados' foreign reserve cover at the equivalent of 19 weeks of imports at the end of
2012, compared to 16 weeks at the onset of the crisis in 2008. When reserves came under
pressure from May 2013, an appropriate fiscal adjustment package was introduced in
August. The 19-month austerity program committed the authorities to a number of fiscal
consolidation measures that include restraint in the wage bill and other current outlays,
particularly to public enterprises, which should reduce statutory bodies’ dependence on
the budget. Further measures were added in December, to keep the adjustment program
on track. Reserve cover at December 2013 was 15 weeks. Since the Minister of
Finance’s announcement in December, the following measures have been instituted:





Layoffs in the public sector commenced from the beginning of January 2014 and
are targeted at reducing employment in the public sector by 10 percent;
The consolidation tax was implemented and is projected to yield about BDS$24.0
million for a fiscal year;
The tax on commercial bank assets has begun to accrue, with the first payment
due on February 15, 2014;
The Municipal Solid Waste tax became effective in January 2014, with the first
payment due in June 2014; and

3


A freeze on all non-statutory discretionary waivers unrelated to the earning and/or
direct saving of foreign exchange for the next three years.

In preparation for the government’s fiscal adjustment program, and in keeping with
Barbados’ long established social partnership, in July 2013 a national consultation was
held with stakeholders in the government, the private sector, and the labor movement.
The social partners meet regularly to discuss the economic and social conditions in
Barbados and make recommendations for the way forward. In the current austerity the
social partnership helps to maintain social cohesion and decision-making. The economic
strategy is monitored monthly by a committee of top technocrats in the Ministry of
Finance and Economic Affairs, as well as the Central Bank of Barbados, with their
outputs being discussed periodically with the social partnership.
Structural Reforms
In 2010, the Barbadian authorities embarked on both a Medium-Term Fiscal Strategy
(MTFS), aimed at fiscal consolidation, and a Medium-Term Development Strategy
(MTDS) to promote sustainable growth. In 2013, the government started to implement
the Medium-Term Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS), to update and align these
objectives. The document provides an enabling framework for achieving a sustainable
fiscal trajectory, with targeted fiscal deficits and the rejuvenation of the foreign exchange
earning sectors, in particular the alternative energy sector.
The authorities have recently approved several initiatives aimed at providing a platform
for the restoration of growth through incentives and business facilitation for the foreign
exchange earning sectors, as well as investment in infrastructure that will further
strengthen the quality of Barbados' products. These measures include a reduction in the
VAT for tourism services and additional financing for small and medium-sized hotels.
Also, our authorities are confident of attracting FDI and to this end, they will be seeking
to enhance and modernize the business climate by setting a “one-stop shop” to improve
the pace of business facilitation. As part of this process, an island-wide open wireless
internet network is to be established, to encourage the use of information and
communications technology (ICTs) for improving competitiveness and productivity.
Efforts to reform the public sector have been geared towards the reform of the tax system
and the management of state-owned entities. The ongoing CARTAC-led technical
assistance related to the state-owned entities – the first phase of which has just been
completed – is expected to assist the government with the monitoring of these entities and
to improve their financial management practices. CARTAC’s assistance has also been
sought to address the tax administration challenges and the formation of a central revenue
authority. The Barbados Central Revenue Authority is targeted at removing the
administrative fragmentation that exists in the system and is scheduled to be established
on April 1, 2014.
Debt
The Barbados Government and state corporations have an outstanding debt balance of
BDS$9.1 billion, of which 35 percent (US$1.6 billion) is foreign debt. On the assets side,

4
the government and statutory bodies hold deposits, sinking funds, foreign reserves, and
other liquid assets of BDS$3.5 billion. The net public sector debt of BDS$5.6 billion is
the equivalent of 67 percent of GDP.
The servicing of foreign debt absorbs about 6 percent of current account inflows, and
foreign debt servicing is projected to remain below 10 percent for the next 5 years.
Government interest payments for domestic and foreign debt are projected at 27 percent
of revenue for the 2013/14 Fiscal Year, which ends in March. Barbados maintains an
impeccable record of servicing domestic and foreign debt fully and on schedule.
Monetary Policy
Since April 2013, the Central Bank of Barbados has provided guidance on interest rates
through its intervention in the Treasury Bill tender. The external financial accounts of
Barbados are open to non-portfolio flows, de facto, and domestic interest rate trends
follow comparable US interest rates. Domestic rates may deviate in response to surplus or
scarcity of domestic liquidity. At the time of the introduction of the new policy, domestic
liquidity was ample, and the domestic short term rate declined by a few basis points.
Although there remains excess liquidity in the system, the domestic Treasury bill rate has
risen more recently.
There has been a temporary increase in Central Bank credit to the government, in
consequence of the decline in foreign exchange reserves and the associated constriction
of domestic financing. Banks and other financial institutions used funds that might
otherwise have financed the government to purchase foreign exchange from the Central
Bank. This temporary switch between domestic and foreign assets in the Central Bank's
balance sheet is to be expected in a fixed exchange rate regime in the interim while fiscal
adjustment measures take their full effect. The balance will decline with the achievement
of the 2014/15 fiscal target.
External Sector Developments
Last October the government tested the waters for a US$500 million international bond
issue that would be eligible for the emerging market bond index and would therefore
attract investors with an interest in liquid securities. Because the government needed only
US$250 million of new money to boost reserves and kick-start priority projects, the
strategy involved the exchange of US$250 million of outstanding issues. At the end of a
week-long series of meetings with investors, the government concluded that the market
costs of this arrangement were too high, and instead the required funds were borrowed
through private placement.
We believe that staff exaggerates Barbados' vulnerability to global financial market
volatility. By its own calculations, Barbados does not need to access international capital
markets during the forecast period in order to maintain foreign reserves at the equivalent
of 3 months' cover, provided private capital flows return to normal levels.

5
The link between Barbados' tourism receipts and growth rates in its main tourist markets,
emphasized in the Staff report, is not immutable. Sophisticated marketing and market
diversification strategies, now being implemented, are specifically designed to break
these links.
Financial Sector Assessment
Our authorities are in general agreement with the FSSA recommendations. They have
had a high uptake of advice from the previous FSSA and are already in the process of
adopting many of the recommendations of the current one. They are keen on making the
necessary revisions to legislation, particularly the Financial Institutional Act - to
strengthen the monitoring of credit risks, and the Central Bank of Barbados Act. They
have also been supportive of efforts to establish a credit bureau.
An assessment of the financial system has revealed that while credit quality and
profitability issues exist, the sector remains stable and liquid with well-capitalized
institutions. Banks’ non-performing loan (NPL) ratio rose to 13.8 percent in mid-2013,
but has since fallen to 11.3 percent as at end-September with the resolution of a large
corporate non-performing loan (to the hotel sector).
Given that Barbados’ banking system is totally foreign-owned, the authorities have
maintained a very good regulatory relationship with Canada, which has the majority
interest in the banking sector and is widely regarded as having the most stable banking
system in the world.
Summary
Our Barbados authorities have put in place an economic strategy for growth and
adjustment that is appropriate to the country’s circumstances. It focuses on private sectorled growth in the sectors that earn and save foreign exchange, and builds out Barbados’
established competitive advantages by improving product quality, enhancing product
offerings, raising factor productivity, developing new products and services, supporting
targeted marketing, developing nontraditional markets, and improving business
facilitation. Fiscal policy continues to be employed aggressively to protect the value of
the peg, while providing support and incentives for the foreign exchange earning sectors.
A medium-term program of structural adjustment is underway to improve government
efficiency. Downside risks exist, but they are mitigated by the demonstrated resilience of
the Barbadian economy and its noteworthy institutional strength.
