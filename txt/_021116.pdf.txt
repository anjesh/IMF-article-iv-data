AMENDMENT TO STEPS TO ADDRESS EXCESSIVE
DELAYS IN THE COMPLETION OF ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATIONS OR MANDATORY FINANCIAL
STABILITY ASSESSMENTS AND APPLICATION TO
THE CASE OF ARGENTINA

IMF staff regularly produces papers proposing new IMF policies, exploring options for
reform, or reviewing existing IMF policies and operations. The Report prepared by IMF
staff and completed on February 11, 2016 has been released.
The staff report was issued to the Executive Board for information. The report was
prepared by IMF staff. The views expressed in this paper are those of the IMF staff and
do not necessarily represent the views of the IMF's Executive Board.

The IMF’s transparency policy allows for the deletion of market-sensitive information
and premature disclosure of the authorities’ policy intentions in published staff reports
and other documents.

EXCESSIVE DELAYS IN ARTICLE IV CONSULTATIONS

INTRODUCTION
1.
Management has received a request from the Argentine authorities to publish
documents on economic developments in the country prepared by Fund staff for informal
Board briefings in 2013–15. The Argentine authorities see publication of these papers as part of
their commitment to transparency and accountability in their operations.1 The documents were
prepared pursuant to the Fund’s policy on excessive delays in the completion of Article IV
consultations and mandatory financial stability assessments, which requires that staff informally brief
Executive Directors every 12 months on the economic developments and policies of relevant
members.2, 3 The objectives of the policy are to promote re-engagement with members with
excessively delayed consultations, and to share information with the Board to help it fulfill its
surveillance function.
2.
Under current policy, the briefing documents are not published. Instead, a short factual
statement is issued in a press release, noting that the Board was given an informal staff briefing on
the member’s economy based on available information. Under the policy, the Fund decided against
publication of the briefing documents since it was considered that publication could expose the
Fund to a significant reputational risk if the analysis set out in the documents missed key
vulnerabilities due to large information gaps created by the lack of consultation with the member.
Also, outside audiences may not appreciate that the documents represent the views of staff, not the
views of the Board, and do not constitute an Article IV consultation. A further concern was that
publication could reduce the pressure on members to proceed with an Article IV consultation. In
light of the current policy, any publication of these documents would require a change in policy
approved by the Executive Board.

PROPOSED AMENDMENT
3.
Going forward, the general approach of non-publication remains appropriate. The
reputational risks to publication of these documents remain significant, when they are based on
incomplete information (e.g., with regards to economic developments and policies, economic and
financial vulnerabilities and data). In addition, the risk of public confusion about the nature of the
documents remains; outside audiences may not appreciate that the reports represent the views of
staff and not those of the Board.

The last Article IV consultation for Argentina was completed in July 2006, and thus is excessively delayed. Argentina
is not one of the S29 systemic economies, and therefore it is not subject to the Fund’s framework for mandatory
FSAs. On a voluntary basis, Argentina has requested an FSAP, and the FSSA was presented to the Board in July 2013.

Decision No. 15106, adopted February 29, 2012, as amended. See also Amendment to Steps to Address Excessive
Delays in the Completion of Article IV Consultations or Mandatory Financial Stability Assessments.

Staff has so far briefed the Board on economic developments in Argentina, Eritrea, and Venezuela (which are
delayed), and Ecuador and Madagascar (which subsequently resumed Article IV consultations).

4.
However, the staff sees that publication could support the goals of the policy in
certain cases where members are taking steps to normalize relations with the Fund with the
aim of resolving the delay in the consultation. Publication could spread awareness of economic
developments and challenges, and may help the authorities convince other domestic stakeholders
of the benefits of re-engagement with the Fund. In those circumstances, staff sees that publication
might be warranted, in particular if the risks referred to above could be mitigated. At the same time,
the fact that an informal briefing takes place or briefing documents are published would in no way
serve to discharge the member’s obligation to consult with the Fund under Article IV.
5.
Staff therefore favors a change in policy to make an exception to the general policy of
non-publication that would allow publication of briefing documents when the following two
conditions are met:


The member requests publication; and



The Fund determines that the member is cooperating with it to resolve the consultation delay
and that publication of the briefing documents would facilitate such a resolution.

6.
Publication would only be permitted in a given case upon adoption of a decision by
the Executive Board in support of a member’s request.
7.
To mitigate the reputational risks referred to above, publication would be
accompanied by a disclaimer (See template, Annex I).4 The disclaimer would clarify the following:
that the documents represent the views of the staff, and not of the Executive Board; that the
documents have been prepared based on publicly available data and without consultation with the
member; and that the informal briefing in no way constitutes an Article IV consultation. The
disclaimer would also seek to minimize the risk of misperception that the member is in compliance
with its obligation to consult.
8.
Accordingly, staff proposes a modification of the policy as outlined above. The
proposed changes are shown in redline in Annex II.5

APPLICATION TO THE CASE OF ARGENTINA
9.
In the particular case of Argentina, staff supports Argentina’s request for publication
of the briefing documents and recommends that the Board approve the request pursuant to

4

While such materials would not be subject to the Fund’s Transparency Policy, the rules of the Transparency Policy
would be applied by analogy to assess requests for modifications (corrections and deletions). Any corrections and
deletions will be circulated to Executive Directors.
5

Please note that paragraphs 5-7 of the decision as copied in Annex II dictate the original dates of the decision’s
entry into force in 2012. The entry into force of the proposed new language in paragraph 3 would be immediate
upon Board adoption.

the proposed new policy. First, Argentina has made a request. Second, it is the judgment of
management that Argentina is working to resolve the consultation delay. The Minister of Economy
has said publicly and confirmed bilaterally to management that Argentina intends to undertake an
Article IV consultation later in 2016. The authorities believe that publishing past informal board
papers is likely to build domestic consensus toward undertaking an Article IV consultation. The
authorities are also supportive of accompanying the release by an appropriate disclaimer.

Proposed Decisions
The following decisions, which may be adopted by a majority of votes cast, are proposed for
adoption by the Executive Board:
I.

Amendment to Policy on Steps to Address Excessive Delays in the Completion of
Article IV Consultations or Mandatory Financial Stability Assessments

Paragraph 3 of Decision No. 15106-(12/21), adopted February 29, 2012, as amended, shall be
revised to read as follows:
”3. Whenever an Article IV consultation or a mandatory financial stability assessment for a
member has not been concluded within 18 months of the expected deadline for conclusion,
staff shall, except as provided below, informally brief Executive Directors on the economic
developments and policies of the member or on its financial sector, as applicable. No such
briefing shall be required to the extent that (i) staff discussions with the member for the
Article IV consultation or mandatory financial stability assessment have been completed, or
(ii) Executive Directors have, within the previous twelve months, been briefed on the member’s
economic developments and policies or on its financial sector, as applicable, in another context,
or (iii) the Managing Director, in exceptional circumstances, determines that the available
information is so inadequate as to seriously undermine the ability of Fund staff to conduct a
meaningful analysis of the member’s economic developments and policies or of its financial
sector, as applicable. Following the initial briefing and, for so long as the conditions set out in (i),
(ii) and (iii) have not been met, staff shall, in cases of delayed Article IV consultations, brief the
Executive Directors on the economic development and policies of the relevant member every
12 months thereafter; and in cases of delayed mandatory financial stability assessments, brief
the Executive Directors on the financial sector of the relevant member every 60 months

thereafter. Whenever a briefing under this paragraph is held, the Fund will make public the fact
that the briefing took place. The Fund may authorize the publication of documents prepared for
such briefings only if: (1) a member requests such publication; and (2) the Fund determines that
the member is cooperating with the Fund in resolving the delay in completing an Article IV
consultation or a mandatory financial stability assessment and that publication would facilitate
such a resolution. The publication will be accompanied by a disclaimer clarifying that: (a) the
documents do not represent the views of the Executive Board; (b) the documents were prepared
based on publicly available data and without consultation with the member; and (c) the informal
briefing does not constitute an Article IV consultation with the member. Whenever the
Managing Director makes the determination specified in (iii) above, the Managing Director will
inform the Executive Board that no such briefing will be held and the Fund will make public the
fact that no briefing was held due to the lack of adequate information.”
II.

Publication of Briefing Documents on Argentina

The Fund hereby authorizes publication of the documents prepared for the informal briefings on the
economic developments and policies of Argentina for the years 2013, 2014 and 2015 pursuant to
the policy on Steps to Address Excessive Delays in the completion of Article IV Consultations or
Mandatory Financial Stability Assessments.

Annex I. Draft Disclaimer1
This document on [economic developments and policies] [the financial sector] was prepared in the
context of an informal Executive Board briefing on [Country] under the procedures for members
with excessive delays in Article IV consultations or Mandatory Financial Stability Assessments. Under
these procedures, IMF staff prepares an assessment of the member’s [economy and policies]
[financial sector] based on information that is publicly available and without consultation with the
member. The document, which constitutes the views of IMF staff, is aimed at keeping the Board
informed about developments in the country. Given the absence of a more complete set of
information, and a more thorough policy dialogue with authorities, this document should not be
characterized as an IMF [Article IV staff report] [Financial System Stability Assessment] nor should it
be portrayed as representing the views of the Executive Board. Similarly, the associated informal
Executive Board briefing does not constitute an Article IV consultation with the member.

This language represents a template, and individual disclaimers would be adapted depending on whether the case
concerned an Article IV consultation or mandatory FSA.

Annex II. Redlined Version of Policy of Steps to Address Excessive
Delays in the Completion of Article IV Consultations or
Mandatory Financial Stability Assessments
This decision is adopted pursuant to Article IV, Section 3(a) and (b) of the Fund’s Articles. It
establishes a framework for addressing cases where there are delays in the completion of Article IV
consultations or mandatory financial stability assessments.
1. Whenever an Article IV consultation for a member or a mandatory financial stability assessment
pursuant to Decision No. 14736-(10/92), September 21, 2010 (a “mandatory financial stability
assessment”) has not been concluded within 12 months of the expected deadline for conclusion,
and staff discussions with the member have not been completed, the Managing Director shall notify
the member in writing of the delay. The notification shall be calibrated to the circumstances of the
member and, where appropriate, shall remind the member of its obligation to consult. Subsequent
notifications shall be sent to the member at 12 month intervals as long as the Article IV consultation
or mandatory stability assessment has not been concluded and staff discussions with the member
have not been completed. If the Managing Director determines that: (i) the Article IV consultation or
mandatory financial stability assessment has been delayed because of exceptional circumstances,
such as extreme natural disaster, extreme civil unrest or war, or (ii) there is uncertainty as to the
views of the international community regarding the recognition of an administration in effective
control of the country, the Managing Director may postpone sending the notification of the delay to
the relevant member until the Managing Director decides that the situation leading to the
postponement no longer exists. The Managing Director will promptly inform the Executive Board of
any decision to postpone or resume sending notifications to a member.
2. The Fund shall, at intervals of not more than six months, publish a list of all members whose
Article IV consultation or mandatory financial stability assessment has, as of the date of publication,
not been concluded within 18 months of the expected deadline for conclusion. For each such
member, the list shall, in particular, specify (i) the fact of the delay in completion and (ii) the reasons
for the delay. Where applicable, the list will note the cases when staff discussions with members
have been completed.
3. Whenever an Article IV consultation or a mandatory financial stability assessment for a member
has not been concluded within 18 months of the expected deadline for conclusion, staff shall, except
as provided below, informally brief Executive Directors on the economic developments and policies
of the member or on its financial sector, as applicable. No such briefing shall be required to the
extent that (i) staff discussions with the member for the Article IV consultation or mandatory
financial stability assessment have been completed, or (ii) Executive Directors have, within the
previous twelve months, been briefed on the member’s economic developments and policies or on
its financial sector, as applicable, in another context, or (iii) the Managing Director, in exceptional
circumstances, determines that the available information is so inadequate as to seriously undermine

the ability of Fund staff to conduct a meaningful analysis of the member’s economic developments
and policies or of its financial sector, as applicable. Following the initial briefing and, for so long as
the conditions set out in (i), (ii) and (iii) have not been met, staff shall, in cases of delayed Article IV
consultations, brief the Executive Directors on the economic development and policies of the
relevant member every 12 months thereafter; and in cases of delayed mandatory financial stability
assessments, brief the Executive Directors on the financial sector of the relevant member every 60
months thereafter. Whenever a briefing under this paragraph is held, the Fund will make public the
fact that the briefing took place. The Fund may authorize the publication of documents prepared for
such briefings only if: (1) a member requests such publication; and (2) the Fund determines that the
member is cooperating with the Fund in resolving the delay in completing an Article IV consultation
or a mandatory financial stability assessment and that publication would facilitate such a resolution.
The publication will be accompanied by a disclaimer clarifying that: (a) the documents do not
represent the views of the Executive Board; (b) the documents were prepared based on publicly
available data and without consultation with the member; and (c) the informal briefing does not
constitute an Article IV consultation with the member.
Whenever the Managing Director makes the determination specified in (iii) above, the Managing
Director will inform the Executive Board that no such briefing will be held and the Fund will make
public the fact that no briefing was held due to the lack of adequate information.”
4. Any calculation of the deadlines in paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 above shall be made in accordance with
Decision No. 14747-(10/96), September 28, 2010, as amended and Decision No. 14736-(10/92),
September 21, 2010, as amended, taking into account any grace period, as applicable.
5. Paragraph 1 of this Decision shall begin to apply one month after the date of adoption of this
Decision.
6. Paragraph 2 of this Decision shall begin to apply immediately upon the date of adoption of this
Decision provided, however, that the first public announcement required under that paragraph shall
take place no later than six months following the date of adoption of the Decision.
7. Paragraph 3 of this Decision shall begin to apply six months after the date of adoption of this
Decision.
