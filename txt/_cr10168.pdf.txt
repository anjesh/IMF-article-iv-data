EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Discussions focused on medium-term challenges and policies to achieve high, diversified,
and sustainable growth in order to create jobs and reduce poverty.
Background
The food and fuel price increases and the global economic slowdown, combined with the
domestic political crisis resulted in an output contraction and a significant deterioration in the
fiscal position. In contrast, the current account deficit has narrowed, international reserves
have slightly increased, and domestic inflation remained in the low single digits.
Authorities’ views
Fiscal consolidation is a top priority to restore medium-term fiscal sustainability. The 2010
budget targets a 3.8 percent of non-oil GDP deficit, down from 5.3 percent in 2009 through a
combination of revenue and spending measures. The budget increases poverty-related and
infrastructure spending.
The central bank has started to ease monetary policy through a reduction in its policy rates.
Further easing should be gradual, with an eye on inflationary pressures and on external
accounts. The authorities see merit in pursuing a more flexible exchange rate policy and have
reestablished the foreign exchange auction system.
For the medium term, lessening the economy’s vulnerability to external shocks, and
achieving a high and sustainable growth to further reduce poverty will require creating fiscal
space to increase social and infrastructure spending, strengthening monetary policy
operations, deepening the financial sector, and improving the business environment.
Staff recommendations
Decisive measures are needed to bolster revenues, slow recurrent expenditure growth, and
adequately fund poverty-related and infrastructure spending, while containing inflation and
strengthening the external position.
The central bank should stand ready to increase its policy rates as soon as signs of pressures
on inflation or in the foreign exchange market emerge. It is also critical to strengthen
coordination between monetary and fiscal policies to enhance liquidity management.
The authorities should pursue their multi-pronged banking sector reform strategy. Reducing
the cost of doing business and improving competitiveness are also needed. The range of
reforms is wide and should be carefully sequenced and prioritized to take into account
administrative capacity, and the need for social consensus.
The authorities have requested a three-year arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility
(ECF) with access of 120 percent of quota. The arrangement would continue to support
Mauritania’s efforts to maintain macroeconomic stability, restore and sustain strong pro-poor
growth, protect the poor and accelerate the pace of progress toward the MDGs, ensure debt
sustainability, and reduce the country’s vulnerability to external shocks. Staff supports this
request.

5
I. BACKGROUND
1.
The July 2009 presidential election, won by Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, enabled
Mauritania’s return to constitutional order. The August 2008 military coup triggered a
domestic political crisis and many bilateral and multilateral donors, including the World
Bank, discontinued their assistance. The PRGF arrangement was interrupted in October 2008
after the third review was successfully completed in May 2008. The international
community, including the Fund, has now resumed normal relations with Mauritania. The
authorities have requested Fund reengagement through a new ECF arrangement.
2.
The authorities’ ambitious reform agenda, supported by several Fund
arrangements, had started to bear fruits. Economic growth was robust, reflecting prudent
economic management, sustained donor support and the beginning of oil production.
Inflation was low, and both external and fiscal positions strengthened (Figure 1). Additional
debt relief under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDR-I) in 20061 contributed to firm
up the country’s debt sustainability, and create fiscal space for infrastructure and poverty
reducing spending. Although, some progress has been made on the structural reform agenda,
notably in the areas of public finance management, foreign exchange market liberalization,
banking sector, and governance (Box 1), significant weaknesses remain. Private investment
is still low, the economy remains vulnerable to commodity shocks, and limited infrastructure
and an unfavorable business environment continue to hamper economic growth. The new
program will help address these challenges.
3.
Economic performance deteriorated sharply in 2008-09 on the back of both
domestic and external shocks (Box 2). The global food and fuel price increases weakened
the fiscal and external positions and pushed up inflation. The domestic political crisis led to a
significant reduction in external assistance. The global economic slowdown contributed to
further fiscal and balance of payments pressures mainly through the decline in the prices of
and the demand for Mauritania’s main export commodity (iron, copper, and fish). Moreover,
the anticipated shift to an oil economy did not materialize.
4.
Though it has been reduced, poverty remains high. Poverty incidence has declined
from 47.6 percent in 2004 to about 42 percent in 2008. Progress has been made in the social
sectors, but the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) remains a key
challenge. Mauritania ranked 154 out of 182 countries according to the Human Development
Index in 2009. Recent domestic and external shocks have likely slowed progress on poverty
reduction, highlighting the need to protect social spending and develop appropriate safety
nets for the most vulnerable segments of the population.

1

The country reached the HIPC completion point in 2002.

6
Box 1. Mauritania and the IMF
Mauritania has had a long-standing relationship with the Fund, with ten arrangements over the
last twenty five years (three StandBy arrangements, one Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility
arrangement, and six Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangements).
All but the last two Fund-supported programs have been completed. The 2003-05 PRGF
arrangement was cancelled at the request of the authorities just after one year because of long
standing practice of providing inaccurate data to the Fund. The revised data suggest that significant
imbalances and low levels of foreign reserves persisted over many years. After the successful
implementation of a six-month staff-monitored program (SMP) covering January–June 2006, a new
PRGF arrangement (2006-09) was approved in December 2006. It was interrupted in October 2008
due to a military coup, and then cancelled, at the request of the authorities, in November 2009.
Key objectives of past arrangements. All Fund-supported programs aimed at maintaining
macroeconomic stability; achieving high and sustainable growth; diversifying the economy and
reducing vulnerability to shocks; and improving social indicators and reducing poverty.
Significant progress was made in several areas. On the macroeconomic side, these arrangements
contributed to sustain non-oil GDP growth at an average of 4.5 percent, and keep inflation relatively
low. On the structural side, the arrangements were instrumental in:


Establishing an auction system in the foreign exchange market and a more flexible
exchange rate that reduced significantly the premium in the parallel market.



Increasing tax revenue thanks to tax policy and administration reform.



Liberalizing trade policy.



Strengthening the central bank operational, supervision, and regulatory capacity.



Improving some social indicators and making indent in the poverty incidence (which
declined from about 51 percent in 2000 to 42 percent in 2008).

In contrast, weaknesses remain in several areas, as evidenced by:


External vulnerabilities: exports still heavily depend on the mining sector, and
international reserves are below the targeted 3 months of imports.



Rigidities in some areas of public financial management.



Large transfers to state-owned enterprises.



Weak financial intermediation.



Unfriendly business environment.



Slow progress in improving several development goals and lack of coherent and
comprehensive social protection and safety nets.

Performance under the two recent PRGF arrangements was largely affected by exogenous
factors. This includes political instability with two military coups (2005, 2008), unfavorable weather
conditions (particularly in 2002), and the sharp decline in oil production in 2006. But, it also
highlights the need to build capacity, notably through appropriate and well designed technical
assistance.

7

Box 2. Weathering Multiple Exogenous Shocks in 2008-09
Mauritania was hard hit by the fuel and food crisis nearly two years ago and the subsequent financial crisis and
global recession in 2008-09. The consequences of these external shocks have been exacerbated by a domestic
political crisis triggered by the military coup of August 2008 and the unexpected significant drop in oil
production. These shocks have taken a toll on the economy and its growth prospects.

Global economic slowdown: Direct
contagion from the global financial
crisis has been insignificant because the
country’s financial sector is small and
insulated from international markets. In
contrast, the country has been affected
through the trade channel. The decline
in demand and prices for Mauritania’s
main exports (iron ore, copper, and fish
products) resulted in a sharp drop of
exports. Remittances (although
relatively low) have likely declined and
some large investments projects
delayed.

Fuel and food crisis: The significant
fuel and food price increases were
exacerbated by a structurally precarious
food situation affecting mainly poor
people. In response, the government
adopted a Special Intervention Program
(SPI) amounting to about US$161
million (4.9 percent of non-oil GDP).
The SPI contributed to a wider fiscal
deficit but helped avoid social unrest.
Reflecting measures to contain the
prices of several goods, inflation was
kept at 3.9 percent (y/y) through endDecember 2008 compared to
7.4 percent in 2007.

The oil economy: Production in the
main oil field Chinguetti (declared
commercially viable in 2004) started in 2006 and immediately ran into major technical difficulties which led
output to fall from close to 75,000 barrels per day (bpd) in early 2006 to 30,000 barrels by end-2006 and
steadily declining to reach only 10,000 bpd in 2009. Projected output for 2011 could be as low as 7,500 bpd.
This drastic shift in production has led to a significant revision in the macroeconomic outlook of the country,
the downsizing of the public investment program, and the need for more external aid which was curtailed at the
onset of the oil economy.

The domestic political crisis: The August 2008 coup d’état staged by a military junta, led many bilateral and
multilateral donors to suspend their aid flows, complicating policy responses to the global economic slowdown.
The drop in external assistance and delays in foreign-financed projects contributed to slower economic activity,
mainly in construction and services, and reduced foreign exchange availability.

8
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
5.
The global economic downturn and the drop in donor financing have weakened
economic activity, through slower activity in the mining, fishing, and the construction
sectors. Non-oil real GDP growth is estimated at -0.9 percent in 2009, down from 4.1 percent
in 2008. Oil output continued to decline in 2009 and total GDP would contract by about
1 percent (Table 1 and Figure 2).
6.
Fiscal position has deteriorated. The basic non-oil fiscal deficit increased to
7.7 percent of non-oil GDP in 2008, up from 2.2 percent in 2007 (Table 2 and Figure 3).
Preliminary data suggest that spending adjustment efforts have not kept pace with declining
revenue and the basic non-oil fiscal deficit, although lower, would still be high in 2009,
reaching 5.3 percent of non-oil GDP. Faced with limited resources, the authorities have used
the recent SDR allocation to help close the fiscal financing gap.
7.
Lower food and fuel prices and the normalization of relations with the
international community have helped cushion the impact of the global economic
slowdown on the external position. The current account deficit is estimated at 12.7 percent
in 2009, down from 15.7 percent in 2008 (Table 3). The decline in exports values is expected
to be more than offset by a marked reduction in imports, reflecting the contraction in
economic activity, lower world food and fuel prices, and the foreign exchange rationing. The
resumption of donor financing after the July 2009 election and the disbursement of financial
compensation under the European Union (EU) fishing convention helped maintain the level
of gross international reserves at 2.2 months of imports2 at end-December 2009. The Central
Bank of Mauritania (BCM) restored the foreign exchange auction system in mid-December
2009.
8.
Inflation has remained in the low single digits (5 percent in 2009). Inflation fell
rapidly to 0.9 percent (y/y) in September, reflecting lower international fuel and food prices
and a somewhat prudent monetary policy stance. However, international fuel and food prices
are rising again, pushing up inflation to 5 percent (y/y) at end-December (Figure 2). With
slumping economic activity and a benign inflation outlook, the BCM lowered its policy rate
from 12 to 9 percent in November 2009 but real interest rates remained positive. Broad
money grew at 15.2 percent, reflecting the monetization of recent additional SDRs allocation,
while private sector credit growth slowed down to about 4 percent in 2009 (Table 1 and
Figure 4). The effective exchange rate depreciated by 3 percent in nominal terms and
2 percent in real terms.



Overall real GDP is projected to grow by 5.2 percent on average over the next five
years, supported by strong activity in the non-oil sector, including the launching of a
major project (estimated at US$1.1 billion) by the national iron ore company.3



Inflation is expected to remain in the low single digits at around 5 percent.



The basic non-oil deficit would fall to about 1 percent on non-oil GDP, thus helping
limit inflationary pressures, free resources for public and private investment, and
ensure public debt sustainability.



The external position would strengthen gradually. On one hand, the country’s export
outlook should gradually improve as the global economy recovers and domestic
capacity expands. On the other hand, imports associated with major oil, mining,
water, and infrastructure projects will decline as the projects are being phased out
over the next 5 years. On balance, the current account deficit would peak in 2011, and
thereafter decline gradually below10 percent by 2014.

3

The project includes 4 components: (a) expanding capacity; (b) building a new mineral seaport;
(c) modernizing the railway connection from the mine to the seaport; and (d) building a maintenance base. The
financing is provided by several financial institutions, including the African Development Bank, the European
Investment Bank, the French Development Agency (AFD), and the Islamic Development Bank.

10.
There are several risks to the outlook. The risks to the 2010 outlook remain tilted to
the downside given continued uncertainty in the global environment. Looking forward, other
risks include (a) volatility in the commodity market, notably a large drop in iron ore and
copper prices; and (b) a prolonged shortfall in power supply. On the upside, an acceleration
of reforms and donor support could spur growth.
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS AND PROGRAM OBJECTIVES
11.
Mauritania’s immediate challenge is to limit the fallout from recent shocks,
including the global economic slowdown and restore growth while ensuring
macroeconomic stability. The peaceful completion of the presidential election has
established a strong basis for resumption of the reform agenda and of the financial support
from the international community. An appropriate macroeconomic policy mix will support
the recovery while containing inflationary pressures.
12.
Turning to the medium term, the key challenge is to achieve high and
sustainable growth in order to boost employment and further reduce poverty. Meeting
these challenges requires fiscal consolidation, prudent monetary policy, and accelerated
structural reforms, particularly in public financial management (PFM) and in the financial
sector. Another crucial objective is to lessen the economy’s vulnerability to external shocks.
Improving the business climate and strengthening social policies are also important.
13.
To address these challenges, the authorities have launched a comprehensive
reform agenda in support of which they have requested an arrangement under the

11
ECF. The arrangement (2010-12) would support Mauritania’s efforts to sustain high growth
and reduce poverty while safeguarding macroeconomic stability. To achieve these goals, the
program and policy discussions focus on (a) fiscal consolidation to reduce public debt while
creating more fiscal space for social and infrastructure spending; (b) further enhancing the
monetary policy framework to maintain low inflation and rebuild reserves to about 3 months
of imports; (c) deepening financial intermediation and enhancing the business environment in
support of a broad-based private sector led-growth; and (d) strengthening social protection
and safety nets.
A. Furthering Economic Growth and Equity Through Fiscal Reform
Fiscal consolidation was brought to a
halt in 2008 by lower revenues, and
weak spending control. Furthermore,
the rigid expenditure framework
constrained fiscal adjustment (Box 3).
With limited external financing, the
deficit has been financed, inter alia, by a
significant increase in domestic debt.
Reforms to restrain expenditure and
bolster revenues are needed to put
public finances back on a sustainable
path, while increasing poverty-related
and infrastructure spending.

reconciliation of the payroll file
with the civil service roster will be completed. This would lead to significant savings in the wage bill
in 2010 while creating room for recruitment of personnel in strategic development sectors. In the
medium term, the government intends to address the size, effectiveness and remuneration system of
the public service. Possible measures include decompressing the wage structure, shifting towards
performance-based compensation, enhancing recruitment policies, and introducing additional PFM
measures. Transfers to SOEs are to decline as well, by revising tariff structures and introducing
better-targeted subsidies.

13

15.
Efforts to strengthen revenues by broadening the tax base, curtailing the use of
exemptions, and improving tax and customs administration (MEFP, ¶33) will ensure a
sustainable fiscal consolidation. The medium-term direct tax policy reform, in line with the
2008 FAD technical assistance report, aims at simplifying the tax system, making it easier to
administer, and lowering the burden on businesses. In this regard, it is important to conduct a
new census of tax payers and complete the computerization of the tax revenue agencies. On
customs administration, in addition to further reductions in discretionary exemptions, ongoing
projects aim at strengthening valuation and inspection procedures.
16.
The authorities intend to restrain the wage bill and other nonpriority spending
while giving priority to pro-poor spending, and shifting gradually the balance from
recurrent spending to capital spending. They are committed to speed up the civil service
reform to contain the wage bill while improving the quality of public service (MEFP, ¶36).
Efforts are also needed to eliminate inefficient spending, including untargeted subsidies.
17.
The authorities program for 2010 targets a reduction of the basic fiscal non-oil
deficit to 3.8 percent of non-oil GDP through revenue-enhancing measures and expenditure
restraint. Non-oil revenue would increase on account of new revenue measures (MEFP, ¶24),
improved economic situation, as well as the authorities’ determination to improve tax
compliance. At the same time, current expenditure would be reduced by 3.4 percentage
points, reflecting measures to contain nonpoverty-related current spending, the unwinding of
one-time spending (presidential elections), and other savings. The completion of the census
of civil servants and the subsequent reconciliation of the payroll file with the civil service
roster (to eliminate double pay and ghost employees), and the computerization and
automation of the payroll would free resources and lower the wage bill by 1 percent of GDP,
while allowing new recruitment in the education, health, judiciary and security sectors
(MEFP, ¶36). The authorities agreed on the need for contingency plans in case revenues are
much lower than expected (MEFP, ¶26). Such measures would imply further cuts in
nonpriority spending, in particular in common reserves, while minimizing economic
distortions and adverse effects on the poor.
18.
A durable reduction in the fiscal deficit will also require clarifying the
relationship between the government and public enterprises. The authorities are aware
that management of SOEs, in general, needs to be improved, given the drain on budget
resources. In this respect, they intend to launch, in collaboration with the World Bank, a
comprehensive study to review the financial status of all SOEs and propose a restructuring
and recovery program that will ensure their long-term viability (MEFP, ¶14). The authorities
are discussing with their multilateral and bilateral development partners to secure additional
grants and concessional loans to fund these restructuring plans.
19.
Efforts will be geared towards further improving the quality of public
investment. The increase in capital expenditure is ambitious, putting pressure on the

14
absorption and implementation capacities of the Mauritanian economy. However, the
authorities stressed the importance of small projects (in the areas of water, health, habitat),
easily implementable and with high impact on poverty reduction (MEFP, ¶25). They are
aware of the need to further strengthen implementation capacity and indicated that the
recently-established Agency for Project Monitoring will help improve the quality of
investment spending, coordinate projects management, and increase transparency and value
for money on public investment.
20.
Public financial management (PFM) reforms would ensure greater
transparency, accountability, and efficiency in the use of public resources. Streamlining
and strengthening budget preparation, execution, and monitoring are important. One of the
key measures is the creation of a treasury single account by 2011 (MEFP, ¶15), in line with
the recent FAD/West AFRITAC technical assistance report. To improve medium-term
budget planning and better inform discussions on expenditure priorities, the authorities intend
to improve the medium-term expenditure framework, move to programmatic budgeting, and
put in place a cash management plan with Fund and World Bank TA.
21.
The authorities concurred with the conclusion of the debt sustainability analysis
(DSA) carried out jointly with World Bank staff. This assessment is broadly unchanged
from the 2008 DSA4. Mauritania remains at moderate risk of distress, although the country’s
debt indicators have deteriorated, mainly reflecting both the new loan contracted by the
national mining company to expand its productive capacity as well as lower projected oil
output. Looking forward, the authorities are committed to develop an appropriate debt
strategy and improve the country’s debt management capacity to preserve external debt
sustainability. For that purpose, they intend to request World Bank support to assess debt
management capacity and needs in the context of the management performance assessment
(MPA) and medium-term debt strategy (MTDS) TA programs (MEFP, ¶30).
B. Greater Flexibility of Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
The economic downturn and slowing
down of private sector credit may
warrant further monetary easing. But,
there is some concern that
inflationary pressures could reemerge
rapidly given the recent increases in
food prices—which have a large

Regarding arrears to Kuwait and Libya, the authorities indicated that the technical groundwork was completed
but final negotiations were interrupted by the August 2008 military coup. The new authorities are stepping up
their efforts to reengage rapidly with the two creditors. They expect to finalize bilateral agreements in the
coming months.

15
impact on domestic inflation—as well as the prospects for a strong economic recovery.
Regarding exchange rate policy, in response to a weakening external position in late 2008,
the central bank has begun rationing foreign currency. This increased the parallel market
premium, undermined confidence, and led to a sharp drop in the amount of foreign exchange
sold on the official market (excluding BCM intervention). Greater exchange rate flexibility is
needed to increase the effectiveness of monetary policy and facilitate adjustment to external
shocks.
22.
Monetary policy will remain geared toward containing inflation in the context of
a flexible exchange rate policy (MEFP, ¶27). Rising fuel and food prices are expected to
pose some risks to the inflation outlook, but the authorities’ monetary program for 2010 will
be sufficiently firm to keep inflation rate close to 5 percent. Broad money growth is to be
limited to 13 percent, which, in view of the limited government financing requirement, would
allow credit to the private sector to increase to 11.4 percent, up from 3.9 percent in 2009.
Staff and BCM agreed that further cuts in interest rates should be gradual and based on a
careful examination of the impact on external accounts. A reduction in the statutory reserve
ratio could also be explored. In any case, the BCM stands ready to increase the policy rate as
soon as signs of pressures on inflation or in the foreign exchange market emerge. The BCM
will seek to strengthen its liquidity management efforts, notably through better coordination
between monetary and fiscal policies.
23.
The authorities concurred that greater exchange rate flexibility will help absorb
the external shocks. In this respect, it was agreed that the foreign exchange auction system
should be reestablished, although the authorities expressed some concern about the negative
impact of such measure on foreign exchange reserves. However, they recognized that greater
flexibility of the exchange rate, resumption of donor support, and fiscal consolidation would
help respond to the anticipated strong demand associated with the lifting of foreign exchange
restrictions and to minimize loss of foreign exchange reserves, while increasing official
reserves to US$247 million (2.5 months of imports) at end-December 2010. On this basis,
the BCM has restored the foreign exchange auction system in December 2009 MEFP, ¶28)
and will confine its interventions to smooth fluctuations in the exchange rate. The BCM
intends to request technical assistance for improving its intervention policy in the foreign
exchange market. Staff and BCM agreed that the exchange rate is close to its equilibrium
(Box 4), with a modest overvaluation in the range of 2 to 11 percent. Completing the
structural reform agenda will then be critical to buttress competitiveness.
C. Enhancing Financial Intermediation and the Investment Environment
Excluding the oil and other extractive sectors, investment in Mauritania is relatively low,
reflecting poor financial intermediation (limited access to and cost of bank financing), red
tape, cumbersome tax regulations, lack of infrastructure, high costs of production factors,
and energy shortages. The Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) and the World Bank Doing
Business reports have ranked Mauritania in the bottom quartile (Panel 1). Market-oriented

16
reforms centered on boosting financial intermediation and enhancing the investment
environment will be critical to improve competitiveness, raise economic activity, and further
reduce poverty.
Box 4. The Real Effective Exchange Rate Assessment
There are no clear signs of exchange rate misalignment. Parallel market premiums and CGER analyses
suggest that the Mauritanian real

exchange market introduced in late
2008 raised some concern over the
availability of foreign exchange, and
widened the premium in the parallel
foreign exchange market, up to

resumption of donor financing in the
middle of 2009 boosted international
reserves, lowering significantly the
premiums to about 1 percent.

Panel 1. Mauritania: Competitiveness and Governance, 2010
Out of 183 countries, Mauritania ranks 166 in the 2010 World Bank's Doing Business Survey, losing five places relative to
the previous year. Lack of competitiveness and poor governance constitute major constraints to the development of the
manufacturing sector; while lack of progress in the judiciary reform and high NPLs reflect unfavorably on the banking
indicators.

24.
The authorities intend to accelerate implementation of their multi-pronged
banking sector reform strategy to strengthen regulation and supervision and
consolidate the banks’ financial situation. The domestic banking sector has virtually no
exposure to the source of the global financial crisis. However, the banking system remains
fragile with nonperforming loans reaching almost 26.5 percent of total loans at endOctober 2009. Moreover, the economic slowdown could further deteriorate credit quality. In
this regard, the authorities indicated that they will maintain a vigilant watch on bank
performance as the impact of the global slowdown plays out. They will accelerate the

18
implementation of the 2007 FSAP. The BCM is committed to pursue the implementation of
safeguards assessment mission recommendations (MEFP, ¶37). The authorities intend to
request Fund technical assistance to further enhance banks’ supervision.
25.
Improving the investment climate and private sector development remains a
priority for the authorities. Efforts to firm up governance and transparency, increased
public spending in
infrastructure, education and
health, measures in the
financial sector and in the
tax regime to support private
sector activity, reforms in
the legal, judicial, and
regulatory areas, and the
new investment code
(MEFP, ¶39) are vital to
help lower the cost of doing
business and boost private
investment. Further progress
in reforming public enterprises, in particular in the energy sector, would also help improve
the business environment. In this context, the authorities will finalize, in collaboration with
the World Bank, an overall strategy in the energy sector to reduce costs and expand supply.
D. Social Protection and Safety Nets
Notwithstanding recent progress, poverty remains exceptionally high, particularly in rural
areas. The recent household survey found that 59.4 percent of the population in rural area is
below the poverty line in 2008 (Panel 2). In addition, Mauritania’s food situation remains
structurally precarious, and a large segment of the population is subject to food insecurity.5
In the absence of safety nets, the government has been protecting vulnerable groups through
a rise in poverty-related spending and a series of ad hoc measures. There is a need to
develop comprehensive, well-targeted, and sustainable social protection and safety nets.
26.
The authorities intend to develop sustainable and efficient safety nets over the
medium term. The authorities’ response to the food and fuel crisis in 2008 mainly addressed
short-term concerns, focusing on free food distribution via food stamps programs, and
stabilization of gas, electricity, and water prices. Recent efforts to protect the poor led the
authorities to provide well-targeted subsidy for cooking and heating oil to avoid severe
environmental damages stemming from the use of wood by poor households who cannot

19
afford high gas prices. The authorities recognized the need to make further efforts to
strengthen and expand, well targeted and coherent subsidy schemes and social safety nets
programs in coordination with the World Bank and other donors. In this respect, they will
launch, in collaboration with the UNICEF, a comprehensive study on existing social
protection and safety nets schemes (MEFP, ¶41). The results and recommendations will be
included in an updated version of the PRSP.6 Looking forward, the authorities are also
intensifying efforts to attract private investment in the agricultural sector to increase food
output, reduce dependency on imports, develop income-generating activities for the poor, and
improve food access.

E. Data Provision
27.
Provision of data to the Fund is broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, with
timeliness and regularity of basic macroeconomic data being priorities. Recently, efforts
have been made to strengthen national accounts, balance of payments, and fiscal data, with
the help of Fund technical assistance. Measures for improvement are underway.
V. ECF-SUPPORTED PROGRAM MODALITIES
28.
Access level and phasing. ECF access is proposed at the norm of 120 percent of
quota (SDR 77.28 million), to be disbursed in 7 installments over the three-year period
covered by the arrangement (Table 6). The proposed access would be consistent with (a) the
high balance of payment needs given that the country has been hit by multiple severe
external shocks; (b) the need to build an adequate foreign exchange buffer in view of
Mauritania’s vulnerability to external shocks; (c) the strength of the program; and (d) the
relatively low outstanding Fund credit (16.01 percent of quota). It would also help to rebuild
reserves to comfortable levels and facilitate the authorities’ adjustments efforts.
29.
Monitoring. The program will be monitored on a semi-annual basis, with tests dates
for end-June and end-December through 2012. The first review would assess performance
based on end-June 2010 quantitative performance criteria and the second review would
assess performance based on end-December 2010 performance criteria. Quantitative targets
(MEFP Table 1) aim at (a) safeguarding external stability—a floor on net international
reserves of the BCM; a ceiling on short-term external borrowing; a ceiling on medium- and
long-term nonconcessional borrowing contracted or guaranteed by the government; a ceiling
on new external arrears—and (b) ensuring fiscal sustainability—a ceiling on net domestic
assets of the BCM; a floor on the balance of government non-oil operations. Structural
benchmarks (MEFP Table 2) aim at strengthening tax administration to increase revenue;
improving budget execution and liquidity management; enhancing transparency and
accountability of the BCM; and ensuring an efficient management of the program. The
measures are consistent with the Article IV policy discussions and are detailed in the MEFP.
30.
Financing. The country faces high financing needs from 2010 through 2012. Taking
into account the authorities’ reserve target, the total financing gap during the period would
reach US$205 million. These requirements would be partially filled by expected support
from bilateral and other multilateral development partners, including the Arab Monetary
Fund (Table 7). The remaining gap in 2010 would be filled by the Fund. Staff will reassess
the availability of financing during the first review, when the extent of donor support should
be clearer, and program targets will be revised if necessary. The authorities intend to
organize by end-2010 a follow-up meeting on the pledges made during the December 2007
consultative group meeting in Paris.

21
31.
Program risks and mitigation. Although challenging, the objectives of growth and
poverty reduction in Mauritania are not out of reach, but risks remain. The key counterparts
at the ministry of finance and at the central bank are those who were in charge of monitoring
the 2006 PRGF arrangement. This provides signs of the authorities’ capacity to undertake a
new program. Further, the new authorities are strongly committed to the reform agenda, and
to strengthen ownership, they have decided to create a technical monitoring committee to
monitor closely the program and the reform agenda (MEFP, ¶43). Nevertheless, there are
some risks, including renewed political instability and social tensions that could arise from
the civil service reform and the restructuring of public enterprises.
32.
Capacity to repay. The country’s capacity to repay the Fund remains solid. Taking
into account the scheduled disbursements and repayments due during the program period,
Mauritania's outstanding use of Fund credit is expected to peak at 132 percent of quota, less
than 4 percent of the country's total stock of medium- and long-term external debt in 2013.
Debt service to the Fund will remain around 0.1 percent and 0.5 percent of exports of goods
and services and gross international reserve through 2012, respectively (Table 8).
Furthermore, preliminary results of the updated DSA indicate that the proposed access does
not pose serious risks.
33.
Safeguards. An update safeguards assessment of the BCM is underway and should
be completed by the time of the first review. The 2010 safeguards mission found that recent
economic and political challenges exacted a toll on the safeguards framework of the bank and
significant risks continue to exist. Action is needed on several fronts including to restore
independent governance oversight and timely publication of the audited financial statements,
along with new procedures to ensure the integrity of data reported to the Fund. The
permanent cessation of the cash operations of the BCM foreign offices is also a safeguards
priority. The previous safeguards assessment of the BCM was completed on April 16, 2007.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
Recent global crises have highlighted Mauritania’s vulnerability to external
shocks. The food and fuel price increases and the global economic slowdown, combined
with the domestic political crisis have led to a contraction of economic activity and a decline
in revenue. Together with a rising wage bill, this has hindered fiscal performance, limiting
the government’s ability to meet pressing demands for infrastructure and basic social
services. On the positive side, domestic inflation remained in single digits and foreign
exchange reserves of the BCM slightly above 2 months’ import cover.
35.
Fiscal consolidation will be central to maintaining macroeconomic stability,
putting public finances back on sustainable path, and promoting growth. The 2010
budget strikes the right balance between supporting the recovery and restoring fiscal
consolidation. It appropriately increases social and infrastructure spending while containing
current spending. Medium-term fiscal sustainability will hinge on further broadening the

22
revenue base, strengthening tax and customs administration, and reducing tax exemptions, as
well as reducing the wage bill and eliminating nonessential recurrent spending including
untargeted subsidies. Adhering strictly to all budget execution procedures and significantly
reducing the practice of treasury advances is also important. Decisive measures are also needed
to improve public expenditure management, enhance public financial management, and
restructure SOEs, in particular the utility companies to reduce the subsidy burden to the
budget.

36.
Monetary policy should focus on anchoring inflation at low levels. Staff supports
the recent easing of monetary conditions. But the BCM should keep a wary eye on
inflationary pressures and further easing should be gradual.
37.
Greater exchange rate flexibility is important to ensure that the exchange
market clears and the parallel market disappears. Staff welcomes and supports the
authorities’ intention to request technical assistance for improving their intervention policy in
the foreign exchange market. Mauritania’s real effective exchange rate is in line with its
equilibrium level.

38.
Structural reforms to buttress the economy’s resilience and improve
competitiveness will be critical to raise economic activity and further reduce poverty.
The authorities need to pursue their multi-pronged banking sector reform strategy to further
strengthen the financial sector and enhance banking intermediation. Continued fiscal
consolidation to create room for investment in human capital and infrastructure and decisive
actions to make the business environment more attractive are also important to promote a
broad-based private sector-led growth. However, the range of reforms should be carefully
sequenced and prioritized to take into account administrative capacity, and the need for social
consensus.
39.
Key challenge is to strengthen social protection and safety nets. The authorities
are committed to protect spending critical for poverty reduction. Progress in expanding and
strengthening social protection is also needed. Staff welcomes the authorities’ plan to launch a
comprehensive study on existing social protection and safety nets schemes. The results and
recommendations should be included in the new PRSP under consideration.
40.
Staff supports the authorities’ request for a new ECF arrangement. The
authorities are strongly committed to pursue the reform process embodied in the 2006 PRGF
arrangement. They indicated their readiness to preserve macroeconomic stability, accelerate
structural reforms to achieve high and sustainable growth, and strengthen social protection.
The new program appropriately addresses these challenges.
41.
External assistance will be essential to address Mauritania’s short- and mediumterm financing needs and strengthen external sustainability. Fund financing can be
expected to play a crucial role in catalyzing other donors’ support. However, the government
should engage the World Bank and other development partners in providing additional

financial assistance. Staff supports the authorities’ intention to organize by end-2010 a
donors meeting.
42.
Improving the country’s debt management capacity will also help to ensure
external debt sustainability. To the extent possible, the authorities should continue
mobilizing concessional support to cover their financing needs. They also need to strengthen
their debt management framework and accelerate efforts to conclude bilateral negotiations
with the remaining Non-Paris Club creditors.
43.
Statistical data should be further strengthened to guide and monitor
macroeconomic and poverty reduction policies. In this respect, improved data on national
accounts, the balance of payments and on external debt are a priority.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Mauritania be held under the
24-month cycle in accordance with the decision on consultation cycles in program countries.

APPENDIX: MAURITANIA: LETTER OF INTENT
Nouakchott, February 23, 2010

Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20431
USA

Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
1.
The elections organized in July 2009 with the assistance of the international
community paved the way for the return to constitutional order. Since then, the new
government is now focusing its attention on continuing the economic reforms undertaken in
recent years, which have helped to raise the standard of living of the population and to
further reduce poverty. Aware that further efforts are needed to reach the Millennium
Development Goals, the government has prepared a wide-ranging program of reforms
covering the period 2010-12.
2.
The new program is primarily designed to address the fallout from the external
shocks that have led to a decline in economic activity, strained public finances, and thereby
slowed poverty reduction efforts. The much needed stabilization of the economy requires
fiscal consolidation, a cautious monetary policy, and a flexible exchange rate policy. To put
growth on a sustainable path, the program includes ambitious structural reforms aimed at
enhancing public financial management, developing the financial sector, and creating a
business climate conducive to private investment, a prerequisite for creating jobs and
reducing poverty. Regarding exchange rate policy, we restored normal operation of the
foreign exchange market on December 14, 2009. All exchange restrictions introduced since
end-2008 on current account transactions payments were lifted.
3.
The attached Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) sets out the
main elements of the government’s program for the next three years. It also describes the
macroeconomic objectives, structural measures, and indicators for the first year of the
program supported by the ECF arrangement.
4.
The government requests financial assistance from the IMF through an arrangement
under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) in the amount of SDR 77.28 million, i.e., the
equivalent of 120 percent of the country’s quota. The government will provide Fund staff
with all the data and information necessary to monitor implementation of the program. The

38
first and second reviews of Mauritania’s performance under the arrangement will be
completed by September 30, 2010 and March 31, 2011, respectively.
5.
The government believes that the policies set forth in the attached MEFP are adequate
to achieve the objectives of the program. Nevertheless, the government stands ready to adopt
any measures that may prove necessary for this purpose. The government will consult with
Fund staff on the adoption of these measures well in advance of any revisions to the policies
stated in the MEFP, and in accordance with the IMF’s policies on such consultations.

Sincerely yours,

/s/
Ousmane Kane
Minister of Finance

/s/
Sidi Ould Tah
Minister of Economic Affairs and Development

/s/
Sid’Áhmed Ould Raiss
Governor of the Central Bank of Mauritania

39
ATTACHMENT I. MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES, 2010–12
FEBRUARY 23, 2010
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The political change that occurred in August 2008 led to a domestic political crisis
and a significant reduction in, or in some cases, the suspension of financial and technical
assistance of several development partners. The Mauritanian people's deep commitment to
democracy and the help of the international community made possible the organization of
presidential elections in July 2009 and the return to constitutional order.
2.
The new government remains steadfastly committed to continuing and accelerating
the reforms begun in the past few years with a view to increasing the standard of living of its
population and to achieving further reduction in poverty. This entails the pursuit of sound
macroeconomic management and the acceleration of structural reforms to improve the
business climate, promoting the private sector, and diversifying the economy.
3.
This memorandum sets out the government program for the period 2010–12, for
which we request the financial support of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) under the
Extended Credit Facility (ECF). It also sets out the actions and objectives for the first year.
II. ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND REFORMS: RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
4.
Prudent macroeconomic management and the implementation of structural reforms,
undertaken as part of the program supported by the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF) approved in 2006, had started to bear fruit, with sustained economic growth and
inflation relatively under control. This performance, together with debt relief,1 facilitated the
allocation of additional resources to finance infrastructure and poverty-reducing social
expenditure. Progress was therefore made toward achieving the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs), in particular in the education sector and access to drinking water.
5.
In addition to the domestic political crisis and subsequent reduction in financial
assistance from its main partners, Mauritania also suffered two further shocks in 2008 and
2009 that had a significant negative effect on its economy.


1

First, the sharp rise in food prices in 2008, in response to which the authorities
implemented a Special Intervention Program (SIP) for an amount of US$161 million,

Mauritania reached the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative completion point in 2002 and
received assistance under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) in 2006.

40
equivalent to 4.9 percent of non-oil GDP (PIBHP). The SIP helped to limit the impact
of this crisis on the most disadvantaged sections of the population.


Second, Mauritania suffered the effects of the international financial crisis. The direct
impact of the latter is very limited as financial intermediation is low and the
Mauritanian financial sector is insulated from the global financial system. However,
the global economic slowdown did affect Mauritania significantly through the fall in
prices of and external demand for its main export commodities (iron and copper).
World prices for iron and copper dropped between 2008 and 2009 by 36 percent and
28 percent, respectively.

6.
These three shocks led to a contraction in the non-oil activity of about 1 percent in
2009. Furthermore, oil production continues to fall. In 2009, it reached 10,700 barrels a day
compared with initial projections of approximately 75,000 barrels a day at the beginning of
2006. The external current account deficit is expected to reach 13 percent of GDP in 2009.
The allocation of Special Drawing Rights (SDR) and financial compensation under the
fisheries agreement with the European Union (EU) helped the Central Bank increase its
foreign exchange reserves at end-December 2009 to approximately US$238 million,
equivalent to 2.2 months of imports of goods and services.2 The drop in tax revenues
resulting from the global economic slowdown, together with the rise in spending under the
SIP led to deterioration in the basic non-oil budget deficit excluding grants, which amounted
to 5.3 percent of non-oil GDP in 2009.
7.
Some progress was made in the area of structural reform. In the public finance area,
consistent with IMF recommendations from 2008, measures being implemented seek to
simplify the tax system, expand the tax base, and streamline and assess the quality of public
expenditure. In this context, the government has undertaken several reforms since 2008
specifically aiming at (a) simplifying procedures; (b) reducing tax rates;3 (c) creating the
large enterprise unit responsible for collecting taxes from enterprises with turnover in excess
of UM 100 million; (d) setting up the medium-sized enterprises directorate, responsible for
tax collection from enterprises with turnover ranging between UM 30 and 100 millions; and
(e) upgrading the Tax Centers (Centres des impôts—CDI) tasked with collecting taxes from
small enterprises subject to a flat turnover tax.
2

3

Excluding extractive industry imports and those financed by foreign aid.

The Corporate income tax (impôt sur les bénéfices industriels et commerciaux—BIC) was reduced from
40 percent to 25 percent, the presumptive minimum tax (impôt minimum forfaitaire—IMF) was lowered from
4 percent to 2.5 percent, the tax on salaries and wages (impôt sur les traitements et salaries—ITS) decreased
from 60 percent to 30 percent, the tax on noncommercial income (impôt sur les bénéfices non commerciaux—
BNC) was reduced from 35 percent to 30 percent, and the tax on income from movable capital (impôt sur les
revenus de capitaux mobiliers—IRCM) was cut from 16 percent to 10 percent.

41
8.
On monetary policy, we have lowered in November 2009 the key interest rate of the
Central Bank of Mauritania (BCM) from 12 percent to 9 percent, taking into account the fall
in inflationary pressures and the sluggish state of the economy. The modernization of our
management instruments is underway. In this connection, we adopted (a) a new charter for
the Central Bank aimed at strengthening monetary policy efficiency by targeting price
stability and ensuring greater independence for the central bank; and (b) new regulations and
a new procedures manual for the money market. A monetary policy council chaired by the
Governor tasked with setting BCM’s monetary policy was also established. Furthermore, the
legal framework for new policy instruments (BCM bonds, certificates of deposit, and
commercial paper) was established, and the money market was expanded to include all
economic agents.
9.
Foreign exchange reforms included establishing as of January 2007 a procedure for
auctioning foreign currencies on the foreign exchange market. However, this procedure was
suspended in reaction to the financial crisis and the deterioration of Mauritania’s external
position, and temporary exchange restriction measures were introduced at end-2008.
10.
We implemented important reforms in the financial sector. Accordingly, in line with
the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) recommendations, we introduced various
measures, including (a) new laws relating to the charter of the central bank, banking activity,
and microfinance; and (b) several implementing regulations relating to the general order
regulating credit institutions. In line with the objectives set out by the government, all but
four of the banks have already increased their capital to UM 4 billion. In addition, since 2005
the financial statements and international reserves of the BCM were audited annually and
semiannually, respectively, by an international audit firm hired through a competitive
selection process. Significant headway has also been made in modernizing the payment
system. For example, the launch of electronic banking was accompanied by the
standardization by the central bank of the securities handled by the Clearing House.
III. GOVERNMENT PROGRAM
A. Medium-Term Objectives
11.
The government’s objective is to create adequate conditions for stronger growth in
order to progress toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and to reduce the
poverty incidence to less than 28.3 percent by 2015. In this context, the authorities intend to
pursue structural reforms and macroeconomic policies during 2010-12 aimed at maintaining
macroeconomic stability and in particular (i) keeping inflation at about 5 percent;
(b) returning to an average annual non-oil GDP growth rate above 5 percent; and
(c) accumulating foreign exchange reserves equivalent to about three months of imports by
end-2012.

42
B. Policies
Fiscal policy
12.
We have decided to reduce the basic non-oil deficit (excluding grants) from
5.3 percent of non-oil GDP in 2009 to about 1 percent in 2012, by increasing revenues while
rationalizing public spending. In this connection, we will continue to implement measures
aimed at further expanding the tax base and improving tax and customs administration with a
view to increase tax revenues. Nevertheless, total revenues (excluding grants) are expected to
stabilize given the fall in nontax revenues, in particular those relating to the fishery sector.
13.
Regarding current expenditure, civil service reform and the modernization of
government will contribute to a reduction in the wage bill by 1.7 points of non-oil GDP
between 2009 and 2012 and to an improvement in the quality of public service. The ongoing
civil service reform, in collaboration with our development partners, including the World
Bank, will focus on updating the regulations and rationalizing the recruitment process,
decentralizing the payroll, and paying salaries and wages through bank accounts. Using the
findings of the comprehensive census of government employees, we will assess the
operational staffing needs by ministry, ensure adequacy between staffing and needs, and
strengthen personnel management. These measures will be part of a plan to rehabilitate the
public sector, reduce budgetary transfers, and upgrade performance.
14.
Lower transfers and subsidies to public enterprises will also help reduce current
spending. To achieve this objective, we will carry out an assessment of the governance of
public enterprises,4 and program or performance contracts will be signed with the ultimate
view of restoring balanced financial positions and reducing subsidies. We intend to pursue
our efforts on public investment, consistent with the priorities targeted in the Poverty
Reduction and Strategy Paper (PRSP), including with particular reference to human
resources development, access by the poor to basic services, acceleration of economic
growth, and promotion of employment. Under these circumstances, emphasis will be on
building infrastructure and land-use planning to ensure a balanced and orderly development
of the country. We have just set up an agency tasked with project monitoring and research,
and we intend to adopt a new government procurement code to improve the quality of public
investment. This new code will facilitate not only swifter execution of projects, but also
greater transparency of government contract award procedures.

43
15.
Most state-owned enterprises are in financial distress and rely heavily on budgetary
transfers to continue operating. In the context of our program to restructure the public
enterprise sector, and in view of the fiscal risks posed by SOEs, we will put in place, in
collaboration with the World Bank, recovery programs for all SOEs in financial distress. The
objective is to enable these SOEs to continue supplying these public goods to the country in a
sustainable way and in adequate conditions. We will seek grants and concessional loans to
fund the restructuring plans.
16.
The government is committed to carry on its ambitious PFM reform program,
including improving the medium-term expenditure framework, moving to program
budgeting, and creating a Treasury Single Account under a government account management
agreement. The government is also committed to increasing poverty-reducing expenditures
during 2010-12 and to pursuing reforms to further improve the quality, transparency, and
efficiency of government expenditure
Monetary and exchange policy
17.
We will pursue prudent monetary policy, consistent with our objective to keep
inflation in check. The BCM will continue the reforms undertaken to modernize, adapt
monetary policy instruments, and strengthen central bank operational independence. We will
intensify our efforts in particular to develop an interbank market.
Structural reforms
18.
In line with FSAP recommendations, we intend to implement reforms to strengthen
the financial sector while improving access to financial services in a competitive
environment. This reform will focus on strengthening the legal and regulatory framework of
the financial sector, increasing transparency of accounting practices in the financial sector
and the reliability of its financial statements, building the capacity of the various financial
institution supervisory authorities, and implementing AML/CFT regulations. To safeguard
transparency and to ensure adequate supervision of the financial sector, commercial banks’
financial statements will be audited annually by an audit firm hired through invitation to
tender. The authorities are also committed to studying various options to eliminating the
stock of outstanding nonperforming loans held by the banks. Furthermore, the banks will
continue to increase their share capital to the level of UM 6 billion by 2012.
19.
We will continue to pursue a more flexible foreign exchange policy and to modernize
the foreign exchange market. This market, based on a BCM-managed auctions system, could
then be transformed into an interbank foreign exchange market.
20.
We are committed to improving the business climate and to removing obstacles to
private sector development. Measures under consideration include setting up a legal
framework to facilitate the acquisition and enforcement of collateral and guarantees on
movable and immovable property, simplification of the mechanisms to recover claims and

44
enforce contracts, the strengthening of the capacity of the courts regarding commercial law,
financial law, and the settlement of trade disputes, and to improve the dissemination of legal
information.
Strengthening the social welfare system and combating poverty
21.
The current PRSP is organized around five pillars: (a) accelerating economic growth
and maintaining macroeconomic equilibrium; (b) anchoring growth in the economic sphere
of the poor; (c) developing human resources and improving access to basic social services;
(d) enhancing governance and reinforcing institutional capacities; and (e) improving
planning, monitoring and evaluation systems. The combination of higher output growth,
relatively low inflation, and increased and improved social spending contributed to lower the
national incidence of poverty from 47.6 percent in 2004 to about 42 percent in 2008. At this
rate, achieving the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) by bringing down poverty rate to
28.5 percent in 2015 appears very challenging. However, some MDGs, particularly in the
education sector will likely be achieved by 2015.
22.
The government’s steady commitment to achieving the MDGs and to strengthening
the social welfare system will be reflected through additional resources to benefit vulnerable
segments of the population, primarily at the local level, an improvement in the range of
available services (in the design and implementation of sectoral policies), a strengthening of
the institutional and human capacity to increase absorption capacity, and, finally, the linking
of resources to specific targets, including the setting of performance indicators associated
with the MDGs to facilitate the monitoring of expenditure effectiveness and efficiency. The
program will help achieve higher economic growth and preserve macroeconomic stability
while creating fiscal space for additional social and infrastructure spending, thereby
facilitating progress toward the MDGS.
23.
We recognize that the success of Mauritania’s social and economic development
national policies is more than ever predicated on crafting a governance policy that delivers
transparent and efficient management of public goods. To address this major challenge, the
government has decided to join a number of international agreements that will ensure
effective implementation of its ambitions with regard to good governance and sound public
resources management. We will make all efforts to mobilize technical and financial
assistance from foreign partners in support of government policies.
IV. PROGRAM FOR 2010
24.
Our objective for the 2010 annual tranche of our program is to attain a growth rate in
the non-oil sector of 5.2 percent, to keep inflation below 5 percent, reduce the external
current account deficit to about 12 percent of GDP, and to increase foreign exchange reserves
to approximately 2.5 months of imports. Achieving these targets assume normal rainfall, the
resumption of technical and financial assistance by our partners, the implementation of
appropriate macroeconomic policies, and the continuation of structural reforms.

45
A. The Macroeconomic Program
Fiscal policy
25.
The 2010 budget law is based on a solid resumption of economic growth, a
significant improvement in revenue collection, a tight control in public spending growth,
strengthened access to essential services, and improved living conditions of the population.
The basic non-oil deficit (excluding grants) will be limited to UM 32.6 billion (3.8 percent of
non-oil GDP).
26.
Non-oil revenues will increase on account of both the economic recovery and tax
measures to expand the tax base and modernize and strengthen the tax and customs
administrations. The main measures include: (a) a 100 percent increase in the tax on vehicles
used for public transportation of people or goods and a 50 percent increase on vehicles for
personal use; (b) a raise from 14 to 18 percent in the value added tax (VAT) rate on
petroleum products and telephony with a view to harmonizing the VAT system with that of
neighboring countries, in particular those from the West African Economic and Monetary
Union (WAEMU); and (c) replacing the tax services with a 14 percent tax on financial
operations.
27.
The current budget (excluding interest on foreign debt) will fall slightly to
UM 183 billion (21 percent of non-oil GDP). Civil service reform (completion of the census
of civil servants, reconciliation of the payroll file with the civil service roster to eliminate
double pay and unjustified paid salaries, and the computerization and automation of the
payroll) should help keep the level of the wage bill unchanged compared with 2009, at
UM 76.6 billion (8.8 percent of non-oil GDP in 2010 against 10.1 percent of non-oil GDP in
2009). The 2010 consolidated domestically-financed capital expenditure amounts to UM 54.3
billion (6.3 percent of non-oil GDP). These resources will be allocated to priority actions
supporting sustained economic growth, job creation, better access to essential services, and
improved living conditions for the population, in particular for the most vulnerable groups. In
this context, a relatively significant amount is allocated for restructuring the poor
neighborhoods of large towns and cities, improving the living environment and access to
drinking water, developing education and health, as well as supporting employment
initiatives. Capacity constraints are a risk and efforts will be made to put together various
programs aimed at strengthening capacity and modernizing the public sector. In view of the
substantial needs of the country, we intend to step up our efforts to mobilize more grants in
support of higher priority spending. Should that be the case, the basic non oil deficit would
exceed the program target. We are committed to offset shortfall in revenue by cuts in
spending with lower priority, so as to achieve the basic non-oil deficit (excluding grants)
program target.

46
Monetary and exchange policies
28.
The monetary authorities will continue to implement a sound monetary policy
consistent with the inflation target and in the context of greater exchange rate flexibility. The
2010 monetary program targets a 13 percent monetary growth and an increase in credit to the
private sector. However, the Central Bank stands ready to tighten its policy, specifically
through its lead rates as much as necessary if inflationary pressures emerge. In support of a
more active liquidity management, the fiscal and monetary coordination committee will be
revived. The BCM will continue to use Treasury bills for open-market operations.
29.
Regarding exchange rate policy, we restored normal operation of the foreign
exchange market on December 14, 2009. All restrictions introduced since end-2008 on
current account transactions payments were lifted. The intervention policy will be conducted
in line with market rules and will essentially aim to smooth excessive daily fluctuations in
the exchange rate. We are firmly of the opinion that this should restore confidence and lead
to the expansion of the foreign exchange market and a rise in transactions. We would
welcome technical assistance in this area to guide our efforts.
External sector and debt management
30.
Mauritania’s external outlook hinges upon development in prices of its principal
export commodities. Current projections indicate that prices of Mauritania’s main export
commodities are on the rise again, which could lead to an increase in exports and an
improvement in the external current account in 2010. The external current account deficit is
expected to amount to approximately US$406 million (about 12 percent of GDP) and be
financed mainly through a rise in foreign direct investment in the oil and mining sector and
the mobilization of additional external funding. Excluding the financing mobilized by the
National Industrial and Mining Company (Société Nationale Industrielle et Minière (SNIM))
to expand its productive capacity, medium- and long-term external borrowing is expected to
reach approximately US$281 million in 2010.
31.
Our external borrowing policy will be under intense monitoring to ensure debt
sustainability. The government will work closely with its development partners to implement
a debt management strategy that will ensure access to external financing while preserving
external debt sustainability. In this context, we intend to request World Bank support to
assess debt management capacity and needs in the context of the management performance
assessment (MPA) and medium-term debt strategy (MTDS) TA programs. The
recommendations will enable us to address the weaknesses of the current system and ensure
more active and efficient debt management. We will be mobilizing mainly financing on
concessional terms. However, some strategic projects could require financing that may not be
secured on concessional terms. Such projects will be brought to the attention of the IMF and
the World Bank for review. Finally, we will pursue our best efforts to reach an agreement on

47
the arrears accumulated vis-à-vis Kuwait and Libya, on terms comparable with those granted
by the Paris Club creditors.
B. Structural Reforms
Strengthening tax administration and improving fiscal management
32.
The sound execution of the 2010 government budget and the preparation of the 2011
budget as a tool for macroeconomic management require measures to strengthen
transparency, improve tax collection, and reinforce budget execution in line with the
recommendations of recent technical assistance missions of the IMF, the World Bank, and
the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
33.
Eradicating corruption is an essential prerequisite for sound resource management
and effectiveness of government policies in the service of its citizens. The government has
now started a process with the support of its partners that will lead to the adoption of a
national anti-corruption strategy (SNLCC). An initial revised report and three-year action
plan have just been prepared and have been forwarded to our development partners. During
2010, this policy will be submitted to all stakeholders for validation and implementation. Our
country’s membership of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) reflects
similar consideration. Over the past few years, Mauritania has received considerable
assistance to strengthen natural resource management both in the mining sector run by the
National Industrial and Mining Company (SNIM) and the hydrocarbon sector. Regards the
latter, the Mauritanian Hydrocarbon Company (Société Mauritanienne des Hydrocarbures
(SMH)) manages the government’s interests in hydrocarbons and the publication of the
production-sharing contracts.
34.
On revenues, we intend to strengthen the tax and customs administrations based on
the recommendations of the most recent West Africa Regional Technical Assistance Center
(West AFRITAC) technical assistance mission. The modernization of tax administration is
the cornerstone of fiscal reform. In this connection, we will set up a steering committee to
oversee tax reform. This committee will be tasked with: (a) developing and implementing the
plan to computerize the operations of the General Directorate of Taxation; and (b) issuing, in
parallel with the census operations, new identification numbers to taxpayers, starting with
those for the Large Enterprise Directorate and the Medium-sized Enterprise Directorate.
35.
We will also strengthen customs administration by simplifying and computerizing
customs procedures. The third phase of customs computerization and, in particular, migration
to the Automatic System for Customs Data Entry (ASYCUDA++) version is underway. This
application will improve management of exemptions and help establish digital archiving. To
minimize fraud, the customs administration intends to: (a) create a valuation office (bureau
de la valeur); and (b) set up a customs valuation database. We will also continue reconciling
data between customs and the service company (SGS).

48
36.
Improvement in cash flow and active cash management are priorities for government
action. In this context, we will prepare a government cash management plan. Weekly
meetings of the fiscal and monetary policy coordination committee will be recorded in
minutes that will review the cash position and three-month rolling cash forecasts, as well as
the budget execution recommendations, and the BCM’s interventions on the money market.
Controlling the wage bill and improving quality of public service
37.
Civil service reform with the support of the World Bank and government
modernization will be continued. The comprehensive census of government employees
carried out in 2007 will be validated and updated by end-June 2010 and we will reconcile the
databases of the government payroll and the civil service roster. We will terminate, before
June 30, 2010, all benefits in kind granted to government employees and replace them
instead by cash allowances in order to enhance transparency in the remuneration policy.
Reorganizing and strengthening the financial sector
38.
It is important to continue building on the achievements of the past few years by
improving access to financial services in a competitive environment. The BCM is committed
to pursue the implementation of measures recommended by safeguards assessment missions,
including the January 2010 mission in order to strengthen the safeguards mechanism in place
and address all the vulnerabilities identified. On accounting, BCM intends to convert its
accounting system to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with a view to
improving financial transparency. In order to fully implement this project, BCM requests the
resumption of IMF technical assistance over the next few years, including in 2010. BCM’s
financial statements, including central bank reserves at end-December 2009, will be audited
by an international audit firm hired through a competitive selection process. In addition, the
commercial banks should increase their share capital to UM 4.5 billion by end-2010 about
(US$17 million).
Reforming the electricity sector
39.
The electricity production sector is in a very fragile state, due to insufficient
production capacity as well as very significant operating losses of the government electricity
company Société Mauritanienne d'électricité (SOMELEC). With support from our partners,
we will finalize a master plan for the sector that will include medium- and long-term
objectives. The plan will include a technical and financial restructuring program for
SOMELEC, while clarifying the relationship between SOMELEC and the government, and
defining the role of the private sector in the sector.
Improving the business climate and promoting the private sector
40.
The obstacles hindering private sector development range from the high input costs of
production factors and the rigidity of the overall business environment. They are also

49
attributable to the availability and skills of the workforce and to weak infrastructure services,
such as water, transport, telecommunications, and, above all, electricity. Measures under
consideration in support of private sector development will aim at mitigating the impact of
those obstacles and gradually removing them. The Investment Code will be revised during
2010, drawing on the experience of other countries, so as to provide Mauritania with a
consistent and comprehensive law that consolidates all the advantages, incentives, and
safeguards granted to investors. Administrative formalities and procedures will be simplified
and their processing will be shortened as we intend to reactivate and expand starting in 2010
the authority of the One-Stop Facility.
Strengthening the social welfare system and combating poverty
41.
With the support of UNICEF and other specialized institutions of the United Nations,
Mauritania has recently launched a study on social protection with a view to better
understanding existing social welfare mechanisms and programs. This study will review the
social safety nets currently in place, assess the priority needs, and issue recommendations to
guide the action of the government and its partners in preparing a national social welfare
strategy for Mauritania for the 2010–12 period.
Improving economic statistics
42.
The compilation of reliable financial and economic statistics is essential for the
design and monitoring of the PRSP and this program. Accordingly, the collection and
processing of data on prices, national accounts, and balance of payments will be further
improved. For this purpose, we are committed to strengthen the resources of the agencies
tasked with producing these data, including the National Office of Statistics (ONS). We will
also step up our efforts with the donors to mobilize the technical and financial resources
needed for that purpose.
C. Risks
43.
Various risks may hamper achievement of the program objectives. These include the
following: (a) the vulnerability of the Mauritanian economy to exogenous shocks, such as
price volatility of its principal export commodities; (b) low mobilization of official transfers;
and (c) rainfall and locust infestation hazards on agriculture and livestock farming in an arid
zone. The government is aware of these risks and stands ready to adjust its policies if the
risks materialize. If need be, corrective measures will be taken in consultation with IMF staff.
V. PROGRAM MONITORING
44.
The government will establish a technical monitoring committee (CTS) to ensure
effective implementation of this program. This committee will also monitor the execution of
an action plan to reform public financial management. It will include, in particular,
representatives of the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and

50
Development, BCM, ONS, and representatives of other ministries and government agencies
that can assist CTS, if need be. The technical committee’s operation will be guided by a
ministerial committee that will also include the Governor of the Central Bank. The CTS will
have a permanent secretariat and will meet regularly to assess progress made and will ensure
transmission of data required for monitoring program execution. The implementation of the
program will be assessed every six months in consultation with IMF staff. The first review
will be based on the quantitative performance criteria and indicators at end-June 2010
(MEFP Table 1) and on the structural benchmarks (MEFP Table 2). These quantitative
criteria and benchmarks are set out in the Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU),
along with adjusters in case of contingencies.

ATTACHMENT II. TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
1.
This memorandum sets out the definitions of the quantitative targets for the period
January 1, 2010–December 31, 2012, which are set forth in the Memorandum of Economic
and Financial Policies (MEFP) and reported in Table 1. It also establishes the content and
frequency of the data to be provided to IMF staff for monitoring the program. For the
purpose of this memorandum, the government is defined to include only the central
government.
2.
The quantitative targets are defined as ceilings or floors for cumulative changes
between the reference period described in Table 1 and the end of the month indicated.
I. DEFINITIONS
A. Performance Criteria and Quantitative Benchmarks
3.
Net international reserves (NIR) of the Central Bank of Mauritania (BCM) are
defined as the difference between the reserve assets of the BCM (i.e., the external assets that
are readily available to, and controlled by, the BCM, as per the 5th edition of the IMF
Balance of Payments Manual) minus the foreign exchange liabilities of the BCM to residents
and nonresidents. The gold holdings will be evaluated at the gold price in effect on
November 30, 2009 (US$1,127 per oz.) and the U.S. dollar value of reserves assets (other
than gold) and foreign exchange liabilities will be calculated using program exchange rates,
namely, the November 30, 2009 exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the ouguiya
(UM/US$ 262.0), the SDR (US$/SDR 1.61), the Euro (Euro/US$ 1.49), and other non-dollar
currencies as published in the IFS.
4.
Net domestic assets (NDA) of the BCM are defined as reserve money minus net
foreign assets (NFA) of the BCM. Reserve money comprises: (a) currency in circulation
(currency outside banks and commercial banks’ cash in vaults); and (b) deposits of
commercial banks at the BCM. NFA are defined as gross foreign assets of the BCM,
including the external assets not included in the reserve assets, minus all foreign liabilities of
the BCM (i.e., NDA = Reserve Money – NFA, based on the BCM balance sheet). NFA will
be measured at the program exchange rates as described in Paragraph 3.
5.
Government balance is defined for program monitoring purposes as non-oil central
government basic balance excluding grants, which is equal to non-oil government revenue
(excluding grants) minus government expenditure (excluding foreign-financed investment
expenditure and interest due on external debt). The government balance will be measured
based on Treasury data. Revenue are defined in accordance with the Government Financial
Statistics manual (GFSM 2001), excluding the revenue related to oil- and other hydrocarbonrelated activities and transfers from the National Hydrocarbon Revenue Fund (FNRH) to the
budget. They will be monitored on a cash basis (revenue recorded by Treasury). Expenditure
will be monitored on the basis of payment orders, including the interest on domestic debt

53
(paid by the Treasury or automatically debited from the treasury account at the BCM,
including but not limited to discounts on treasury bills held by banks and nonbanks and
interest charges on the consolidated debt of the government vis-à-vis the BCM).
6.
The new limit on medium- and long-term nonconcessional external debt
contracting or guaranteeing by the government, the BCM, and SOEs (excluding SNIM) is
defined as the foreign currency debt, with maturities of one year or longer, contracted or
guaranteed by the government or the BCM with a grant element (defined as 1 minus the
NPV-to-face value ratio, and estimated on the basis of the currency and maturity specific
discount rates reported by the OECD (commercial interest reference rates) of less than
35 percent. This definition applies not only to debt as defined in point No. 9 of the
Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt (IMF Executive Board
Decision No. 12274-(00/85) August 24, 2000; see Annex) but also to commitments
contracted or guaranteed for which value has not been received. The national industrial and
mining company (SNIM) is excluded from the ceiling on medium- and long-term
nonconcessional external debt because the firm does not pose fiscal risks and can borrow
without government guarantee.
7.
The short-term nonconcessional debt is defined as the stock of foreign currency
debt, with original maturity of less than one year, contracted or guaranteed by the
government or the BCM. This definition applies to debt as defined in point No. 9 of the
Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt (Decision No. 12274(00/85) August 24, 2000; see Annex). This definition excludes foreign currency deposits with
the BCM. It also excludes normal import-related credits.
8.
External payments arrears are defined as overdue payments (principal or interest)
on the external debt contracted or guaranteed by the government or the BCM after the
expiration of the applicable grace period.
9.
Treasury float (outstanding payments at the Treasury) is defined as the
outstanding stock of payment orders registered at the Treasury and not yet executed by the
Treasury. Once the RACHAD payment module is implemented, the float will be defined as
the payment orders validated by the RACHAD payment module and not yet executed by the
Treasury.
10.
Poverty reduction expenditures will be estimated on the basis of the public
expenditure functional classification based on the recommendations of the January 2006
technical assistance mission report of the IMF Fiscal Affairs Department (“Les réformes en
cours de la gestion budgétaire et financière,” March 2006). This estimate will only take into
account domestically-financed expenditures.

54
B. Structural Benchmarks
11.

Structural benchmarks for the 2010 tranche of the program are:



Issue by end-December 2010, while surveys are underway, new identification numbers to
new taxpayers in Nouakchott and Nouadhibou. This benchmark aims at building a
centralized taxpayers database and provide each taxpayer with a single identification
number. Observance of this benchmark will require transmission to IMF staff by endDecember 2010 the database including all taxpayers and their single identification
number.



Adopt by end-March 2010 the ministerial decision establishing the Technical Monitoring
Committee (TMC) in charge of monitoring the program. A copy of this decision should
be sent to the IMF by end-March 2010.



Establish by end-December 2010 a rolling three-month cash management plan.
Transmission to IMF staff of the cash management plan and the minutes of the meetings
of the committee to coordinate budgetary and monetary policies.



BCM should publish on its website audited financial statements together with audit
opinions for the years ended





December 31, 2007 (by end-March 2010)



December 31, 2008 (by end-March 2010)



December 31, 2009 (by end-June 2010)

Conduct annual financial audits of the BCM, and twice a year audits of its NIR and NDA
data.
II. PROGRAM ADJUSTORS

12.
NIR and NDA targets are derived based on the projected amounts of the FNRH
contribution to the budget and of the net international assistance. The latter is defined as
the difference between (a) the sum of cumulative disbursements of official loans and grants
(budget support; excluding HIPC assistance and project-related loans and grants) in foreign
currency and of the impact of any additional debt relief obtained after June 30, 2006; and
(b) the toil amount of external cash debt service payments (including interest on foreign
liabilities of the BCM).
13.
In case net international assistance or the contribution of the FNRH to the
budget falls short of the amounts projected in Table 1, the floor for NIR will be adjusted
downward and the ceiling on NDA will be adjusted upward by an amount equivalent to the

55
difference between the actual levels and the projected levels. In the case of the NDA ceiling,
this amount will be converted into ouguiya at the program exchange rates. The cumulative
downward adjustments to NIR will be limited to US$35 million. The cumulative upward
adjustments to NDA will be limited to the ouguiya equivalent of US$35 million at program
exchange rates. In case the contribution of the FNRH to the budget exceeds the amounts
projected in Table 1, the floor for NIR will be adjusted upward and the ceiling on NDA will
be adjusted downward by an amount equivalent to the difference between the actual levels
and the projected levels.
14.
The floor on the basic non-oil deficit will be adjusted upward--that is, the maximum
deficit will be increased for any higher than programmed disbursement of budgetary grants.
III. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

To allow for the monitoring of economic developments and program performance,
the Mauritanian authorities will provide the IMF with the following specific information.

IV. CENTRAL GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS TABLE
18.
The Treasury will prepare a monthly budget execution report in the format of a
Central Government Operations Table (TOFE). In preparing this table, the following
definitions shall be used:


Grants are defined as a sum of: foreign project grants (grants used in the execution of the
foreign-financed investment projects included in the central government and the EPA
parts of the consolidated investment budget and (parties BE et BA)); and foreign program
grants for budget support including the multilateral HIPC debt relief on the government
external debt budget and HIPC debt relief on the external debt of BCM and SNIM
(including the part of the AFD/BFD debt relief on Cologne terms).



Domestic bank financing of the government deficit is defined as a change in the net
credit to the government from the banking system, defined as claims on the government
minus deposits of the government with the banking system (including the HIPC account
but excluding the deposits of public establishments and other administrative units (EPA)
with the BCM).



Domestic nonbank financing of the government deficit is defined as a net change in
holdings of Treasury bills by nonbanks.



Domestic arrears are defined as a net change in the Treasury float and in the stock of
domestic claims (beyond a period of three months) on government acknowledged by the
Ministry of Finance (including but not limited to accumulated payment arrears to public

58
enterprises (utilities), international organizations, procurement contracts, and court
orders).


External financing is defined as the sum of: the net outflows from (i.e., the opposite of
the change in the balance of the FNRH’s offshore account); net disbursements of foreign
loans; and exceptional financing. The latter comprises (a) the accumulation of technical
arrears and passive debts as defined in Paragraph 8; and (b) debt relief obtained on
external government debt net of the HIPC assistance that is treated as grants.

ANNEX: DEFINITION OF DEBT SET FORTH IN NO. 9 OF THE GUIDELINES
The definition of debt set forth in No. 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with
Respect to Foreign Debt reads as follows:
(a) For the purpose of this guideline, the term “debt” will be understood to mean a current,
i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual arrangement through the provision
of value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor
to make one or more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at some
future point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities
incurred under the contract. Debt can take a number of forms, the primary ones being as
follows: (i) loans, i.e., advances on money to the obligor by the lender made on the basis of
an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits, bonds,
debentures, commercial loans, and buyers’ creditors) and temporary exchanges of assets that
are equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which the obligor is required to repay the
funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future
(such as repurchase agreements and official swap arrangements); (ii) suppliers’ credits, i.e.,
contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer payments until sometime after the
date on which the goods are delivered or services are provided; and (iii) leases, i.e.,
arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee has the right to use for one
or more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter than the total expected service life
of the property, while the lesser retains the title top the property. For the purpose of the
guideline, the debt is the present value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease payments
expected to be made during the period of the agreement excluding those payments that cover
the operation, repair or maintenance of the property.
(b) Under the definition of debt set out in point 9(a) above, arrears, penalties, and judicially
awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual obligation
that constitutes debt. Failure to make payments on an obligation that is not considered debt
under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt.

Decision point—point at which the IMF and the World Bank determine whether a country
qualifies for assistance under the HIPC Initiative and decide on the amount of assistance to
be committed.
Interim assistance—amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision and
completion points, up to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the assistance
committed at the decision point (or 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in exceptional
circumstances).
Completion point—point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its assistance
committed at the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of interest income
as defined in the footnote above. The timing of the completion point is linked to the
implementation of pre-agreed key structural reforms (i.e., floating completion point).

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms at the
completion point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in NPV terms at the
decision point. Hence these two amounts cannot be added.

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point corresponding to
interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed during the interim
period.

Safeguards Assessments

6.
An update safeguards assessment of the Banque Centrale de Mauritanie (BCM) was
completed on April 17, 2007. The assessment identified serious vulnerabilities in the central
bank's safeguards framework and concluded that with the exception of appointing an
international audit firm, the central bank had made little progress in strengthening the
framework since the 2004 assessment. In particular, critical vulnerabilities were found in the
areas of financial reporting (including reporting of monetary data to the Fund), and controls.
A number of recommendations were made to address these vulnerabilities, including with
respect to audits of reserves and quarterly monetary program data, the preparation of
financial statements on the basis of International Financial Reporting Standards, and
measures to improve controls in reserves management. Measures have been taken in some
areas. Recommendations related to monetary program data remain relevant in the context of
possible future programs. An update safeguards assessment of the BCM is underway and
should be completed by the time of the first review. The 2010 safeguards mission found that
recent economic and political challenges exacted a toll on the safeguards framework of the
bank and significant risks continue to exist. Action is needed on several fronts including to
restore independent governance oversight and timely publication of the audited financial
statements, along with new procedures to ensure the integrity of data reported to the Fund.
The permanent cessation of the cash operations of the BCM foreign offices is also a
safeguards priority. The previous safeguards assessment of the BCM was completed on April
16, 2007.

4

The Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member countries
that are qualified for the assistance. The debt relief covers the full stock of debt owed to the Fund as of
end-2004, which remains outstanding at the time the member qualifies for such debt relief. The MDRI is
financed by bilateral contributions and the Fund's own resources, as well as the resources already disbursed to
the member under the HIPC Initiative (see Section VII above).

5

Exchange Rate Arrangement

The currency of Mauritania is the ouguiya (UM). In August 2002, the BCM issued two
circulars: the first sets limits on, and regulates, the handling of foreign bank notes and the
second imposes a variant of a surrender requirement where 70 percent of fishing export
receipts should be repatriated via the BCM. In July 2005, this surrender requirement was
reduced to 60 percent. In July 2006, the surrender requirement was cancelled for small-scale
pelagic fish exports and in October 2006, it was further reduced to 25 percent for exports of
the public trading company SMCP. The BCM eliminated in October 2006 foreign exchange
rationing, which constitutes a restriction on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions under Article VIII, section 2 (a). From October 2005 to January
2007, the ouguiya was de facto pegged to the U.S. dollar, at an exchange rate of UM 268.6
per dollar. The BCM launched a foreign exchange auction market in late January 2007. By
end-2008, in response to a weakening external position triggered by the global economic
slowdown, the central bank moved away from the auction system and rationed foreign
exchange. In December 2009, the central bank lifted all restrictions on current account
transactions and restored the auction system. Mauritania’s de facto exchange rate continues
to be classified as a managed float with no pre-announced path.

Last Article IV Consultation

Discussions for the 2008 Article IV consultation were held in Nouakchott during March 920, 2008. The Country Report No. 08/231 was considered by the Executive Board on May
19, 2008.

FSAP Participation, ROSCs and Offshore Financial Center (OFC) Assessments

A joint Fund/Bank FSSA, based primarily on work undertaken during two visits to
Mauritania in February 2005 and February–March 2006 as part of the Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP), was presented to the Executive Board in April. Its main
findings are that:


The financial sector, while not exhibiting any sign of distress, does not support
economic development and presents significant challenges.



Banks are vulnerable and inefficient; they primarily serve their affiliated economic
groups.



Nonbank financial intermediaries are underdeveloped; microfinance is emerging,
with institutions depending on subsidies.



Financial sector regulation still needs some additional improvement and enforcement,
in spite of recent progress, is still weak.

6


The financial sector infrastructure needs to be modernized—including the legal and
judicial framework, accounting and auditing practices, and the payment system.

Some recommendations have already been implemented, including: upgrading the financial
sector legal framework and gradually increasing competition in the banking sector by
encouraging entry of reputable international banks.
The fiscal transparency module of the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes
(ROSC) was based on two missions, conducted from May 14–24, 2002, and from
August 6–13, 2002, respectively. The final fiscal ROSC report is published on the IMF

ANNEX III. ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA—STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
As of January 30, 2010
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Most affected areas are:
national accounts, balance of payments, and external debt statistics. Since 2005, STA and AFRITAC West have been
assisting the authorities with the macroeconomic statistics.
National accounts: Substantial work is still required to implement the statistical methodologies of the 1993 System of Natio
Accounts (1993 SNA) and rebase constant price estimates to 1998. The National Statistical Office (ONS) has finalized estima
1998–2001 and produced provisional estimates for 2002–05. The ONS has completed the 2006 estimates and is working on
2008. AFRITAC West is providing technical assistance.
Price statistics: The current edition of the consumer price index (CPI), developed with the assistance of AFRISTAT has bee
published since May 2004. Geographical coverage of the CPI is limited to Nouakchott, the capital. The authorities intend to
a new CPI that will reflect recent consumption trends.
Government finance statistics: has benefited from recent efforts to increase the comprehensiveness of the data through
the adoption of systematic compilation practices. With ongoing methodological improvements, the authorities should
publish monthly statements of treasury accounts.
Monetary statistics: BCM monetary statistics are in line with the statistical methodologies of the Monetary and
Financial Statistics Manual and data dissemination recommendations of the GDDS. More specifically, BCM developed
and implemented bridge tables from source data for monetary statistics to the new Standardized Report Form (SRFs) for
reporting monetary statistics to STA. In parallel, BCM pursued the implementation of the recommendations of the various
IMF safeguards assessment missions. BCM posts monetary statistics on its official website (the most recent data refers to
December 2007). With recent methodological improvements, the BCM is now expected to submit monetary data to STA
monthly by using the SRFs 1SR, 2SR, and 5SR beginning with end-January 2010 data onwards and to progressively
compile SRFs back to December 2001.
Balance of payments: Balance of payments statistics are affected by significant shortcomings, as many components are
routinely based on estimates and there are no systematic efforts to collect data on certain types of transfers, foreign direct
investment, or tourism receipts. In addition non mining exports, services, and short-term capital flows are not well
measured as under-reporting of external transactions by commercial banks is problematic. No balance of payments
statistics are reported to STA. TA from AFRICA West could help address some of the short comings.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Participant in the General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS). Metadata need to be upgraded.

No data ROSC is available.

III. Reporting to STA (Optional)
Mauritania does not report of government finance statistics to STA.
Monetary data using SRFs 1SR, 2SR, and 5SR are not currently reported.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND AND
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA
Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund
and the International Development Association
Approved by Alan MacArthur and Dhaneshwar Ghura (IMF)
and Carlos Primo Braga and Sudhir Shetty (World Bank)
February 26, 2010
The updated joint IMF-World Bank low-income country debt sustainability analysis (LIC
DSA) shows that, despite the several shocks that affected the country, including the global
economic slowdown, Mauritania remains at a moderate risk of debt distress.1 Under the
baseline scenario, all debt burden indicators remain below their policy-dependent indicative
thresholds, except for a minor and non protracted breach of threshold for the present value
(PV) of debt-to-GDP ratio. Public debt indicators remain on declining paths. Stress tests
suggest that Mauritania is particularly vulnerable to export shocks, thus highlighting the
need to pursue a prudent macroeconomic policy and a cautious borrowing strategy, improve
debt management, and diversify the economy.
I. BACKGROUND
1.
This report updates the DSA prepared in 2008. This analysis is based on the longterm macroeconomic framework presented in the 2009 Article IV discussions report. The
assessment remains broadly similar to the 2008 DSA, despite the fact that public and external
balances are weaker than previously projected and that medium-term prospects are not as

1

The external and the public sector LIC DSAs presented in this document are based on the common standard
LIC DSA framework. See “Debt Sustainability in Low-Income Countries: Proposal for an Operational
Framework and Policy Implications” (http://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/sustain/2004/020304.htm and
IDA/SECM2004/0035, 2/3/04) and “Debt Sustainability in Low-Income Countries: Further Considerations on
an Operational Framework, Policy Implications” (http://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/sustain/2004/091004.htm
and IDA/SECM2004/0629, 9/10/04) and “Applying the Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income
Countries Post Debt Relief,” http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2006/110606.pdf and IDA/SecM20060564, 8/11/06).

2
favorable. In the long run, the forecast remains broadly the same and as a result Mauritania
remains at a moderate risk of debt distress.
2.
HIPC debt relief and MDRI assistance contributed to firm up the country’s debt
sustainability. Mauritania reached its completion point under the HIPC Initiative in 2002
and received MDRI assistance in 2006. Debt relief agreements with most creditors have been
finalized, but agreements have yet to be reached on arrears owed to two non-Paris club
creditors (Libya and Kuwait). These arrears amounted to about US$1.2 billion at end-2009
(nearly half of Mauritania’s outstanding stock of external nominal debt), of which about
US$1 billion (83 percent) is owed to Kuwait.
Figure 1. Evolution and Composition of External Debt

HIPC/MDR

3.
As of end-2008, total external debt amounted to US$2.8 billion, or 88.5 percent of
GDP. Gross public and publicly-guaranteed (PPG) external debt2 was about 81 percent of
GDP, compared with a projection of about 50 percent in the previous DSA. The difference is
mainly explained by the non-clearance of arrears accumulated vis-à-vis the aforementioned
two non-Paris Club creditors. Excluding those arrears, the public external debt ratio remained
broadly unchanged (Figure 2). Key creditors are the World Bank Group’s IDA, Saudi Arabia,
and Kuwait. Preliminary data indicate that public external debt to GDP ratio increased to
about 93 percent at end-2009 due mainly to the decline in GDP. At end-2008, net total public
debt (gross external and domestic debt net of oil fund reserves) amounted to roughly 89
percent of GDP.

2

This includes central government and state-owned enterprises (excluding SNIM).

(i) the differences in the estimates of the PPG external debt as percentage
of GDP in 2008 between the DSA 2008 and DSA 2010
and (ii) the change in PPG external debt between 2009 and 2008

II. UNDERLYING DSA ASSUMPTIONS
4.
Since the last DSA, oil output and exports were significantly revised downward,
in line with output trends in 2008 and 2009. Oil production3 is expected to reach annually
10.2 million barrels over the period 2009-29 (compared with 13.9 million barrels in the 2008
DSA). The current projections are conservative considering the intense exploration program
underway that could boost prospects for additional oil and gas reserves.

3

The exhaustion of reserves is beyond the projected horizon.

4
5.
The medium-term outlook is affected by recent external shocks. Mauritania was
hard hit by the fuel and food crisis nearly two years ago and the subsequent global recession
in 2008-09, mainly through the decline in the prices of and the demand for Mauritania’s main
export commodities (iron, copper, and fish). The consequences of these external shocks have
been exacerbated by a domestic political crisis triggered by the military coup in August 2008
and the unexpected significant drop in oil production. These multiple shocks have taken a toll
on the economy and its growth prospects. Therefore, in the medium term, economic activity,
exports, and the fiscal and external positions are weaker than previously projected.
6.
Long-run macroeconomic indicators remain, however, broadly unchanged. The
economy is expected to return to high and sustained non-oil GDP growth, supported by
ongoing large investments projects, including a major project to expand capacity of the
national iron ore company (estimated at US$1.1 billion).4 Thus, the external position is
expected to strengthen gradually. On the fiscal side, the non-oil deficit will increase,
reflecting social and infrastructure needs, but it will be fully financed by increasing oil
revenue. Average annual inflation would stay at around 5 percent during the projection
period.
7.
Outstanding arrears to Kuwait and Libya are assumed to be rescheduled in 2010
and 2011. The authorities indicated that the technical groundwork was completed but final
negotiations were interrupted by the August 2008 military coup. The July 2009 presidential
election enabled Mauritania’s return to constitutional order, and the new authorities are
stepping up their efforts to reengage rapidly with the two creditors. They expect to finalize
bilateral agreements in the coming months. Therefore, consistently with LIC DSA guidelines
for post-completion point countries, we assume debt relief by Kuwait and Libya in line with
the debt reduction required under HIPC.5

4

The project includes 4 components: (a) expanding capacity; (b) building a new mineral seaport;
(c) modernizing the railway connection from the mine to the seaport; and (d) building a maintenance base. The
financing is provided by several financial institutions, including the African Development Bank, the European
Investment Bank, the French Development Agency (AFD), and the Islamic Development Bank. This project
will help expand iron ore production. Lack of detailed information does not allow to fully incorporate the
impact on growth of other major ongoing and upcoming identified projects.

Box 1. Baseline Macroeconomic Assumptions
Real GDP growth: Real GDP growth is projected to be sustained at 5.3 percent per year on average over
2010-14, supported by strong activity in the non-oil sector, which is expected to be driven by a significant
investment program covering water production and distribution, a large port, and a major project
(estimated at US$1.1 billion) to expand capacity of the national iron ore company. Upon completion of
these projects, we expect growth to stabilize at about 4.5 percent per year over 2015-29. Near-term risks
include volatility in the commodity market, notably a large drop in iron ore and copper prices and a
prolonged shortfall in power supply. On the upside, accelerated structural reforms to improve the business
environment and higher return on ongoing investment could spur growth.
Inflation: Continued prudent monetary and fiscal policies will keep inflation in the low single digits, at
around 5 percent.
Current account balance: The current account deficit is expected to peak at about 16.5 percent of GDP
in 2011, mainly driven by the increase in imports associated with the implementation of three major
projects in the mining, transportation, and water sectors. The external position would strengthen gradually
after 2012, with exports remaining at about 45 percent of GDP through 2022 (and then declining to about
40 percent in 2029) and imports falling steadily to 41 percent by 2029. Net foreign direct investment is
expected to decline gradually from about 8 percent of GDP in 2008 to 2.3 percent in 2029.

Government balances: The framework assumes the following: (a) non-oil revenue remains stable at
about 24 percent of non-oil GDP throughout the period; (b) grants are expected to stabilize at 1 percent in
the long-run; and (c) oil revenue will peak at 4 percent of GDP in 2022 before declining steadily to
3.1 percent of GDP in 2029. The government’s non-oil deficit including grants is projected to improve
gradually from 9 percent to about 3.6 percent of non-oil GDP between 2008 and 2029. The projected
primary balance improves from a deficit of 3.2 percent of GDP in 2009 to a surplus of 0.9 percent of GDP
in 2029.
External financing: The framework assumes that the authorities will be successful in eliciting additional
aid resources equivalent to the levels pledged at the December 2007 consultative group meeting. For this
purpose, the government intends to organize in 2010 a follow-up meeting on these pledges. The baseline
scenario assumes that Mauritania will borrow essentially on concessional terms. It is expected that new
borrowing will gradually shift away from concessional financing. Average grant element on new
borrowing will decline to about 18 percent in 2029.
Domestic debt, mainly treasury bills held by the banking sector, stood at 8 percent of GDP at end- 2008.
It is projected to stay around 9 percent until 2029.
Real interest rates. The real interest rate of the short-term domestic debt approaches 5 percent.

III. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
8.
The analysis shows that Mauritania’s external debt is at a moderate risk of debt
distress.6 The analysis was conducted under the debt sustainability framework for lowincome countries (LICs). Mauritania ranks as a “medium performer,” according to the World
Bank CPIA rating.7 Therefore, the indicative, policy-related debt burden thresholds used for
the analysis are those applying to medium performers. The debt-burden thresholds for
countries in this category are: (a) the PV of the debt-to-exports of goods and services of
150 percent; (b) PV of the debt-to-GDP of 40 percent; and (c) PV of the debt-to-fiscal
revenues of 250 percent. The relevant debt service ratios are: (a) 20 percent of exports of
goods and services; and (b) 30 percent of fiscal revenues.
Baseline
9.
All debt burden indicators remain below their policy-dependent indicative
thresholds, except for a marginal and non protracted breach of threshold for the
present value (PV) of debt-to-GDP ratio. PV of debt-to-exports and PV of debt-to-revenue
ratios remain well below their indicative, policy-dependent thresholds throughout the period
(Figure 1). Furthermore, the ratios decline continuously, and are estimated to be about
40 percent below their thresholds during the last ten years of the projections. However, the
PV of debt-to-GDP ratio would only decline below its threshold from 2016. The deterioration
of the country’s debt indicators in the medium term relative to the previous DSA is
attributable mainly to the (i) new loan contracted by the national mining company to expand
its production and export capacity; (ii) lower projected oil output; and (iii) the decline in the
discount rate from 5 to 4 percent. Debt service ratios reflecting liquidity risks would stay
below the indicative thresholds.
Alternative scenario and stress tests
10.
Under the two alternative scenarios, all external debt burden indicators—but
the PV of debt-to-GDP—remain below their thresholds. In the historical scenario (key
macroeconomic indicators evolve in line with the record of the past ten years), as well as in a
scenario of less favorable lending conditions (new borrowing at 2 percentage points higher
interest rates than in the baseline), PV of debt-to-exports and PV of debt-to-revenue ratios
6

According to the LIC DSA guidelines, the existence of arrears could suggest that a country is in debt distress,
unless there are other reasons than debt-service burden for not servicing its debt. Despite having substantial
arrears to external creditors, Mauritania is not assessed as being in debt distress because its arrears are related to
debts that were previously categorized as “passive”.

7

In the LIC DSA framework, the quality of a country’s policies and institutions is measured by the World
Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index, and classified into three categories: strong,
medium and poor. The average CPIA rating for Mauritania over 2006-08 is 3.33, above the 3.25 threshold (see
http://siteresources.worldbank.org/IDA/Resources/tablesCPR.pdf).

7
remain below their thresholds. The historical scenario, based on a continued relatively high
level of FDI (12 percent of GDP), shows a more optimistic debt ratio trajectory in
comparison with the baseline. However, maintaining FDI at 12 percent of GDP in the long
term is unlikely to occur.
11.
The bound tests highlight the country’s vulnerability to external shocks, in
particular, to lower export value growth. The most extreme test reflects the one standard
deviation shock to export of goods and services in 2010-11. As a result of this shock, all debt
stock indicators would breach the thresholds before declining to sustainable levels around
2017 for the PV of debt-to-revenue ratio and 2022-23 for the PV of debt to-exports and GDP
ratios.8 The PV of debt-to-exports ratio does not breach its threshold under any other tests,
while the PV of debt-to-revenue ratio breaches the currency depreciation test—a one-time
30 percent depreciation of the exchange rate in 2010—during four years. Also, the debt-toGDP ratio is breached under several other stress tests.
IV. PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
Baseline
12.
Under the baseline assumptions, the PV of net government debt-to-GDP ratio is
projected to decline continuously over the projection period. Total public debt consists
mainly of external PPG debt (90 percent), following then closely the dynamics of its external
component. Net public debt would decline to 27 percent of GDP in 2029, down from
89 percent of GDP in 2008. This decline reflects the authorities’ policy to move to a primary
fiscal surplus starting in 2018 coupled with relatively high and sustained economic growth.
Alternative scenario and stress tests
13.
Stress tests highlight some vulnerability, particularly to exchange rate, to fiscal
slippages, and to long-term growth. The public debt path is susceptible to shocks to the
primary fiscal balance. If the primary deficit remains at about 3½ percent of GDP (as in
2009) the debt ratio would stay at around 60 percent of GDP through 2029. This, of course,
suggests that the 2009 fiscal stance is not sustainable and the need for fiscal consolidation to
put public finances back on a sustainable path. The debt path is also vulnerable to the shock
“permanently lower GDP growth.” Under the latter assumption, the PV of public debt would
reach 52 percent of GDP in 2029, compared with a baseline projection of 24 percent. Public
debt indicators also increase in case of a large depreciation of the exchange rate as shown by
the test one-time 30 percent real depreciation in 2010.
8

The standard test models a decline in export performance by 16 percent in 2010-11. Should the growth of
exports be set at 0 percent during 2010-11, the debt ratios would breach their thresholds only marginally and for
three years.

8
V. CONCLUSION
14.
This LIC DSA, in line with the 2008 DSA, suggests that Mauritania’s risk of
debt distress remains moderate. The PV of debt-to-revenue and PV of debt-to-exports
ratios would remain well below the policy-dependent thresholds throughout the period, while
the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio exhibits a minor breach in the indicative threshold until 2016.
The latter debt trajectory is on a gross basis and does not take into account accumulated
reserves in the oil fund (1.1 percent of GDP in 2016).
15.
The debt dynamics are subject to risks. The country’s vulnerability to exports
shocks highlights the need to pursue a cautious borrowing strategy, improve debt
management, pursue a prudent macroeconomic policy, and diversify the economy. The
authorities need to adopt sustainable macroeconomic policies and proceed cautiously with
new borrowing over the medium to long term. On the upside, hydrocarbon projections are
very conservative despite some indications of additional oil and gas reserves. Moreover, the
ongoing large investments projects are expected to result in an acceleration of growth, which
has not been fully incorporated in the macroeconomic framework.

2/ Ass umes that the interes t rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the bas eline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are as sumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a s hare of GDP is as s umed to return to its bas eline level after the s hock (implicitly
an offs etting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private trans fers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all s tres s s cenarios except for A2 (les s favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as s pecified in footnote 2.

Economic performance deteriorated sharply in 2008-09 on the back of both domestic
and external shocks. The global food and fuel price increases weakened the fiscal and
external positions and pushed up inflation, while domestic political crisis led to a
significant reduction in external assistance. The global economic slowdown contributed
to further fiscal and balance of payments pressures mainly through the decline in the
prices of and the demand for Mauritania’s main export commodity (iron, copper and
fish). Furthermore, the anticipated shift to an oil economy did not materialize, as oil
output continued to fall steadily, lowering the country’s expectations and heightening the
need for more external aid.
Reflecting these multiple shocks, non-oil real GDP growth is estimated at -0.9 percent in
2009, down from 4.1 percent in 2008. Oil output continued to decline and overall GDP
would contract by about1 percent.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

16
Inflation has remained in the low single digits (5 percent in 2009), on account of a
somewhat prudent monetary policy stance and low international fuel and food prices.
Broad money grew at 15.2 percent while private sector credit growth slowed down to
about 4 percent in 2009. With slumping economic activity and a benign inflation outlook,
the monetary authorities reduced the central bank policy rate from 12 to 9 percent in
November 2009 but real interest rates remained positive. The effective exchange rate
depreciated by 3 percent in nominal terms and 2 percent in real terms.
The basic non-oil fiscal deficit increased to 7.7 percent of non-oil GDP in 2008, up from
2.2 percent in 2007. Spending adjustment efforts have not kept pace with declining
revenue and the basic non-oil fiscal deficit, although lower, would still be high in 2009,
reaching 5.3 percent of non-oil GDP.
The current account deficit is estimated at 12.7 percent in 2009, down from 15.7 percent
in 2008, as lower food and fuel prices and the normalization of relations with the
international community have helped cushion the impact of the global economic
slowdown. Gross international reserves reached about US$ 238 million at endDecember 2009, the equivalent of 2.2 months of imports of goods and services.
In the short term, the authorities need to limit the fallout from recent shocks, including
the global economic slowdown and restore growth while ensuring macroeconomic
stability. The peaceful completion of the presidential election has established a strong
basis for resumption of the reform agenda and of the financial support from the
international community. An appropriate macroeconomic policy mix will support the
recovery while containing inflationary pressures. Looking forward, the authorities need
to sustain high and diversified growth in order to boost employment and further reduce
poverty.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors observed that the return of constitutional order to Mauritania has
established a basis for the resumption of the reform agenda and of financial support
from the international community.
Directors noted that Mauritania’s macroeconomic situation weakened in 2008-09 owing
to the global economic downturn and the domestic political crisis. However, the
economy is projected to rebound in 2010 driven by strong activity in the non-oil sector.
Directors stressed that sustaining high economic growth over the long term will require
sound macroeconomic policies and broad-based structural reforms to promote private
sector development and increase the resilience of the economy to external shocks.
Directors considered fiscal consolidation to be a high priority. They agreed that the 2010
budget strikes the right balance between supporting the recovery, increasing social and
infrastructure spending, and restoring fiscal prudence.

17
Directors underscored that medium-term fiscal sustainability will hinge on further
broadening the revenue base, strengthening tax and customs administration, containing
the wage bill, and reducing nonessential recurrent spending, including untargeted
subsidies. They encouraged the authorities to implement decisive measures to improve
expenditure management, restructure the state-owned enterprises, and strengthen the
debt management framework.
Directors supported the gradual easing of monetary policy. They underscored that any
further monetary easing should be undertaken cautiously, and that the authorities
should stand ready to increase the policy rate as signs of inflationary pressures emerge.
Directors stressed that greater exchange rate flexibility will facilitate the adjustment to
external shocks. They welcomed the reestablishment of the foreign exchange auction
system and the authorities’ commitment to a flexible exchange rate. Directors noted
staff’s assessment that the real effective exchange rate is broadly in line with economic
fundamentals and supported the authorities’ intention to limit intervention in the foreign
exchange market to smoothing out excessive volatility.
Directors encouraged the authorities to pursue their multi-pronged banking sector
reform strategy to further strengthen the financial sector, and enhance banking
intermediation. They urged the authorities to reduce the high level of nonperforming
loans. A sound banking system, together with well-sequenced reforms to improve the
business environment and address electricity supply bottlenecks, is important to
promote a broad-based private sector-led growth.
Directors stressed the importance of increased donor support on concessional terms to
address Mauritania’s short-and medium-term financing needs. They welcomed the
authorities’ plans to convene a donors meeting during 2010. Directors encouraged the
authorities to accelerate efforts to conclude bilateral negotiations with the remaining
non-Paris Club creditors on terms comparable with those granted by the Paris Club
creditors.
Directors commended the authorities’ commitment to protect poverty-related spending.
They highlighted the need to expand and strengthen safety nets and social protection. In
this regard, Directors welcomed the authorities’ plan to launch a comprehensive study
on existing social protection schemes.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue improving the quality and timeliness of
data reporting to the Fund.

Press Release No. 10/89
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
March 15, 2010

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Approves US$118.1 Million Three-Year Extended Credit Facility
Arrangement for Mauritania
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved a three-year
arrangement totaling SDR 77.28 million (about US$118.1 million) for the Islamic Republic
of Mauritania under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF).1 The approval makes an amount
equivalent to SDR 11.04 million (about US$16.9 million) immediately available, with the
remainder available in installments subject to semiannual reviews.
The 2010-2013 arrangement, equivalent to 120 percent of Mauritania’s SDR 64.4 million
quota in the Fund, will support the Mauritanian authorities’ economic program. Mauritania’s
economic growth and fiscal position have been weakened by the global fuel and food price
crisis in 2007-08 and subsequent financial crisis and global recession in 2008-09. The effects
of these external shocks were exacerbated by a domestic political crisis that led to a decline
in aid flows, and the unexpected significant drop in oil production.
At the conclusion of the Executive Board’s discussion of Mauritania’s request, Mr. Murilo
Portugal, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, made the following statement:
“Economic performance in Mauritania deteriorated sharply in 2008-09 on the back of both
domestic and external shocks. Real GDP declined and the fiscal position weakened. Inflation has

1

The Extended Credit Facility (ECF) has replaced the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) as the
Fund’s main tool for medium-term financial support to low-income countries by providing a higher level of
access to financing, more concessional terms, enhanced flexibility in program design features, and more
focused streamlined conditionality. Financing under the ECF currently carries a zero interest rate, with a grace
period of 5½ years, and a final maturity of 10 years. The Fund reviews the level of interest rates for all
concessional facilities every two years.

2
remained under control, but the current account deficit is high at 12.7 percent of GDP, and
international reserves only cover about two months of imports.
“The economic program prepared by Mauritania for 2010-12 focuses on addressing these
challenges with policies to support sustained growth and poverty reduction. Fiscal
consolidation will create more space for social and infrastructure spending, while reducing
the vulnerability stemming from a large public debt. Together with a prudent monetary
policy framework, this will help maintain low inflation and rebuild international reserves.
Deepening financial intermediation and enhancing the business environment will support a
broad-based private sector led-growth.
“The 2010 budget targets a deficit of 3.8 percent of non-oil GDP, down from 5.3 percent in
2009, through a combination of revenue and spending measures. The budget appropriately
increases social and infrastructure spending while containing current spending.
“The authorities have decided to allow greater exchange rate flexibility to increase the
effectiveness of monetary policy and facilitate adjustment to external shocks, while
conserving scarce international reserves. Rising fuel and food prices may pose some risks to
the inflation outlook, but the authorities’ monetary program for 2010 aims to be sufficiently
firm to keep the inflation rate close to 5 percent.
“The authorities’ multi-pronged banking sector reform strategy would help strengthen the
financial system and enhance intermediation. Decisive actions to make the business
environment more attractive are also important to promote a broad-based private sector-led
growth.
”Support from the international community will be essential to help Mauritania address its
short and medium-term financing needs and strengthen external sustainability,” Mr. Portugal
stated.
Recent Economic Developments
The global economic downturn and the drop in donor financing following the August 2008
military coup have weakened economic activity in Mauritania, through slower activity in the
mining, fishing, and the construction sectors. Non-oil real GDP growth is estimated at 0.9 percent in 2009, down from 4.1 percent in 2008. Oil output continued to decline in 2009
and total GDP would contract by about 1 percent.
The fiscal position has also deteriorated. The basic non-oil fiscal deficit increased to
7.7 percent of non-oil GDP in 2008, up from 2.2 percent in 2007. Preliminary data suggest
that spending adjustment efforts have not kept pace with declining revenue and the basic
non-oil fiscal deficit, although lower, would still be high in 2009, reaching 5.3 percent of

3
non-oil GDP. Faced with limited resources, the authorities have used the IMF’s recent SDR
allocation to help close the fiscal financing gap.
Lower food and fuel prices and the normalization of donor relations have helped cushion the
impact of the global economic slowdown on the external position. The current account deficit
remains high at an estimated 12.7 percent in 2009, although down from 15.7 percent in 2008.
The resumption of donor financing after the July 2009 election and the disbursement of
financial compensation under the European Union (EU) fishing convention helped maintain
the level of gross international reserves at end-December 2009 at 2.2 months of imports.
Inflation has remained in the low single digits. It fell rapidly to 0.9 percent year-on-year in
September 2009, reflecting lower international fuel and food prices and a somewhat prudent
monetary policy stance. However, international fuel and food prices are rising again, pushing
up inflation to 5 percent year-on-year at end-December 2009. With slumping economic
activity and a benign inflation outlook, the BCM lowered its policy rate from 12 to 9 percent
in November 2009 but real interest rates remained positive. The effective exchange rate
depreciated by 3 percent in nominal terms and 2 percent in real terms.
Program Summary
The authorities’ 2010-2012 economic program aims to sustain high growth and reduce
poverty while safeguarding macroeconomic stability. To achieve these goals, the program
focuses on the following key areas:


Fiscal consolidation to reduce public debt, while creating more fiscal space for social
and infrastructure spending



Further enhancing the monetary policy framework to maintain low inflation and
rebuild reserves to about 3 months of imports



Deepening financial intermediation and enhancing the business environment in
support of a broad-based private sector led-growth



Strengthening social protection and safety nets..

Statement by Laurean W. Rutayisire
Executive Director for the Islamic Republic of Mauritania
I.

Introduction

On behalf of my Mauritanian authorities, I would like to thank Management and Staff for
their continuous support to Mauritania.
Over the past two years, Mauritania has been adversely affected by a series of major shocks
which have contributed to deteriorating significantly the country’s economic outlook. The
global economic crisis hit Mauritania hard through the trade channel i.e., the decline in
external demand for the country’s main export commodities; a shock that was preceded in
2008 by both the rapid increase of the global food prices, and the suspension of financial aid
from development partners following the 2008 political crisis.
With the stabilization of the political situation in July 2009, my authorities have launched an
ambitious reform agenda to revive the economy and address the country’s long-term
development challenges including the need to diversify the economy and increase the
population’s living standards and welfare. There was an urgent need to stabilize the
economy, strengthen public finances and create fiscal space for infrastructure and poverty
reducing expenditure while accelerating the implementation of structural reforms to enhance
the economy’s resilience to shocks.
To better anchor these policies, my authorities are requesting the support of the IMF under a
three-year Extended Credit Facility. They would like to reiterate their firm commitment to
the policies and objectives under the Fund-supported program, notably fiscal consolidation
and a prudent monetary policy within a more flexible exchange rate regime. They are also
committed to improving the country’s competitiveness and business climate while continuing
to promote the development of the private sector.
II.

Recent economic developments and policy measures

In 2009, non-oil real GDP contracted by 0.9 percent compared to +4.1 percent in 2008 while
oil production continued to drop to approximately 10,000 barrels per day. The current
account deficit remained high at almost 13 percent of GDP while the basic non-oil fiscal
deficit dropped slightly to 5.3 percent of GDP in 2009 from 7.7 percent in 2008. Inflation
remained relatively stable at approximately 5 percent in 2009. Foreign exchange reserves
stood at the equivalent of 2.2 months of imports.
In the context of the economic slowdown, the authorities implemented supportive fiscal
policy measures including significant tax rate reductions. The corporate income tax, for
example, was lowered from 40 percent to 25 percent and the tax on wages reduced from 60
to 30 percent. Concomitantly, measures to enhance revenue performance were also taken to
simplify the tax system, expand the tax base, and streamline public expenditure. In this
regard, and consistent with previous IMF recommendations, the authorities set up both a
large and a medium-sized enterprise units responsible for tax collection while tax centers for
small enterprises were upgraded.

2
On the monetary policy front, the central bank lowered its lead rate from 12 to 9 percent in
November 2009, as the economy stagnated and inflation declined. While continuing to
address the effects of the economic slowdown, the authorities also pursued a number of
important reforms including the adoption of a new charter giving greater independence to the
central bank, and the establishment of the legal framework for new policy instruments
(central bank bonds, CDs, and commercial paper).
In response to the deterioration of Mauritania’s external position in the midst of the global
economic crisis, temporary exchange restriction measures were introduced by the central
bank at end-2008 and the foreign exchange auction mechanism was interrupted. However,
normal operation of the foreign exchange market was restored on December 14, 2009 and the
exchange system is now free of restrictions.
III.

Medium-term objectives under the program

The medium-term objectives under the program are: a return to a sustained growth rate of 5
percent; keep inflation low and stable at about 5 percent; accumulate reserves equivalent to 3
months of imports by end-2012; bring down the basic non-oil fiscal deficit to about 1 percent
by 2012.
1.

Fiscal policy

To lower the basic non-oil deficit to about 1 percent by 2012, the authorities have launched
important measures both of the revenue side, and on the expenditure side and are committed
to offset any shortfall in revenue by cuts in lower priority spending to achieve the fiscal
deficit target. In view of the substantial needs of the country, they intend to step up their
efforts to mobilize additional grants in support of high priority spending.
In the 2010 budget law, the basic non-oil deficit will be limited to 3.8 percent of non-oil
GDP. Measures to expand the tax base and modernize and strengthen tax and customs
administrations will be implemented. In view of harmonizing the VAT system with that of
neighboring countries, in particular those of the WAEMU, the VAT on petroleum products
and telecommunication will be increased from 14 to 18 percent.
On the expenditure side, the civil service reform under way with the assistance of the World
Bank and other development partners comprises the completion of the census of civil
servants, reconciliation of the payroll file with the civil service roster to eliminate unjustified
paid salaries, and the computerization and automation of the payroll. This reform will
contribute to a reduction of the wage bill by 1.7 percent of non-oil GDP between 2009 and
2012 and lowering the share of the wage bill to 8.8 percent of non-oil GDP in 2010 compared
to 10.1 percent in 2009. An assessment of operational staffing needs by ministry will also be
conducted. Furthermore, all benefits in kind granted to government employees will be
terminated and replaced by cash allowances.
To lower transfers and subsidies to public enterprises which for the most part are in financial
distress and rely heavily on budgetary transfers to continue operating, an assessment of the
governance of public enterprises will be carried out with the assistance of development

3
partners, and performance contracts will be signed with the ultimate view of restoring
balanced financial positions and reducing subsidies.
Public investment efforts will be pursued consistent with the priorities of the PRSP, including
access by the poor to basic services and promotion of employment. The emphasis will be put
on building infrastructure that has a high impact on poverty reduction. In this regard, a large
share of capital expenditure will be allocated for restructuring poor neighborhoods of large
cities, improving living conditions including access to drinking water, and supporting
employment initiatives. An agency tasked with project monitoring and research has just been
set up, and the authorities intend to adopt a new government procurement code to improve
the quality of public investment.
2.

Monetary, exchange rate, and financial sector policies

The monetary authorities remain committed to a prudent monetary policy with the objective
of keeping inflation in check in the context of greater exchange rate flexibility. Following the
November loosening of monetary policy, the central bank stands ready to further tightening
monetary policy if inflationary pressures emerge as credit to the private sector is projected to
grow. Reforms under way to modernize and adapt monetary policy instruments while
strengthening central bank operational independence will also be pursued.
Following the lifting of all restrictions introduced on current account transactions payments
in 2008, the authorities remain committed to implementing a more flexible exchange rate
regime to help absorb external shocks. Interventions by the central bank will be limited to
smoothing excessive daily fluctuations.
As regards financial sector reform, various measures were introduced in line with recent
FSAP recommendations, including new laws relating to the charter of the central bank,
banking activity, and microfinance. Additional reforms will focus on strengthening the legal
and regulatory framework, increasing transparency of accounting practices and the reliability
of financial statements, building the capacity of the various financial institution supervisory
authorities, and implementing AML/CFT regulations. The authorities will also study various
options to eliminate the large stock of outstanding nonperforming loans held by the banks.
3.

External sector and debt

The current account deficit is projected to decline to 11.9 percent of GDP in 2010 from 15.7
percent in 2008 subject to a favorable development in prices for Mauritania’s main export
commodities and an improvement in the global economic outlook. The deficit will be
financed mainly through an increase in FDI in the oil and mining sector and the mobilization
of additional external funding.
As regards Mauritania’s external borrowing policy the government will work closely with
its development partners to implement a debt management strategy that would ensure access

4
to external financing while preserving external debt sustainability. They agree with the
findings of the recent debt sustainability analysis conducted with the World Bank indicating
that Mauritania remains at moderate risk of debt distress. Efforts will continue to be made to
mobilize financing mainly on concessional terms. However, some strategic projects that
could require financing on non-concessional terms will be brought to the attention of the IMF
and the World Bank for review.
4.

Structural reforms

The authorities will continue their efforts to improve the business climate and to remove
obstacles to private sector development notably the limited availability and skills of the
workforce and weak infrastructure services in electricity, transport, and telecommunications.
Measures under consideration include setting-up a legal framework to facilitate the
acquisition and enforcement of collateral on property, and strengthening the capacity of the
judicial system. The authorities will also revise the investment code in 2010 drawing on
experience of other countries so as to consolidate the safeguards granted to investors.
With the support of development partners Mauritania will finalize a master plan for the
electricity sector which is in a very fragile state due to insufficient production capacity and
significant operating losses. The plan will include a restructuring program for national
electricity company and will clarify the relationship between the electricity company and the
government.
With the support of UNICEF Mauritania has recently launched a study on social protection
that will review the social safety nets currently in place, assess priority needs, and issue
recommendations to guide the action of the government and its partners in preparing a
national social welfare strategy for Mauritania for the 2010-12 period.
The government is also currently working on the adoption of a national anti-corruption
strategy. An initial report and three-year action plan have just been prepared and have been
forwarded to our development partners. During 2010, this policy will be submitted to all
stakeholders for validation and implementation.

Conclusion

My authorities are aware of the daunting challenges ahead but they are also firmly
determined to move ahead with their ambitious reform agenda and achieving the objectives
under the program. However, reaching these objectives is subject not only to the
implementation of sound macroeconomic policies and the continuation of structural reforms
but also to the resumption of financial and technical assistance from Mauritania’s
development partners. They are confident that the IMF and other partners will continue to
support the authorities’ efforts to reach their economic and social objectives.
