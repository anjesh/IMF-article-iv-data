EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

After many years of rapid growth, the economy slowed in 2006. Production of oil
and its derivatives declined, while other sectors remained buoyant. Inflationary
pressures persisted, and the real exchange rate continued to appreciate. Favorable
external conditions generated large balance of payments and fiscal surpluses. Banking
system prudential indicators improved.

•

An economic recovery in 2007 will be accompanied by continued inflationary
pressures and strong balance of payments and fiscal surpluses. New
hydrocarbons production will spur GDP growth, and continued high budgetary
spending and wage increases will intensify inflationary pressures.

•

Based on current policies and relative stability in oil prices, medium-term
prospects are positive. Economic developments will largely mirror changes in oil
and derivatives production, with strong but diminishing growth, and moderation in
inflationary pressures and the balance of payments and fiscal surpluses. Restraint in
the growth of public spending will lead to a consolidation of the non-oil primary
deficit, a key fiscal indicator.

•

The National Development Plan (NDP), now being formulated, will guide
government policies. The government’s strategy will have two main prongs: (i) a
fiscal policy that aims at improvement in the non-oil primary balance, and thereby
helps contain inflationary pressures and real exchange rate appreciation, and
improves long-run fiscal sustainability; and (ii) structural reforms to raise
productivity and enhance external competitiveness. The economy’s diversification
into hydrocarbon derivatives bolsters longer-term growth and fiscal sustainability.
However, reforms to stimulate growth elsewhere are necessary to generate jobs and
reduce poverty. The country now has adequate resources to hasten progress toward
the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

•

Improving the quality of public spending and strengthening non-oil revenues
remain critical challenges. A Social Needs Fund, whose projects are expected to get
underway in mid-2007, will address important priorities in health, education and
water. Current expenditures need to increase to support a growing public capital stock
and the implementation of social programs. Public financial management reform must
address serious weaknesses and is essential to improving the use of public resources.
Strengthening tax and customs administration also remain key priorities.

•

Many important challenges remain in improving governance and transparency.
The new hydrocarbons law has raised investor concerns. The Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative (EITI) has stalled. Access to business credit is still limited.
The weak statistical base hinders macroeconomic policy making. The authorities are
engaged in negotiations with CEMAC partners on reforms of regional institutions and
have premised remittance of overseas deposits to satisfactory resolution of these
issues.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Equatorial Guinea has recorded one of Africa’s fastest growth rates over the
past decade, as its petroleum industry has expanded and diversified into oil derivatives.
Oil production is currently the third largest in sub-Saharan Africa. Oil and its derivatives now
account for around 85 percent of GDP and 95 percent of fiscal revenues, and virtually all
exports. Strong oil revenues have allowed the accumulation of sizable foreign assets, and
significant scaling up of infrastructure spending that is addressing many critical priorities, but
also raising absorptive and administrative capacity concerns. Equatorial Guinea’s strategy to
diversify into downstream activities will strengthen its longer-term economic and fiscal
sustainability.
2.
Economic reforms will be guided by a NDP with a 2020 horizon, which is
underpinned by a macro-fiscal framework that takes account of hydrocarbon resource
exhaustibility. Fiscal policies are targeting a slight reduction in the non-oil deficit in 2007
and a more substantial one over time. The authorities continue to negotiate with CEMAC1
partners on reforms to the Bank of Central African States (BEAC) and have premised
remittance of overseas deposits to satisfactory resolution of these issues. Equatorial Guinea
has adequate resources to alleviate poverty and achieve the MDGs, though weak public
financial management and limited access to education and health care have so far impeded
progress.

Macroeconomic performance was
mixed in 2006. After rapid economic
development in recent years, real GDP declined
by about 5 percent, on account of a drop in oil and
methanol production (Tables 1 and 2, Figure 1,
and Text Table on Effects of Hydrocarbon
Derivatives Reclassification). The economy
continued to diversify into hydrocarbon
derivatives, while strong growth in construction,
utilities, and finance and housing was driven by a
large increase in public capital spending.

Equatorial Guinea: Effects of Reclassifying Hydrocarbon Derivatives from the Oil Sector to the Non-oil Sector
Staff reclassified oil derivatives from oil GDP to non-oil GDP, in accordance with national income accounting conventions, and refined
measures of other components of non-oil GDP. The table below shows previous and revised measures for 2006 and 2011(projected).

The average rate of inflation in 2006 was 4.5 percent. Strong domestic demand
exerted upward pressure on prices, though a temporary tightening of monetary conditions
and improved availability of food at year end helped contain inflation (Figure 2). The real
effective exchange rate (REER) continued to rise, reflecting the appreciation of the euro
against the U.S. dollar and inflation above that in major trade partners (Figure 3). The
appreciation of the REER recently is to a large extent driven by an adjustment to its
equilibrium value, consistent with strengthening fundamentals.2

Since 2000, real per capita GDP has grown at a dramatically higher rate than in main trading partners and the
average price of exports relative to imports has risen by 83 percent. Applying the coefficients of the model of
the equilibrium REER in the CEMAC countries, in IMF Working Paper, WP/06/236, to Equatoguinean data
(with a country-specific intercept) shows that, in recent years, the REER in Equatorial Guinea has been below
its estimated equilibrium values.

5.
High oil prices led to a strong balance of payments. The overall balance of
payments surplus exceeded US$700 million, driven by continued inflows of foreign direct
investment and improvement in the terms of trade (Table 3, and Figures 4 and 5). The current
account moved into surplus, reflecting strong inflows of hydrocarbons revenues partially
offset by high oil and public sector imports, and investment income outflows.3 Gross official
foreign assets rose to about 24 months of non-oil related imports of goods and services.
Traditional wood, cocoa, and coffee exports contributed minimally to exports.

Fiscal performance in 2006 also benefited from the high oil prices. The overall
fiscal surplus rose to 23 percent of GDP, reflecting stronger oil revenues, partially offset by a
sizeable rise in capital spending (Tables 4a, b, and c, and Figure 6). With the revised
estimates of non-oil GDP and revenues, the non-oil primary deficit remained at about
64 percent of non-oil GDP. While significantly lower than previous estimates, the gap with a
sustainable fiscal position over the long term remains sizeable. Deposits at the BEAC
reached US$3.1 billion and deposits in foreign commercial banks reached US$2.1 billion, at
end-2006.

3

In past years, the flows of government deposits to banks abroad were implicitly included in outflows in the
current account. Staff have taken explicit account of government deposits abroad in the financial account, which
implied a level improvement in the current account and corresponding weakening in the financial account. See
Appendix I for description of adjustments to the balance of payments data and implications for the debt
sustainability analysis.

8
7.
The 2006 execution of the Public Investment Program (PIP), a three-year rolling
plan for capital spending, considerably exceeded its budget. This overexecution reflected
unbudgeted purchases of shares of hydrocarbon sector projects and spending on physical
infrastructure, including improvements to roads, and air and port facilities (Box 1). A number
of social projects also took shape, including the renovation of schools, the national
university, and health facilities, and the construction of the country’s first modern hospital.
But capital spending for education, health, and water and sewerage amounted to only a small
share of PIP spending.

Public financial management and transparency remain weak. Capacity building
in spending control and analysis of the quality of public spending are critical to achieve
budget priorities. Transparency and accountability are particularly weak, and the fiscal data
need improvement, especially on the financing side. Although Equatorial Guinea was one of
the earliest countries to publicly commit to the EITI, there has been relatively little progress
toward compliance.

10
9.
In the absence of an active sterilization policy by the regional central bank,
monetary conditions in 2006 continued to be shaped by fiscal and balance of payments
developments. A shift of government deposits from the commercial banks to the BEAC in
December 2006 brought down the 12-month growth rate of reserve money to 5.4 percent and
broad money (M2) to 14.1 percent, while private credit expansion picked up at year end
(Tables 5a and b). M2 velocity relative to non-oil GDP (excluding oil derivatives) has
stabilized in recent years (Figure 7).

10.
The financial system remains underdeveloped but appears generally sound.
Financial soundness indicators show an improvement in bank asset quality and capital
adequacy in 2006 (at the expense of banks’ profitability), following a deterioration in the
previous year (Table 6). Risks stemming from bank’s noncompliance with large exposure
limits persist, with two of the three established banks remaining in noncompliance at end2006. Currently most bank lending is short term, mostly in the form of deposit overdrafts.
Bank lending rates, near the ceiling of 15 percent, result in high real interest rates, which
limits the capacity of small- and medium-sized businesses to borrow. Moreover, most
deposits earn no interest and access to savings accounts is limited by high minimum balance
requirements. On the positive side, two banks are about to launch ATM services, and the new
commercial bank, the National Bank of Equatorial Guinea (BANGE), which started

11
operations in 2006,4 has introduced a branch-to-branch money transfer service that does not
require opening of a deposit at the bank.
11.
A new hydrocarbons law was enacted in 2006, intended in part to raise the
government’s share in oil revenues. International oil companies were not consulted prior to
enactment of the law, and are seeking clarifications of important aspects of the law and clear
implementing regulations. A number of provisions are controversial, including a transitory
provision that gives the Minister of Mines the right to require the renegotiation of existing
production contracts to adapt them to the new law.5 Oil sector participants have also
indicated that local content and employment provisions in this law and other decrees of
government could be difficult to fulfill, given the limited size of the private sector and a lack
of skills in the domestic labor force. The government is seeking a creditable international
auditor for private sector hydrocarbons activities, while the national oil and gas companies
would remain under fiscal audit controls.
III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
12.
The discussions focused on the medium-term macroeconomic outlook and the
building blocks of the NDP, with broad consensus on both the outlook and that
appropriate fiscal and structural policies need to be at the NDP’s core. To ensure longrun fiscal sustainability, fiscal policies should be derived in the context of a rolling mediumterm framework that targets a reduction in the non-oil primary fiscal deficit. To facilitate
poverty reduction, a sustained strong pace of non-oil growth will hinge on improving
competitiveness and creating a good climate for investment through: (i) high quality public
spending, (ii) an emphasis on human capital development, (iii) a satisfactory resolution of
outstanding issues regarding the new oil and gas law, and (iv) continued liberalization of
goods and labor markets. Greater fiscal, financial, and data transparency and governance
improvements will be essential.
A. Medium-Term Outlook
13.
The medium-term macroeconomic outlook is positive. Growth is expected to
recover to roughly 10 percent in 2007 (Table 7). A modest increase in oil production will be
accompanied by a significant increase in liquefied natural gas (LNG), as a new facility comes
online. Continued high public capital spending and private investment will support
construction and rising incomes will lead to the expansion of retail trade. Thereafter, growth
will be dominated by hydrocarbon sector developments. Absent new discoveries, oil and gas
development will slow. But the growth of derivatives will provide some continuing

5

12
momentum.6 Growth will remain strong in service areas of the economy, but diversified
export growth will falter without significant improvements in productivity.
14.
Inflationary pressures will remain. Inflation is projected to rise to 6.1 percent,
in 2007, reflecting the continued strong growth of public capital spending, a 30 percent
increase in civil service base wages, and an increase in private sector wage norms. A slowly
tightening fiscal stance and continued strength of the euro would imply some medium-term
reduction of inflation but continued real exchange rate appreciation.
15.
The strong balance of payments will lead to continued rapid accumulation of
foreign assets. The external current account surplus will narrow in 2007 and the medium
term, reflecting a moderate drop-off in oil prices and rapid rise in consumer imports
(Table 8). Foreign direct investments will remain robust albeit declining, led by investments
in oil exploration and hydrocarbons derivative activities.
16.
Equatorial Guinea has a minimal debt service burden. Recently, it resolved a
number of minor outstanding arrears. In late 2006, the government agreed to a framework
with China for a credit line of up to US$2 billion, on which it is not expected to draw
immediately (Table 9).
17.
There are a number of significant risks to this positive outlook. Weaknesses in the
business environment and governance (Box 2), if left unaddressed, could jeopardize
successful development by discouraging foreign investment and hindering sound economic
policy formulation. A prolonged and deep weakness in oil prices also poses a threat, though
the high stock of international reserves and low government debt should buffer against
shocks. Moreover, without significant improvements in public expenditure control and
project appraisal, there is a risk that capital spending will not have a high return.
B. Designing Fiscal Policies for Stability and Sustainability
18.
There was consensus that fiscal policy, within the NDP, should be guided by
reduction in the non-oil primary fiscal deficit over time to improve competitiveness and
longer-term sustainability. The authorities indicated that they would benchmark public
expenditures according to a measure of permanent income from oil and gas revenue over
time and the ongoing evolution of non-oil revenues. Total expenditure would decline in the
medium term as a share of GDP without a significant strengthening of non-oil revenues.
Indeed, if spending in 2007 and the medium term were set according to staff projections for
permanent income, the non-oil primary deficit should be no higher than 44 percent of non-oil
GDP in 2007 and improve to 23 percent in 2011 (Text Table on Medium-Term Fiscal
6

At current rates of exploitation, primary oil and gas resources are expected to last until around 2035, while the
capability to produce oil and gas derivatives will be significantly strengthened with realization of recent
agreements to import natural gas from Nigeria and Cameroon.

This analysis assumes that the remuneration of reserve assets is satisfactorily resolved (see Box 4), allowing for a real return of 3 percent over
the long term. Higher returns will encourage greater saving through the substitution effect, but may discourage saving through the income effect.

Hydrocarbons revenue projections are based on the baseline scenario assumptions for government take and WEO based oil price.
Non-oil revenue grows at a rate slower than nominal non-oil GDP but considers administrative improvements over the medium term.

3

Expenditure is equal to the permanent income derived from hydrocarbons revenue plus non-oil revenue (excluding interest earned).
Some alternative rules are explored in Helmut Franken, 2006 (IMF Country Report No. 06/237, pages 60–76.)

4

The baseline scenario projections for government expenditures consider a growing current expenditure and a stable
capital expenditure (in terms of GDP).

19. The fiscal outcome in 2007 is expected to remain strong. The overall surplus is
expected to be a little weaker than in the budget and last year’s execution, but the non-oil
primary deficit is expected to improve slightly (Tables 10a, b, and c). However, the non-oil
primary deficit falls clearly outside of the one suggested by the permanent income
benchmark, mainly owing to an overly ambitious public investment program. The
authorities defended the level of capital spending, given the huge infrastructure needs of the
country, but indicated that, unlike recent years, spending would adhere to budgetary
allocations.
20.
Staff’s medium-term fiscal projection shows a declining non-oil primary deficit,
although by 2011, it would still be, at 46 percent of non-oil GDP, twice as high as the
level implied by the permanent income benchmark. This projection is based on the
critical assumption of adherence to budget ceilings and a leveling off of the growth in
capital spending relative to GDP after 2007, in accordance with the fiscal policies expected
to be embodied in the NDP. Although current spending remains modest, staff expect it
would gradually rise, reflecting the need for higher public sector staffing levels and for
goods and services related to the expanding public capital stock and the achievement of
Social Needs Fund goals. The hydrocarbons revenue share is expected to contract, as a
result of the diminished importance of primary oil extraction, from which the government
extracts a sizeable resource rent, and some modest decline in real oil prices. The non-oil
revenue share is projected to grow at a slower rate than non-oil GDP.
21.
The composition of public expenditures raises several concerns. There is a high
concentration on capital spending compared to current spending, and within capital spending,

15
on infrastructure spending. The authorities recognized that current spending has to provide
for the operational needs of the growing public infrastructure and for capital stock
maintenance. In their view, social needs are being accorded sufficient priority in the budget.
Nonetheless, they expressed interest in conducting a World Bank-led public expenditure
review, and considered it timely to re-evaluate the general structure of the social safety net
and to reformulate and improve monitoring of the subsidy to the monopoly gasoline retailer.
22.
The government also expects to begin implementing critical projects identified
under the Social Needs Fund in the areas of education, health, water and sanitation,
gender, and local government, to be executed by relevant line ministries. The
mechanism, established last year by the government, through a memorandum of
understanding with USAID, would allocate priority spending in these areas of about
US$72 million (0.8 percent of GDP) in 2007, for which a rough allocation exists in the
budget. An important element is to develop the capacity of the responsible ministries to
administer and evaluate these projects. The mission urged the authorities to complete the
governance structure of the Social Needs Fund, which had delayed its activation in 2006 and
early 2007. The achievement of these priorities would hasten progress toward meeting the
MDGs.
23.
The authorities agreed that public financial management reform efforts should
be invigorated. An overlapping mission of the Fiscal Affairs Department identified
continuing serious weaknesses in this area, and priorities, which include: (i) introducing a
functional classification of expenditures in the budget and using a medium-term budget
ceiling for ministries; (ii) elaborating monthly forecasts of revenues and expenditures and a
cash plan; (iii) assessing budget execution on a commitment basis; and (iv) improving
information flows with autonomous agencies to move toward a general government budget.
24.
Improving fiscal transparency remains an important priority. The authorities
indicated their continued commitment to establish the national EITI framework. In the
meantime, staff advised the authorities to enhance transparency by taking a number of
priority steps, which can be done along with the EITI (Box 3).
25.
The authorities concurred on the need to improve non-oil revenues. They pointed
to tax and customs administration reforms, including reinforcement of tax police,
improvements in customs infrastructure, and a value-added tax information campaign. The
proposal to raise alcohol taxes is aimed at discouraging excessive consumption.
26.
The authorities have repeatedly expressed concerns that the government’s
deposits at the BEAC, where Equatorial Guinea’s fiscal surpluses are meant to be
placed, do not receive a sufficiently high remuneration. The authorities indicated that they
would remit these deposits upon satisfactory resolution of CEMAC institutional reforms that
would enable an increase in the remuneration of BEAC deposits and share governance more

Box 3. Measures to Improve Fiscal Transparency
•

Establish the national EITI framework and appoint an aggregator to compile, reconcile,
and oversee the revenue data.

•

Commit to regular external audits of the national oil and gas companies by a credible
international auditor and publish the results.

•

Publish new contracts with oil and gas investors (or key provisions), in accordance
with emerging international best practice.

•

Publish detailed information on the oil sector, including daily production and price
statistics, on government websites.

•

Build a wider data dissemination template and calendar, covering execution of all
government revenues and expenditures, as well as its financial assets and liabilities, in
fully reconciled form.

•

Establish a clear calendar and channels for the dissemination of the budget law and
budget execution law to the public.

equally among member countries (Box 4). In particular, they emphasized that in order to
replace revenues from hydrocarbon resources with investment income in a fiscally
sustainable way, these investments would need to receive a higher real return. Staff
welcomed the authorities’ intention to continue working with CEMAC partners to resolve
outstanding differences on BEAC reforms and remit funds held abroad.
27.
The authorities concurred on the need for caution in borrowing, especially at
rates of interest higher than currently received on reserves, and to reflect any
borrowing transparently in the fiscal accounts and balance of payments. The authorities
indicated that they do not have any immediate plans to draw upon the China credit line,
which staff noted could be difficult to reconcile with the large expected fiscal surplus. Any
borrowing under this line would require a separate agreement, laying out the specific
purposes and terms. The government has also expressed interest in purchasing shares of
equity in oil and gas assets. Staff urged the authorities to be cautious in undertaking any
large-scale borrowing for such purposes. A debt sustainability analysis shows that Equatorial
Guinea’s economy is robust to typical shocks (Appendix).
C. Strengthening Growth Prospects and Improving the Business Climate
28.
The authorities emphasized that sustained growth depends on the further
development of the hydrocarbons sector and ancillary activities. The authorities

Box 4. Equatorial Guinea: Investment of Foreign Assets
All CEMAC members have an obligation to pool their foreign assets at the BEAC, which
invests them mostly in an operations account with the French Treasury. In 2006, the
government placed roughly two-thirds of its fiscal surplus in commercial banks abroad, some
in actively managed accounts and some in conventional deposit accounts. Despite this,
Equatorial Guinea has contributed more than a third of the regional central bank’s end-2006
gross official reserves.

Inflation in Equatorial Guinea exceeded the interest rate on BEAC deposits, about 2 percent on
average in 2006, resulting in a negative real rate of return of about 2½ percent, which may
discourage saving. Most of the deposits abroad were held in U.S. dollars, with the largest
deposit earning a return of about 4½ percent. However, the depreciation of the dollar against
the euro reduced the return in CFA francs on those deposits to about –6 percent. Some of the
other terms of BEAC deposits that are perceived as unattractive are a remuneration rate that is
lower than the short-term rate in the euro area, and other restrictions on when new deposits can
be placed in the different funds and on withdrawal of deposits without penalty.

expressed confidence that the new oil and gas law provided a solid legal basis for oil sector
activities. However, staff noted that improving governance and transparency are key to
building investor confidence, and highlighted the importance of addressing the concerns of
oil sector investors regarding the need for expeditious reconciliation of the fiscal, local
content, and other terms of the law with existing production contracts and for clear
implementing regulations.
29.
Staff and the authorities agreed that it is essential to reduce inflationary
pressures and limit real exchange rate appreciation. The authorities were not concerned
about high money supply growth because they saw the high import component of
consumption and investment as easing supply constraints. However, they noted that high
inflation was leading to continued real exchange rate appreciation, in the context of the

18
pegged nominal exchange rate, and that this would undermine competitiveness and
consequently efforts to diversify the economy—a key objective of their NDP.
30.
The authorities pointed to measures that have already been undertaken to raise
productivity and to address a deterioration in competitiveness. They highlighted the
importance of an improved transport infrastructure in reducing business costs, and of
vocational training to enable local workers to fill key roles in the oil and construction sectors.
The removal of export taxes on timber and cocoa should also boost profitability in these
industries. The authorities were supportive of CEMAC initiatives to reduce the common
external tariff but were cautious on liberalizing the labor market. Staff encouraged the
authorities to speed up the phasing out of the import surcharges.
31.
Job growth for low-skilled labor will require diversification outside the
hydrocarbons sector. The authorities support a development strategy for the non-oil
economy, based on agriculture, aquiculture, and fishing, construction and utilities, financial
services, and tourism. Staff noted that revitalization of agriculture and fishing holds promise.
However, a lack of skilled personnel and high costs may limit prospects in financial services
and tourism. A number of programs already exist to support farmers and small businesses,
but the authorities indicated a need to improve the effectiveness of these programs. They
emphasized the importance of expanding access to training, which could be supported by the
international community.
32.
There was consensus that the financial sector should play a stronger role in
supporting private sector development. The authorities indicated the importance they
attach to creating a more competitive atmosphere with expanded access for small- and
medium-sized businesses. They expressed interest in participating expeditiously in a national
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), to complement the findings of the 2006
CEMAC FSAP. Staff and authorities agreed that BANGE should operate on strictly
commercial terms, a view shared by BANGE’s management. Staff emphasized the
importance of the National Agency for Financial Investigation to begin operations in the area
of anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) quickly.
D. Statistical Issues
33.
Equatorial Guinea’s statistical apparatus remains weak. The lack of timely,
accurate, and comprehensive macroeconomic data hampers the monitoring of developments
and policy formulation. The authorities need to create the national statistical institute with
robust collection and analysis capabilities. Staff have laid out a methodology for improving
estimates of non-oil GDP, which should be institutionalized. However, there remain critical
deficiencies in the national accounts, price, and labor market statistics, and in indicators of
poverty to measure progress toward the MDGs (Table 11). The results of the recently
completed household survey should be used to inform anti-poverty policies.

19
34.
Two other high priorities are to improve balance of payments and fiscal
statistics. The balance of payments is still largely constructed on a historical basis from
estimates rather than actual financial and customs records, including information on the
hydrocarbons sector that is already available to some parts of the government. The fiscal
execution should encompass the financing items, including flows to offshore accounts, and in
fully reconciled form with the monetary accounts. A functional disaggregation of
government current and capital spending is critical. Equatorial Guinea should strive to
participate in the General Data Dissemination System.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
Equatorial Guinea’s macroeconomic performance in the recent period has
generally been strong. After a temporary respite, real GDP growth is expected to regain
vigor and high oil prices will maintain a strong external and fiscal position. Medium-term
macroeconomic prospects are favorable, given the outlook for world oil and hydrocarbon
derivatives prices. But inflation and real exchange rate appreciation remain key concerns.
36.
The authorities’ NDP is expected to lay out a solid foundation for guiding the
economy. It will focus on two key components: a fiscal policy guided by a gradual reduction
of the non-oil primary deficit to improve competitiveness and longer-term sustainability and
structural measures to support competitiveness, economic diversification, and job creation.
37.
An urgent priority is to ensure that the Social Needs Fund programs are
implemented and that an emphasis is placed on human resource development. Progress
in alleviating poverty and meeting the MDGs has been slow.
38.
Improvements in fiscal management and transparency are needed to ensure high
quality public spending and strengthen non-oil revenues. The high concentration on
capital spending on infrastructure, and the lack of progress on public financial management
reforms and the EITI remain key concerns. Improving tax and customs administration will
require sustained attention.
39.
The authorities’ commitment to remitting offshore assets to the common central
bank and to working with CEMAC partners to revise the investment strategy for
central bank reserves is welcome. A two-pronged strategy of reducing domestic inflation
and revising the investment strategy for central bank reserves will be required to raise the
real return on investments.
40.
The pegged exchange rate regime has served Equatorial Guinea well. While some
real appreciation has been consistent with fundamentals, it will be important to safeguard
competitiveness going forward. To offset the steadily appreciating real exchange rate, the
authorities need to ensure that public spending leads to high quality infrastructure and
improved human resources and that goods, services, and labor markets are opened further to
competition.

20
41.
Private sector development would benefit from further strengthening of
governance and the legal and regulatory environment. The authorities should move
forward quickly to ensure that the new hydrocarbons law does not have a negative impact on
investors, and that this law and new tax laws are clear and transparent in their
implementation.
42.
Efforts to strengthen the role of the financial system in private sector
development should be properly sequenced and integrated into the NDP. To this end, the
authorities are encouraged to participate expeditiously in a national FSAP, to complement the
findings of the 2006 CEMAC FSAP. It is also important for the National Agency for
Financial Investigation to begin operations in the AML/CFT area as soon as possible.
43.
While the data provided by Equatorial Guinea are broadly adequate for
surveillance, the statistical apparatus remains weak. The lack of timely, accurate, and
comprehensive macro- and socio-economic data hampers economic analysis. The authorities
should establish a National Statistical Institute and ensure that it has a robust capacity to
collect and analyze data.
44.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

Current year profits are excluded from the definition of regulatory capital, following the Basel I
capital accord guidelines. General provisions are included in Tier 2 capital up to an amount equal to
1.25% of risk-weighted assets. Regulatory capital is the sum of Tier 1 capital, and the minimum of Tier 1 and
Tier 2 capital.
2
The risk-weighted assets are estimated using the following risk weights: 0% - cash reserves in domestic and
foreign currency and claims on the central bank; 100% - all other assets.

Related to the crash of the banking system during the early eighties.
4
Equal to the overall balance excluding grants minus hydrocarbons sector corporate income tax and non tax revenue plus hydrocarbons revenue
generated in the secondary LNG, LPG and methanol production and purchase of share in hydrocarbons projects, minus interest on saving funds plus
interest expenditure (please see detailed hydrocarbons revenues in Table 8c).

APPENDIX
EQUATORIAL GUINEA⎯EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
1.
Assuming no new borrowing, the external debt of Equatorial Guinea is expected
to decline from around 2 percent of GDP in 2006 to less than 1 percent by 2012
(Appendix Table 1). The external debt burden could increase substantially (to 17 percent of
GDP in 2012), if the authorities decide to activate a recently negotiated credit line from
China.7 8
2.
Equatorial Guinea’s external debt is sustainable. A debt sustainability analysis
(DSA)— using the middle income country template—demonstrates that the country’s
external debt would remain below the CEMAC convergence criteria of 70 percent of GDP
under all stress-test scenarios (Appendix Figure 8).
3.
In stress-test scenarios, all shocks are calibrated over the period 2002-2006. The
shorter calibration period is chosen over the standard ten-year one, because in the late 1990s
the Equatoguinean economy experienced extraordinary volatility related to the development
of newly discovered oil fields, which is unlikely to recur in the future.
4.
Staff revised historic balance of payments data, which led to an improvement of
the current account and gross financing needs. In the 2007 Article IV Consultation it was
established that in the official balance of payments data, the outflows of government deposits
to banks abroad had been implicitly subsumed in current account outflows. Staff revised the
historical data to explicitly account for government deposits abroad, which implied a level
improvement in the current account and corresponding weakening in the financial account.
5.
The explosive path of the external debt to GDP ratio under the current account
stress-test results from the standardized assumption that Equatorial Guinea would
continue to accumulate reserves at the same pace as in the baseline scenario, if faced
with a severe negative external shock.9 This assumption is too stringent, as in reality any
widening of the current account deficit relative to GDP is likely to result in a one-on-one

7

In 2006, Equatorial Guinea and China signed a framework agreement that could eventually result in China
lending up to US$2 billion to Equatorial Guinea. The framework contains a list of investment projects, which if
awarded to Chinese companies and if the Treasury is unable to meet its obligations on the contracts, will be
financed from the credit line. At present, there is no outstanding credit⎯any drawings in the future would
require separate agreements, within the overall framework, laying out the specific purposes and terms of the
credit.
8
During the 2007 Article IV consultations, the authorities insisted that there are no immediate plans to draw
upon the China credit line, given the hefty foreign assets of the government. Based on this statement, the
mission team did not include any drawings from the China credit line in the external debt forecasts.
9
In the DSA in last year's Article IV staff report, the shock on the current account was calibrated as a temporary
one (that is, it was applied to the 2006 current account balance only) rather than as the standardized permanent
one, which explains the different conclusions drawn from the current account stress test in the two analyses.

38
decrease of the ratio of accumulated foreign assets to GDP10 This issue does not typically
arise in other DSAs, because the ratio of accumulated foreign assets to GDP in most
countries is small.

Shaded areas represent actual data. Individual shocks are permanent one-half standard deviation shocks,
calibrated over a five-year period (2002–06). Figures in the boxes represent average projections for the
respective variables in the baseline and scenario being presented. Five-year historical average for the variable is
also shown.
2
In the 2007 Article IV Consultation, staff revised the historic BOP data to explicitly account for government
deposits abroad, which implied a level improvement in the current account and corresponding weakening in the
financial account.
3
It is assumed that Equatorial Guinea draws US$1 billion from the China credit line in 2007 and the same
amount in 2008. On both instances, the interest rate is assumed to be 3.5 percent, the repayment period—30
years, and that the debt is serviced semi-annually with constant payments over the life of each loan.
4
Permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and current account
balance.
5
One-time real depreciation of 30 percent occurs in 2008.

10

The DSA template assumes that the evolution of the ratio of external debt to GDP reflects changes in the debt
service as a share of GDP (with a positive impact), and the current account to GDP ratio, the ratio of net foreign
direct investment to GDP and the ratio of accumulated foreign assets to GDP (all with a negative impact). The
last category is a residual equal to the difference between the predicted evolution of the external debt to GDP
ratio, given by changes in the other variables, and its actual realizations. In Equatorial Guinea, this residual is
sizeable, reflecting government's savings of oil revenues and the big permanent transfers of assets from
international oil companies to their local affiliates.

Exchange Rate Arrangement and Safeguard Assessments
The Bank of the Central African States (BEAC) is the regional central bank of the
Central African States, of which Equatorial Guinea is a member. The safeguards
assessment completed on August 30, 2004 found that the BEAC has implemented a
number of measures to strengthen its safeguards framework since an earlier 2001
safeguards assessment, but further progress needs to be made in key areas. The main
recommendations of the 2004 assessment were reported in IMF Country Report No. 05/3.
Equatorial Guinea’s currency, the CFA franc, is pegged to the euro at the fixed exchange
rate of CFAF 655.957 per euro.
Equatorial Guinea maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions.
Article IV Consultations
Equatorial Guinea is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle.
The last Article IV consultation with Equatorial Guinea was concluded by the Executive
Board on May 10, 2006 (IMF Country Report No. 06/233).
Technical Assistance
FAD provided an 18-month technical assistance during 1992–94 to reorganize the tax
department and personnel training.
FAD conducted a review of PEM and tax administration systems in 1997.
FAD conducted a diagnostic mission on key deficiencies and training needs in public
finance in May 2003.
FAD conducted a diagnostic mission on modernization of public expenditure
management processes and steps for reforming the system in July 2005.
STA evaluated the collection of monetary statistics and proposed steps to adopt the
methodology of the 2000 Manual on Monetary and Financial Statistics in
December 2002.
STA conducted a diagnostic mission on real sector statistics in July 2005.
STA conducted a diagnostic mission on government finance statistics in January 2006.
STA conducted a follow-up mission in real sector statistics in January 2006.

APPENDIX II.
EQUATORIAL GUINEA—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(as of April, 2007)
The discovery of large oil reserves caused Equatorial Guinea to graduate to IBRD status
(based on a GNP per capita of $1,170 in 1999), which has meant that concessional IDA
assistance is no longer available. At the request of the authorities, a World Bank mission
to examine Equatorial Guinea’s participation in the Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative (EITI) coincided with a Fund fiscal ROSC mission in January 2005.
Subsequently, the World Bank proposed a services agreement to finance various
activities, including (i) strengthening the management of the petroleum sector and
associated revenues; and (ii) preparing a poverty reduction strategy, although a final
agreement was finally not reached for none of the activities.
The World Bank Group has not approved any new lending operations for Equatorial
Guinea since mid-1992.
IMF—World Bank collaboration
Overall, the IMF and World Bank staffs have maintained a collaborative relationship in
coordinating their activities and policy advice to the authorities, in particular around the
shared interests on EITI implementation, introduction of high standards of governance in
the hydrocarbons sector, and the emergence of a coherent national development plan.
World Bank activities
The Bank financed a statistical capacity-building project designed to support the drafting
and implementation of a long-term development program of the national statistical
system. The grant (US$397,000) was signed in February 2002 and closed in
December 2005. The first phase of the project (US$108,000; Bank-executed) succeeded
in preparing the NSDS (National Statistical Development Strategy). The second phase of
the project ($289,000; recipient-executed) provided technical assistance to improve the
national accounts, including procurement of hardware and software to support the
system.
At the request of the authorities, a mission from FIAS—a joint facility of the World Bank
and International Finance Corporation—visited Equatorial Guinea in April 2001 in order
to survey the investment climate in the country. The FIAS report identified a series of
obstacles to private investment in the oil and non-oil sectors (particularly foreign direct
investment). In view of these obstacles, the report recommended various actions aimed at
improving and simplifying the legal framework (laws and institutions) to create an
investment-friendly environment.

6
In 2005, the Bank proposed to the Government a technical assistance project in the
petroleum and energy sectors, that includes: (a) a study of the institutional set up to
define the role and responsibilities of the Ministry of Mines, Industry and Energy and the
state oil company, GEPetrol; (b) a review of existing petroleum sector laws and
regulations, including environmentals and regulations; (c) sector capacity building, and
design and implementation of training programs; (d) the development of an Oil Revenue
Diagnostic Model that integrates upstream and midstream activities by generating
forecasts of future sector revenues under different assumptions regarding costs, prices
and the pace of development; (e) the formulation of the national hydrocarbon and energy
policy that optimizes the links between the two sectors; and (f) the formulation of
resource revenue management policy, including relevant institutional arrangements.
However, this project could not move forward because no services agreement was signed.
At this time, government priorities have changed and technical assistance from the Bank
has been requested with respect to the implementation of EITI. In particular, the
government has expressed the interest in receiving the support of a technical advisor to
help the EITI National Secretariat to move forward implementation actions. The Bank
would facilitate the application for funds under the EITI Trust Fund.
A World Bank mission visited the government of Equatorial Guinea in late March-early
April 2007. This mission overlapped with the IMF Article IV mission and participated in
the workshop to kick-off the National Development Strategy. The mission reached
preliminary agreement with the authorities on a new Services Agreement to prepare a
Public Expenditure Review in 2007-2008. Possible areas for further joint work include
analyzing the National Development Strategy after it has been revised and defining
specific areas for Bank support, as well as a diagnosis of the problems of the current
statistical system (with focus on National Income Accounts).
Finally, Bank assistance has been discussed in (a) the design and implementation of the
reporting framework and institutional arrangements necessary to implement the EITI;
(b) related governance and anti-corruption policies; and (c) assistance in the petroleum
and energy sectors. Further discussions took place in the November 2006 and
March 2007 missions, where it was agreed that the Bank will continue to discuss with the
authorities how to enhance collaboration on these issues.

APPENDIX III.
EQUATORIAL GUINEA—STATISTICAL ISSUES
The economic and financial statistics remain very weak, which hampers the
monitoring of developments and policy formulation. The deficiencies in quality, timing,
and coverage in most macroeconomic data are related to insufficient administrative and
technical capacity. Technical assistance has resulted in some progress but there is still a
need to consolidate these gains including through participation in the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS) and the establishment of the National Institute of Statistics
(NIS). The BEAC regularly reports monetary, interest rate, and exchange rate statistics for
publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS), but their timeliness needs
improvement.
Real sector and prices
National accounts and price data suffer from weaknesses that are compounded by
poor centralization of information from the island and continental regions. National
accounts are compiled at current and constant prices, but often contain significant
inconsistencies. The compilation of the official consumer price index (CPI) has benefited
from French technical assistance, but both the weights and composition of the basket of
goods and services are outdated, and the geographical coverage is not comprehensive.
STA missions visited Malabo in July 2005, January 2006, and March 2007. The 2005
mission reviewed the methods and data sources used to compile both the national accounts
and the CPI, and assessed the adequacy of statistical legislation and the resources devoted
to the statistical function, and made recommendations for improvement. The 2006 mission
reviewed the work for implementing the recommendations of the July 2005 mission, and
delivered a short seminar on national accounts. The mission found that little progress had
been made, mainly due to persistent management problems and severe human and
computing resource constraints.
The 2007 mission found that some progress had been made in implementing previous
missions’ recommendations. The pilot of the Agricultural Production Survey (APS)
2005–06 is being conducted with the support of the UN Food and Agriculture
Organization, and a Quick Household Survey (QHS), with national coverage, was
conducted between December 2006 and February 2007 in a sample of 5,240 households.
The APS will be useful for revising the coverage of production and value-added for
agriculture. Even though the QHS did not collect data on revenues and the collected
expenditure data reflect seasonality, the results of the QHS, if adjusted, would be valuable
to update the basket and weights of the CPI (currently, corresponding to 1986) and
compile poverty and other social indicators.

9
The mission provided hands-on assistance to prepare a business register/sample
frame and a database on employment and compensation of employees, basic source
data for improving the coverage of the national accounts. Also, the mission revised
estimates on oil and non-oil gross domestic product (GDP) for the period 2000–06 with
2000 as base year, and reclassified manufacturing of oil and gas derivatives in the non-oil
sector following the UN International Standard Industrial Classification of all Economic
Activities (ISIC,) Rev. 3. According to ISIC, the division 11 of Mining and Quarrying
includes the extraction of crude petroleum and natural gas, owing to their extractive nature
and the exhaustibility of the output. On the other hand, production of LNG, LPG, and
methanol are classified in manufacturing, a division of the secondary sector. The mission
explained the methodology of the revised series to the authorities and the General
Directorate of Statistics and National Accounts (GDSNA) staff and left a methodological
note describing the results for 2006, suggesting institutional implementation of the revised
approach.
The collection of prices for the CPI was discontinued in June 2005 because of
budgetary reasons, and reestablished in February 2006. Apparently, priority had been
given to the International Comparison Program (ICP) exercise. The GDSNA revised the
official figures for the period July 2005–January 2006 by using the data from the ICP,
which include a limited subset of prices, and carrying the last reported price for the CPI
forward. The 2007 mission observed that some relative prices for February 2006 were
atypical and recommended revising price imputations for the period July 2005–January
2006 by using the price change of similar products, the price change of the related
group/class of products, or its historical trend.
As regards the institutional framework, the statistical legislation is quite recent
(2001) and is, in general, adequate to regulate the statistical system. However, the
decree to create the National Institute of Statistics (NIS) has not been passed. In addition,
the resources devoted to the statistical function are insufficient as only one person is
assigned to the national accounts unit and three to the CPI unit. GDP estimates are
prepared by the BEAC, rather than by the GDSNA. The Minister of Finance and Planning
informed the mission of his commitment to improving statistics and requested assistance to
establish the NIS and train the staff. The assistance will be provided by Central AFRITAC.
The World Bank is also preparing a service agreement with Equatorial Guinea to provide
technical assistance for compiling poverty indicators.
Real sector statistics reported to STA (IFS) are limited to GDP (without breakdown
by sector or expenditure category), exports, and imports. The February 2007 issue of
IFS includes data for GDP through 2005 and exports and imports through 2005. Export
and import data are provided to AFR. Priorities for the period ahead include
implementation of the System of National Accounts, 1993, updating the reference period of
the national accounts (1985), and updating the CPI’s basket and weights without delay.

10
Fiscal accounts
Following technical assistance from France, there have been some improvements in
fiscal accounting. Further improvements are needed, particularly in procuring timely and
accurate data from the Debt-Service Unit (Caja Autónoma de la Deuda Pública). Equatorial
Guinea does not report fiscal data to STA for publication in International Financial Statistics
and the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. However, the authorities provide budget
execution data to AFR although full information on the conciliation with the monetary
accounts is still lacking. An STA mission in early 2006 reviewed government finance
statistics and found that coverage remains incomplete, there is no functional classification of
expenditure, which is critical, and dissemination practices need improvement. The fiscal data
are not subject to any internal process of verification as internal and external audit capability
remains weak.
Monetary accounts
The timeliness of monetary statistics has improved recently although delays in
production and submission by BEAC headquarters to STA for publication in IFS still
occur occasionally. The April 2007 issue of IFS includes data for the central bank and other
depository corporations through December 2006.
Accuracy of monetary data may be hampered by large cross-border movements of
currency among CEMAC member countries. Equatorial Guinea is affected by such
movements: 59.3 percent of banknotes issued in Equatorial Guinea by the BEAC national
directorate circulate in Cameroon, 7.7 percent in Gabon, and 7.1 percent in the three other
countries of the CEMAC; only 26 percent of banknotes issued in Equatorial Guinea remain
in this country. Currency in circulation in Equatorial Guinea includes 18.4 percent of
banknotes from Gabon and 18.3 percent from Cameroon.
The mission that visited the BEAC headquarters in May 2001 provided technical
assistance on the compilation of timely monetary statistics for the CEMAC member
countries. The mission discussed an action plan for the implementation of the Monetary and
Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM) and for the introduction of an area-wide page in IFS for
the CEMAC. The new page for CEMAC was published in the January 2003 issue of IFS.
Following the 2001 mission, a regional workshop on monetary and financial statistics was
organized by the BEAC in Libreville (Gabon) in May 2002 to support the implementation of
the MFSM in the CEMAC countries.
In addition, a monetary and financial statistics mission visited Malabo in
December 2002. This mission (1) reviewed the structure of the financial system and the
procedures used for compiling monetary and financial statistics; (2) provided technical
assistance to the staff of the BEAC National Directorate in addressing data collection,
compilation, and dissemination problems, and in improving the analytical usefulness of the
monetary statistics; and (3) briefed the authorities on the methodology in the MFSM, and

11
initiated steps to facilitate its implementation. An action plan has been designed for
implementing the recommendations but action is pending.
External debt
Data on the outstanding stock of external debt and projections of debt-service payments
are hampered by serious inconsistencies. The debt service paid—reported by the DebtService Unit—is often significantly different from that reported by the budget and the Paris
Club, as the unit usually lacks precise information on payments made. Also, details regarding
scheduled debt-service obligations are not incorporated into the budget in a systematic and
timely manner. Debt-service projections beyond the following year are only provided in a
highly aggregated form and some debt service takes place outside the Debt-Service Unit. The
authorities have started a major inventory of debt and are beginning to address the capacity
constraints in the Debt-Service Unit through training and new staffing.
Balance of payments
Although the BEAC produces balance of payments data, delays are long and the data
suffer from significant inconsistencies with other datasets. At present, all BOP data for
2004–06 are estimates. Statistics are still largely constructed on a historical basis from
estimates rather than actual financial and customs records, including information on the
hydrocarbons sector available to some parts of the government. Customs data have improved
since the implementation of the Central African Customs and Economic Union reform and
the deployment of customs brigades. However, data analysis is still hampered by the lack of
computerization. While some progress has been made in compiling current and financial
account items, the lack of source data is a key concern. Balance of payments data are
published in the International Financial Statistics Yearbook through 1996 only.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with
the Republic of Equatorial Guinea
On June 8, 2007 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Equatorial Guinea.1
Background
Equatorial Guinea has recorded one of Africa’s fastest growth rates over the past decade, as its
petroleum industry has expanded and diversified into hydrocarbon derivatives. The
development of downstream activities strengthens the country’s longer-term economic and
fiscal sustainability. However, weaknesses in the business environment and transparency could
jeopardize successful development.
Macroeconomic performance was mixed in 2006. After rapid economic development in recent
years, the real economy declined around 5 percent, on account of a temporary drop in oil and
methanol production. In the non-oil sector, strong growth was observed in construction, utilities,
and finance and housing, mainly driven by a large increase in public capital spending. Strong
domestic demand exerted upward pressure on prices. With inflation above that in major trade
partners and the euro appreciating against the U.S. dollar, the real exchange rate continued to
rise.
The authorities are now developing a National Development Plan, with a 2020 horizon, to be
supported by a macro-fiscal framework that takes account of hydrocarbon resource
exhaustibility. Hydrocarbon revenues have provided the country with adequate resources to
alleviate poverty and achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Informal indicators
suggest a growing prosperity, but the importance of a sound statistical base for policy making—
including accurate measures on indicators of well-being—is becoming more pressing.
Fiscal performance in 2006 benefited from the high oil prices. The overall fiscal surplus rose to
23 percent of GDP, reflecting stronger oil revenues, partially offset by a sizeable rise in capital
spending, which considerably exceeded the budget. This overexecution reflected unbudgeted
1
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year.
A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's
economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for
discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.

2
purchases of shares in hydrocarbon sector projects and spending on physical infrastructure.
Education, health, and water and sewerage projects remain only a small share of public
investment spending. The non-oil primary deficit—a key fiscal indicator—remained at about
64 percent of non-oil GDP. Although revised estimates of the non-oil GDP and non-oil revenues
significantly improved measures of fiscal sustainability compared to previous estimates, the gap
with a sustainable fiscal position over the long term remains sizeable.
The oil price windfall has also led to robust balance of payments surpluses, and the
accumulation of sizeable financial assets. The balance of payments surplus was US$712 million
driven by continued inflows of foreign direct investment and improvement in the terms of trade.
The current account moved into surplus. Deposits at the Banque des Etats de l’Afrique Centrale
(BEAC) reached US$3.1 billion and deposits in foreign commercial banks reached
US$2.1 billion, at end-2006. In the absence of an active sterilization policy by the regional
central bank, monetary conditions in 2006 continued to be shaped by fiscal and balance of
payments developments. The financial system remains underdeveloped but stable.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors observed that, following a pause in 2006, Equatorial Guinea was poised to
resume strong growth in 2007. Continued robust oil exports and diversification of the
hydrocarbons industry into derivatives should help to sustain favorable growth prospects in the
medium term.
Directors endorsed the authorities’ efforts to formulate a long-term National Development Plan,
aimed at enhancing productivity and accelerating progress toward the MDGs. In that context,
and in view of the inflationary pressures and real exchange rate appreciation, Directors
underscored the importance of ensuring that macroeconomic policies help to safeguard
competitiveness, and are accompanied by accelerated structural measures to support a sound
business climate, economic diversification, and job creation.
Directors welcomed the development of a medium-term fiscal framework that takes into account
the exhaustibility of hydrocarbon resources. They supported the authorities’ adoption of a fiscal
policy guided by a reduction in the non-oil primary fiscal deficit. A key priority is to ensure that
budgetary execution adheres to spending limits and safeguards the quality of public
expenditure. Directors also stressed the need to improve the performance of non-oil revenues,
which will require sustained attention to tax and customs administration reform.
Directors considered that the continued saving of a significant part of hydrocarbon revenues is
critical to generate investment income to replace oil revenues that will decline over time. They
emphasized the importance of Equatorial Guinea fulfilling its obligations within the monetary
union to remit fiscal savings to the BEAC. Directors called on the authorities to work with their
BEAC partners to reformulate the investment strategy for reserves and to ensure an appropriate
return on oil savings.
While recognizing the country’s needs for physical infrastructure, Directors underlined that the
authorities’ immediate priority is to reorient capital spending toward human resource
development, and to ensure that current spending receives an appropriate allocation to operate
and maintain the growing public capital stock. They welcomed the creation of a Social Needs
Fund to guide the government’s social welfare activities, and looked forward to implementation

3
of its programs in 2007. A timely public expenditure review, with World Bank support, should
contribute to enhancing the efficiency of public investments and improving social spending.
Directors regretted the lack of progress in public financial management reform, and encouraged
the authorities to invigorate their efforts. They underscored the critical role of transparency and
accountability in the fiscal accounts and oil sector, in particular through undertaking regular
audits of the national oil and gas companies, and publishing the central government budget and
its execution, as well as data and information related to the oil and gas sector in accordance
with international best practice. In this regard, Directors urged faster progress toward full
participation in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.
Directors emphasized the need for clear and transparent implementing regulations for the new
hydrocarbons law and tax laws. They encouraged the authorities to move expeditiously to
reconcile the fiscal and local content terms of the hydrocarbons law with existing oil sector
contracts.
Directors supported the authorities’ efforts to strengthen the role of the financial system in
private sector development, including by improving access to credit by small- and medium-sized
enterprises. They highlighted the need for proper sequencing and integration into the National
Development Plan. Directors welcomed the authorities’ interest in a national Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP), to complement the findings of the regional FSAP. They looked
forward to the early operation of the recently-created National Agency for Financial Investigation
to counter money laundering and combat the financing of terrorism.
Directors saw Equatorial Guinea’s minimal debt service burden and high reserves as key
buffers against economic shocks. To preserve the advantages of a strong external position,
they cautioned against sizable new borrowing. All external borrowing should be reflected
transparently in the fiscal accounts and balance of payments.
Directors noted that Equatorial Guinea’s statistical apparatus remains weak and hampers
macroeconomic analysis and policy formulation. They encouraged the authorities to allocate
with priority the required resources to enhance the statistical capacity, including by establishing
a National Statistical Institute, and to consider participating in the General Data Dissemination
System.

Statement by Laurean W. Rutayisire, Executive Director
for Republic of Equatorial Guinea
June 8, 2007

On behalf of my Equatoguinean authorities, I would like to thank Executive Directors and
Management for their continued support. I also would like to convey my authorities’
appreciation to staff for the policy advice, and for the constructive discussions held in
Malabo.
Equatorial Guinea’s economy continues to be dominated by the oil sector, in spite of slight
decline in 2006 production. This decline was attributed to three main reasons: (i) the
country’s largest oil field of Exxon Mobil has experienced decreasing production pace since
2005, which continued in 2006; (ii) the new UN International Uniform Industrial
Classification (CIIU) of economic activities that places all oil derivatives under non oil sector
- LNG, LPG, Propane, Methanol, and Butane all are considered non oil outputs and; (iii) the
two months break in Methanol production activities due to mechanical problems. As a result,
the real GDP decreased by about 4.9 percent of GDP, while the non oil sector remained
strong. Agricultural activities for instance, grew by 6 percent. The average inflation rate
remained almost the same as last year at 4.5 percent in 2006, against 4.8 percent the previous
year.
Thanks to high international prices of export commodities and tight fiscal policy, Equatorial
Guinea’s economy experienced high fiscal revenues of 23.4 percent of GDP, a robust balance
of payments, and a very comfortable external position at the end 2006.
The authorities have taken steps to ensure an efficient use of these buoyant revenues, and
creating the basis for economic diversification. To this end, the authorities have expressed
their determination to continue working closely with the Fund in order to establish a policy
of permanent income that would align capital expenditure to non-oil GDP growth rate,
address budgetary weakness, and further target inflationary pressures up to the CEMAC
regional level.
Short-Term Outlook
The authorities are optimistic with the near term economic outlook that may be boosted by
additional production from Okume oil field. This new facility discovered by Amerada Hess
started its commercial production in December last year, with over 30 thousand barrels of
crude oil per day, expected to double by end 2007. In addition, the 25 percent of government
share from the liquefied natural gas (LNG) represents another source of revenue. This plant
is expected to produce 4,607 million btu/year. On May 24, 2007, Marathon Oil Corporation
and Equatorial Guinea’s government representatives announced the delivery of the first cargo
of LNG from Bioko Island, with 6 months ahead of anticipated time.

2
Assuming that no mechanical problem will interrupt Methanol plant again, and that all
existing production facilities will continue at their actual production pace, including
derivatives, the projected overall production output justifies the authorities’ optimistic view
of Equatorial Guinea’s economic outlook. This optimism is shared by staff that estimates the
average growth rate of all production sources to rebound at 11 percent of 2007 real GDP.
Social Sectors and Development Plan
In an April 2006 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), the government of Equatorial
Guinea and the USAID created a Social Fund intended to guide all government social
activities. This Social Fund has identified essential priority areas to be added to the
government existing social programs, including education, health, running water,
environment, local governments, and women promotion. Most of the Social Fund’s
governance structure has been completed, except for the appointment of three foreign
resident Advisors specialized in social development. The authorities are working on this last
requirement to make the body operative.
The government has already included in its 2007 budget the USD 72 million (approximately
0.08% of GDP) cost for this year activities of the Social Fund. The authorities also have
indicated their intent to work in close coordination with the Social Fund to strengthen
capacities within Ministries responsible for social development projects. The Social Fund is
expected to start financing implementation of projects by mid-2007, with the motto of one
project at the time, to ensure efficiency. Other activities carried out by the government on
this ground include the following:
•

In May 2007, the government organized a second workshop in Bata – Equatorial
Guinea horizon 2020-, to discuss the national development plan (NDP) that will
guide the authorities’ overall spending, taking account of the depleting nature of oil
and gas resources. IMF staff attended the first and kick-off workshop on the NDP.
The authorities expect their efforts on social sectors to help the country meet the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In that regard, the recent completion of a
household survey will help the authorities assess progress made and monitor key
indicators on alphabetization, life expectancy, infantile and maternal mortality, and
other areas identified by the MDGs.

•

The National Development Plan (NDP), now being formulated, will guide the
government overall spending policies. In general, this strategy will have two main
prongs: (i) fiscal policy aimed at improving the non-oil primary balance, thereby
containing inflationary pressures and real exchange rate appreciation, and improving
long-run fiscal sustainability; and (ii) structural reforms aimed at raising productivity
and enhancing external competitiveness. The economic diversification into
hydrocarbon derivatives should bolster longer-term growth and fiscal sustainability.

3
However, the authorities agreed with staff that reforms to stimulate growth in
different sectors are necessary to generate jobs and further poverty reduction.
Likewise, the authorities agreed with staff that this is the right time to start moving
quickly in this direction, as the country has accumulated adequate resources to hasten
progress toward the achievement of the MDGs.
Fiscal Policy and Reforms
On the fiscal front, Equatorial Guinea’s policy is driven by the government determination to
diversify the economy. To achieve this goal, the authorities increased capital expenditures by
over 30 percent and 19 percent in 2005/06, and 2006/07, respectively. For instance, the 2006
three-year rolling plan of Public Investment Program (PIP) for capital spending considerably
exceeded its budget. The over execution reflected unbudgeted allocations of funds to
highways and urban infrastructures (36%), housing and public administration (17%),
hydrocarbon sector (16.7%), and air and sea infrastructures and industry (15.8%).
Additionally, a number of social projects also took off, including renovation of schools, the
national university, health facilities, and the construction of the country’s first modern
hospital in Bata. The non-oil primary deficit was reduced to about 64 percent of non-oil
GDP.
On the revenue side, net collection was robust, reflecting high oil prices, albeit the slowdown
in oil production during the 2005/06 compared to the 2004/05 fiscal year. Consequently, the
government deposits at the BEAC further increased reaching USD 3.1 billion, while those in
foreign commercial banks amounted to USD 2.1 billion, at end-2006. Complying with
CEMAC regulations, the authorities expressed their intention to bring all their foreign
deposits to the BEAC, hoping that the ongoing reforms within this central bank would lead to
competitive remunerations for all public deposits in the BEAC.
Under their reform agenda, and well aware of the limited scope of oil and gas resources, the
authorities are taking corrective measures to ensure long term fiscal sustainability. These
measures include the new and more comprehensive 2006 Hydrocarbon Law, and the
underway National Development Plan that would guide public spending to targeted areas,
align capital spending with non-oil GDP growth rate, and set a policy of Permanent income
beyond oil production era. These two initiatives constitute the core reform strategies through
which the authorities intend to set up a reliable fiscal safety net. Regarding the new
hydrocarbon law, some implementation aspects are still to be discussed between oil
companies and the government, including a transitory clause that would give the Ministry of
Mines the power to review and renegotiate any existing signed contract and adapt it to the
new regulation.
As for the concern of aligning the spending pace with the non-oil GDP growth rate through
the hypothesis of permanent income (PIH), the authorities have requested IMF assistance on

4
designing a financial program on that matter. Likewise, the authorities have initiated a
number of actions to address the prevailing weaknesses in public finance management and
transparency. The authorities have requested Fund assistance in this area, with the view of
fostering spending control, and improving the quality of public spending.
To improve financial transparency and accountability, the authorities have recently engaged
in a process to appoint an audit firm to audit the oil sector. The authorities have also
requested World Bank assistance in providing them with a resident Advisor that will help
them move expeditiously toward fulfilling the few remaining required preconditions for EITI
Initiative.
Financial and Monetary Policy
While limited sterilization has resulted into the monetary situation being dominated by fiscal
expansion and balance of payments, nevertheless, money supply growth experienced a
reduction of about 5.4 percent in 2006, especially following the government transfer of some
of its deposits from commercial banks to BEAC, causing M2 to decrease by 14.1 percent.
Private sector credit also grew at a normal rate.
The financial sector of Equatorial Guinea is dominated by a few and less developed
commercial banks. The authorities have created the National Bank of Equatorial Guinea
(BANGE) to encourage competitiveness, innovation, and improve access to credit. The
shares of this bank are held both by the public (35 percent) and the private sectors, with the
latest being the majority. Accordingly, the sector has experienced improvement in capital
placements, bank activities, and increased competition, compared to the deteriorating path
suffered from the past.
Technical Assistance
In order to improve their public management system limitations, the authorities signed a
Technical Assistance on June 2006 with the IMF. The Agreement consisted on hiring two
resident Advisors, one for Public Finance Management, and the other for Macro Fiscal
Analysis. Equatorial Guinea was to pay the full amount of the service delivered under this
Agreement through the reimbursement system. Some progress was reported up to April 2007
when some private security issues caused the Advisors to leave the country. My
Equatoguinean authorities and the Fund have exchanged letters on this matter, as well as on
the conduct of the advisors’ activities, especially the implications of Fund’s Back-stopping
policy. A decision on the future of the agreement is still pending.
As second area of TA, the authorities also have asked the Fund to help them get a better
remuneration of their reserves. A Fund study that could provide the authorities with diverse

5
options regarding their BEAC’s deposits, versus other competitive markets, would be very
helpful.
Conclusion
My authorities have once again demonstrated their commitment to policies and their
willingness to collaborate with the Fund on key issues facing Equatorial Guinea’s economy.
There have been commendable achievements on the path of reforms, economic prosperity
and poverty reduction. Still, more needs to be done with the aim of diversifying the economy
beyond the oil sector.
In view of the satisfactory fiscal performance in the past periods, the broad
commitment of the authorities to implement structural reforms, I will appreciate the Board's
support for the completion of the 2007 article IV consultation with Equatorial Guinea. My
authorities continue to count on the Fund’s support to achieve their development goals.

View of the authorities of Equatorial Guinea on IMF Staff’s 2007 Article IV
Consultation Report

The Equatoguinean authorities agree with much of the staff’s 2007 Article IV report and
assessment. However, we strongly disagree with the report’s conclusion regarding real GDP
growth rate in 2006 which, according to the report, was -5.2 percent. The authorities’
estimate of growth is 5.3 percent. The authorities expect that over time as the methodology
and source data are improved, we will arrive at a better measure of GDP, which could lead to
a substantial upward revision of growth estimates for recent years.
The authorities consent to the publication of the staff report conditional to the inclusion of
this note and look forward to future reconciliation of the methodologies and estimates.
