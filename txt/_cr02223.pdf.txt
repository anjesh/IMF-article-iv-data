IMF Concludes 2002 Article IV Consultation with Dominica
On August 28, 2002, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Dominica and approved a one-year Stand-By Arrangement in
the amount of SDR 3.28 million (see Press Release No. 02/37, August 28, 2002).1
Background
Over the past several years, output and employment growth have been on the decline
reflecting the ongoing retrenchment of the key banana industry (due to weak export prices and
the beginning of the phase out of preferential access to the European Union market), and the
weak growth of non-banana agriculture and tourism. After growing on average by about
2½ percent during 1996–99, real GDP stagnated in 2000 and is estimated to have contracted
by 4½ percent in 2001, as banana production fell (owing also to adverse weather conditions)
and tourism was hit by the global slowdown and the events of September 11. The 12-month
increase in consumer prices was just under 2 percent in 2001. Unemployment remains high.
The public finances have deteriorated in recent years as capital expenditure has increased
sharply, while saving has been declining. The deficit of the consolidated public sector almost
quadrupled over the period 1997/98–2000/01 (years ending June 30) to about 12½ percent of
GDP and public savings fell by 3½ percent of GDP, mainly reflecting the deterioration in
central government finances. However, the overall deficit of the central government is
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2estimated to have declined slightly to about 10½ percent of GDP in 2001/02. The deficit
continued to be financed by external borrowing, recourse to the banking system, and arrears
accumulation, especially to social security and public and private enterprises. Central
government dissaving is estimated to have reached 6¾ percent of GDP in 2001/02, as current
revenues declined sharply owing to economic contraction. Capital expenditure is estimated to
have declined to 6 percent of GDP from 16½ percent of GDP in 2000/01, owing to the
completion of major investment projects in the areas of infrastructure and education, as well as
emerging financing constraints.
During 2001, broad money increased by about 7½ percent, fueled by net credit to the
nonfinancial public sector, as well as a steady inflow of remittances and private transfers from
abroad. In contrast, banking system credit to the private sector declined by over 3 percent, in
line with the downturn in economic activity. As a result, commercial banks built up their net
foreign asset positions.
The external current account deficit, which averaged about 11½ percent of GDP in 1998–99,
widened to about 18⅓ percent of GDP in 2000, on account of a sharp decline in banana
exports, stagnant receipts on services (including tourism), and higher interest payments,
following the substantial build-up of public sector external debt in recent years. The current
account deficit narrowed to about 16½ percent of GDP in 2001, due to the economic
contraction and lower imports. The capital account remained in surplus, leading to a small
increase in imputed reserves (compared to a decline in 2000).
Little progress was made on structural reforms in 2001, other than the implementation of the
much-delayed reduction in the common external tariff under the CARICOM agreement
of 1992.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors regretted Dominica’s sluggish recent economic performance, a result of the
retrenchment of the banana industry and slowdown in tourism receipts. Further diversification
and enhancements to competitiveness will be needed to improve long-term growth prospects
and reduce external vulnerability. This calls for perseverance with structural reforms to
improve economic efficiency, and raise national savings and investment.
Directors expressed particular concern that the overall deficit of the consolidated nonfinancial
public sector—after nearly doubling in 1999/2000—remained at an unsustainable level in
2001/02. The public sector’s serious cash shortage is the main impediment to output and
employment growth, and poses a threat to economic stability. In this context, Directors
welcomed the authorities’ program for 2002/03, which aims to put the public finances on a path
consistent with public debt sustainability and lay the foundation for sustained economic growth.
Directors commended the authorities for the strong measures already taken in the context of
the 2002/03 budget. While noting that the decision to focus in the budget on revenue-raising

-3measures had been taken with the objective of securing public support for the program and
strengthening social and labor harmony, they would have preferred more emphasis to be
placed on expenditure containment, which they saw as a surer path to regaining growth
momentum. It was broadly agreed that government spending should be reduced in the
medium term, including through structural reforms in the civil service, government financial
management, and public investment. A comprehensive reform of the tax system and tax
administration will also be important.
Directors agreed that a tight public expenditure policy will be crucial to support fiscal
consolidation. They emphasized the need to implement the prudent government wage policy
envisaged in the program and, in the medium term, to put in place a wage policy based on
performance and productivity gains. Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to implement
a comprehensive civil service reform. Reducing public employment through attrition would help
increase efficiency in the provision of public services.
Directors advised the authorities to implement only those public investment projects that are
aimed at redressing the main impediments to growth, and that can be financed largely with
external resources on concessional terms. They welcomed the authorities’ ongoing review of
the public investment program and their planned review of public expenditure.
Directors were encouraged that the banking system is considered by the Eastern Caribbean
Central Bank (ECCB) to be generally sound. However, they noted the risks to the large stateowned commercial bank stemming from its heavy exposure to the financially weak public
sector and the distressed banana industry. The authorities’ commitment to reduce the level of
government indebtedness to this bank was therefore welcomed, as was the commitment to
eliminate government domestic arrears.
Directors welcomed the Dominican authorities’ intention to support fully the ECCB’s efforts to
strengthen financial sector regulation and supervision in the region, and their plans to
strengthen the oversight of the financial system, with support from the ECCB, and to review
the offshore financial sector. They commended the authorities’ intention to participate in the
Financial Sector Assessment Program of ECCB member countries in 2003. Directors noted
the steps the authorities had taken on anti-money laundering, and encouraged them to
address the few outstanding issues on an urgent basis.
Directors concurred with the authorities’ decision to accelerate the ongoing restructuring of the
banana sector. They also welcomed the progress made toward privatization of public
enterprises, and noted that consideration might be given to using the proceeds from
privatization to reduce Dominica’s public debt. They urged the completion of the process of
phasing out import licenses and moving toward establishing low and uniform tariff rates.

Directors noted that improvements in Dominica’s statistical database are needed for effective
economic analysis and surveillance, and encouraged the authorities to accelerate the planned

-4enhancements of economic statistics in the context of the Fund’s General Data Dissemination
System.

Public Information Notices (PINs) are issued, (i) at the request of a member country, following the
conclusion of the Article IV consultation for countries seeking to make known the views of the IMF to the
public. This action is intended to strengthen IMF surveillance over the economic policies of member
countries by increasing the transparency of the IMF's assessment of these policies; and (ii) following
policy discussions in the Executive Board at the decision of the Board. The Staff Report for the 2002
Article IV Consultation with Dominica is also available.
