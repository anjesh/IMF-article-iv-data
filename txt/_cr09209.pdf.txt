KYRGYZ REPUBLIC
Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation and First Review Under the
18-Month Arrangement Under the Exogenous Shocks Facility
Prepared by the Middle East and Central Asia Department
(In cooperation with other Departments)
Approved by David Owen and Ranil Manohara Salgado
May 11, 2009

Discussions were held in Bishkek during March 4–18, 2009. The team comprised
Mr. van Rooden (head), Ms. Bacalu, Ms. Jardaneh (all MCD), Ms. Kongsamut (MCM), and
Mr. Wu (SPR), and was assisted by Mr. McHugh (the Fund’s Resident Representative in the
Kyrgyz Republic). The team met with Prime Minister Chudinov, Deputy Prime Minister for
Labor and Social Protection Abdullaeva, Minister of Finance Sultanov, Minister of Trade and
Economic Development Japarov, National Bank Chairman Alapaev, other senior officials, and
representatives of the donor community and the financial sector.
The last Article IV consultation was concluded on November 3, 2006. The exchange rate
regime is classified as an other managed arrangement. The Kyrgyz Republic has accepted the
obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system free of
restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions.
The Executive Board approved an 18-month arrangement under the high-access
component of the Exogenous Shocks Facility (ESF) on December 10, 2008, in the amount
of SDR 66.6 million (about $100 million), or 75 percent of quota. The authorities had
requested the arrangement to support their economic program to address the consequences of
the exogenous shocks that had hit the economy and to manage the effects of the slowdown in
regional growth and spillovers from the global financial crisis. A first disbursement of
SDR 16.65 million (about $25 million) was made following Board approval.
Staff recommends the completion of the first review under the ESF arrangement, based
on the authorities’ strong performance and the strength of their policy commitments expressed
in the attached supplementary Letter of Intent. A second disbursement of SDR 16.65 million
(about $25 million) would become available upon completion of the review.
Data provision is adequate for surveillance and program monitoring, although data could be
improved in some areas (Annex VI). The Kyrgyz Republic subscribes to the SDDS.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The outlook for the Kyrgyz economy has worsened as the region has been swept up by
the global economic crisis. The crisis is hurting the Kyrgyz economy mainly through trade
and remittance channels. Russia and Kazakhstan remain key trading partners of the
Kyrgyz Republic and the main source of remittances. With these countries in recession,
Kyrgyz growth is expected to almost come to a halt this year, before recovering modestly in
2010. Inflation has come down sharply to 13.6 percent in March 2009, as world commodity
prices eased, and is expected to slow further to about 10 percent by year-end.
Policy implementation under the ESF program approved in December 2008 has been
strong. All end-2008 performance criteria and structural benchmarks were observed. Policies
have been aimed at supporting growth and the poor, while reducing inflation and maintaining
financial sector stability.
The authorities’ economic policies for 2009, together with large donor support, will help
mitigate the impact of the crisis on the Kyrgyz economy. Sizable assistance received from
Russia—including $450 million in highly concessional budget support—allows fiscal policy
to accommodate the large shortfall in government revenues expected this year, while creating
some room for an increase in capital and social spending. The resulting fiscal easing will
provide a strong boost to the economy and help to avoid a recession. The assistance will
more than cover the balance of payments and fiscal needs that were emerging for 2009.
The NBKR will allow continued exchange rate flexibility to absorb the large external
shocks and limit foreign exchange reserve losses. The spread of the financial crisis resulted
in strong depreciation pressures. The NBKR remains concerned about a loss in confidence in
the national currency that could arise from a sudden and disorderly depreciation and will
continue to intervene to smooth extreme volatility. Provided that inflation continues on a
downward path and exchange rate pressures ease, interest rates could be gradually reduced.
Banks have held up well to the global financial crisis. Bank capitalization and liquidity
remain high. Kazakh banks have so far maintained funding of their Kyrgyz subsidiaries.
Credit growth, however, has come to a halt and nonperforming loans have started to rise.
Stress tests indicate vulnerabilities to credit and concentration risks. The high level of
capitalization of banks provides some cushion to these risks.
The authorities have taken a proactive approach to prepare for possible financial sector
problems. They have put together a crisis preparedness plan, including plans for injecting
capital into systemic banks if needed, funded from the budget. Emergency liquidity facilities
are in place. The introduction of deposit insurance is being advanced and deposit insurance
levels have been increased. The NBKR has also required banks to prepare their own
contingency plans and has stepped up monitoring of the banks.

5
I. BACKGROUND
1.
Up to 2008, a favorable external environment and sound economic policies
resulted in a steady increase in the pace of economic growth in the Kyrgyz Republic,
while inflation remained low. Following periods of political turmoil, economic growth
accelerated to 8½ percent in 2007 and non-gold growth reached 9 percent that year. Poverty
rates fell to 35 percent, from 54 percent in 2002, while extreme poverty dropped from
23 percent to 7 percent. Inflation remained close to 5 percent, until it started to surge in late
2007.
2.
Over the last year and a half, adverse external developments have led to a
deterioration in economic conditions. Initially, the Kyrgyz economy was hit by the rise in
international commodity prices that caused a sharp increase in Kyrgyz inflation and a
worsening of the external position. When the international economic tide turned in the
second half of 2008 and the global economic and financial crisis spread to the region, the
Kyrgyz economy was badly hit as well. Growth has slowed sharply over the last six months.
In addition, long-standing energy sector problems matched up with water shortages, causing
a major shortfall in hydropower capacity and widespread power outages.
Box 1. The Authorities’ Response to Past Fund Advice
Despite a difficult political environment, the authorities’ policies have generally been consistent with
Fund advice. Implementation of the structural reform agenda was more mixed, but improved in recent
years.
Fiscal Policy: During the last four years, the authorities were successful in consolidating the budget
deficit, benefiting from strong economic performance, an increase in trade, and improved revenue
administration. With prudent fiscal policies and aided by strong growth and Paris Club support,
external public debt indicators improved considerably during this period. After some delay, a new tax
code was passed in the fall of 2008, simplifying the tax regime. The new code, however, included a
big decrease in the VAT rate and introduced a cascading turnover tax, against Fund advice.
Monetary Policy: Over the years, the NBKR has generally pursued appropriate monetary policies to
keep inflation at low levels. It could have raised interest rates more quickly in late 2007, when
inflation started to pick up; interest rates were raised to positive real levels only in 2008. Also, the
NBKR has generally allowed the exchange rate to adjust to market forces, smoothing large
fluctuations, apart from a period in 2007 when it resisted pressure on the exchange rate to appreciate.
The NBKR’s foreign exchange purchases during that period contributed to a rapid monetary
expansion that may have made it easier for inflation to take hold later that year, but it also provided
the NBKR with a much stronger foreign reserve cushion.
Financial sector: The authorities have made notable progress in implementing the recommendations
of the 2006 FSSA report, including strengthening supervision, enhancing the central bank’s
independence, and taking the necessary measures to introduce a deposit insurance scheme.

6
3.
The Fund has continued to assist the Kyrgyz authorities with policy advice and
financial assistance during these more challenging times. An augmentation of resources
by 10 percent of quota (SDR 8.88 million) was approved with the last review under the
Kyrgyz Republic’s arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility in
May 2008. And in December 2008, the Executive Board approved an 18-month arrangement
under the Exogenous Shocks Facility in the amount of SDR 66.6 million (75 percent of
quota), to help the country manage the impact of the various exogenous shocks.
4.
Presidential elections have been advanced to July this year. The elections were
originally expected to be held in 2010. The Kyrgyz Republic has experienced a period of
relative political stability, especially following the parliamentary elections in late 2007,
resulting in an improved relationship between the government and the parliament.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
A. Spillovers from the Global Crisis: Economic Activity Slows Rapidly
5.
Growth remained strong in 2008, but the global and regional slowdown is
affecting economic activity outside the gold sector. Overall economic growth reached
7.6 percent, mainly on account of a strong recovery in gold production. Non-gold growth,
however, fell to 5.4 percent in 2008, compared to 9 percent in 2007, as demand started to
slow and the frequent power outages hurt production. With these power cuts, however, and
aided by a relatively mild winter, a more serious energy crisis was avoided. Non-gold growth
fell further to 0.8 percent in the first quarter of 2009 (relative to the same period last year) as
the global crisis spread to the region.
6.
Inflation has come down sharply to 13.6 percent in March 2009, after spiking at
over 30 percent in mid-2008. Prices had risen rapidly through mid-2008, due to the surge in
international food and fuel prices. The reversal in international commodity prices, the
slowdown in activity, and a substantial tightening of monetary policy during 2008
contributed to the decline in inflation. Second-round price effects have caused core inflation
to remain relatively high, however, at 14.4 percent in March 2009.
7.
The current account balance worsened substantially in 2008. This mainly
reflected higher import prices for food and fuel products. The higher import bill was partially
offset by higher gold export receipts, strong remittance inflows, and higher tourism receipts,
but the current account deficit widened by more than 6 percent of GDP, from a near balance
in 2007. The NBKR’s gross international reserves stood at just over $1.2 billion at end-2008
(covering 3½ months of imports), broadly the same level as at end-2007.
8.
Fiscal policy was more conservative than budgeted in 2008. As the economy
started to slow and began to affect revenue collection, the authorities sharply curtailed
spending on non-priority items in the last few months of the year. Their aim was to maintain
a comfortable balance in the Treasury accounts in anticipation of worse times to come,

Strengthened economic performance of the past few years was put to the test by the rise in global food and
fuel prices, and, more recently, by the global and regional slowdown. The outlook has worsened considerably.
GDP growth is projected to almost come to a halt in 2009, before
recovering modestly in 2010.

Figure 2. Kyrgyz Republic: External Sector Developments
The current account is estimated to have deteriorated substantially in 2008. Recent regional developments
point to slowing demand for Kyrgyz exports and a decline in remittances. Official reserves are over 3 months
of imports and, with large financial assistance from Russia coverage will reach almost 4 months this year.
The current account deficit widened to 6½ percent in 2008 and is
projected to remain high in 2009–10.

pending also their efforts to mobilize additional external financing for 2009. Combined with
a larger-than-budgeted surplus of the Social Fund, this resulted in an overall budget deficit of
only 0.1 percent of GDP for 2008.
B. Financial Spillovers: Pressures Emerge
9.
The spread of the global financial crisis resulted in strong depreciation
pressures. The som had been appreciating against the dollar through August of last year,
reflecting strong remittance inflows and export earnings. But as the financial market turmoil
spread and particularly as the Russian ruble depreciated against the dollar, the som came
under pressure as well. Pressures intensified after the devaluation of the Kazakh tenge and
the Armenian dram in early 2009. Since end-August, the som has depreciated by 25 percent
against the dollar, while appreciating by about 7 percent against the ruble. The NBKR
allowed greater exchange rate flexibility than most other countries in the region, but
intervened to avoid a sharper depreciation. It sold $181 million during September 2008–
March 2009 and reserves fell to $1,042 million by end-March 2009. Exchange rate pressures
eased in March and April as the Russian ruble appreciated slightly against the dollar.
10.
The increased uncertainty affected money demand and credit growth, and
contributed to an increase in dollarization. Broad money contracted by 17 percent (at
constant exchange rates) during October 2008–March 2009. With confidence in the local
currency and in the banking system weakening, people shifted out of the som and out of
banks. Local currency deposits fell by 22 percent during October 2008–March 2009 and
foreign currency deposits by 16 percent. The decline in money demand seems to have leveled
off recently. Credit also contracted, by 8 percent during this period, as demand for new loans
fell and banks became more cautious. With the decline in demand for som, the NBKR has
kept interest rates positive in real terms and has sought to keep banks’ excess liquidity low.
11.
Banks have so far held up well to the global financial crisis, but signs of stress
are emerging. Bank capitalization and liquidity are high. Linkages to the international
financial system have so far been broadly maintained without disruption: while subsidiaries
of Kazakh banks account for more than a third of the Kyrgyz banking system, their parent
institutions have maintained funding levels. Banks’ non-performing loans (NPLs) have
started to rise, however, and their deposit base declined.
C. Program Implementation: the Program is on Track
12.
Policy implementation under the ESF program has been strong. All end-2008
performance criteria (PCs) and indicative targets were met. The fiscal PC and, linked to that,
the PC on the NBKR’s net domestic assets were met by wide margins as government
spending was curtailed during the last month of 2008. Structural benchmarks were also
observed:
•

The government and NBKR issued a joint resolution clarifying the roles of the NBKR
and the Ministry of Finance in dealing with problems in banks that are of systemic
importance. The NBKR will take the lead in determining whether a bank is of
systemic importance, while any capital injections would be provided from the budget.

10

Figure 3. Kyrgyz Republic: Monetary and Exchange Rate Developments
Monetary policy was tightened in 2008 to tackle inflation. While inflation has come down, interest rates have
been kept high to support the som as exchange rate pressures emerged in late 2008 and money demand fell.
Exchange rate pressures intensified considerably in recent months. The NBKR intervened tot smooth day-to-day movements and
prevent a loss of confidence. The som has depreciated by 25 percent against the U.S. dollar since end-August 2008.

Parliament approved the amendments to the central bank law to strengthen the
NBKR’s financial independence by increasing its statutory capital and ensuring an
asymmetric (and thus more conservative) treatment of unrealized valuation gains and
losses in the central bank’s income statement.

Coordination between the NBKR and the Ministry of Finance on financial operations

The review of the proposed new arrangements for the government securities market
was completed with some delay in April 2009. Based on this review, staff advised
that moving government securities issuance and trading to the stock exchange would
be premature, pending creation of a single depository and an accompanying secure
payment and settlement infrastructure. Also, trading of government securities should
not be made exclusive to the stock exchange; large parties (banks) should continue to
be allowed to trade over-the-counter.
III. OUTLOOK: A CHALLENGING YEAR AHEAD

13.
With the spread of the global crisis, 2009 will be a difficult year for the Kyrgyz
economy. The outlook for the Kyrgyz economy has worsened substantially as countries in
the region are increasingly being swept up by the global crisis. Russia and Kazakhstan
remain key trading partners of the Kyrgyz Republic and a major source of remittances
(remittances were equivalent to almost 30 percent of GDP in 2008). The recession in these
countries is hurting the Kyrgyz economy via trade and remittance channels, spilling over to
domestic demand. As a result, and taking into account the planned fiscal stimulus, economic
growth in the Kyrgyz Republic is expected to almost come to a halt in 2009, before
recovering modestly in 2010. Growth is projected to accelerate over the medium term as the
region recovers and reforms continue.
14.
The spreading economic crisis is putting pressure on the balance of payments. In
2009, the current account deficit (excluding official transfers) is expected to widen further to
10 percent of GDP, as the reversal in food and fuel prices is projected to be more than offset
by a drop in exports and remittances.
15.
The economic slowdown is also causing a decline in government revenues.
Revenues were already anticipated to fall relative to GDP in 2009 due to the changes in tax
policy that came into effect in January, in particular the reduction in the VAT rate from 20 to
12 percent (see Box 2). The decline in economic activity, however, combined with
decreasing commodity prices, is causing a much sharper drop in government revenues than
anticipated earlier.

13
Box 2. Tax Revenue Developments
Tax collection in the Kyrgyz Republic compares favorably with that in the region. Propped up
also by strong growth, tax collection improved in recent years on account of improved customs
administration and streamlined tax procedures, including better arrears management.

Taxes on consumption and labor are the main sources of revenue. VAT collection accounted for
39 percent of total taxes in 2008, followed by taxes on labor at 25 percent. Reliance on taxes on
imports (VAT, customs duties, and excises) is strong, accounting for more than 40 percent of all taxes
collected.

Taxes on import

Tax revenue is expected to drop sharply in 2009. On top of the earlier expected decline in taxes due
to large tax cuts (most notably, of the VAT rate from 20 to 12 percent), recent data point to a sharper
decline in tax collections. This can be attributed to a combination of factors: declining economic
activity; lower commodity prices leading to lower taxes collected on imports; and a worsening in
taxpayers’ compliance. The enforcement of the new property tax has been delayed due to the
complexities of application. The new wider turnover tax that was introduced to offset some of the
expected revenue losses and that replaced the cascading sales, road, and emergency taxes is also
cascading and therefore continues to distort the allocation of resources. The recent increase in the
excise rate on petroleum products will only make a modest contribution to revenues.

17.
Inflation, meanwhile, is expected to ease further, to about 10 percent by end2009. This reflects the decline in international commodity prices, the continuation of a tight
monetary policy, and slowing demand. It also takes into account the additional increases in
utility tariffs and the impact of the depreciation of the som. 1
I. POLICY DISCUSSIONS: MANAGING THE IMPACT OF THE GLOBAL CRISIS
18.
Policy discussions focused on how to manage the impact of the global crisis on
the Kyrgyz economy. The authorities agreed that policies would need to support growth and
the poor and safeguard external stability, while keeping inflation on a downward path and
maintaining financial sector stability. In the absence of large financial assets, however, such
as those accumulated by oil and gas producing countries elsewhere in the region, they
recognized that the room for policies to support growth depended critically on the availability
of donor support. The authorities have therefore actively sought to mobilize additional aid.
Large donor support, mainly provided by the Russian Federation, will help cushion the
impact of the crisis. The Russian Federation recently disbursed a $150 million grant and a
$300 million concessional loan to help support the Kyrgyz budget (together

equivalent to about 9 percent of GDP). 2 The Russian Federation is also providing
$190 million in debt relief and a possible $1.7 billion commercial loan for the construction of
the Kambarata hydropower plant over the next several years. The budget support more than
covers the financing needs that were emerging for 2009. The authorities therefore intend to
use this money in a medium-term fiscal framework, also taking into account the limited
administrative capacity, with a little over one-third used to finance the 2009 budget.
19.
The authorities have updated their Country Development Strategy (CDS) to take
account of the new external challenges. The updated CDS was approved in February and
extended to cover the period 2009–11. The new version does not change the vision and goals,
but stresses that the overarching goal is the improvement of the quality of life through
improving the quality of economic growth, management, and the environment. As such, the
CDS remains focused on four key pillars: (i) economic development; (ii) governance and
transparency in public administration; (iii) human capital development; and
(iv) environmental sustainability. The updated version also commits to achieve the
Millennium Development Goals by 2015. Supporting the authorities in their efforts, the
donor community continues to work closely together in the framework of the Joint Country
Support Strategy.
A. Fiscal Policy: Room for Stimulus
20.
The external financing will allow fiscal policy to accommodate the large shortfall
in government revenues expected this year, while creating some room for an increase in
spending, providing a strong boost to the economy and helping to avoid a recession.
Measured by the widening in the primary fiscal deficit excluding grants relative to 2008, the
use of a little more than one-third of the Russian budget support will imply a fiscal easing of
5½ percent of GDP in 2009. The overall deficit will remain limited to 2 percent of GDP.
21.
Besides raising capital spending, which will improve medium-term growth
prospects, the authorities will also increase social support. The decline in economic
activity combined with the expected decline in remittances will cause a drop in disposable
household incomes that could reverse much of the gains in poverty reduction achieved in
recent years. To mitigate the effects on the poor, the main social benefit—the Unified
Monthly Benefit (UMB)—will be increased further this year, adding to the increase in the
benefit level introduced last year. Work to improve the targeting of benefits is continuing
with the help of the World Bank and the European Union.
22.
In the coming years, available concessional financing will allow for relatively
large budget deficits without jeopardizing fiscal sustainability. The utilization of the
remaining funds provided by the Russian Federation, combined with an expected spike in the

Fiscal policy was tighter than budgeted in 2008. Against a sharp slowdown in growth, revenues are projected
to fall more than expected in 2009. Large donor support allows for a substantial fiscal easing in 2009,
accommodating the revenue shortfall, which will help support the economy.

donor-financed public investment program (mainly infrastructure projects) will allow an
annual average budget deficit of about 3¾ percent of GDP during 2010–12. Due to the high
degree of concessionality of the donor support, however, this will not undermine fiscal
sustainability. Over the medium term, the fiscal deficit will need to be reduced to a level of
about 2 percent of GDP annually to ensure that debt ratios, which are picking up slightly this
year due to the disbursement of the Russian assistance and the depreciation of the som,
continue their downward trend. An updated debt sustainability analysis continues to place the
Kyrgyz Republic at a moderate risk of debt distress.
23.
The authorities are considering further revenue measures to ensure fiscal
sustainability over the medium term, when donor support may decline. Also, if growth
slows further or if the recovery is delayed, revenue measures could be needed if donor
assistance is to be preserved for the coming years. Excise rates on oil products have already
been increased. Further measures could include a partial reversal of the reduction in the VAT
rate and eliminating VAT exemptions on imported goods. Some increase in the VAT rate
may also be needed to proceed with the planned elimination of the cascading and therefore
less-efficient turnover tax by end-2011. Export duties on the export of wheat have expired.
The authorities are also exploring a range of measures to strengthen tax administration,
including improving large taxpayer administration, expanding audit operations, and
intensifying arrears collection, while assisting financially distressed taxpayers through paying
timely VAT refunds and providing payment options.
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy: Safeguarding External and Internal Stability
24.
The NBKR will allow continued exchange rate flexibility to absorb the large
external shocks, maintain competitiveness, and limit foreign exchange reserve losses. An
assessment of the exchange rate suggests that, in real effective terms, the som moved from
having been moderately undervalued to a slight overvaluation (see Box 3). Depending on the
movements of trading partners’ currencies, some further downward adjustment of the som
could be expected, to bring the exchange rate in line with its equilibrium. The NBKR
remains concerned, however, about a loss in confidence in the currency that could arise from
a sudden and disorderly depreciation. Therefore, while the NBKR will pursue a flexible
exchange rate policy, it will continue to intervene to smooth extreme volatility, but at a lower
scale. Interventions have been more limited in the last two months.
25.
Monetary policy will aim at further reducing inflation and mitigating exchange
rate pressures. Price pressures are expected to ease, reflecting the impact of declining
international commodity prices and the slowdown in activity, but the depreciation of the som
and recent and planned utility tariff increases will have some offsetting effects (see Box 4).
With large changes in money demand and a flexible exchange rate regime, the NBKR will
continue to follow a more discretionary approach toward monetary policy. The NBKR
recognized that during the coming months it would need to carefully manage the increase in

18
Box 3. Exchange Rate Assessment and Competitiveness
After a period of stability, the som appreciated sharply in real effective terms from mid-2007
until mid-2008. This mostly reflected the sharper rise in inflation in the Kyrgyz Republic than in
partner countries. The Kyrgyz Republic’s export growth (both including and excluding gold exports)
remained strong, however, and the country’s share in world exports has actually increased slightly.1

Comments

The macroeconomic balance approach suggests that the current level of the real exchange rate is
about 1¼ percent above the level consistent with the equilibrium current account deficit (the mediumterm current account norm) of about 3¼ percent of GDP. The external sustainability approach
indicates that in real effective terms, the som is about 2¼ percent above the value needed for the
current account to decline to a level that stabilizes the ratio of the country’s net foreign liabilities to
GDP at its 2008 level. The equilibrium real exchange rate approach suggests that the som has
moved from being slightly undervalued to marginally overvalued, by less than 3 percent.

proxy for unit labor cost) is high compared to other countries in the region, raising concerns on
manufacturing wage competitiveness in the Kyrgyz Republic. Nevertheless, the manufacturing

Improving productivity through broad-based structural reforms should therefore remain a
priority. Considerable progress has been made in the last two years in improving the business
environment, earning the Kyrgyz Republic a ranking as one of the top ten reformers of last year’s
World Bank Doing Business Survey, and moving it to ranking of 68 out of 181 countries. The Kyrgyz
Republic, however, was ranked 122nd among 134 countries in competitiveness (and the lowest among
the CIS countries ranked) by the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report.

Box 4. Determinants of Inflation in the Kyrgyz Republic
Inflation in the Kyrgyz Republic remained stable during 2002-06, but picked up sharply
starting in mid-2007. Inflation in the Kyrgyz Republic was successfully brought down to low doubledigits by 1995 with the implementation of a money-based stabilization program. Inflation rose again
during 1998–99 in the aftermath of the Russian financial crisis as the domestic currency depreciated
sharply. It was brought down again and remained stable at around 5 percent during 2002–06, before
rising again in the summer of 2007 and reaching a high of 32.5 percent in July 2008. The latest
inflationary episode was marked by a sharp increase in food prices, rising by 47 percent in the twelve
months through July 2008 and reflecting international developments. The prices of services rose by 30
percent during the same period, largely reflecting the pass-through effects of higher energy prices and
utility tariffs. Food accounts for almost 50 percent in the consumer basket and services for 10 percent.
Since mid-2008, inflation has come down steadily due to falling food and energy prices.

A Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model was estimated to explore the drivers of inflation. The
model uses monthly data for the period 1999:1-2008:12 for the following variables specified in the
order as listed: international food price index, real GDP, price for services (as a proxy for
administered prices), headline CPI, M2, and the som/dollar exchange rate. 1,2
The results suggest that a shock to broad money, international food prices, the som/dollar
exchange rate, and services prices are all significant. A shock to money results in an increase in
inflation with a lag of about 12 months. The impact of the shock increases over time and lasts for
12 months. In terms of exchange rate pass-through, a 10 percent depreciation of the som results in an
almost immediate 2.5 percent increase in inflation.

Some offsetting factors notwithstanding, the observed decline in international commodity prices
will contribute to a decline in inflation this year. With imported goods constituting close to
65 percent of the consumer basket, the depreciation of the exchange rate will, however, put upward
pressure on prices. Using the above analysis, a 25 percent depreciation in the som/dollar exchange rate
can add close to 5 percent to inflation. Another potential offsetting factor is the increase in energy
tariffs expected in the second half of 2009 (tariffs are captured in the price of services in the above
analysis).
___________________
1/ The ordering of variables is verified using Granger causality test where commodity food price index, GDP, and price of
services are shown to be exogenous relative to CPI, M2, and the exchange rate.
2/ All data with the exception of the exchange rate is seasonally adjusted. Unit root tests showed that all variables in the
system are I(1). There is also evidence of cointegration. Tests for lag structure specification revealed that the optimal lag
structure is three, and LM test indicated no autocorrelation.

liquidity resulting from the higher levels of government spending. The authorities also
acknowledged that as long as exchange rate pressures continue, there would be little room for
a change in interest rates, which remain at positive real levels. However, provided that
inflation continues on a downward path and exchange rate pressures ease, money demand
can be expected to recover and interest rates could be gradually reduced, to help stimulate
economic growth. Meanwhile, the NBKR is working out the details of a new refinancing
facility that would aim at providing liquidity to banks that lend domestically.
C. Financial Sector Policies: Maintaining the Banks’ Health
26.
The authorities recognized the risks to the banking system from the worsening
economic outlook and the spreading financial crisis. NPLs are likely to increase further as
the economy slows (see Box 5). Furthermore, although banks do not have large open foreign
exchange positions, the depreciation of the som may cause a deterioration in the quality of
foreign exchange loans made to unhedged borrowers. The high level of capitalization of
banks provides some cushion to these risks. Subsidiaries of Kazakh banks may still see a
decline in funding from their parent banks if the latter face increased difficulties.
27.
The authorities have taken a proactive approach to prepare for possible
financial sector problems. They have put together a crisis preparedness plan, including
plans for injecting capital into systemic banks if needed, funded from the budget. Emergency
liquidity facilities are in place. The introduction of deposit insurance is being advanced to
mid-2009 and the planned deposit insurance levels have been raised from about $500 per
household deposit to $2,500. The budget will ensure that the deposit insurance fund is fully
funded, with the banks’ contribution recovered over the next two years. The NBKR has also
stepped up monitoring of banks and required them to prepare their own contingency plans.
D. Structural Reforms
28.
The authorities continue to advance their broader structural reform agenda to
ensure that the Kyrgyz economy will be well-placed to benefit from a global recovery.
They are continuing with their efforts to strengthen public financial management, reduce the
administrative burden on businesses, including in the areas of taxation and trade, and fight
corruption.
29.
In the energy sector, policies are aimed at improving the sector’s financial
soundness, reducing demand, and increasing the supply of electricity. A second round of
electricity tariff increases is planned for this summer. A feasibility study for the large
Kambarata hydropower project is underway and a new joint venture with participation of

The banks came into the current crisis with some cushion. Capital adequacy was 27.7 percent in
March 2009, banks were still profitable, and highly liquid. After recovering from a banking crisis
partly triggered by the 1998 Russia crisis, the favorable global environment until late 2007 helped fuel
a credit boom driven by capital inflows and increased confidence in banks and the som. Deposits grew
and dollarization fell; annual credit growth reached over 80 percent in mid-2007, with the largest
share of loans supporting the trade sector. The strong overall economic performance boosted bank
profitability and strengthened their capital positions.
As the effects of the current crisis began to be felt—including through a slowing economy and
depreciation pressures on the som—dollarization of deposits crept up, while overall system
deposits declined. Non-performing loans rose to 7 percent in March 2009. The large share of Kazakh
subsidiaries in the system gives rise to concerns about spillover effects from difficulties encountered
by the parent banks. The subsidiaries reportedly have been more profitable than their parent banks
and, so far, funding from the parent banks has been broadly maintained. There is a risk of
retrenchment, however, arising from both the parent banks’ continuing difficulties as well as the
deterioration in performance expected in the subsidiaries from the economic slowdown. A few banks
have also faced some difficulties in securing credit lines with correspondent banks, as the latter have
become more sensitive to counterparty risks.

worsening economic conditions, unhedged
foreign currency borrowing, the concentration
of loans in the trade, mortgage and construction sectors, and a concentration of exposure to a few
large borrowers in some banks.
The authorities have been proactive in tackling these challenges along the following dimensions:
•

Deposit insurance has been raised to 100,000 som, with all commercial banks automatically
members of the fund. The government will provide the bulk of the initial funding, with
gradual reimbursement by the commercial banks to agreed levels through 2010. The deposit
insurance is expected to become operational in July 2009.

•

Contingency plans have been prepared in case of fast-moving events. These include
emergency liquidity support by the NBKR, and a newly adopted resolution that will allow for
capital injections into systemic banks through the budget, in the event that this should be
needed.

•

Close monitoring of banks, including of transactions with non-residents.

•

Banks have been required to prepare their own contingency plans. Banks have increased
liquidity, tightened lending standards, raised provisioning, cut costs, and have sought
alternative sources of funding.

Kyrgyz and Russian companies is being created for this project. If the project is considered
viable, the Russian partner is to arrange $1.7 billion in financing needed for the
construction. 3 With Kambarata, the Kyrgyz Republic would be able to meet its own
electricity needs and to export electricity. The latter would also require investment in
transmission lines.

3

Based on the current agreements, repayment of this loan would not be guaranteed by the Kyrgyz government.

25
V. RISKS
30.
The short-term economic outlook is subject to significant downside risks. A
deeper or longer than already projected recession in Russia and Kazakhstan would further
hurt growth and remittances. Banking sector difficulties in the region could also intensify,
spilling over to the Kyrgyz banking sector. The authorities are prepared, however, to deal
with a further worsening of the external environment and the assistance received from Russia
provides a large buffer. In case of a sharper economic downturn, a key concern would be to
ensure sufficient support to the poor. Over the medium term, once the region recovers,
growth in the Kyrgyz Republic may pick up at a faster pace than currently projected.
31.
Political uncertainty surrounding the upcoming elections and domestic tensions
could affect confidence or weaken the authorities’ ability to adhere to sound policies.
The upcoming elections may trigger an increase in spending over and above budget targets,
including by channeling donor assistance to off-budget funds. This would leave less funds
available to cover the financing needs of the central government budget in the coming years.
The authorities, however, expressed a strong commitment to use the support in a mediumterm budget framework.
32.
The Kambarata hydropower project could provide large benefits to the
Kyrgyz Republic, but is not without risks. Financing this project with loans would sharply
increase the country’s external debt (see the accompanying debt sustainability analysis).
Moreover, if the government were to assume any responsibility for the repayment of these
loans, public debt indicators would deteriorate dramatically. The authorities, however, have
indicated that any decision regarding Kambarata will not be made until the feasibility study is
completed and that they will continue to refrain from issuing any government guarantees.
VI. PROGRAM ISSUES
33.
Conditionality continues to center on macroeconomic policies. Performance
criteria have been agreed for end-June and end-December 2009 and are set out in Table 1
attached to the authorities’ supplementary Letter of Intent. Two additional structural
benchmarks have been added, again derived from the authorities’ policy agenda, which focus
on ensuring that the deposit insurance is fully funded and raising social benefits.
34.
A safeguards assessment update found a strengthened framework that meets the
expected standards under the Fund’s safeguards policy. The update found that the NBKR
continues to adhere to key aspects of the safeguards framework. In particular: (i) the NBKR
publishes its annual financial statements, together with the external audit opinions, on a
timely basis; (ii) the external audit is conducted in accordance with international standards
and the audit opinions have been unqualified; (iii) the building blocks for a modern internal
audit function are in place and this activity is playing an increasingly important role in
safeguarding the NBKR’s operations; and (iv) an audit oversight mechanism is in place,
following the establishment of an Audit Committee in 2008.

26
35.
The safeguards assessment considered the NBKR to be well-placed to build on
these foundations and complete the remaining challenges. These include: (i) allowing a
multi-year mandate for the bank’s external audit firm, subject to a periodical tendering and
rotation of the audit firm or partner every five to seven years; (ii) specifying a benchmark
financial reporting framework in the central bank law (while the NBKR’s financial
statements are de facto close to International Financial Reporting Standards, there is no
requirement to follow a specific benchmark); and (iii) consolidating the progress made in
modernizing the internal audit function through a strengthening of skills and resources.
VII. STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
The Kyrgyz Republic’s economic outlook has worsened further in recent
months. The global crisis is causing a sharper economic slowdown than already expected at
the time of approval of the ESF arrangement. This is creating revenue shortfalls and larger
balance of payments needs. Confidence in the national currency and the banking system has
weakened.
37.
The authorities’ macroeconomic policies, together with substantial and timely
donor support, will help mitigate the impact of the global crisis on the Kyrgyz economy.
The large support offered by the Russian Federation will more than cover the fiscal gap and
balance of payments needs. Without this support, stronger adjustment efforts would have
been needed to safeguard external stability, which in the short run would have hurt growth
further.
38.
Despite the worsening external environment, the authorities’ strategy designed
in the fall of 2008 remains appropriate. The larger donor support will allow fiscal policy to
provide an even stronger boost to the economy than envisaged earlier. The exchange rate is
broadly in line with fundamentals and continued exchange rate flexibility will help ensure
that external stability is maintained over the medium term. Monetary policy continues to
focus on reducing inflation and mitigating exchange rate pressures. Provided that inflation
continues to fall and demand for som recovers, a gradual easing of monetary policy could
help support growth. The provision of liquidity to banks should continue to remain free from
interference in banks’ lending decisions.
39.
Further revisions to the tax system would be needed to remove remaining
inefficiencies and ensure strong revenue collection over the longer term. Donor support
may decline over the medium term and higher revenue collection would be needed to
safeguard fiscal sustainability. A partial reversal of the reduction in the VAT rate and the
removal of import exemptions could also allow for the early elimination of the distortive
turnover tax. Revenue administration needs to be strengthened further, focusing particularly
on large taxpayers.
40.
The authorities have prepared themselves to deal with possible financial sector
difficulties. The banking system has weathered the crisis thus far and banks have some

27
buffer. The updated stress tests indicate vulnerabilities to credit and concentration risks and
the NBKR will need to continue to monitor banks closely. Putting the deposit insurance into
effect and increasing its coverage should help increase confidence in the banking system.
Until the depository issue can be addressed, the NBKR should retain its role as agent in
issuing, settling, and acting as depository of government securities.
41.
On the basis of the Kyrgyz Republic’s performance to date and the policy
intentions expressed by the authorities in the attached letter of intent, staff recommends
the completion of the first review under the ESF arrangement. Program implementation
has been strong and macroeconomic policies are sound.
42.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with the Kyrgyz Republic be held
in accordance with the decision on consultation cycles approved on July 15, 2002.

May 6, 2009
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20431

Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
In December 2008, the International Monetary Fund approved an arrangement under its
Exogenous Shocks Facility (ESF) for the Kyrgyz Republic, in support of our economic
program for 2008–09 aimed at managing the effects of the external shocks that have hit our
economy since early 2008. This support proved valuable and timely, and we are grateful to
the IMF for its support.
This letter describes the economic policies that we plan to implement during the rest of 2009.
As the global and regional economic outlook has continued to worsen, we remain committed
to implementing policies aiming to support growth and the poor, while keeping inflation on a
downward path and maintaining financial sector stability. In this regard, we remain, of
course, fully committed to carrying out the policies set out in our economic program attached
to our letter of intent dated November 25, 2008.
Recent Economic Developments
Overall economic performance in 2008 was still strong. Real GDP grew by 7.6 percent,
compared to 8.5 percent in 2007. The impact of the shocks that have hit our economy,
however, including the rise in commodity prices until mid-2008, a shortfall in hydropower,
and the slowdown in regional growth, contributed to a decline in activity outside the gold
sector. Real GDP excluding gold production slowed to 5.4 percent last year, from 9 percent
in 2007.
Inflation has come down sharply since spiking at over 30 percent in mid-2008. Reflecting a
tightening of monetary policy, declining international commodity prices, and slowing
domestic demand, 12-month inflation subsided to 20 percent by end-2008 and further to
13.6 percent in the 12 months through March 2009. Core inflation has remained relatively
high at 14.4 percent in March.
The current account balance deteriorated in 2008, mainly due to the higher cost of importing
food and fuel. Strong remittance inflows mitigated the widening trade deficit. The overall
balance still recorded a surplus and the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic’s (NBKR)

41
foreign exchange reserves increased slightly to $1,222 million by end-2008 (covering about
3½ months of imports).
Our national currency, the som, came under pressure, however, in the last quarter of 2008, as
the global financial crisis spread and the Russian ruble depreciated against the dollar.
Pressures on the exchange rate of the som intensified in early 2009, especially in the period
immediately following the devaluation of the Kazakh tenge. Since end-August, the som has
depreciated by about 25 percent against the dollar, while appreciating by about 10 percent
against the ruble. The NBKR allowed the exchange rate to adjust, but intervened to avoid an
overly rapid depreciation that could undermine confidence in the currency, contributing to a
decline in reserves to $1,042 million by end-March 2009.
Macroeconomic Policies for 2009
The outlook for the Kyrgyz economy has worsened as the global economic crisis has
intensified. The economic slowdown in several of our main regional partners, notably Russia
and Kazakhstan, is affecting growth in the Kyrgyz Republic via trade and remittance
channels, spilling over to domestic demand. As a result, economic growth is expected to slow
sharply to less than 1 percent in 2009. The slowdown in activity is creating fiscal and balance
of payment gaps in 2009 that are expected to persist in 2010. These gaps are covered,
however, by the sizable and timely financial support provided by the Russian Federation.
This support will help us weather the effects of the global economic crisis and avoid a major
contraction in economic activity.
We will use the $450 million in concessional budget support provided by the Russian
Federation in a medium-term fiscal framework, and intend to use $165 million during 2009.
This allows fiscal policy to accommodate the large shortfall in government revenues
expected for 2009, while creating some room for an increase in spending, both of which will
support growth. Measured by the primary fiscal balance excluding grants, this will imply a
fiscal stimulus of almost 6 percent of GDP. The overall fiscal balance will remain limited to
less than 2 percent of GDP.
Particular emphasis will be given to capital spending, which improves medium-term growth
prospects, but also to social support. The decline in economic activity and, even more so, the
expected decline in remittance inflows will result in a considerable reduction in disposable
household incomes that threatens to reverse much of the gains in poverty reduction achieved
in recent years. To mitigate the effects on the poorest segments of the population, as of
July 1, 2009, we will top up the Unified Monthly Benefit (UMB) by another Som 40 per
UMB recipient (structural benchmark for July), in addition to the Som 35 top-up introduced
in October 2008, which we will maintain. Meanwhile, we will continue our work to refine
the eligibility criteria for the UMB to improve its targeting, for implementation in 2010. We
are furthermore considering options to increase revenue collection, including changes in the
tax structure, tax rates, and measures to strengthen tax administration.

42
The NBKR will continue to aim its policies at further reducing inflation and maintaining
financial sector stability. With interest rates at positive real levels and the easing of
international price pressures, but taking into account additional increases in utility tariffs and
the impact of the depreciation of the som, we expect 12-month inflation to fall to within a
range of 10–15 percent by end-2009. The NBKR will allow continued exchange rate
flexibility to absorb the large external shocks, maintain competitiveness, and limit reserve
losses. The NBKR will manage commercial banks’ excess liquidity through its operations in
the financial markets. Should it be necessary to act decisively to withdraw liquidity, the
NBKR is prepared to raise interest rates on its securities and repurchase operations.
However, provided that inflation continues on a downward path and exchange rate pressures
ease, interest rates could be eased gradually, to help stimulate economic growth.
Banks have held up well to the global financial crisis. Bank capitalization and liquidity
remain high. Credit growth, however, has come to a halt, as demand for financing has
weakened and banks have become more cautious. Non-performing loans have started to rise
and are likely to increase further as the economy slows. Deposits have fallen and new
funding from external sources has been drying up. In this more challenging financial
environment, the NBKR has taken a proactive approach and is monitoring banks closely. We
have prepared contingency plans that envisage emergency liquidity support by the NBKR,
and possible capital injections by the government for systemic banks (which would require
revisions to the budget). The NBKR has also required banks to prepare their own
contingency plans. Legislation to advance the date at which the deposit insurance scheme
comes into effect and to increase coverage of household deposits from $500 to $2,500 was
approved in March. In accordance with this legislation, we will ensure that the deposit
insurance fund will be fully funded by end-June to enable the deposit insurance to come into
effect on July 1, 2009 (structural benchmark).
While our main focus is on macroeconomic policies to manage the spillover effects of the
global economic crisis, we will continue to advance structural reforms, to improve
macroeconomic management and ensure strong growth over the longer term. In this regard,
we will continue with our efforts to further strengthen public financial management, reduce
the administrative burden on businesses, including in the areas of taxation and trade, enhance
financial intermediation, strengthen the energy sector, and fight corruption.
Program Monitoring
All performance criteria for end-December 2008 under the ESF arrangement were met. We
also observed the structural benchmarks for end-2008. We therefore request the completion
of the first review under the arrangement and the disbursement of the second tranche of
SDR 16.65 million.
As the ESF arrangement is subject to semi-annual reviews, we understand that the second
and third reviews are expected to be completed no later than November 2009 and May 2010,

43
respectively, and will require observance of the quantitative performance criteria for endJune and end-December 2009, respectively, set out in Table 1 attached to this letter and
described in more detail in the attached revised Technical Memorandum of Understanding
(TMU).
The current economic environment remains highly uncertain and risks are on the downside.
We believe that the policies set forth in our economic program attached to our letter of
November 25, 2008 and as supplemented by this letter are adequate to achieve our
objectives, but we are prepared to take all additional measures necessary to achieve these
objectives. We will consult with the IMF on the adoption of these measures and in advance
of any revision to the policies contained in our economic program, in accordance with the
IMF’s policies on such consultation. The Kyrgyz government and the NBKR will continue to
provide the Fund with the necessary information for assessing progress in implementing our
program, as specified in the attached revised TMU, and will maintain a close policy dialogue
with the IMF staff.
We authorize the IMF to publish this Letter of Intent and its attachments, as well as the
related staff report on the Fund’s website following consideration of our request by the IMF’s
Executive Board.

Sincerely yours,

/s/
Igor Chudinov
Prime Minister of the Kyrgyz Republic

REVISED TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The Kyrgyz Republic’s performance during the period January 1, 2009–
December 31, 2009 under the 18-month arrangement under the Exogenous Shocks Facility
will be assessed by the IMF on the basis of the observance of quantitative performance
criteria and structural benchmarks. This memorandum and its attached tables define the
quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets under the ESF-supported program. It
reflects the Economic Program of the Kyrgyz authorities as attached to their Letter of Intent
dated November 25, 2008 and updated in their Letter of Intent dated May 6, 2009.
2.
The program exchange rate of the Kyrgyz som to the U.S. dollar is set at som
38.2101 = $1. The corresponding cross exchange rates and program gold price for the
duration of the program are provided in Table 7.
3.
Central government and republican government are synonymous in this
memorandum. The State budget comprises central and local government budgets. The
general government budget comprises the State and Social Fund budgets.
II. QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
4.
The quantitative targets (i.e., quantitative performance criteria) for end-June 2009 and
end-December 2009 as presented in Table 1 attached to the letter, dated May 6, 2009, are
defined below.
A. Floor on net international reserves of the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic
(NBKR) in convertible currencies
5.
The program contains a floor on the stock of net international reserves of the NBKR
in convertible currencies. This floor will be calculated as the difference between total
international reserve assets and total international reserve liabilities of the NBKR in
convertible currencies.
6.
Total international reserve assets of the NBKR are defined as the NBKR holdings of
monetary gold, holdings of SDRs, any reserve position in the IMF, and any holdings of
convertible foreign currencies in cash or with foreign banks, and debt instruments (including
accrued interest) issued by nonresidents that are liquid. Amounts pledged as collateral or in
swaps or otherwise encumbered, capital subscriptions in foreign financial institutions, and
illiquid assets of the NBKR are excluded. Also excluded are net forward positions, defined as
the difference between the face value of foreign currency denominated NBKR off-balance
sheet claims on nonresidents and foreign currency obligations to both residents and
nonresidents. For program monitoring purposes, international reserve assets shall be valued
at program exchange rates and gold prices. Total international reserve liabilities of the NBKR
in convertible currencies are defined as outstanding liabilities to the IMF and other
convertible currency liabilities to nonresidents with an original maturity of up to and

47
including one year. For program monitoring purposes, total international reserve liabilities
will be valued at the program exchange rates as described in paragraph 2 above.
7.
Thus calculated, the stock of net international reserves in convertible currencies
amounted to $988 million at December 31, 2008 and $833 million at March 31, 2009. The
program floors on the NIR of the NBKR in convertible currencies are reported in Table 1
below.

1/ End-of-period stocks.

8.
The NBKR’s net foreign assets consist of net international reserve assets plus other
net foreign assets, including the medium- and long-term foreign obligations of the NBKR,
other net claims on CIS countries, amounts pledged as collateral or in swaps or otherwise
encumbered, net forward positions, capital subscriptions in foreign financial institutions, and
illiquid assets. For program monitoring purposes, the other net foreign assets will also be
valued at the program exchange rates.
9.
The floor on net international reserves of the NBKR will be adjusted
upward/downward to the full extent of any excess/shortfall in program grants and program
loans as given in table 4, and upward/downward to the full extent that amortization of public
external debt is less/more than the amortization given in table 4.
B. Ceiling on the net domestic assets of the NBKR
10.
Net domestic assets of the NBKR are defined as reserve money of the NBKR
(defined below), minus the NBKR’s net foreign assets as defined above, minus the
counterpart of the loan by the Eximbank of Turkey and the counterpart of the EBRD and
IDA enterprise loans. Items in foreign currencies will be valued at the program exchange
rates.
NDA=RM–NFA–Turkish Loan–EBRD-IDA Enterprise Loan
11.
Thus defined, the NBKR’s net domestic assets consist of: (a) gross credit to the
general government from the NBKR, minus deposits of the general government with the
NBKR, minus the counterpart of the loan by the Eximbank of Turkey; (b) gross credit to
domestic banks by the NBKR, minus the counterpart of the EBRD and IDA enterprise loans;
and (c) all other net assets of the NBKR (other items net). Thus defined, the stock of the
NBKR’s net domestic assets amounted to minus Som 2,705 million on December 31, 2008
and minus Som 2,318 on March 31, 2009.

13.
The ceiling on net domestic assets of the NBKR will be adjusted downward/upward
to the full extent of any excess/shortfall in program grants and program loans as given in
table 4, and downward/upward to the full extent that amortization of public external debt is
more/less than the amortization given in table 4.
C. Ceiling on the cumulative overall deficit of the general government
14.
The overall deficit of the general government is defined as the sum of: (a) the change
in the stock of net claims of the domestic banking system and nonfinancial institutions—
including state-owned enterprises and public companies—and households on the general
government; (b) the change in the stock of net claims of the foreign banking system and
nonfinancial institutions and households on the general government; (c) net privatization
receipts including from any new sales or purchases of shares; (d) net foreign loans disbursed
to the state government for budgetary support; and (e) net foreign loans disbursed to the
general government for project financing. The targets for the fiscal balance are based on an
Som/US dollar exchange rate of 42.8140. Adjustments, as defined in paragraph 17, will be
made using program exchange rates.
15.
The change in the stock of net claims of the domestic banking system on the general
government is defined as the change in the stock of the banking system claims on the general
government, less the change in the stock of all deposits of the general government with the
banking system. The claims of the banking system on the general government include: (a)
bank loans to the general government; (b) securities or bills issued by the general government
held by banks, with the exception of those issued in relation with bank rescue operations; and
(c) overdrafts on the current accounts of the general government with banks.
16.
The program ceilings on the cumulative overall deficit of the general government are
reported in Table 3 below. The ceiling on the overall budget deficit of the general
government will be adjusted upward to the full extent that concessional foreign loans with a
grant element of at least 35 percent disbursed to the budget are higher than the amounts given
in Table 4. The ceiling on the overall budget deficit of the general government will also be

49
adjusted upward to the full extent that program grants received are less than the amounts
given in Table 4. The ceiling on the overall budget deficit of the general government will be
adjusted downward/upward to the full extent that disbursements of PIP loans are less/more
than the amounts given in Table 4. The ceiling on the overall budget deficit of the general
government will be adjusted downward/upward to the full extent that amortization of public
external debt is less/more than the amortization given in Table 4.

D. Ceilings on contracting or guaranteeing of new external debt by the state
government of the Kyrgyz Republic or the NBKR or any other agency acting on behalf
of the state government
17.
In connection with the contracting or guaranteeing of external debt by the state
government of the Kyrgyz Republic, the NBKR, or any other agency acting on behalf of the
state government of the Kyrgyz Republic, “debt” is understood to have the meaning set out in
point 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with respect to External Debt in Fund
arrangements (Decision No. 12274–00/85, dated August 24, 2000). 1
18.
External debt ceilings apply to (a) the contracting or guaranteeing of new nonconcessional short term external debt (i.e. external debt with an original maturity of less than
one year and grant element less that 35 percent, except normal import-related credits and
NBKR reserve liabilities); and (b) contracting or guaranteeing of nonconcessional mediumand long-term external debt (i.e., external debt with an original maturity of one year or more
and with grant element of less that 35 percent). Disbursements by the Fund are excluded
from the ceilings on external debt. Also excluded from these external debt ceilings is the
contracting or guaranteeing of new external debt that constitutes a rescheduling or
refinancing of existing external debt at terms more favorable to the debtor. The limit on the
contracting or guaranteeing of short-term external debt is zero on a continuous basis
throughout the period of the arrangement. The limit on the contracting or guaranteeing of
medium- and long-term nonconcessional external debt is also zero and on a continuous basis
throughout the period of the arrangement, as specified in Table 1 of the economic program of
the authorities.

1

Debt is understood to mean a current, i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual arrangement
through the provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which requires the
obligor to make one or more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at some future
point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the
contract. Debt can take a number of forms, the primary ones being as follows: (a) loans, i.e., advances of money
to the obligor by the lender made on the basis of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the
future (including deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans and buyers’ credits) and temporary exchanges
of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which the obligor is required to repay the funds,
and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase
agreements and official swap arrangements); (b) suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the
obligor to defer payments until some time after the date on which the goods are delivered or services are
provided; and (c) leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee has the right to
use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter than the total expected service life of the
property, while the lessor retains the title to the property. For the purpose of the guideline, the debt is the
present value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the period of the
agreement excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair or maintenance of the property.
Under the above definition of debt, arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to
make payment under a contractual obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an
obligation that is not considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt.

51
19.
For the purposes of the ceiling on contracting and guaranteeing new external debt,
any other agency acting on behalf of the state government will in particular include the
Development Fund and the Kazakh-Kyrgyz Fund as well as all nonfinancial public
enterprises with share capitals of not less than Kyrgyz som 100 million in which the state
government holds at least 51 percent of the share capital.
E. Ceiling on accumulation of new external payments arrears
20.
For the purposes of the program, external payment arrears will consist of all
debt-service obligations (i.e., payments of principal or interest) arising in respect of any debt
contracted or guaranteed or assumed by the state government of the Kyrgyz Republic, or the
NBKR, or any agency acting on behalf of the state government of the Kyrgyz Republic since
the Kyrgyz Republic’s independence, including, without limitations, unpaid penalties,
interest charges or judicially awarded damages associated with these arrears owed by the
state government of the Kyrgyz Republic, or the NBKR, or any agency acting on behalf of
the state government of the Kyrgyz Republic. The ceiling on new external payment arrears
shall apply on a continuous basis throughout the period of the ESF arrangement.
III. INDICATIVE TARGETS
A. Ceiling on reserve money
21.
For the purposes of the program, reserve money consists of currency issued by the
NBKR and balances on commercial banks’ correspondent accounts with the NBKR. The
indicative program limits are reported in Table 5 below.

services; specific taxes on services; turnover taxes; taxes on property; taxes on international
trade; and other taxes. Cumulative tax collections in cash include collections of tax arrears
but exclude tax offsets.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
KYRGYZ REPUBLIC
Joint World Bank/IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by the Staffs of the International Monetary Fund
and the World Bank
Approved by David Owen and Ranil Manohara Salgado (IMF) and
Luca Barbone and Carlos Alberto Braga (World Bank)
May 11, 2009
Based on the joint World Bank-IMF Low-Income Country Debt Sustainability Framework,
the Kyrgyz Republic is assessed to be at a moderate risk of external debt distress. 1 Compared
to the previous joint DSA, the long-term debt outlook did not change. Some stress tests suggest
that the country is still vulnerable, particularly to a combination of exogenous shocks.
Further improvement of the debt outlook will depend on maintaining sound macroeconomic
policies; including prudent borrowing, as well as ensuring continued concessional financing
to support the country’s large development needs.
I. BACKGROUND
The Kyrgyz Republic’s nominal stock of public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external
debt declined from about 100 percent in 2003 to 70 percent of GDP in 2006, and further
to 42 percent in 2008. The decline has been mainly the result of an acceleration in the pace
of economic growth and a nominal appreciation of the domestic currency, but also reflects
firm fiscal discipline and Paris Club support. The present value (PV) of PPG external debt
was equivalent to $1,355 million (27 percent of GDP) at end-2008, of which 70 percent is
owed to international financial institutions (IFIs) and the remaining 30 percent to bilateral
creditors. The external private debt reached four percent of GDP at end-2008.
The Kyrgyz Republic had two debt restructuring agreements with the Paris Club. The
first debt restructuring with the Paris Club, in December 2002, provided for flow
rescheduling, in three phases and on Houston terms, of maturities falling due between
December 2001 and April 2005, all of which have been implemented. The second, in
March 2005, under the Evian approach, stipulated that the full amount of principal payments
on official development assistance credits was to be repaid over 40 years, with a
1

The DSA has been produced jointly by Bank and Fund staffs, in consultation with Asian Development Bank
staff and the Kyrgyz authorities. The fiscal year for the Kyrgyz Republic is January 1–December 31.

2
13-year grace period, at interest rates at least as favorable as the original concessional rates
applied to those loans. The Kyrgyz authorities indicated in early 2007 that they did not wish
to avail themselves of the HIPC initiative, but subsequently expressed interest for the MDRI.
At end-2008, indebtedness indicators were estimated to be below the applicable HIPC
Initiative thresholds, while income levels were estimated to be above the IMF MDRI
thresholds.
II. UNDERLYING DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS ASSUMPTIONS
The macroeconomic assumptions reflect the framework underlying the current IMF
program and World Bank and IMF staff projections through 2029. They have been
updated to incorporate recent developments and changes to the medium-term outlook, but
long-term assumptions are broadly similar to the framework used in the last DSA. The data
on the stock of external debt at end-2008 and debt payment schedule were provided by the
Kyrgyz authorities, except for the data on the World Bank and Asian Development Bank
debt, which were provided directly by the two institutions.
The framework assumes continuation of sound macroeconomic policies—including
fiscal consolidation and prudent public debt management—as a basis for sustaining
growth (Box 1). The baseline projections do not rely on substantially higher growth rates
than the historical average nor on significant improvement in loan terms. Growth would be
underpinned by firm implementation of structural reforms to remove impediments to private
investment and stimulate economic diversification. The framework features average long-run
GDP growth of about five percent per year over 2011–29, in line with growth assumed in the
last DSA, backed by strong private investments (including foreign direct investment) spurred
by improvements in the business climate. The external current account deficit is projected to
decline from 6.3 percent of GDP in 2009 to 4.7 percent in 2029.
The main change compared with the last DSA is the financial package from the Russian
Federation agreed in February 2009. This includes the cancellation of the existing Russian
debt of $194 million (with a PV of $126 million), the contracting of a $300 million
concessional loan (with a PV of $132 million), and a grant of $150 million for budget
support. An agreement has also been reached between the governments of the Russian
Federation and the Kyrgyz Republic to set up a joint stock company to construct the
Kambarata-I hydropower dam. Russia's RAO UES will own 50 percent of the company, and
the remaining 50 percent will be owned by a Kyrgyz company which itself is about
90 percent owned by the Kyrgyz government. A pre-feasibility study is underway and is
expected to be finalized in July, and, depending on the outcome, this is expected to be
followed by a formal feasibility study. It is unclear, however, whether these studies will
conclude that the project is economically viable. Given the very large uncertainty associated
with the project, it is not incorporated in the DSA. Nevertheless, some analysis is included to
explore the potential impact on the external debt sustainability, which is reported in Box 2.

3
Box 1. Baseline Macroeconomic Assumptions
Real GDP growth is projected to average about 5 percent over the longer term, only marginally higher
than the historical average of about 4½ percent, on the back of strong private investment, including
FDI, spurred by improvements in the business climate. Affected by the global and regional slowdown
combined with weaker domestic demand due to lower remittances inflows and slowdown in credit
expansion, GDP growth is expected to be depressed in the near term. In the medium term, however,
growth will rebound, supported by continued development of the mining industry, the resumed
reforms in the energy sector, and an increase in tourism.
The gradual decline in gold output is assumed to be compensated by gains in tourism receipts and
other exports. In all, annual growth of exports of goods and services, including estimates for informal
agricultural exports and reexports of consumer goods, would average 6¾ percent over the long term,
maintaining the export-to-GDP ratio at about 66 percent. Consistent with growth projections and
expected FDI inflows, imports of goods and services would grow at about 6½ percent per year over
the long term, with the import-to-GDP ratio declining slightly to 86 percent. Remittances are
projected to slow down in the near term, but will remain strong over medium and long term, with
their ratio to GDP gradually declining.
Net FDI inflows would stay at about 4 percent of GDP over the long term. While in the near-term
FDI would be concentrated in sectors like mining, financial services, and industry, the business
climate improvements should yield a more diversified structure of FDI in the outer years.
International reserves would be kept above three months of imports of goods and services.
Medium-term public borrowing is assumed to be on highly concessional terms. Over the DSA
horizon, concessionality of new external public borrowing would gradually decline from around
42.8 percent in 2009–14 to 12.8 percent in 2015–29, as more borrowing will be contracted at less
concessional terms from bilateral and commercial creditors.
Consistent with the assumption of continued sound fiscal and monetary policies, inflation (measured
by the GDP deflator) would average 4½ percent annually over 2011–29. Expenditure controls and a
strengthening of revenue performance will bring the primary balance back to a low level of below
½ percent of GDP on average in 2015–29. As a result, the public sector debt would stabilize at just
under 50 percent of GDP over the longer term.

4
III. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
A. Baseline
The baseline scenario points to a cautiously favorable improvement in the external debt
outlook over time. Already by end-2008, the PV of debt-to-exports and the PV of debt-torevenue ratios, at 43 and 94 percent respectively, were well below their policy-based
indicative thresholds. 2 Only the PV of PPG debt-to-GDP ratio, at 27 percent, is closer to its
relevant threshold of 40 percent in 2008. Over the DSA horizon, all debt ratios move steadily
on a downward path underpinned by steady growth, fiscal consolidation, and prudent debt
management.
Debt service is expected to remain manageable throughout the DSA horizon. This
reflects the high concessionality of both the outstanding multilateral debt and the assumed
new borrowing over the medium term. The PPG debt service ratio would increase slightly
from 3.5 percent of exports (5.3 percent of revenues) in 2008 to 7.5 percent of exports
(11.4 percent of revenues) in 2029, driven by less-concessional new borrowing and the
repayment of the previously restructured bilateral debt.
B. Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests
Stress tests and alternative scenarios show that the Kyrgyz Republic’s external debt is
vulnerable to large shocks or substantially less favorable assumptions. The PV of the
external debt-to-GDP ratio and the PV of the external debt-to-revenue rise above the relevant
indicative thresholds under some tests. The PV of debt-to-GDP ratio rises above the
indicative threshold of 40 percent in the medium term (or even over the longer term) when
(i) export value growth is at historical average minus one standard deviation in 2010−11;
(ii) the net non-debt creating inflows over 2010−11 are one standard deviation below their
historical average; and (iii) under a shock over 2010−11 combining lower GDP and export
growth, currency depreciation, and lower net non-debt creating inflows. The ratio of PV of
debt-to-revenue would also rise above the relevant indicative threshold of 250 percent in the
medium term under the last two conditions. However, the PV of debt-to-exports ratio is
robust and does not breach its threshold under various tests. Debt service ratios also prove
resilient, staying below their indicative threshold levels under various tests. The historical
scenario—where key macro variables evolve according to their historic averages—points to a
more benign external debt outlook than the baseline scenario.

2

The Kyrgyz Republic is rated as a medium performer based on the World Bank’s Country Performance and
Institutional Assessment Index for low income countries. The relevant policy-dependent thresholds for
countries in this category are 40 percent for the PV of the debt-to-GDP ratio, 150 percent for the PV of debt-toexports ratio, 250 percent for the PV of debt-to-revenue ratio, 20 percent of the debt service-to-exports ratio,
and 30 percent of the debt service-to-revenue ratio.

Box 2. Kambarata-I Loan
The Kambarata hydropower project could provide large benefits to the Kyrgyz Republic, but is
not without risks. The Kambarata-I loan would substantially increase Kyrgyz Republic’s external
debt burden, especially in the medium term. According
PV of total external debt-to-GDP ratio
to the agreement reached between the Russian and
Kyrgyz governments, the Russian partner of the joint
stock company would provide $1.7 billion in financing at
LIBOR plus three percent, with an eight-year grace
period, and twenty-year maturity. It is assumed that the
construction of the dam would start in 2011, with full
production capacity reached in 2019. Growth would
benefit during the construction phase, although a large

part of the materials would be imported. Growth rates
PV of total external debt-to-exports ratio
would also increase somewhat once production of
electricity starts, but will level off once the production
capacity is reached. Electricity output in excess of
domestic demand is assumed to be exported at six cents
per kWh. Over the DSA period, on average about half of
the output is assumed to be exported. The PV of external
debt-to-GDP and debt-to-exports ratios would shoot up
over the next few years when the loan is disbursed, and
gradually decline over the longer term as electricity export receipts are used to repay the debt.

Based on current agreements, repayment of the loan would not be guaranteed by the government. But
if the government were to assume any responsibility for the repayment of these loans, public debt
indicators would deteriorate dramatically. The authorities, however, have indicated that any decision
regarding Kambarata will not be made until the feasibility study is completed and that they will
continue to refrain from issuing any government guarantees.

IV. PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
A. Baseline
Domestic debt is projected to increase and will play a more important role in financing
the budget deficit in the medium and long term. Domestic debt currently accounts for less
than 10 percent of total public debt. However, by 2029, domestic debt is projected to reach
40 percent of total public debt as domestic financial markets deepen.
The Kyrgyz Republic’s public debt outlook is projected to be manageable in the
medium and long term. Under the baseline scenario, the PV of public debt to GDP ratio
increases gradually from 33 percent in 2009 to 46 percent by 2029 reflecting declining

6
concessionality of new external borrowing and increased domestic debt. The tax revenue
ratio will increase from 23 percent in 2008 to 25 percent by 2029. The tax revenue ratio will
drop somewhat in 2009 due to tax cuts introduced with the new tax code and, in addition,
declining economic activity and lower commodity prices affecting the tax base. However, in
the longer run, tax collection will gradually recover and, aided by continued tax reforms and
discipline on the expenditure side, contribute to the sustainability of public debt indicators.
B. Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests
Alternative scenarios and stress tests show that Kyrgyz Republic’s public debt remains
sensitive to shocks that reduce real GDP growth. The standard sensitivity analysis based
on the historical variation of key parameters, including real GDP growth and exchange rate,
shows that debt ratios will rise considerably in the long run. Under different stress tests and
scenarios, the PV debt-to-GDP ratio in 2029 will vary from about 33 percent under the fixed
(at 2009 level) primary deficit scenario to 95 percent under the permanent real GDP growth
shock scenario.
V. DEBT DISTRESS CLASSIFICATION AND CONCLUSIONS
Based on the projected external debt burden indicators, Kyrgyz Republic is assessed to
be at moderate risk of debt distress. The public DSA suggests that Kyrgyz Republic’s total
public sector debt seems manageable in light of the dynamics of the domestic debt stock. All
PV-based external debt indicators in the baseline are projected to stay below their indicative
thresholds over the DSA horizon. Moreover, under the baseline scenario, the debt service
burden would remain well below the thresholds, reflecting the high concessionality of the
external debt. Nevertheless, alternative scenarios and stress tests show that the external
public debt indicators could approach or breach the thresholds if the Kyrgyz Republic were
to experience large adverse exogenous shocks or relax its prudent debt management policy.
This conclusion is consistent with the last DSA.
Low-concessionality loans from bilateral and commercial creditors to finance large
public investment projects continue to pose a risk to the debt outlook. Staff recognizes
that the Kyrgyz Republic has large developmental needs, but considers paramount to lock in
the recent progress towards achieving and maintaining debt sustainability. Even if loans have
a grant element of at least 35 percent, it would be important to ensure that the underlying
projects are viable and that market risks, including exchange rate risk, are accounted for, so
as to avoid the build up of an unsustainable debt burden. Similarly, it would remain
important for the government to not provide any guarantees for commercial loans, including
in the energy sector.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - d(1+g)]/(1+g+d+gd) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and d = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. Projections also include contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Status of HIPC and MDRI Assistance

The Executive Board considered the preliminary HIPC document on October 13, 2006.
However, in 2007, the authorities have decided not to avail themselves of HIPC and MDRI
assistance. The updated LIC DSA shows that the Kyrgyz Republic does not qualify for HIPC
debt relief.
VIII.

Safeguards Assessments

Under the Fund’s safeguards assessments policy, the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic
(NBKR) is subject to an update assessment in conjunction with a new arrangement under the
high-access component of the Exogenous Shocks Facility. The update assessment was
completed April 9, 2009. Previous assessments were completed in October 2005 and in
January 2002. The 2009 assessment found a strengthened safeguards framework at the
central bank, but raised concerns and made recommendations about the need for updated
terms of reference for audits of program data, and the lack of a benchmark financial reporting
framework and multi-year audit appointments.
IX.

Exchange Rate Arrangements

The currency of the Kyrgyz Republic has been the som (100 tyiyn =1 som) since
May 15, 1993. The de jure exchange rate arrangement is other managed arrangement. The
National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR) participates and intervenes in the interbank
foreign exchange market to limit exchange rate volatility as necessary. Effective
February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been
changed from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to other
managed arrangement retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification
methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not
imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the country’s exchange
arrangement or other policies. The NBKR publishes daily the exchange rate of the som in
terms of the U.S. dollar, which is determined in the interbank foreign exchange market. The
official exchange rate of the som against the dollar is defined as the weighted average of the
exchange rates of the interbank foreign exchange market transactions for the week.
The Kyrgyz Republic maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making
of payments and transfers for current international transactions, except for exchange
restrictions maintained for security reasons relating to the restriction of financial transactions
and the freeze of accounts of certain individuals or organizations associated with terrorism
pursuant to (i) relevant UN Security Council resolutions and (ii) the list of current terrorist
organizations designated by the U.S. Secretary of State. The authorities have notified these
measures to the Fund pursuant to Executive Board decision No. 144-(52/51) in May 2007.

Article IV Consultations

The Kyrgyz Republic is on the 24-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation
discussions were held in August 2006 and were completed by the Executive Board in
November 2006 (see IMF Country Report No. 07/135).
XI.

FSAP Participation and ROSC Assessment

An FSAP update mission in October 2006 reviewed progress since the 2002 assessment, and
the Board considered the Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) along with the 4th
PRGF review in May 2007. A fiscal ROSC mission was held in March 2001 and the ROSC
Fiscal Transparency Module was published on March 13, 2002. A data ROSC mission was
held in November 2002 and the ROSC Data Module was published in November 2003. A
fiscal ROSC reassessment was held in September 2007.

Resident Representative

The seventh resident representative of the Fund in the Kyrgyz Republic, Mr. McHugh, took
up his post in Bishkek in late September 2006.

ANNEX II. KYRGYZ REPUBLIC––RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of May 1, 2009)
The Joint Country Support Strategy (JCSS) covering FY07–10, a joint strategy of the
donor community closely aligned with the Government’s development goals was approved
by the Board on June 19, 2007 to support implementation of the Country Development
Strategy (CDS). The WB Country team jointly with seven development partners (Asian
Development Bank, European Commission, the German Government, IMF, Swiss
Cooperation, UK DFID, and United Nations Agencies) is currently preparing a mid-term
progress report to assess progress in implementation of the JCSS and to review the overall
strategic direction for the remaining JCSS period of 2009–10 in light of the new challenges
faced by the Government stemming from the ongoing regional and global financial crisis.
The Government also updated the CDS in 2008 to present its key priorities for 2009–2011.
The JCSS progress report due in May 2009 would reflect the new priorities and will continue
to ensure coordination of donor assistance in support of the government development
objectives.
The World Bank Group Program within JCSS. The WBG program contributes to the
strategic goals outlined in the JCSS, with a particular focus on supporting the Government’s
efforts to improve the environment for business and economic growth and improve the
quality of and access to basic services (health, education, water and sanitation). The WBG
strategy emphasizes greater selectivity given the limited IDA resources and limitations
placed on the Government’s own public investment program. Building on lessons learned,
and in line with the principles of the JCSS, the Bank Program builds on successful results
achieved in first generation projects, targets activities where the Bank can show visible
results to the population, and leverage lending and analytical work to attract financing from
other development partners.
The proposed annual allocation for the Kyrgyz Republic under JCSS 2007–2010 is about
$46 million U.S. dollars. To respond to short term needs arising from rapid increase in food
and energy prices, the World Bank increased its activities significantly in 2008 by approving
additional financing for the Agricultural Investment and Services project of US$4.0 million
and additional financing of US$6.0 million for the Health and Social Protection SWAp, a
$10 million Energy Emergency Project to secure fuel supplies for the Bishkek power station
for winter 08/09, bringing the total disbursement over 2007–08 to $126 million. Additional
financing for VIP-II in amount of US$7 million to maintain the momentum and complete the
4-year support cycle in all ayl okmotuu (local self government territories) and additional
financing for STI project in amount of US$4 million to finalize sub-projects in four towns are
planned to be provided in FY09.
The Bank Group is currently reviewing its program within the context of the JCSS progress
report to provide support where the real need is demonstrated and where it can complement

6
the existing donor support. In addition to the existing programs, support is envisaged for
reforms in the electricity, state owned enterprises, and the education sectors.
IDA allocation: The World Bank has upgraded the status of the Kyrgyz Republic under
IDA–15 program from ‘red light’ to ‘yellow light,’ reflecting the country’s improved status
to “moderate risk” of debt distress, as assessed by the latest WB/IMF debt sustainability
analysis (DSA). The Kyrgyz Republic is assessed to be at moderate risk of debt distress
because, starting in 2007, all external debt indicators in the baseline are projected to stay
below the indicative threshold over the DSA horizon. Therefore, future IDA allocations for
the Kyrgyz Republic will be on a 45% grant /55% credit basis.
IDA Portfolio As of March 2009, the active Bank portfolio (Table 2) in the Kyrgyz Republic
comprises 18 operations with total commitments of US$ 191.7million, of which US$115.92
(60%) million remains undisbursed. In addition to 18 projects financed by IDA, the
World Bank manages EFT–FTA funds and donors TFs for Health & Social Protection
SWAp, and a TF on Public Financial Management currently under preparation.
New projects on Bishkek-Osh Infrastructure (US$12 million), Agricultural Investment and
Services (US$9 million), Real Estate and Land Registration-II (US$6 million), and Economic
Management Capacity Building TA (US$12 million) were approved by the Board in FY08.
In addition to the four projects, the Board approved amendments in amount of US$10 million
for two ongoing projects Health & Social Protection SWAp and AISP as a response to food
price crisis. Both the Health SWAp portion (US$6 million) and the agriculture support part
(US$4 million) have been declared effective and actual disbursement for the Unified
Monthly Benefit top-ups commenced with effect from October 1, 2008. Additional financing
for the Small Towns Infrastructure and Capacity Building Project ($4 million) was approved
by the Board on March 31, 2009. In addition to the country portfolio, the Kyrgyz Republic
also benefits from the regional HIV/AIDS project. Osh–Isfana Road and Rural Water
Sanitation-II are under preparation.
IFC Program and Portfolio: Since becoming a member of IFC in 1993, the
Kyrgyz Republic has received commitments totaling more than $75 million from IFC’s own
funds to finance more than 20 projects in the financial, banking and microfinance, oil and gas
sector, agribusiness, pulp and paper sectors. The committed IFC portfolio as of April 2009
stands at $18.2 million, with US$15.0 million disbursed (81% in financial markets, 19% in
general manufacturing. In 2005–2008, IFC investments amounted to US$19 million.
IFC has completed and is implementing 17 technical assistance projects in the areas of:
(i) institutional and capacity building of financial institutions; (ii) leasing and microfinance
development; (iii) business enabling environment (launched in the fall of 2008), and
(iv) improving corporate governance in local companies. IFC Central Asian Primary Market
Development Project was launched in 2005, and the second phase of IFC PEP Central Asian

7
Regional Leasing was launched in 2006. At the end of 2007, IFC started regional TA project
to improve corporate governance in enterprises of Central Asia including Kyrgyzstan.
In FY 2008, IFC committed investments for Altyn–Ajydar for the production of construction
materials (US$1.6 million), and long term financing and advisory services for Kyrgyz
Investment and Credit Bank (US$5million) to expand their activities. IFC supported the
Government in passing legislation in May 2008 which creates important tax incentives for
leasing. In addition, IFC intends to support the agribusiness sector by providing credit lines
through local commercial banks for agribusiness companies.
In FY 2009 IFC plans to invest more than US$30 million dollars into the Kyrgyz economy in
new investments, with focus on the financial sector. This will be complemented with a new
advisory services project to improve financial markets infrastructure, specifically credit
information sharing systems, financial intermediaries’ credit underwriting practices, and risk
management education. As a response to financial crisis, IFC is reinforcing its work with
credit bureaus which would help financial institutions identify risks and safely re-engage in
lending activities when the economic cycle permits. IFC will continue its advisory services
aimed at implementing the regulatory framework for institutional and capacity building in the
financial sectors, developing corporate governance and improving business environment for
private sector and investment climate.
In addition, IFC is preparing an infrastructure advisory program for Central Asia. This
initiative could provide advice and assistance to the Kyrgyz Government in designing public
private partnerships and, possibly, privatization of infrastructure companies. Infrastructure in
the Kyrgyz Republic is in the great need of investments and this constitutes a constraint to
economic growth. The Infrastructure Advisory Program could attract external investments to
these sectors and increase the capacity of the Government to develop and structure projects
on a PPP basis.
MIGA: has supported private sector development in the Kyrgyz Republic by extending
guarantees to foreign direct investments in four projects in the manufacturing, services, and
mining sectors. The total amount of foreign direct investment facilitated by MIGA
guarantees is over $360 million.
MIGA’s current portfolio in the Kyrgyz Republic consists of guarantees for two projects in
the transport sector: an airline (Kyrgyz Airlines) and an airport services company (Manas
Management Company). The projects are owned by Austrian and Italian investors. The
combined gross exposure from these projects is US$14.8 million. Both of the projects are the
subject of active and ongoing disputes between the investors and the Government.
The operations license of the airline was cancelled by the government and is currently the
subject of a proceeding at the London Court of International Arbitration. If the investor is
successful in that forum it will result in a claim under MIGA’s guarantee. A claim has been

8
filed against MIGA in connection to the Manas Management Company as the result of the
Government’s taking of certain shares of the company.
MIGA is working with the parties to reach a settlement of the disputes and is in close contact
with both the Kyrgyz authorities and the investors for this purpose. An agreement was
reached in 2008, but, because of delays in carrying out its terms, the settlement is not yet
effective. At present, there are no new projects in the Kyrgyz Republic in MIGA’s FY09
pipeline.

ANNEX III. KYRGYZ REPUBLIC––RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(ADB)
(As of 31 March 2009)
ADB has been the second largest development partner in the Kyrgyz Republic since its joining in
1994. ADB's country partnership strategy for the Kyrgyz Republic is presented in the joint
country support strategy 1 (JCSS) for 2007–10 approved in October 2007. The JCSS was
prepared in cooperation with four development partners—the Swiss Cooperation, the
United Kingdom Department for International Development, the United Nations Agencies,
and the World Bank Group. Two other development partners—the European Commission
and the German Government—joined the JCSS in December 2007. The JCSS supports the
government development agenda, articulated in the country development strategy for 2007–
10, of which the main theme is to contribute to robust and sustainable economic growth and
poverty reduction, and the attainment of Millennium Development Goals. 2

In line with the country development strategy, the JCSS identifies four priority areas:
(i) promoting economic management consistent with strong and sustained pro-poor growth;
(ii) improving governance, promoting effective public administration, and reducing
corruption; (iii) building sustainable human and social capital; and (iv) ensuring
environmental sustainability and natural resources management.
The country operations business plan (COBP) for 2009–11, which was approved in
January 2009, is broadly in line with the JCSS priorities, with some adjustments in the
lending and non-lending program to reflect: (i) impact of the ongoing global financial and
economic crises; and (ii) the Government’s latest economic policy to address the country's
short- and long-term development challenges. 3 In May 2008 ADB adopted Strategy 2020,
which requires ADB to be more effective through more focused operations in five core areas.
The adjustments made in the forward program are compliant with this approach.
As of 31 March 2009, the country has received 26 loans worth $603.5 million, 9 ADF and
1 GEF grants worth $134 million. Eight out of 26 loans and 10 grants are program loans
totaling $212 million provided to support policy reforms to facilitate the transition to a
market economy. The remaining 19 project loans and 9 grants (worth $525.5 million) were
provided to support various investment activities. At present, 6 loans and 8 grants with
approved amount of $264.8 million are ongoing. These loans and grants have an undisbursed
balance of $132.2 million as of 31 March 2009. All assistance provided to the
Kyrgyz Republic is from concessional ADB’s special fund resources—Asian Development

Fund (ADF). The Kyrgyz Republic has also received 7 grants from Japan Fund for Poverty
Reduction (JFPR grants) amounting to $7 million. The transport and communications sectors
account for the largest share of ADB assistance, followed by the multisector, and law,
economics and public policy.
In addition to loans and grants, ADB had provided 71 technical assistance (TA) projects
amounting to $41.251 million as of today. Of these, 23 are project preparatory TAs
amounting to $14.44 million and the remaining 48 TAs for $26.811 million are advisory TAs
for capacity building, policy advice, institutional strengthening and training.
The performance of ADB’s portfolio is generally satisfactory with one loan rated at risk. The
scarcity of budgetary resources, and ceilings on the externally funded PIP constituted the
biggest risks to the country portfolio. ADB and the World Bank have thus sought the removal
of quarterly disbursement ceilings, which delay project implementation. In August 2005, IMF
agreed to be more flexible in determining annual targets for the PIP, which is expected to
improve portfolio performance.
ADB’s annual lending began with $40 million in 1994 and reached the peak level of
$89 million in 1997. Thereafter, lending declined as the Government’s debt reduction
strategy limited the size of its externally funded PIP to about 3 percent of GDP.
Since 2005, up to 50 percent of ADF assistance to the country was provided in the form of
grants in view of the heavy external indebtedness of the country. In September 2007, the new
grants framework was approved by ADB’s Board of Directors, which enables the
Kyrgyz Republic to receive 100 percent of its annual ADF allocation in grants. Access to
grants will depend on the county’s debt repayment capacity, which will need to be assessed
periodically. As debt sustainability of the country strengthens, the Kyrgyz Republic will
again be eligible for 50 percent grant and 50 percent loan starting from 2009. The allocation
for the block of two years 2009–10 is determined at $120.78 million.
The Kyrgyz Republic was selected as one of the pilot countries during the February 2003
Rome Conference on Harmonization. Since then key development partners have learned to
better coordinate and harmonize procurement procedures, oversee financial management and
monitoring, share project implementation units, and conduct joint country portfolio reviews.
The JCSS for the Kyrgyz Republic has been prepared by five funding agencies. The areas
identified for harmonization in the immediate future are: (a) procedures for procurement of
goods and services; (b) financial management and monitoring of projects; and (c) project
implementation units. World Bank and ADB procurement documentation has been
harmonized in these areas.
ADB cooperates extensively with civil society organizations in the Kyrgyz Republic to
strengthen the effectiveness, quality, and sustainability of the services it provides.

11
ANNEX IV. KYRGYZ REPUBLIC––RELATIONS WITH THE EUROPEAN BANK FOR
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT (EBRD)
(As of March 1, 2009)
The EBRD facilitates the transition to a market-based economy through its support to the
local banks and non-bank micro financial institutions, selected financially viable local
enterprises, key infrastructure, and targeted technical assistance. Under the Early Transition
Countries’ Initiative (ETCI) introduced in 2004, the Bank is able to more innovatively
respond to the Kyrgyz economic conditions and support more challenging smaller local
projects. Under the initiative, the Bank also provides technical cooperation (TC) in support of
investment development.
In accordance with the Strategy for the Kyrgyz Republic approved in June 2007, the Bank’s
priorities are: (a) fostering the private sector; (b) strengthening the financial sector; (c)
support for critical infrastructure; and (d) policy dialogue to improve the investment climate
and support reform efforts.
As of March 2009, the Bank had supported 66 investment projects (including restructurings)
with total financing of €779 million. The Bank has provided €212 million of this amount.
During the past three years, the Bank expanded its activities in the financial sector including
the following:
•

With an objective to develop dynamic micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises,
the Bank has been trying to strengthen the financial sector by investing and lending to
stronger local financial institutions and encouraging co-investment.

•

The Bank works with five-partner banks and also with four non-banking
institutions—Bai-Tushum, FINCA, Kompanion and Frontiers.

•

In 2007, the Bank approved $40 million in support of the Bank’s Financial Sector
Strategy for the Kyrgyz Republic which aims to strengthen the sector by addressing
identified gaps and weaknesses and promoting best practice. The project will support
development of the private enterprises and banking sector in the Kyrgyz Republic by
increasing medium- and long-term financing to the productive sector of the economy
through local banks. In 2007, under this project KICB received $3 million credit line
for lending to small- and medium-sized enterprises and $2 million loan for mortgage
financing. The SME credit line is used to finance local enterprises in the tourism
sector and related services. The mortgage loan is used for financing residential
mortgages.

•

Equity investments in DKIB and KICB.

•

ANNEX VI. KYRGYZ REPUBLIC––STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data provision is adequate for surveillance. The four institutions responsible for
collecting, compiling and disseminating macroeconomic statistics—the National Statistics
Committee (NSC), the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade (MOEDT), the
Ministry of Finance (MOF), and the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR)—have
legal and institutional environments that support statistical quality, and their respective staff
are well-versed in current methodologies.
2.
The NSC maintains a comprehensive and regularly updated website with data that
largely incorporate international methodological recommendations with adequate coverage
and timeliness (http://www.stat.kg). In February 2004, the Kyrgyz Republic subscribed to the
SDDS.
3.
A data ROSC mission in November 2002 concluded that the quality of the
macroeconomic statistics had improved significantly in the last few years. The authorities’
response to the data ROSC (posted on the IMF website (www.imf.org/external/np/rosc)
includes an update on the status of implementation of the ROSC recommendations.
National accounts
4.
In general, dissemination of national accounts statistics is timely. Technical assistance
has been received from the IMF, EUROSTAT, OECD, the World Bank, and bilateral donors.
While significant progress has been made in improving the national accounts estimation
process, problems persist regarding the quality of the source data, due mainly to excessively
tight collection deadlines associated with the release schedule. Efforts are needed to improve
the quality of the source data for quarterly GDP estimates. Moreover, while the quarterly
GDP estimates are disseminated on a discrete basis for SDDS purposes, these estimates are
still derived from cumulative data. Difficulties also remain in properly estimating the degree
of underreporting, especially in the private sector. To improve the coverage and reliability of
primary data, work has been undertaken to introduce sampling procedures. Improved
sampling procedures have been adopted for household surveys and new report forms have
been introduced for the enterprise survey. The NSC has established a division of sample
surveys, which would assist in improving the sampling techniques.
Price and labor market statistics
5.
The concepts and definitions used in the CPI, which has been published since
January 1995, are broadly consistent with international standards. The price index covers all
urban resident households of all sizes and income levels, but needs to cover rural households,
which comprise the majority of the population.
6.
The PPI, which has been published since October 1996, is compiled broadly in
accordance with international standards, although its coverage needs to be improved. The

19
coverage of the PPI was broadened in May 1997 and is expected to be further expanded in
the coming years.
7.
Progress has been made in computing unit value indices for imports and exports.
Work continues with regard to computation of these indices using a standard index
presentation and the development of an export price index. However, problems in customs
administration have led to incomplete coverage of trade and the lack of an appropriate
valuation system. Moreover, the data processed by customs have suffered due to the use of an
outdated computer software system.
8.
Problems exist in the compilation of the average wage, especially with respect to the
valuation of payments in kind and the coverage of the private sector. Monthly and annual
data are not comparable because of different coverage and classifications. These problems
extend to employment data as well. The coverage of unemployment includes an estimate of
unregistered unemployed.
Government finance statistics
9.
The scope of central government statistics falls short of international standards
because it excludes data for the Social Fund (these data are published separately). Other
limitations involve the discrepancies between the deficit and financing data. While revenue
and expenditure data generally accord with the GFSM 1986, there are misclassifications in
both categories (for example, some nontax revenues are classified as taxes, and certain
expenditure items are misclassified in the budget and treasury accounts). Monthly GFS data
are reported to STA for publication in the IFS; the latest data reported for publication in the
GFS Yearbook were for 2006, and covered general government and its subsectors; the data
were compiled using the GFSM 2001 analytical framework.
10.
The provision of data on public external debt service has improved. Data on actual
debt service, guaranteed debt service, outstanding debt and revised debt projections, are
provided on a monthly basis. The quality (including timeliness) of external debt data is
adequate. The External Debt Division of the MOF is now solely responsible for monitoring
external debt, and has benefited from on-site training provided by a Swiss-financed long-term
consultant and the computerization of its database.
Monetary and financial statistics (MFS)
11.
The 2002 data ROSC mission found that: (a) the residency criterion was not
uniformly applied, as the currency denomination was used to classify some transactions with
foreign and domestic units; (b) deposits with banks in liquidation were included in broad
money; and (c) source data did not provide sufficient information for a more detailed sectoral
breakdown (e.g., subsectorization of nonbank institutions as recommended in the MFSM.

20
12.
The April/May 2004 STA mission on MFS found that the NBKR had made
substantial progress in implementing ROSC recommendations pertaining to monetary
statistics. To address the outstanding issues, the mission further recommended that the NBKR
(a) improve the basic source data to allow for proper classification of the transactions with
foreign and domestic units; (b) fully implement the MFSM’s methodology concerning
accrual accounting; (c) exclude deposits with banks in liquidation from monetary aggregates
and classify them as restricted deposits; and (d) set up a working group to follow up on
consistency between monetary and balance of payments statistics. The mission also
recommended expanding the current broad money survey to include the accounts of credit
unions and microfinance companies.
13.
The new accounting framework for banks implemented in January 2009 revealed
some problems in classification of a part of the Social Fund deposits. Efforts are under way
to address the consequences of the introduction of the new accounting rules.
14.
Monetary data have been reported electronically to STA using Standardized Report
Forms (SRFs). STA identified classification issues in the reported SRF data, which were
communicated to the authorities. The data will be published in IFS and IFS Monetary and
Financial Statistics Supplement as soon as these issues are resolved.
External sector statistics
15.
Data on the balance of payments and international investment position are compiled
and disseminated on a quarterly basis. The 2002 data ROSC mission noted that the
compilation of balance of payments statistics broadly follows the methodology recommended
in the BPM5. However, deficiencies remain with respect to data on remittances, trade,
services, and foreign direct investment. There is also a need to improve compilation
procedures for achieving temporal consistency of data, and investigating and reconciling
discrepancies. The March 2004 STA mission on balance of payments statistics noted that
while progress had been made in several areas, further improvements were needed in the
international transactions reporting system; data sampling methods; and data validation and
coverage, particularly on trade, services, private sector external debt, and foreign direct
investment.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with
the Kyrgyz Republic
On May 22, 2009 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Kyrgyz Republic. 1
Background
Up to 2008, a favorable external environment and sound economic policies resulted in a
steady increase in the pace of economic growth in the Kyrgyz Republic, while inflation
remained low. Following periods of political turmoil, economic growth accelerated to
8½ percent in 2007 and non-gold growth reached 9 percent that year. Poverty rates fell to
35 percent, from 54 percent in 2002, while extreme poverty dropped from 23 percent to
7 percent. Inflation remained close to 5 percent, until it started to surge in late 2007.
Over the last year and a half, adverse external developments have led to a deterioration in
economic conditions. Initially, the Kyrgyz economy was hit by the rise in international
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
commodity prices that caused a sharp increase in Kyrgyz inflation, to over 30 percent by mid2008, and a worsening of the external position. When the international economic tide turned in
the second half of 2008 and the global economic and financial crisis spread to the region, the
Kyrgyz economy was badly hit as well. In addition, long-standing energy sector problems
combined with water shortages caused a major shortfall in hydropower capacity and
widespread power outages. Overall growth remained strong in 2008, reaching 7.6 percent on
account of a strong recovery in gold production, but the global and regional slowdown started
to affect economic activity outside the gold sector, with non-gold growth falling to 5.4 percent.
The global crisis is hurting the Kyrgyz economy mainly through trade and remittance channels.
Russia and Kazakhstan remain key trading partners and the main source of remittances. With
these countries in recession, Kyrgyz growth is expected to almost come to a halt in 2009,
before recovering modestly in 2010.
The Kyrgyz authorities’ economic policies for 2009, together with large donor support, will help
mitigate the impact of the crisis on the Kyrgyz economy. Sizable assistance received from
Russia allows fiscal policy to accommodate the large shortfall in government revenues
expected this year, while creating room for an increase in capital and social spending. The
resulting fiscal easing will provide a strong boost to the economy and help to avoid a
recession. The assistance will more than cover the balance of payments and fiscal needs that
were emerging for 2009. Accordingly, the authorities are planning to use this money in a
medium-term fiscal framework.
The National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR) continues to aim its policies at further
reducing inflation and maintaining financial sector stability. Inflation has come down sharply to
13.6 percent in March 2009, as world commodity prices have eased, and is expected to slow
further to about 10 percent by year-end. The NBKR has allowed continued exchange rate
flexibility to absorb the large external shocks and limit foreign exchange reserve losses.
Notwithstanding some signs of stress, including an increase in non-performing loans and a
loss of deposits, the banking sector has thus far weathered the crisis well.
Although the current emphasis of the authorities’ policies is on addressing the impact of the
external shocks, they continue to advance their broader structural reform agenda to ensure
strong growth over the medium term. Considerable progress was made in the last two years in
improving the business environment, earning the Kyrgyz Republic a ranking as one of the top
ten reformers in last year’s World Bank Doing Business Survey. The authorities are continuing
with their efforts to strengthen public financial management, reduce the administrative burden
on businesses, including in the areas of taxation and trade, and fight corruption.

3
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that the Kyrgyz Republic is being adversely affected by the global
economic crisis spreading to the region, primarily through trade and remittances, spilling over
to domestic demand, and creating a revenue shortfall and larger balance of payments needs.
As a result, growth in the Kyrgyz Republic is likely to come to a halt this year, with
considerable downside risks associated with a possibly more protracted recession, a
worsening of financial sector difficulties in the region, and uncertainties surrounding the
upcoming elections. Looking ahead, Directors were encouraged by the authorities’
commitment to sound economic policies and their readiness to take additional measures if
needed to ensure macroeconomic stability.
Directors commended the authorities on their prompt response to the crisis including a strong
performance under the ESF arrangement. They agreed with the Kyrgyz authorities’ emphasis
on managing the spillover from the global crisis, aiming to support growth, safeguard external
and financial stability, and mitigate the impact on the poor. Directors welcomed the large
financial support provided by the Russian Federation and the authorities’ commitment to use
this support in a medium-term budget framework.
Directors noted that the larger donor support will permit fiscal stimulus to sustain economic
activity, by compensating for a revenue shortfall, while still leaving room to increase capital
and social spending. Directors particularly welcomed the authorities’ plans to raise the level
and improve the targeting of social benefits, with the help of the World Bank and the European
Union. Looking forward, they encouraged the authorities to press ahead with fiscal reforms,
including strengthening public financial management, further revising the tax system, including
a partial reversal of the recent VAT rate reduction and eliminating VAT exemptions on imports,
and strengthening revenue administration. These measures will be crucial to ensure fiscal
sustainability over the medium term, when donor support may decline.
Directors noted the updated debt sustainability analysis, which continues to place the
Kyrgyz Republic at a moderate risk of debt distress. They underscored the need to maintain a
prudent debt strategy, and supported the authorities’ decision to abstain from issuing
guarantees for commercial projects, including in the energy sector.
Directors concurred with the central bank’s monetary policy aimed at further reducing inflation,
while maintaining a flexible exchange rate regime. They noted the staff’s assessment that the
real effective exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals. In the short term, Directors
saw limited scope for monetary easing to help support economic growth, given depreciation
pressures and the persistence of high core inflation. Looking ahead, they considered that the
pace of any gradual easing would depend on lower inflation and the easing of exchange rate
pressures. Directors welcomed the decision to increase the central bank’s capital, thereby
strengthening its independence.

4
Directors observed that banks have been resilient to the global financial turmoil. They were
encouraged by the authorities’ readiness to deal with any financial sector problems, including
by providing emergency liquidity support and injecting capital into systemic banks if needed.
Directors also welcomed the early introduction of the deposit insurance scheme, which would
help improve confidence in the banking system. The authorities should continue to monitor
banks closely, as banks’ asset quality is likely to worsen further as the economy slowed.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

IMF Completes First Review Under Exogenous Shock Facility
with the Kyrgyz Republic and Approves US$25.5 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the first review of
the Kyrgyz Republic’s economic performance under the 18-month Exogenous Shocks Facility
(ESF) arrangement and approved the immediate release of SDR 16.65 million (about US$25.5
million). This will bring total disbursements under the ESF to SDR 33.3 million (about US$51
million). The 18-month, SDR 66.6 million (about US$102 million) arrangement under the ESF was
approved on December 10, 2008 (see Press Release 08/316).
The Board also concluded the 2009 Article IV consultation. Details of the findings will be
published in a Public Information Notice.
Following the Executive Board's discussion, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy Managing Director and
Acting Chair, stated:
“The global crisis is causing a sharper economic slowdown in the Kyrgyz Republic than was
expected at the time of the approval of the 18−month arrangement under the Exogenous Shocks
Facility (ESF) in December 2008. The crisis is affecting the Kyrgyz economy mainly through trade
and remittance channels, spilling over to domestic demand and creating revenue shortfalls and
larger balance of payments needs. As a result, economic growth is expected to slow sharply in 2009.
The authorities are committed to take additional measures as needed.
“The spread of the global financial crisis has also put downward pressure on the exchange rate. The
banking system has been resilient, but the increased uncertainty has affected money demand and
credit growth, and banks’ asset quality has deteriorated. At the same time, inflation has declined
sharply, helped by lower international food and energy prices, prudent monetary policy, and, more
recently, the slowdown in activity.

“The authorities’ macroeconomic policies aim to mitigate the impact of the crisis on economic
growth and the poor. Policy implementation under the ESF arrangement has been strong, and all
targets set for end-December 2008 were met. Large financial support from the Russian Federation
will also help sustain activity by allowing fiscal policy to accommodate the revenue shortfall, and
create room for an increase in capital and social spending. The sizable donor support will also cover
the larger balance of payments needs and help maintain an adequate level of foreign exchange
reserves.
“The Kyrgyz central bank’s policies aim to lower inflation and maintain financial sector stability.
The central bank will continue to pursue a flexible exchange rate policy to absorb external shocks
and limit reserve losses. Provided that inflation continues to decline and exchange rate pressures
abate, monetary policy could be eased gradually to provide additional support to the economy. The
central bank will continue to monitor banks closely. The authorities have acted proactively by
putting in place emergency liquidity facilities and by standing ready to provide capital to systemic
banks if needed. The early introduction of a deposit insurance scheme will help bolster confidence
in the banking system,” Mr. Portugal said.

Statement by Thomas Moser, Executive Director of the Kyrgyz Republic
May 22, 2009
1.
Our Kyrgyz authorities would like to thank the staff for very constructive policy
discussions. They are grateful to the IMF for the very timely support under the Exogenous Shocks
Facility (ESF), which has been helpful in addressing the consequences of the significant exogenous
shocks that the Kyrgyz economy is experiencing. Performance under the arrangements has been
strong, with all performance criteria and structural benchmarks met, and the authorities continue to
be committed to the agreed economic program.
2.
In line with global and regional developments, transmitted both through trade and
remittance channels, the outlook for the Kyrgyz economy has further deteriorated. The recent World
Economic Outlook shows that as the global economic crisis spreads, CIS countries are forecast to
experience the largest reversal of economic fortune in the near term. Given the importance of
Russia and Kazakhstan as trading partners of the Kyrgyz Republic and source of remittances, the
slowdown in those countries severely affects the Kyrgyz economy. Kyrgyz economic growth is
projected to slow sharply, from 7.6 percent in 2008 to less than 1 percent in 2009, significantly
lower than what was projected at the time of the ESF request. Moreover, these projections continue
to be subject to significant downside risks.
3.
The further deterioration is creating revenue shortfalls and larger balance of payments
needs. The Kyrgyz authorities are thus thankful for the substantial donor support provided by the
Russian Federation. The recently disbursed grant of US$150 million and the US$300 million
concessional loan for budget support will help to cushion the impact of the crisis. This allows fiscal
policy to accommodate the large shortfall in government revenues expected for 2009, while creating
room for increasing capital spending and social support. The overall fiscal balance will remain
limited to less than 2 percent of GDP.
4.
As the staff report points out, the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR) has
allowed greater exchange rate flexibility than most other countries in the region, and it will allow
continued exchange rate flexibility to absorb the large external shocks and limit foreign exchange
reserve losses. Monetary policy will focus on reducing inflation and mitigating exchange rate
pressures.
5.
So far, the banking sector has held up well to the global financial crisis, as evidenced by
high bank capitalization and liquidity indicators, but credit growth has come to a halt, nonperforming loans have started to rise, and deposits have fallen. The NBKR is monitoring banks
closely and has prepared contingency plans, envisaging both emergency liquidity support and
possible capital injections by the government for systemic banks. A fully funded deposit insurance
scheme with increased deposit insurance levels (originally planed for 2010) will come into effect

2

already on July 1, 2009. The government will provide the bulk of the initial funding, with gradual
reimbursement by the commercial banks through 2010.
6.
Although crisis management is currently taking center stage, the Kyrgyz authorities
intend to move ahead with structural reforms. Some significant improvement has been achieved, as
evidenced in the World Bank’s latest “Doing Business” report. In categories such as better
protecting investors, starting businesses or dealing with construction permits, much higher rankings
were scored.
7.
In the energy sector, long-standing problems are being addressed, including through
further increases in electricity tariffs. The Kyrgyz Republic has an enormous, still unused potential
for hydropower production. The Kambarata project would be an important milestone in the
development of this potential. While the financing for the construction of the Kambarata
hydropower would be available, the authorities will await the results of the feasibility study to see
whether the project would be economically viable before making any decision, and they will
continue to refrain from issuing any government guarantees.
