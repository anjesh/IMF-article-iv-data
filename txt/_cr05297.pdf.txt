Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2005 Consultation with Barbados
Approved by Ratna Sahay and Matthew Fisher
July 19, 2005
Discussions: A staff team comprising B. Clements (Head), G. Bindley-Taylor, C. Francis, and
W.A. Samuel (all WHD), and L. Valderrama (ICM) held discussions in Bridgetown during April 26–
May 10, 2005. The mission met with Senator Tyrone Barker, Parliamentary Secretary for Finance and
Economic Affairs; Mr. Grantley Smith, Director General of the Ministry of Finance and Economic
Affairs; Ms. Marion Williams, Governor of the Central Bank of Barbados; other senior officials; and
representatives of the private sector. R. Sahay (WHD) and R. Campbell (OED) joined the mission for
the final meetings.

●

● Economic and social background: Barbados compares favorably with other regional economies
on economic and social indicators. The population is about 272,000, and per capita income (PPP) is
about US$15,700. Social indicators are among the best in the Caribbean region and compare
favorably in a global context; in 2004, for example, Barbados was ranked 29th among 177 countries
on the United Nations Development Program’s Human Development Index. Barbados is also one
of only six countries in Latin America and the Caribbean with an investment grade rating for its
sovereign debt.

Political situation: The ruling political party enjoys a comfortable majority in the parliament
and the next elections are due by September 2008. The Barbados Labor Party (BLP), led by
Prime Minister Owen Arthur, won its third consecutive election in May 2003, securing 23 of the
30 seats in the House of Assembly. The main opposition party, the Democratic Labor Party (DLP),
held office during 1986–94, and controls the remaining seven seats.

●

Last Article IV consultation: At its conclusion on April 7, 2004, Directors supported the
authorities’ plan for a gradual return to low fiscal deficits and continued implementation of structural
reforms to enhance economic growth and competitiveness. They emphasized the need to align utility
tariffs with operating costs and to reduce the level of transfers to loss-making public enterprises.
Directors recommended the acceleration of efforts to adopt market based monetary policy tools,
as well as the phasing out of the minimum deposit rate to improve the efficiency of financial
intermediation.
●

● Exchange system: Barbados has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and
maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions. The Barbados dollar has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at BD$2=US$1
since 1975.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Recent developments
•

A strong economic recovery appears to have taken hold in 2004. Real GDP grew
by an estimated 4½ percent in 2004, led by the continued recovery of the tourism
sector. The deficit of the nonfinancial public sector narrowed slightly to 6 percent of
GDP, but public debt remains high at 86 percent of GDP. The balance of payments
deficit widened in 2004, as a rapid expansion in private sector credit generated a
surge in imports while private capital inflows declined. The banking system appears
to be sound and financial sector indicators have improved with the rebound in
economic activity.

•

A modest program of structural reforms was undertaken during the past year.
Tax rates have been reduced, the airport has been corporatized, and the
telecommunications sector has been further liberalized.

Policy discussions
•

The discussions focused on fiscal consolidation to reduce debt, enhancing the
scope for utilizing indirect monetary policy instruments, reducing
vulnerabilities, and structural policies to raise competitiveness and growth. Real
GDP is projected to grow by about 3 percent in 2005 and remain strong until 2007
because of the stimulus from the buildup to the World Cup cricket games.
Maintaining high growth over the medium term, however, will require steps to correct
macroeconomic imbalances and an acceleration of structural reforms.

•

Staff argued that the recent buildup of public debt and rapidly declining foreign
exchange reserves called for a decisive fiscal adjustment. Under the mission’s
active scenario, fiscal adjustment would begin this year, with the deficit declining to
less than 1 percent of GDP by the end of the decade. The authorities concurred with
the broad thrust of the mission’s views, but were concerned that a sharp fiscal
adjustment would be incompatible with their desire to continue to provide highquality public services and maintain a high level of public investment spending to
underpin economic growth.

•

The staff and authorities agreed that the fixed exchange rate regime remains
appropriate for Barbados, provided it was accompanied by appropriate
macroeconomic and structural policies and wage increases in line with developments
in labor productivity.

•

The authorities are moving ahead with structural reforms. The mission endorsed
the government’s efforts in this area but urged a more ambitious agenda. It also
suggested that the central bank phase out the minimum deposit rate and accelerate the
adoption of indirect monetary policy instruments.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Barbados compares favorably with other Caribbean countries on economic and
social indicators. The economy is heavily dependent on tourism and financial services, but
has been resilient in the face of external shocks. The population is about 272,000, and per
capita income (on a PPP basis) is about US$15,700. Poverty rates are the lowest in the
Caribbean. Social indicators compare favorably in both a regional and global context; in
2004, for example, Barbados was ranked 29th among 177 countries on the United Nations
Development Program’s Human Development Index. Barbados is also one of only
six countries in Latin America and the Caribbean with an investment grade rating.

Barbados was one of the better-performing economies in the Caribbean in the
1990s. After an IMF-supported adjustment program in the early 1990s, Barbados grew at
3 percent, inflation was less than 2 percent, and public sector deficits were maintained at less
than 3 percent of GDP over the 1993–2000 period. These small deficits and conservative
monetary policy helped underpin the fixed exchange rate regime.
3.
The solid economic performance of the 1990s has given way to macroeconomic
imbalances since 2001. The economy—especially the tourism and financial services
sectors—suffered a sharp recession in 2001–02 following the September 11th attacks and the
global slowdown (Figure 1 and Table 1). In response to the deterioration in the external
environment, the authorities implemented an expansionary public investment program to
help revive economic activity. Combined with public sector wage increases, this contributed
to a widening of the overall nonfinancial public sector fiscal deficit from about 2 percent of
GDP in FY 2000/01 to about 13 percent of GDP in FY 2002/03. As a result, the public sector
debt-to-GDP ratio rose from 74 percent in March 2001 to 87 percent in March 2003
(Tables 2 and Table 3). The high fiscal deficit and public debt prompted a downgrade in

Barbados’ external credit rating in August 2004.1 The external current account deficit
remained at around 6 percent of GDP over 2001–03, but international reserves rose, owing to
inflows linked to privatization and external borrowing by the central government.
4.
Growth has been hampered by low rates of private investment and the sluggish
performance of manufactured and agricultural exports. Even during the period of
relatively good performance in the 1990s, private investment remained low; over 1995–2003,
for example, it averaged 13 percent of GDP, compared with 22 percent for CARICOM as a
whole.2 The weak performance of goods exports, coupled with growing imports, has slowed
growth and contributed to the weakening of the current account balance over time, with the
surpluses of the mid-1990s replaced by deficits averaging over 6 percent of GDP since the
end-1990s.
5.
High spreads between deposit and borrowing rates point to inefficient financial
sector intermediation that may be curtailing investment. Interest rate spreads, at over
7 percent, are higher than what could be expected of a country with Barbados’
macroeconomic performance and economic characteristics.3 This reflects certain features of
the monetary policy regime, such as a minimum deposit rate and capital controls. This
captive environment has, in some instances, generated excess liquidity in the banking system
and short-term interest rates on government debt close to or below the minimum deposit rate.
These low rates of return on nonloan assets relative to the cost of deposits have, in turn, put
upward pressure on lending rates.
6.
The ruling political party enjoys a comfortable majority in the parliament and
the next elections are due by September 2008. The Barbados Labor Party (BLP), led by
Prime Minister Owen Arthur, won its third consecutive election in May 2003, securing 23 of
the 30 seats in the House of Assembly. The main opposition party, the Democratic Labor
Party (DLP), held office during 1986–94, and controls the remaining seven seats.

In August 2004, Standard and Poors lowered the long-term foreign currency sovereign
credit rating to BBB+ from A-, while the long-term domestic currency rating was reduced
from A+ to A-.

II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND NEAR-TERM PROSPECTS
7.
A strong economic recovery appears to have taken hold in 2004, which is
expected to continue in 2005. Real GDP growth in 2004 is estimated at 4.4 percent, led by a
recovery in tourism, construction, and communications (Box 1 compares this recent
performance with that in the rest of the region). In 2005, real GDP growth is projected to
ease somewhat to 3.1 percent, as tourism activity expands at a more sustainable rate.4 Growth
will be supported by public and private sector investment ahead of the cricket World Cup in
2007, as well as favorable global demand. Inflation has remained low, although
administrative steps to pass through higher international oil prices to domestic prices in 2005
are projected to raise inflation above 3 percent for the year.
8.
The fiscal position improved slightly in
FY 2004/05 for the nonfinancial public sector as a
whole, but is expected to deteriorate in FY 2005/06.
The mission projects an increase in the deficit of about
1 percentage point of GDP to 7 percent of GDP, owing
in part to increases in public investment projects related
to the buildup to the World Cup cricket games. As a
result, the ratio of primary public expenditures to GDP,
which is already high by Caribbean standards, will rise
further. At the same time, public debt (comprising
central government and government-guaranteed debt for
the public enterprises) is projected to rise from
86 percent of GDP in FY 2004/05 to 88 percent of GDP
in FY 2005/06, far exceeding the average for Latin
America and the Caribbean and for emerging market
countries.

Following the rebound in economic activity and a reduction in mortgage lending
rates, growth in credit to the private sector—especially to households—accelerated in
2004. Private sector credit grew by almost 17 percent during 2004, reflecting strong demand
for mortgages (Table 4). Higher personal incomes of households also spurred private credit
growth.

Box 1. Barbados: Recent Performance in a Regional Perspective
•

Growth performance has been similar to other Caribbean countries. At about
3 percent in 2003–04, it was slightly better than Jamaica and comparable to the rest of
the Eastern Caribbean.

•

The primary budget deficit is the highest in the region. Public expenditure is also
significantly higher, owing to high levels of nonwage expenditure. Rising deficits
have contributed to an increase in public debt of over 15 percentage points of GDP
since the late 1990s. The debt burden, though rising in recent years, still remains
below that of other countries in the region, except for Trinidad and Tobago.

•

As in many other Caribbean economies, external current account deficits are
high. Deficits are lower in Barbados than those in Jamaica and the ECCU territories.
FDI, however, is lower in Barbados than in its regional counterparts.

After a largely accommodative monetary policy stance to support the economic
recovery, monetary conditions were tightened in early 2005 to slow the growth of credit.

3.75 percent), following a 0.5 percentage point

11.
The banking sector appears to be sound
and financial sector indicators have improved
with the pickup in economic activity.
Commercial banks are well capitalized, with
adequate levels of provisioning. As in other
countries, nonperforming loans have fallen with the
rebound in economic growth, albeit with a lag.
12.
The external current account deficit
rose sharply in 2004, and is expected to remain
high in 2005. The external current account deficit
increased sharply from 7 percent of GDP in 2003
to 10½ percent of GDP in 2004 (Table 6),
reflecting a broad-based import surge related to
the rapid increase in private sector credit and the
expansion in economic activity. Capital inflows
also declined with the cessation of privatization
receipts from abroad. As a result, the balance of
payments moved from a surplus to a deficit of
5½ percent of GDP in 2004, with gross
international reserves (GIR) falling to 3¾ months
of imported goods and nonfactor services. Despite
the projected slowdown in private sector credit
growth and some increase in capital inflows, the
external current account deficit will remain high
at about 10 percent of GDP in 2005, reflecting the
strong growth of imports linked to the preparation
for the World Cup cricket games. As a
consequence, external reserve coverage is
expected to fall further to about three months.

Structural reforms have advanced in taxation, telecommunications, and the
public enterprise sector. Corporate and personal tax rates have been further lowered, in line
with the multiyear reduction in these rates initiated in FY 2002/03. In telecommunications,
the final phase of reform began in early 2005, and will involve the liberalization of external
telecommunications and the issuance of new licenses for fixed telephone lines on a
competitive basis. Legislation to corporatize the Airport Authority was also recently
approved, paving the way for more efficient management.
III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
14.
Discussions again focused on the need for fiscal consolidation, enhancing the
scope for indirect monetary policy instruments, and structural policies to raise
competitiveness and growth. While in recent Article IV consultation discussions the
authorities have agreed with the staff’s key recommendations—including for reversing the
fiscal stimulus implemented after the 2001–02 recession—policy implementation has
reflected a preference for a more gradual approach. More generally, the authorities take the
position that their policy direction has been broadly in line with past Fund advice and that
consultations have tended to result in a convergence of views.
15.
Staff argued that the recent buildup of public debt and rapidly declining foreign
exchange reserves called for a decisive fiscal adjustment. In the absence of fiscal
consolidation, the burden of addressing external imbalances would fall on the shoulders of
monetary policy, crowding out private investment and dampening growth. Staff noted that
there was now less scope for a gradual approach to reducing high fiscal deficits and public
debt than in the past, given the recent deterioration of the external accounts. The authorities
generally concurred with the broad thrust of the mission’s views, but were concerned that a
sharp fiscal adjustment would be incompatible with their desire to continue to provide highquality public services and use public investment to boost Barbados’ potential growth.
16.
The authorities and staff concurred that competitiveness would need to be
enhanced to support the fixed exchange rate regime. Staff argued that a tighter linking of
wage awards with productivity developments, as well as structural reforms, were key to this
effort. The authorities largely agreed, but viewed the growth fillip from structural reforms—
especially trade liberalization—as likely to be modest in the near term, especially in light of
the recent experience of some sectors in adapting to a more competitive environment.
A. Medium-Term Scenarios
17.
Activity in the near term will be boosted by the buildup to the 2007 cricket
World Cup, but sustaining growth over the medium term may be more difficult. The
policy discussions with the authorities were guided by two medium-term scenarios that
illustrated the importance of addressing macroeconomic imbalances and introducing reforms
to enhance competitiveness (Figure 2 and Table 7). The baseline scenario (Scenario I)

incorporates the authorities’ fiscal policy targets and presumes a relatively more modest set
of structural reforms. As a result of the slow progress in reducing the debt and implementing
structural reforms, growth is projected to revert closer to historical levels (2 percent) from
2008 onward. Despite some improvement in the current account, which is expected to occur
as a result of monetary tightening and the associated decline in import growth, especially for
consumer goods, international reserves will decline to less than two months of imports of
goods and services by 2007.5
18.
The active scenario (Scenario II) envisages stronger policy adjustments. These
include accelerated structural reforms, a more ambitious fiscal adjustment to ensure debt
sustainability and correct external imbalances, and a tighter monetary stance over 2005–07.
As a result, sustained growth at 3–4 percent is achieved over the medium term, reflecting the
supply-side effects of maintaining private investment at roughly the levels projected for the
coming two years. The tightening of fiscal and monetary policy would also help curtail
current account deficits and help maintain reserve cover at three months.
B. Fiscal Policy
19.
The authorities indicated that their goal is to gradually return the deficit to
around 3 percent of GDP, after allowing for an increase in FY 2005/06. This would
imply the nonfinancial public sector deficit falling from around 7 percent of GDP in
FY 2005/06 to around 3¼ percent of GDP from FY 2007/08 onward, roughly the level that
prevailed prior to the counter-cyclical stimulus in FY 2002/03. The authorities also reiterated
their objective of reducing the debt of the central government to 60 percent of GDP, which
they aim to achieve by FY 2010/11. Although the authorities have not established a target for
the debt of the nonfinancial public sector as a whole, staff estimates suggest that it would
remain at between 86–88 percent of GDP over the next five years.
20.
The authorities’ fiscal strategy relies heavily on expenditure reduction. Capital
expenditures are projected to fall by over 2 percentage points of GDP with the completion of
projects financed by privatization proceeds and greater use of public-private partnerships in
the provision of economic infrastructure. Public enterprise balances are also projected to
improve by over 1½ percent of GDP, owing to selective public tariff increases, and subsidies
to cover enterprises’ operating losses will be frozen in nominal terms, resulting in a decline
in these outlays as a share of GDP. No additional revenue-raising measures are being
contemplated, with the exception of a possible import surcharge on non-CARICOM imports
that could yield ½ a percentage point of GDP in FY 2005/06.
21.
The revenue ratio, however, is expected to deteriorate significantly over the
medium term. The decline in import tariffs under the Free Trade Area of the Americas
(FTAA), as well as the completion of the phased reduction in income tax rates, are projected
to reduce revenues by 4–4½ percent of GDP. By FY 2009/10, revenues are projected to fall

- 14 -

below 30 percent of GDP (3½ percentage points of GDP below their level at the beginning of
the decade) and central government expenditures would decline to about 32 percent of GDP
(some 2–3 percentage points below their level of FY 2000/01).
22.
Modest but important risks exist to achieving this baseline fiscal scenario. The
reduction in off-budgetary capital spending is not expected to be contentious, as this
spending is limited to the funds generated by privatizations. Furthermore, the authorities’
adjustment plans do not entail a reduction in government employment. However, some risks
stem from the uncertainty regarding future increases in public tariffs, which will be necessary
to improve public enterprise balances and reduce government subsidies. Furthermore, some
of the fiscal incentives for selected sectors introduced in the Prime Minister’s Economic and
Financial Statement of December 2004 (for example, for dairy and beef production) could
further erode the tax base.
23.
The mission called for a more ambitious plan of fiscal adjustment to put debt on
a firmly declining path, reduce pressures on external reserves, and provide a fiscal
cushion in the event of a negative shock. Stronger fiscal adjustment was also needed to
avoid excessive reliance on monetary tightening to shore up international reserves, which
could choke off private investment and growth. A bolder fiscal consolidation would also
strengthen the climate for private investment by signaling the authorities’ resolve to reduce
debt, which remains well above the average for Latin America and the Caribbean. The
favorable world economic outlook would also support the growth of tourism and provide
propitious timing for fiscal consolidation.
24.
Under the mission’s active scenario, fiscal adjustment would begin this year.
Staff argued that otherwise, reserves could fall below three months of imports of goods and
services, as suggested in the baseline scenario. In tandem with further projected losses, this
could raise concerns about the consistency of the policy stance with the fixed exchange rate
regime. Starting the adjustment now could also avoid the need for an even harsher and less
gradual consolidation after the World Cup. Under the staff’s scenario, the balance of the
nonfinancial public sector would fall to 5¾ percent of GDP in FY 2005/06 and to slightly
less than 1 percent of GDP by FY 2009/10 onward. The resulting deficit would result in a
decline in public debt to around 75 percent of GDP by the end of the decade.6 Beyond that
point, it would be important to maintain the nonfinancial public sector deficit at this level in
order to ensure that the debt ratio falls below 60 percent of GDP in another five years. The
mission argued that in setting targets for public debt, the authorities should use this broader
definition of public sector liabilities, especially in light of the significant amounts of public
spending taking place outside the central government budget.

6

Net of government deposits in the banking system, government and government-guaranteed
debt (excluding the National Insurance System (NIS)) would fall to 60 percent of GDP in
FY 2012/13 and around 50 percent of GDP in FY 2015/16.

- 15 -

25.
The active scenario complements the authorities’ planned reductions in
expenditure with revenue measures. Beyond what is included in the authorities’ baseline
scenario, no additional spending cuts are envisaged for central government expenditures,
with the exception of off-budgetary outlays. In particular, since the scope for other measures
in FY 2005/06 is limited, the team recommended that the privatization proceeds expected for
the current year (about 1 percent of GDP) be used for debt reduction rather than extra
budgetary capital expenditure. Thereafter, in order to achieve additional fiscal adjustment
without causing an undesirable reduction in public services, the active scenario incorporates
revenue measures of 1 percent of GDP. Drawing from FAD technical assistance
recommendations, these could come from either the broadening of the VAT base, increases
in the VAT rate, or increases in excises. Some additional adjustment would also come
through increases in tariffs for water and public transportation, bringing the enterprises to a
balanced position by the end of the decade.
26.
The mission suggested that the petroleum price mechanism be changed to
preserve the financial position of the public enterprises. During the past year, delays in
adjusting administered prices for some consumers led to a deterioration of the balance of the
state oil-importing company of ¼ percent of GDP. Against this background, the team called
for the introduction of a mechanism to allow for an automatic pass-through of the
fluctuations in international prices to domestic prices. Harmonization of domestic and
offshore tax regimes—which would improve the efficiency of the tax system as well as the
environment for the growth of international business services and FDI—should also be
considered, in line with recent FAD technical assistance.
27.
The authorities maintained that a more gradual and modest fiscal adjustment
was appropriate. In their view, a deficit of the nonfinancial public sector of about 3 percent
of GDP was adequate and they expressed concern that a lower fiscal balance would be
incompatible with the longstanding social pact between government, labor, and business that
had served the country well. Furthermore, they stressed the need for infrastructure investment
to generate faster growth over the medium term and the need to maintain a high level of
public services. They also saw no evidence that past budget deficits had crowded out private
sector investment, although they acknowledged their impact on the external current account
deficit. They emphasized that government debt was held mainly by residents and in local
currency, and vulnerabilities were mitigated by the low level of external debt. In light of the
need to boost infrastructure ahead of the World Cup, as well as this more benign assessment
of the near-term impact of higher fiscal deficits and debt on growth, they also saw less need
to begin the fiscal adjustment in FY 2005/06.
C. Budget Formulation and Fiscal Transparency
28.
The mission commended the authorities for their careful efforts to prepare for
the adoption of a medium-term framework incorporating accrual and output-based
budgeting, which is targeted for implementation in FY 2007/08. Nonetheless, the team
suggested that the understanding of the general public of the government’s fiscal policy
objectives and the implementation of fiscal policy could be further improved by broadening
the coverage of fiscal data reported in budget documents. This could include supplemental

- 16 -

information on fiscal operations that are not explicitly recorded as government expenditure in
the central government budget, but have a bearing on the public finances (such as tax
concessions). The implications of public-private partnerships for government outlays could
also be usefully incorporated into medium-term fiscal projections and disclosed in budgetary
documents. The authorities took note of these suggestions, but observed that most of this
information, while not in budget documents, was already in the public domain.7
D. Monetary, Exchange Rate, and Financial Sector Policies
29.
The staff and the authorities agreed that the fixed exchange rate regime
continues to be appropriate for Barbados. The peg to the U.S. dollar has served to increase
the credibility of the exchange rate regime and provided an anchor for inflation and investor
confidence. The authorities concurred with the mission on the need for supportive monetary,
fiscal and structural policies to preserve the exchange rate regime.
30.
The mission suggested that additional monetary tightening was needed to
maintain adequate reserves and support the fixed exchange rate regime. In particular,
slower credit growth in the coming years would be appropriate, especially in the face of the
stimulus from the World Cup, and could avoid the need for a possibly more abrupt
contraction in the future. The authorities envisaged a slowdown in commercial bank lending
in 2005, although credit would still grow faster than nominal GDP over the next three years.
The authorities cautioned that their external position was healthier than indicated by the level
of central bank reserves alone, given the ability to require the repatriation of funds held by
financial institutions under the “second-tier” reserves arrangement.8
31.
The team also noted that sustaining the fixed exchange rate peg would require
measures to strengthen competitiveness. While the real effective exchange rate has
declined since 1999, labor productivity has fallen by about 3 percent (Figure 3). Coupled
with steady rises in real wages, falling productivity led to an increase in real unit labor costs
of approximately 11 percent in 1999–2004. Moreover, competition from low-cost
neighboring countries has intensified. This, coupled with rising unit labor costs, may have
contributed to the deterioration in the trade balance and Barbados’ declining share of both

7

To assist the authorities in moving forward on their efforts to improve fiscal transparency,
the mission recommended the authorities consider requesting a Report on the Observance of
Standards and Codes (ROSC).
8

The central bank’s policy of “second-tier reserves” is based on granting permission to
private sector entities to make investments abroad, with the understanding that they be
repatriated if required by the central bank. These reserves equaled about ½ month of imports
of goods and services.

tourism arrivals and expenditures in the Caribbean. The authorities agreed with the staff on
the need to better align wage increases with developments in labor productivity, and are
aware of the need to strengthen competitiveness, particularly in agriculture and
manufacturing. Toward this end, they have commissioned a series of studies by the IDB to
assist them in formulating appropriate policy responses.9
32.
The mission encouraged the authorities to make greater use of indirect monetary
policy instruments and to phase out the minimum deposit rate. A phasing out of the
minimum deposit rate, as well as greater reliance on indirect monetary policy instruments,
could have a salutary effect on interest rate spreads and financial sector efficiency. In line
with the recommendations of the 2002 FSAP, the government could consider issuing
additional treasury bills through the central bank, with the proceeds placed in a blocked

account. With greater reliance on these instruments for monetary policy operations, the
minimum deposit rate could eventually be phased out.
33.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to develop indirect instruments, but
preferred to maintain, at this time, the minimum deposit rate as their primary
instrument. In addition, they argued that the phasing out of the minimum deposit rate would
increase (rather than decrease) spreads, owing to the oligopolistic structure of the banking
system and the lack of competition for deposits. By contrast, analysis by the staff indicates a
high degree of competition in the banking system.10
34.
The mission and authorities agreed that a further deepening of capital account
liberalization should be contingent on macroeconomic conditions in Barbados. Staff
endorsed the authorities’ strategy for capital account liberalization as envisaged under the
Caribbean Single Market and Economy (CSME) initiative. The authorities reaffirmed their
commitment to implementing the last steps in the liberalization process, which relate to
investment abroad in real estate, the purchase of interest-bearing securities, and private
borrowing. The easing of capital market restrictions could have several beneficial effects on
the financial sector, principally by engendering competition for borrowing and lending,
expanding the menu of saving instruments for the population, and allowing institutional
savers such as the pension funds greater choice to diversify their portfolio of assets.
E. Addressing Vulnerabilities
35.
Fiscal sector vulnerabilities appear moderate, although high debt, and rising
interest rates and oil prices, make the economy susceptible to shocks. Gross financing
requirements are high (25 percent of GDP), but are likely to be met mainly from domestic
sources, and appear manageable over the medium term.11 Nevertheless, a debt sustainability
analysis, anchored on the baseline scenario, indicates that the debt ratio could rise markedly
in the context of adverse shocks (Tables 8 and 9). Maintaining the primary deficit at its
current level would also entail risks, with public debt rising to over 100 percent of GDP by
the end of the decade. Furthermore, given the high correlation of economic activity with the
industrial countries—owing to heavy dependence on tourism (Table 10)—the economy
remains vulnerable to a downturn in world economic activity or deterioration in international
security.
36.
The banking sector appears well poised to absorb shocks. Current vulnerabilities
are low in light of the high levels of capital and provisioning in the banking sector. Although
recent ownership changes in the financial sector, including the privatization of the state10

owned (and largest) bank potentially exposes Barbados’ financial sector to shocks in other
regional economies, vulnerabilities arising from this appear to be low.12 The parent banks are
well capitalized, and regional central banks have signed a memorandum of understanding for
the consolidated supervision of interregional banks. The authorities are also progressing with
outstanding issues raised in the FSAP, including those related to the preparation of guidelines
for assessing market risks; revisions to the Financial Institutions Act; and strengthening the
regulation and supervision of the insurance sector.
37.
Efforts have been made to mitigate weather-related vulnerabilities and their
linkages to the financial sector. Barbados lies outside the usual path for hurricanes in the
Caribbean. Nevertheless, the recent destructive hurricanes in Grenada and the Cayman
Islands—the former was last struck by a hurricane over 40 years ago—underscore how these
disasters can have substantial ramifications for the financial sector in the region.13 The
authorities indicated that in the wake of last year’s events, Barbados has been participating in
efforts to reinvigorate the regional initiative for the pooling of catastrophic risk. National
disaster preparedness plans were being reviewed on an annual basis, and all public assets
were fully covered by insurance.
F. Growth-Enhancing Measures
38.
The mission encouraged an accelerated program of structural reforms aimed at
improving the competitiveness and supply-side response of the economy. The mission
welcomed many of the measures taken by the authorities to improve the competitive
environment in Barbados, including the reduction in corporate tax rates, telecommunications
reform, and the corporatization of the airport. To further buttress these efforts, the mission
suggested additional steps in the following areas:
•

Trade liberalization: Although WTO compliant, Barbados’ trade regime is
moderately restrictive, reflecting an average tariff level of 16 percent and some
residual export and import licensing requirements.14 This imposes costs on a number
of Barbados’ more competitive activities, including tourism. Against this background,
the mission strongly recommended against the imposition of a surcharge on nonCARICOM imports. The staff supported the authorities’ strategy to liberalize trade in
the context of the CMSE, including the proposed liberalization of trade of services,
and the FTAA. At the same time, to complement these initiatives, the mission urged
the authorities to eliminate remaining import and export licensing requirements.

12

During the last two years, two commercial banks were bought by Trinidadian and
Bermudian entities.

13

These hurricanes, for example, led to financial distress for a Jamaican-based insurance
company.

14

These apply to selected vegetables, processed food products, and manufacturing inputs.

- 20 -

•

Reform of the sugar sector: The potential effects of the forthcoming changes in the
European sugar regime—to be decided by the EU by end-2005—should be carefully
assessed. The Government’s present strategy for the sector involves the
diversification of the industry and promotion of new products, including ethanol.
Given that Barbados is one of the world’s highest-cost producers of sugar, and in
light of the reduction in prices envisaged under the EU sugar regime, it is
questionable whether the industry—or activities using raw sugar as an input—can
survive without high levels of public sector support. Moreover, the opportunity cost
of land currently used for sugar production is high, given Barbados’ high population
density. The team noted that the social costs of restructuring the industry could be
ameliorated by the introduction of appropriate social safety nets for the affected
workers.

•

Privatization and enterprise reform: The mission supported the authorities’
strategy to privatize or place under private management all public enterprises that do
not serve public policy objectives. In this context, it encouraged the authorities to
move forward on their plan for divesting its shares in Gems hotels and the stateowned insurance company and to develop an explicit timetable for privatizing the
remaining enterprises that fit the criterion described above.

•

Labor market flexibility: The mission encouraged the authorities to explore options
to further strengthen labor market flexibility, including those suggested in the recent
IDB study on labor markets.15 In particular, the authorities should examine whether
there is scope to streamline unemployment and severance benefits in light of the dual
eligibility of workers for both unemployment and severance payments. Options to
improve worker training and the Labor Market Information System could also be
explored.

•

Investment climate and fiscal incentives: The mission noted that these incentives—
which cover a wide range of activities and benefit both foreign and domestic
producers—were costly, and that their effectiveness was highly uncertain. Rather than
offering activity-specific tax incentives, staff suggested that surveys could be used to
guide efforts to strengthen the investment climate, especially in light of the relatively
low level of FDI outside of real estate. The mission also recommended a reassessment
recent initiatives to ensure that market failures or public policy objectives justified the
costs of government intervention. The authorities responded that recent initiatives
were predicated on public policy concerns and that explicit financial support for these
activities was captured in the budget. Regarding attracting remittances to Barbados
from nationals living abroad, the authorities indicated that there were no impediments

15

Proposals,” paper prepared for an IDB-sponsored workshop on April 1, 2005 in Washington,
and in Barbados on May 4, 2005.

- 21 -

to investment or remittances flows, and attributed the relatively low remittances to
Barbados’ high standard of living and the underreporting of these inflows.
G. Statistical Issues
39.
The statistical information provided by Barbados is broadly adequate for
surveillance purposes, although some important weaknesses remain. While financial
statistics are available on a timely basis, the coverage of data on the operation of public
enterprises and on the capital account of the balance of payments need to be improved. The
linkage between the offshore sector, the balance of payments, and the national income
accounts also merits strengthening. An index of real estate prices would also greatly facilitate
stress testing of different scenarios in financial markets.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
40.
A strong recovery of the Barbadian economy appears to have taken hold during
the last year, spearheaded by the tourism sector. Growth prospects for the next three years
are favorable, reflecting the strong global environment and the expected fillip to activity from
the buildup to the 2007 World Cup.
41.
However, medium-term challenges remain. In particular, macroeconomic
imbalances—including high levels of public debt, high external current account deficits, and
declining international reserves—will need to be addressed to preserve the fixed exchange
rate regime and secure sustainable growth. In the absence of fiscal consolidation, public debt
would rise steadily, and would exceed 100 percent of GDP by the end of the decade. The
post-recession import surge has contributed to a widening of the external current account
deficit, which is projected to remain at historically high levels over the next several years.
The net international reserve position has weakened substantially during the last year, and is
projected to fall below two months of imported goods and services by 2007 under the
baseline scenario.
42.
Fiscal consolidation should be at the center of the strategy to address these
imbalances. While the authorities should be commended for the fiscal adjustment achieved
over the last two years, the primary deficit nonetheless remains the highest in the region.
Furthermore, the injection of fiscal stimulus in FY 2005/06, in the midst of a robust privatesector led recovery, will make the path to debt sustainability more difficult. Therefore, the
fiscal deficit will need to be reduced decisively while the external economic environment
remains favorable, so as to ensure that an adequate reserve cover is maintained, and that the
government debt ratio is placed firmly on a declining path. This would help relieve the
burden on monetary policy to shore up the reserve position and facilitate adequate credit
growth to support private investment and economic activity.
43.
The government’s effort to trim expenditures is commendable, but there is also a
need to intensify the revenue effort. These tax measures would partially offset the projected
revenue loss from the decline in customs duties as a result of trade liberalization. The
authorities’ efforts to promote private sector participation in the provision of economic

- 22 -

infrastructure and services is welcome, but the expenditure commitments associated with
these projects will need to be carefully monitored and controlled. The authorities are also
encouraged to rationalize the tariffs of major public enterprises, in particular water and bus
fares, with a view to reducing subsidies for these entities.
44.
The fixed exchange rate regime remains appropriate for Barbados. The longstanding peg has become a strong anchor of price stability and investor confidence. To
maintain the regime, it will be important to address recent macroeconomic imbalances that, if
left unattended, will result in an erosion of external reserves to very low levels.
45.
Maintaining the fixed exchange rate regime will also require efforts to address
rising unit labor costs that reduce competitiveness. The decline in the real effective
exchange rate—owing to the peg to the U.S. dollar—has shielded Barbados’ external sector,
to some extent, from the adverse effects of rising unit labor costs. To strengthen
competitiveness, it will be important to better align wage increases with developments in
labor productivity, and to accelerate productivity growth through structural reforms.
46.
The authorities are urged to make greater use of indirect monetary policy
instruments. The limited range of policy instruments has contributed to inefficient financial
intermediation. It is recommended that the authorities phase out the administered minimum
interest rate on savings deposits and consider accelerating the transition to market-based
instruments of monetary control. Regarding broader financial sector reforms, the staff
welcomes the actions taken to implement the remaining FSAP recommendations.
47.
There is scope to accelerate structural reforms in a wide range of areas. The
authorities have already made significant progress, including the corporatization of the
airport authority and the move toward greater competition in the telecommunications sector,
and the authorities’ focus on reforms relating to the budget, tax policy, and privatization is
welcome, as is their continued commitment to further trade and capital account liberalization
in the context of the CSME and the envisaged FTAA. At the same time, there is scope to
accelerate and deepen the structural reform effort, including by removing import and export
licenses; reform of the sugar sector; privatizing the remaining public enterprises that do not
meet public policy objectives; enhancing labor market flexibility; and rationalizing fiscal
incentives.
48.
The statistical information provided by Barbados is broadly adequate for
surveillance purposes, though some weaknesses remain. In particular, the flow and
coverage of data on the operations of the public enterprises and on the capital account of the
balance of payments would need to be improved.
49.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Barbados be conducted on the
standard 12-month cycle.

1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency denominated debt;
and e = nominal exchange ratedepreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ The implied change in other key variables under this scenario is discussed in the text.
9/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).
10/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value
of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
4/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and nondebt inflows in percent of GDP.
5/ The implied change in other key variables under this scenario is discussed in the text.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and nondebt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels of the last projection year.

APPENDIX III

Barbados—Relations with the Caribbean Development Bank
The Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) approved US$224.4 million in loans, contingent
loans, equity and grants to Barbados between 1970 and 2004. This represents 9.0 percent of
total approvals to CDB’s borrowing member countries.
Of the total funds approved US$61.7 million or 27.5 percent were allocated to the productive
sectors which comprise agriculture, manufacturing, tourism, and mining. Within the
productive sectors, US$45.5 million or 20.3 percent of the total was allocated to the
manufacturing sector, while tourism accounted for US$12.0 million, or 5.3 percent.
Economic infrastructure accounted for US$112.9 million or 50.3 percent of approved funds.
Of these funds, US$52.4 million (23.4 percent) were allocated to the transportation,
US$55 million (24.5 percent) to the education, and US$3.2 million (1.4 percent) to the health
sectors.
Approximately US$13.5 million in new loans (multi-sector) was approved in 2003 while no
new loans were approved in 2004.

APPENDIX IV

Barbados—Statistical Issues
1.
The statistical information provided by Barbados is broadly adequate for surveillance
purposes, although some important weaknesses remain. Barbados participates in the General
Data Dissemination System (GDDS). Information about Barbados macroeconomic statistics
(metadata) and the authorities’ plans for improving the statistical base are posted on the
Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB) on the internet.
National accounts
2.
Compilation of the national accounts by economic sector is hampered by lack of
reliable and current data on nonsugar agriculture, private construction and nontourism service
activities. To address some of these weaknesses, the authorities have scheduled a census of
economic activity covering tourism, financial businesses, and transport and communications
that should be initiated in June 2005. The Barbados Statistical Services (BSS) estimates the
national accounts by expenditure based on selected surveys. Whereas the household survey
yields a reliable estimate of aggregate consumption, the national accounts suffer from
weaknesses in the external trade and private investment data. Figures for gross domestic
product at constant prices are based on 1974 price weights. The authorities are currently in
the process of updating the weights to 2000 in order to facilitate comparison within the
CARICOM area. National accounts are based on SNA 68 as opposed to the updated SNA 93.
Despite recent initiatives to update the consumer price index and the index of industrial
production, potential misalignments in real estate prices are left unattended owing to the
absence of a systematic index of property prices. The consumer price index uses an
expenditure basket for 1998–99 for its July 2001=100 series introduced in January 2002.
This is a welcome update on 1978 expenditure weights and given this infrequent basket
change, comparisons of CPI data prior to 2002 with CPI data after 2002 should be
undertaken with care. The index of industrial production is based on the sectoral weights
prevailing in 1982. The authorities are currently working towards rebasing the series to 1994.
Nonfinancial public sector
3.
Fairly comprehensive and up-to-date data above the line are available for the general
government, but there is a lag in the reporting of transfers. As a result of the under-reporting
of off-budget transactions, a significant discrepancy exists between the overall balance and
financing data. Data on public enterprises are not systematically and promptly reported to the
ministry of finance. Also, financial sector data on public sector net domestic borrowing
usually cannot fully be reconciled with above the line fiscal data, partly because of limited
availability of the nonbank financial sector information. Data supplied by the public
enterprises, such as on government transfers and capital spending, often differ from those
provided by the ministry of finance.

- 38 -

APPENDIX IV

Financial sector
4.
Important weaknesses remain with respect to the overall quality, coverage, and
timeliness of the monetary accounts. The concept of residency applied to the monetary
statistics is not consistent with the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual. The
CBB classifies some loans to and deposits of non-residents as credit to the private sector and
part of broad money, respectively, instead of as net foreign assets of commercial banks.
Moreover, non-national individuals are recognized as residents only after they have resided
continuously in Barbados for at least three years. There is also a need to extend the coverage
of data to include offshore bank accounts. Recently, the timeliness of data reported to STA
for publication in IFS greatly improved. The lag in submitting monetary data decreased from
about five months to about six weeks for the central bank accounts, and about ten weeks for
the monetary survey. Accounting conventions underlying monetary data compiled by the
CBB are in need of improvement. The CBB data are reported on a cash basis and do not
include accrued receivables and payables. Commercial banks’ positions are recorded on an
accrual basis; however, the accrued interest receivable and payable is classified under other
assets and other liabilities, respectively, rather than under the appropriate category of
domestic credit. Marketable securities are recorded at the acquisition cost and revalued to
market value only on an annual basis (as of December 31). Short-term zero-coupon securities
(treasury bills) are recorded at acquisition cost and are not revalued to market value until
redemption at maturity. Positions with the IMF (SDR holdings, Reserve Tranche Position,
and SDR Allocation) are valued at the IMF holdings rate rather than at the end-of-period
market rate. These issues are being addressed in the context of the GDDS.
External sector
5.
Lags in the compilation of merchandise trade data limit the timeliness of estimating
the external current account balance, in particular, information on the activities of offshore
sector. Estimates of the components of the financial account also need to be strengthened.
Quarterly balance of payments estimates are no longer provided.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
August 15, 2005

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with
Barbados
On August 5, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Barbados.1
Background
Barbados compares favorably with other Caribbean countries on economic and social
indicators. The economy is heavily dependent on tourism and financial services. The population
is about 272,000, and per capita income (on a PPP basis) is about US$15,700. Poverty rates
are the lowest in the Caribbean. Social indicators compare favorably in both a regional and
global context; in 2004, for example, Barbados was ranked 29th among 177 countries on the
United Nations Development Program’s Human Development Index.
Barbados was one of the better-performing economies in the Caribbean in the 1990s. During
1993–2000, Barbados grew at 3 percent, inflation was less than 2 percent, and public sector
deficits were maintained at less than 3 percent of GDP.
The economy—especially the tourism and financial services sectors—suffered a sharp
recession in 2001–02 following the September 11th attacks and the global slowdown. In
response to the deterioration in the external environment, the government implemented a public
investment program to help revive economic activity. Combined with public sector wage
increases, this contributed to a widening of the overall nonfinancial public sector fiscal deficit
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2–
from about 2 percent of GDP in FY 2000/01 to about 13 percent of GDP in FY 2002/03. As a
result, the public sector debt-to-GDP ratio rose from 74 percent in March 2001 to 87 percent in
March 2003. The external current account deficit remained at around 6 percent of GDP over
2001–03.
A strong economic recovery appears to have taken hold in 2004. Real GDP growth in 2004
is estimated at 4.4 percent, led by a recovery in tourism, construction, and communications.
The public sector deficit fell to 6½ percent of GDP in FY 2003/04 and 6 percent of GDP in FY
2004/05 as capital expenditures declined from their high levels of the previous years. Following
the rebound in economic activity and a reduction in mortgage lending rates, growth in credit to
the private sector—especially to households—accelerated in 2004. Private sector credit grew by
almost 17 percent during 2004, reflecting strong demand for mortgages. Higher personal
incomes of households also spurred private credit growth. Base money declined, however,
owing to the resulting from the decline in commercial banks excess reserves. The banking
sector appears to be sound and financial sector indicators have improved with the pickup in
economic activity.
The external current account deficit rose from 7 percent of GDP in 2003 to 10½ percent of GDP
in 2004, reflecting a broad-based import surge related to the rapid increase in private sector
credit and the expansion in economic activity. Capital inflows also declined with the cessation of
privatization receipts from abroad. As a result, the balance of payments moved from a surplus
to a deficit of 5½ percent of GDP in 2004, with gross international reserves (GIR) falling to
3¾ months of imported goods and nonfactor services.
Structural reforms have advanced in taxation, telecommunications, and the public enterprise
sector. Corporate and personal tax rates have been further lowered, in line with the multiyear
reduction in these rates initiated in FY 2002/03. In telecommunications, the final phase of reform
began in early 2005, and will involve the liberalization of external telecommunications and the
issuance of new licenses for fixed telephone lines on a competitive basis. Legislation to
corporatize the Airport Authority was also recently approved
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors observed that based on a recovery in tourism, construction, and
communications, Barbados recorded stronger economic activity and low inflation in 2004.
Directors noted that growth prospects for the next three years remain favorable, reflecting the
positive global environment and the boost to growth from the buildup to the 2007 World Cup
cricket games. At the same time, Directors underscored that a key challenge in maintaining and
sustaining strong economic growth going forward will be to address macroeconomic
imbalances, including a high level of public debt, large fiscal and external current account
deficits, and declining international reserves.
Directors observed that the expansionary public investment program, implemented to revive the
economy after the recession of 2001–02, contributed to raising Barbados’ public debt to a level
far exceeding the average for Latin America and the Caribbean. While welcoming the efforts to
reduce the public sector deficit over the past two years, they noted with concern that the primary

-3–
deficit remains among the highest in the region and that public debt will rise steadily in the
absence of fiscal consolidation. Against this background, they cautioned that the injection of
fiscal stimulus in FY 2005/06, in the midst of a robust private-sector led recovery, could make
the path to debt reduction more difficult. Directors therefore urged the authorities to seize the
opportunity provided by the external economic environment to reduce the fiscal deficit
decisively, thereby placing public debt on a firmly declining path and building a fiscal cushion in
the event of negative shocks. Directors noted that faster fiscal consolidation will also help
strengthen the external reserve position, without overburdening monetary policy, while allowing
credit to be channeled to the private sector to support growth.
Directors welcomed the government’s plan to reduce public expenditure over the medium term.
Most Directors recommended that the authorities complement these efforts with revenue
measures, as well as a rationalization of the tariffs of major public enterprises, with a view to
reducing subsidies to these entities. Directors were encouraged by the authorities’ preparation
for the implementation of output-based budgeting within a medium-term framework, which is
expected to improve budget formulation. While welcoming the authorities’ efforts to promote
private-sector participation in the provision of economic infrastructure and services, Directors
cautioned that expenditure commitments associated with these activities should be carefully
monitored and accounted for in budget documents. To assist their efforts to improve fiscal
transparency, a few Directors recommended that the authorities consider requesting a fiscal
Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes.
Directors supported preserving Barbados’ fixed exchange rate regime, noting its positive role as
an anchor for price stability and investor confidence. They emphasized, however, that going
forward, the exchange rate peg will need to be supported by sound policies aimed at addressing
the recent macroeconomic imbalances. Directors also stressed the need to strengthen
competitiveness by tightening the link between wage increases and developments in labor
productivity, as well as accelerating productivity growth through structural reform.
Directors welcomed the recent steps to slow the growth of credit, and recommended further
tightening to help arrest the decline in foreign reserves. Directors encouraged the authorities to
make greater use of indirect monetary policy instruments and enhance competition in the
banking system. They noted that this would facilitate the gradual phasing out of the minimum
deposit rate and improve the efficiency of financial intermediation. Directors noted that while the
banking sector appears well poised to absorb shocks, risks related to the large share of public
debt held by domestic financial institutions will need to be monitored carefully. Directors were
encouraged by the progress made in addressing the outstanding issues from the Financial
Sector Assessment Program report of 2002, and called for strengthened efforts to curb money
laundering and the financing of terrorism.
Directors underlined the importance of structural reforms to encourage foreign direct
investment, improve competitiveness, and enhance Barbados’ long-term growth potential.
They welcomed the significant progress that has already been made in some areas, including
the reduction in corporate tax rates, telecommunications reform, and the corporatization of the
airport. They welcomed the authorities’ focus on reforms relating to tax policy and privatization,
as well as their continued commitment to further trade and capital account liberalization within

-4–
the context of the Caribbean Single Market and Economy initiative and the envisaged Free
Trade Area of the Americas. Key areas for further reforms include the removal of import and
export licenses; reform of the sugar sector; restructuring or privatization of the public enterprises
that do not meet public policy objectives; and enhanced labor market flexibility. Directors also
urged the authorities to rationalize costly fiscal incentives to investment.
Directors observed that statistical information provided by Barbados is broadly adequate for
surveillance purposes, but noted the need to strengthen the quality, coverage, and timeliness of
data for the public enterprises and the capital account of the balance of payments

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
