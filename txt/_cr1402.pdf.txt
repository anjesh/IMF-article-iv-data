STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND SECOND REVIEW UNDER THE EXTENDED CREDIT
FACILITY ARRANGEMENT

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Context. The coalition government that came into office on December 12, 2012,
remains fully committed to the pursuit of sound policies that are helping to consolidate
macroeconomic stability, despite a challenging external environment and more
uncertain oil prospects.
Program performance. Overall, program performance has been satisfactory. All
continuous and end-June 2013 quantitative performance criteria were met, and one of
two end-June 2013 structural benchmarks was met while the other one will be met with
a delay. However, more time will be needed to devise a plan to clear cross-arrears (the
end-September 2013 structural benchmark was missed). The quantitative indicative
target on pro-poor spending was met, but the other two indicative targets were not.
Macroeconomic and key structural policies. The authorities’ macroeconomic policy
framework for 2014 and beyond reaffirms their commitment to fiscal prudence in
support of the exchange rate peg to the euro and debt sustainability, and to the pursuit
of sound financial policies. The authorities are committed to a 2014 domestic primary
deficit target of 3.0 percent of GDP, in line with projected non-debt-creating financing,
and to a further tightening of the fiscal stance by 2017, given more uncertain oil
prospects. To meet the fiscal targets and create additional space for priority
infrastructure and pro-poor spending, the authorities will strengthen revenue
collections, including by modernizing the tax and customs administrations and
broadening the tax base, and will contain non-priority spending. The central bank has
increased its vigilance over the financial sector through off- and on-site inspections of
commercial banks, and is reinforcing compliance with regulatory and prudential
requirements. It will work with commercial banks to enhance the banking system’s
efficiency, profitability, and resilience. The authorities are striving to strengthen external
competitiveness and reduce external vulnerabilities through improvements in the
business climate and various productivity-enhancing measures.

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

CONTEXT
The authorities remain fully committed to the pursuit of sound policies that are helping to consolidate
macroeconomic stability despite a challenging external environment and more uncertain oil prospects.
1.

The new government that came into office in late 2012 remains committed to fiscal

discipline. The previous minority government was censured by the National Assembly on
November 26, 2012, and formally dismissed by President Pinto da Costa on December 4, 2012. A
coalition, majority government consisting of the other three parties with representation in the
National Assembly was formed under the leadership of Prime Minister Gabriel Costa and sworn in
by the President on December 12, 2012. Since taking office, the new government has demonstrated
its commitment to resisting spending pressures that in past election cycles derailed fiscal rectitude
(local and parliamentary elections are expected to be held by August 2014).
2.

The government is committed to implementing the National Poverty Reduction

Strategy Paper II and to the consolidation of macroeconomic and financial stability (Box 1).
These policies aim to reduce poverty through wealth creation, and promote economic development
through fiscal prudence, financial stability, and the creation of an enabling environment for private
investment and inclusive growth. Fiscal policy continues to support macroeconomic stability and
ongoing efforts to mitigate debt sustainability risks, by ensuring that the domestic primary deficit is
in line with available non-debt-creating financing while mobilizing additional domestic revenue for
priority infrastructure and pro-poor spending. Given the critical role of good liquidity management
and effective banking supervision in maintaining financial stability, the central bank will continue to
improve its liquidity forecasting capabilities, and it will continue to implement diligently its planned
on-site inspections of commercial banks.
3.

The recent decision by the French oil company Total to withdraw from Block 1 of the

Joint Development Zone (JDZ) with Nigeria is akin to a significant external shock, calling for a
strengthening of macroeconomic and financial policies given more uncertain oil prospects
(Box 2). Oil production was projected to start in Block 1 of the JDZ in 2015. While the authorities
remain optimistic about the country’s longer-term prospects for oil production, citing the interest of
several medium-size oil companies to take over from Total, they also recognize the need to
strengthen macroeconomic and financial policies. In particular, increased uncertainty around the
timing and volume of oil production suggests the need to gradually tighten fiscal policy and reduce
the size the banking system—with a view to increasing the system’s efficiency, profitability, and

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

resilience—and to promote even more forcefully the development of non-oil priority sectors, such
as tourism, agriculture and fisheries.
4.

Implementation of the main recommendations of the last Article IV consultation

discussions has been relatively good (Box 3). Executive Directors emphasized the need to maintain
fiscal prudence and stabilize the domestic primary deficit in line with available non-debt creating
flows, while enhancing tax revenues through a reduction of tax exemptions. They also
recommended the adoption of reforms designed to eliminate cross-arrears.1 In addition, noting São
Tomé and Príncipe’s high risk of debt distress, Executive Directors advised the authorities to increase
their reliance on grants and highly concessional finance. These recommendations have either been
adopted or are being addressed within the context of the ECF supported arrangement, although
tangible progress toward the elimination of cross-arrears remains elusive.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PROSPECTS
Adherence to a prudent fiscal policy stance in the context of the fixed exchange rate regime has helped
to foster macroeconomic stability despite the country’s vulnerability to shocks.
5.

After experiencing significant real economic growth volatility and high inflation

through 2009, growth has become more stable since and inflation reached single digits
recently (Table 1, and Figure 1). However, real economic growth slowed to 4 percent in 2012,
reflecting a scaling back of project financing and foreign direct investment as many of São Tomé
and Príncipe’s key partners were hard hit by the global economic slowdown. Growth is projected to
remain unchanged at 4 percent in 2013 in light of lingering uncertainties stemming from the
challenging external environment and continued weak external financing prospects. Despite São
Tomé and Príncipe’s vulnerability to supply shocks, inflation has continued to recede following the
adoption of the peg to the euro in January 2010 and maintenance of fiscal discipline since then (see
below). Although annual inflation reached 10½ percent at end-2012, following unseasonably heavy
rains, which disrupted the supply of perishables, inflationary pressures abated by early 2013 and
annual inflation reached 6½ percent in August 2013 (its lowest level in two decades).
6.

The fiscal stance has been prudent in recent years (Tables 2 and 3, and Figure 2). After an

initial slippage in 2009, the domestic primary balance has improved steadily thereafter, reflecting
efforts to increase tax revenues and contain domestically-financed capital expenditures and goods

and services outlays. However, the authorities have had difficulty sustaining the tax effort, which
dipped from 16½ percent of GDP in 2010–11 to just 14 percent of GDP in 2012. Although this procyclical outcome reflected the influence of the weakening economy on customs duties and
consumption and profit taxes, revenue mobilization was also adversely affected by a still narrow tax
base and the persistence of cross-arrears, which include fuel tax arrears.
7.

Fiscal performance through end-June 2013 was satisfactory, but cross-arrears flared

up again. The authorities offset the underperformance of tax revenues (due to the weakening
economy and accumulation of fuel tax arrears) and a higher wage bill—related to the adoption of a
new career ladder in the national security sector and overtime payments for teachers that were not
foreseen in the budget—with higher nontax revenues and lower discretionary spending. In
particular, transfers from parastatal and fishing royalties were front-loaded, and license fees related
to the sale of the government’s stake in STP Cabo to an Angolan telecommunications company
boosted nontax revenues, while there was under-execution of transfer payments and domesticallyfinanced capital expenditure, as well as lower goods and services outlays.
8.

Following the adoption of the fixed exchange rate regime, monetary aggregate

growth has been consistent with maintaining the credibility of the peg (Tables 4 and 5, and
Figure 3). Broad money growth accelerated in 2012, reflecting a larger than projected accumulation
of foreign assets, but it has since abated. Year-on-year growth in broad money slowed from an
average of 18¾ percent during the second half of 2012 to 16½ percent during the first half of 2013,
and it is now broadly in line with nominal GDP growth. This also reflects the tailing off of private
sector credit growth as household debt levels reached record highs, and the dearth of suitable
bankable investment opportunities despite some banks’ holdings of excess reserves with the central
bank above the statutory requirement.
9.

The financial soundness of the banking system was adversely impacted by rapid credit

expansion until 2011 in the context of poor risk management and lending practices (Table 6,
and Figure 3). The data reveal low overall profitability, a high and rising share of nonperforming
loans, and a rapidly declining trend in banks’ capital-to-risk-weighted-asset ratios. On the positive
side, dollarization in the banking system continues to decline, reflecting measures to foster the use
of the local currency, as well as the public’s increased confidence in the peg as inflation converges to
international levels. In April 2013, the central bank took over the operations of Island Bank, after this
small commercial bank (with only 5 percent of the system’s deposits) failed to comply with
supervisory requirements and did not submit a remedial action plan.

10.

The external current account deficit continues to decline and central bank’s

international reserves to improve (Tables 7, 8, and 9, and Figure 4). Weaker economic activity has
led to reduced imports of goods and services and an improved external current account balance.
After falling below three months of imports in mid-2012, the central bank has since accumulated
international reserves considerably. International reserves, which have been boosted by privatization
receipts from the sale of STP Cabo and grants from the World Bank and Timor-Leste, stood at
around 5½ months of imports at end-September 2013.
11.

São Tomé and Príncipe’s economic outlook will depend on strengthening the

economy’s resilience in the wake of diminished near-term oil prospects (Box 4). Fiscal and
external debt sustainability indicators are expected to improve more slowly following Total’s
unexpected announced withdrawal from Block 1 of the JDZ. The authorities will have to continue
relying on grants and highly concessional financing for many years to come, and more difficult
budget financing prospects will necessitate a tighter fiscal policy stance. Commercial banks will also
have to adapt to the new reality, and the ones that have entered the market lured mainly by the
prospects of oil will have to change their market strategy and strengthen their balance sheets,
including by further recapitalization. There is also a need to restructure and strengthen the banking
system through mergers and/or closure of distressed and weak banks. Finally, the authorities will
have to promote even more forcefully the development of non-oil priority sectors, such as tourism,
agriculture, and fisheries, including by further improving the business climate and upgrading the
country’s infrastructure with private sector support.
12.

The outlook for 2014 continues to be affected by difficult global conditions. Real GDP

growth has been revised downward, from 5½ to 5 percent, reflecting lingering uncertainties in the
world economy, weak external financing prospects for investment projects, and the changed oil
outlook.2 Inflation is projected to reach 6 percent by end-2014, as inflation expectations continue to
be anchored by a prudent fiscal policy stance and the peg of the dobra to the euro. The external
current account deficit is expected to narrow further, with weaker than previously projected
economic activity leading to lower import growth; and the central bank’s international reserves are
expected to remain comfortably above 3½ months of imports (the program’s new floor).
13.

Nevertheless, risks to the outlook are manageable. Downside risks include significant

spending overruns in the run-up to next year’s local and parliamentary elections, which in past
election cycles derailed fiscal rectitude. The authorities, however, are fully committed to resisting
2

spending pressures. The outlook could also be adversely affected by the materialization of supply
shocks (leading to higher inflation and lower growth), spillovers from a further deterioration in
financial conditions in Europe (resulting in delays in project execution due to financing shortfalls),
and delays in restructuring São Tomé and Príncipe’s banking sector (leading to continued low
profitability in the sector and stagnant credit). Upside risks include the possibility of stronger growth
in Europe, lower-than-projected inflation for 2013, and oil production.

PERFORMANCE UNDER THE ECF-SUPPORTED
PROGRAM
Overall, program implementation through end-June 2013 was satisfactory, but implementation
challenges delayed some structural reforms.
14.

Program performance through end-June 2013 was satisfactory (MEFP, Table 1). All

continuous and quantitative performance criteria (PCs) were met, but two out of three indicative
targets (ITs) were missed. The authorities met, with wide margins, the PCs on domestic primary
balance and central bank’s net international reserves. However, the larger-than-programmed
increase in net international reserves contributed to a narrow miss of the IT on base money.3 The IT
on central government domestic arrears was missed mainly due to the resurgence of the crossarrears problem, but the IT on pro-poor spending was met despite difficult financing conditions.
15.

Structural reforms have progressed, albeit at an uneven pace (MEFP, Table 2). One of

two end-June 2013 structural benchmarks was met and progress has been steadfast toward
implementation of three end-December 2013 structural benchmarks, pertaining to improvements in
both tax and customs administration and enhancements to the consumer price index. Completion of
the on-site inspection of the country’s largest commercial bank was done before the end-June 2013
target date, despite staffing constraints due to the central bank’s administrative takeover of Island
Bank. The 2010 government accounts were finalized and presented to the Court of Audit in
June 2013 (the first time in over two decades that government accounts have been prepared and
submitted). The authorities are working on the 2011 and 2012 government accounts, but preparing
the latter using the accounting feature of SAFE-e will take longer than expected given delays in the
3

It has been very difficult to forecast base money in São Tomé and Príncipe due to the large size of foreign exchange
flows relative to the economy and the limited sterilization options available to the central bank. However, the wild
swings of base money growth (Figure 3, left-middle graph) seem to have had limited impact on inflation since the
adoption of the peg to the euro in early 2010.

provision of technical assistance and training in this area. The formulation of a plan to clear crossarrears between ENCO, EMAE, and the Treasury and to avoid their recurrence is still pending. A
critical element of this strategy is to improve EMAE’s cash flow. The authorities have recently asked
the World Bank and the IFC to provide options to address this issue, which may include contracting
out the management of EMAE to a reputable international operator.

POLICIES IN THE NEAR- AND MEDIUM-TERM
Discussions centered on the need to maintain fiscal prudence in the run-up to the 2014 local and
parliamentary elections, and to formulate an appropriate policy response to more uncertain oil
prospects. There was agreement that fiscal rectitude should be maintained and the fiscal policy stance
tightened gradually over the medium term given the high risk of debt distress and more limited
availability of non-debt-creating financing in the absence of oil. The authorities stressed that efforts to
strengthen monetary liquidity management and supervisory and regulatory oversight over the
financial sector would be stepped up, and that the central bank would work with commercial banks to
increase the system’s efficiency, profitability, and resilience.

A. Strengthening Public Finances
16.

The authorities are on track to achieving the 2013 domestic primary deficit target of

3.1 percent of GDP. The domestic primary deficit target remains unchanged despite higher
projected personnel costs (an increase of about Db37 billion, or ⅔ percent of GDP, over the
budgeted amount), due to the cost of the introduction of new job ladders in the health, education,
and security sectors and a 10 percent increase in teachers’ wages (effective August 2013). Revenue
collections will be higher-than-programmed because of higher nontax revenue stemming from
license fees associated with the sale of the government’s stake in STP Cabo, while the tax-to-GDP
ratio will be unchanged (from 2012 levels) as ongoing efforts to strengthen the tax and customs
administrations and broaden the tax base are expected to offset the adverse effects on tax
collections of weaker economic growth. Finally, non-interest recurrent spending is projected to
remain in line with earlier projections, despite higher personnel costs as mentioned above, due to
non-wage recurrent and domestically-financed capital expenditure reprioritization and restraint.
17.

The fiscal program for 2013 remains fully funded. Additional external inflows more than

offset a delay in scholarship grants from Nigeria, which are now expected in 2014. Unanticipated
inflows in 2013 included: increased budget support from the World Bank (an additional
US$1.3 million); budget support from Timor-Leste (US$7 million); and proceeds from the sale of the
government’s stake in STP Cabo (US$6.4 million). These additional inflows have funded a pickup in

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

project execution relative to the first half of year, and will be used to clear Treasury’s arrears to
EMAE by end-2013 (structural benchmark).
18.

The 2014 budget will maintain fiscal rectitude during an election year. The budget will

target a domestic primary deficit of 3.0 percent of GDP, which is fully consistent with available nondebt creating financing from the World Bank, Nigeria, and transfers from the National Oil Account
(NOA). Gains from the widening of the tax base and improved taxpayer segmentation (designed to
enhance compliance among large taxpayers) are projected to result in a modest increase in the tax
effort. On the spending side, the authorities are fully committed to containing the growth of the
public sector wage bill in line with projected average inflation. The elimination (in 2013) and nonaccumulation (in 2014 and beyond) of Treasury’s arrears to EMAE is expected to serve as a catalyst
for the reduction of EMAE’s arrears to ENCO and facilitate the elimination of ENCO’s fuel tax arrears.
19.

Looking ahead, fiscal consolidation will be implemented gradually to limit its

contractionary impact. A cumulative adjustment of the domestic primary deficit of 1.0 percent of
GDP will be phased in over three years, starting in the year after local and parliamentary elections.
This will enable the authorities to weather the initial negative impact of Total’s decision and
undertake the fiscal adjustment once the recovery is firmly underway. Given the relatively low level
of recurrent and domestically-financed capital expenditure, there is limited scope for further
expenditure containment. Thus, notwithstanding ongoing efforts at strengthening expenditure
prioritization and public financial management, the needed fiscal adjustment will be more heavily
weighted toward revenue enhancement, comprising a mix of customs and tax administrative
reforms and, as needed, tax policy measures.
20.

While the authorities reiterated their commitment to fiscal prudence, they had some

reservations about the medium-term revenue projections. The authorities expressed concern
about the revenue projections which, they noted, depended to some extent on the resolution of the
arrears issue between EMAE and ENCO. Staff stressed that the revenue projections were indeed
consistent with a regularization of fuel tax payments by ENCO. In addition, staff noted that revenue
projections were in line with São Tomé and Príncipe’s past revenue performance and expected
improvements in the tax and customs administrations due to extensive technical assistance provided
by the Fund and others.

Structural reforms to strengthen public finances
21.

10

Specific achievements in 2013 in the fiscal reform area included the following:

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE



Creation of a macro-fiscal unit, with representatives from the Ministry of Planning and
Finance, Central Bank, and National Institute of Statistics (INE), which has begun the
preliminary work toward implementing a medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF).



Steps to make the government’s financial administration system (SAFE-e) fully operational,
including the activation of the system’s accounting module.

22.

Reforms that are ongoing or currently slated for 2014 include:



Adopting a comprehensive solution to the problem of cross-arrears. The plan to eliminate
cross-arrears between the Treasury, EMAE and ENCO and to avoid their recurrence is now
expected to be finalized by end-March 2014 (structural benchmark) and the elimination of
Treasury’s arrears to EMAE by end-December 2013 (structural benchmark). In addition,
quarterly ITs have been introduced to monitor during 2014 the non-accumulation of
Treasury’s arrears to EMAE.



Expanding the tax base by launching the “Operation Taxpayer Inclusion” project and
adopting and executing quarterly metrics for the number of newly registered taxpayers. The
project is designed to register on a cumulative basis 500 and 800 new taxpayers,
respectively, by end-June 2014 and end-December 2014 (structural benchmarks), and
ultimately targets registration of an additional 3,000 taxpayers by the project’s end.



Enhancing taxpayer management within the Tax Directorate by increasing security of the
Taxpayer Registry, and by creating a dedicated large taxpayer unit and of a single taxpayer
computerized file system (structural benchmark, December 2013).



Progressing toward completion of the second phase of ASYCUDA World through activation
of all the functionalities and the establishment of a fully computerized procedure (structural
benchmark, December 2013).



Preparing the general government accounts for 2012 and presenting them to the National
Assembly and Court of Audit by end-December 2013 (structural benchmark).



Combating tax fraud and evasion by improving the selection of taxpayers for audit through
risk analysis, expanding tax coverage throughout the country, and strengthening the
National Tax Court, by allowing it to perform its duties with own resources.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE



Increasing taxpayer voluntary compliance by improving the quality of services provided to
taxpayers, simplifying and harmonizing tax procedures, extending tax services to the more
remote areas of the country, and conducting visits to newly created firms.



Providing the tax and customs administrations with the necessary resources, including
additional staff and equipment, to implement the reforms mentioned above.

B. Financial Sector Diagnostic
While the banking system is generally seen as stable and dollarization is on the decline, discussions
centered on possible ways to improve its performance and resilience.
23.

There is room to improve the banking system’s performance and resilience. The staff

analysis presented in Appendix 2 reveals a higher prevalence of banks in São Tomé and Príncipe
relative to peer small island states, suggesting that the country is relatively over-banked. Moreover,
although the banking system’s average capital adequacy ratio appears adequate, this indicator has
been trending downward and it masks underlying weaknesses in some cases. Asset quality has also
deteriorated, reflecting unsound lending practices and poor risk management during the credit
boom that ended in 2011. In addition, with subdued economic activity and rising nonperforming
loans, profitability indicators have declined and are likely to remain under pressure for the
foreseeable future, in the absence of corrective action. The slowing in private sector credit growth
together with largely inoperative money and interbank markets has contributed to a buildup of
excess liquidity, which may undermine the central bank’s efforts to properly manage liquidity. On
the positive side, staff recognized the success in reducing dollarization in the banking system,
including through a combination of market and prudential forces, and commended the authorities’
efforts in this regard.
24.

In view of the above findings, staff made the following recommendations to the

authorities:


Stepping up efforts to strengthen supervision and enforce prudential requirements
throughout the banking system, including the strict enforcement of the minimum capital-torisk-weighted asset ratio of 12 percent.



Considering ways to foster the merger of some small banks to increase the banking system’s
efficiency and profitability, and promote financial stability further.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE



Enforcing the legal requirement that all commercial banks publish their financial accounts to
enhance transparency and facilitate assessments of counterparty risks.



Encouraging banks to revisit their business plans and investment strategies in light of more
uncertain oil prospects, and to adjust their balance sheets accordingly.

25.

The authorities were appreciative of the staff analysis and agreed that there was a

need to improve the overall health of the banking sector. However, they attributed greater
weight to the need to address the underlying causes of the high fixed costs of the banking system,
including costly electricity and telecommunications. They also noted that the cumbersome and
costly judicial process was affecting bank profitability, and that delays in court adjudication affected
the enforcement of creditor claims. The authorities, therefore, stressed the need to improve São
Tomé and Príncipe’s infrastructure and strengthen its legislative and judicial frameworks. While a
solution to these long-standing challenges is clearly needed, staff noted that this could take time
and was not under the direct control of the central bank, and stressed that restructuring the banking
system was a more immediate solution to improve financial stability.
26.

The authorities reiterated their commitment to taking prompt corrective action to

resolve outstanding issues pertaining to distressed banks. They indicated their intention to
appoint a provisional administrator for Island Bank, and informed staff that they were vetting offers
from potential investors interested in Island Bank. The authorities added that addressing the needs
of distressed banks would not have any fiscal implications, and indicated that the central bank is
prepared to liquidate Island Bank if no firm investor commitments are received in due course.
27.

The authorities stated a clear preference for allowing more time for banks to adjust to

diminished oil prospects. While agreeing that the high share of nonperforming loans is a drag on
banks’ balance sheets, the authorities expressed concern that forcing banks to move too fast with
portfolio cleaning would only amplify their losses given the weak economy and dearth of investment
alternatives. In this context, they noted that the newly-created Bankers’ Association would facilitate
discussions on the way forward amongst industry participants and policy makers. This forum has
now tabled for discussion the deteriorating bank asset quality and other related issues, and it could
also serve as a useful forum for discussing needed legislative and judicial reforms that are needed to
reduce costs in the banking sector.

C. Enhancing Liquidity Management, Financial Stability and Safeguards
28.

The central bank continues to develop its monetary liquidity management framework

and supervisory capabilities. It has now successfully extended the liquidity forecasting horizon to
one month and is adopting a systematic approach to analyze forecasting errors as a precursor to the
introduction in due course of money market instruments. In a bid to address capacity constraints,
the central bank has recently recruited three additional staff to the Banking Supervision Department,
but staffing levels remain below optimum. A program of on-site inspections is currently in progress,
and all commercial banks are now expected to be inspected by end-June 2014, after the inspection
of the two remaining banks that have not yet been subject to inspection (structural benchmark). In
addition, the central bank will conduct by end-2013 a second on-site inspection of one bank that
was previously inspected.
29.

Other specific achievements in 2013 included:



Completing the on-site inspection of the largest commercial bank in the first half of the year.



Supporting the exchange rate peg by maintaining net international reserves at the central
bank above the equivalent of three months of imports, and investing additional international
reserves in high quality and liquid financial assets.



Expanding the role of the Internal Audit Department to track more systematically the
implementation of external auditors’ recommendations and monitor the main risks to the
central bank’s balance sheet.



Taking over the operations of Island Bank, following the bank’s failure to comply with
supervisory requirements and to submit a remedial action plan.

30.

Reforms planned for the next year strengthen the economy’s resilience to shocks,

bolster the central bank’s independence and supervisory practices, and promote financial
literacy and transparency include:


Increasing the program’s floor on net international reserves from 3 to 3½ months of imports
to boost confidence in the wake of reduced oil prospects in the near term.



Reinforcing compliance with solvency and other regulatory standards by requiring that all
commercial banks that operate in São Tomé and Príncipe have a capital-to-risk-weighted-

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

asset ratio of at least 12 percent by end-March 2014 (structural benchmark), and strictly
enforcing other banking regulations, such as reserve requirements and dissemination of
data to the credit registry, with application of penalties to non-compliant institutions.


Conducting on-site inspections of the two remaining commercial banks that have not yet
been subject to inspection by end-June 2014 (structural benchmark), and increasing the
frequency of on-site inspections thereafter, as well as improved analysis of the commercial
banks’ quarterly reports, made possible in part through the hiring of additional bank
supervisors.



Enhancing commercial bank transparency by ensuring that all commercial banks publish
their financial results for 2012 by end-March 2014. Commercial banks should aim to publish
their 2013 accounts by end-September 2014, or face penalties for non-compliance
(structural benchmark).



Developing and beginning to implement a work program to introduce a new chart-ofaccounts and reporting at the central bank in line with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS), with technical assistance from the Central Bank of Brazil.



Preparing by end-September 2014 a revised draft of the Central Bank Law that strengthens
the autonomy of the central bank in line with international standards, including in the
resolution of problem banks (structural benchmark).4



Improving external communications policies to enhance financial literacy and boost
confidence in the financial system, including regular publication of reports and economic
bulletins, strengthening the capacity of the Office of Consumer Affairs, and promoting
financial literacy.



Encouraging the use of modern technology, including credit and debit cards, point-of-sale
terminals, ATMs, and secure mobile-banking, with the objective of expanding the operations
of the electronic payments system to the whole country.

4

Further changes to the legal framework, including to the Financial Institutions Law, may also be required.

D. External Balance Assessment
Staff analysis found no conclusive evidence of a real exchange rate misalignment, but pointed to the
need to continue reducing external vulnerabilities given the country’s narrow export base and more
uncertain oil prospects.
31.

São Tomé and Príncipe’s external position is vulnerable owing to a number of factors,

including the country’s narrow export base (Appendix II). The external current account is
projected to remain in deficit over the long term, reflecting both the narrow export base and a
heavy import dependency on food, fuel, and project-related investment goods. Given São Tomé and
Príncipe’s high risk of debt distress and structural international trade deficit, achieving external
sustainability will require continued reliance on FDI, grants, and highly concessional loans.
32.

Staff analysis showed no conclusive evidence of a real exchange rate misalignment

over the medium term. In particular, the exchange rate assessment exercise, based on the IMF’s
Consultative Group on Exchange Rate (CGER) methodologies, showed that the exchange rate is
overvalued in the short-run but broadly in line with medium-term fundamentals. In the short run,
both the macroeconomic balance (MB) and external sustainability (ES) approaches suggested
overvaluation (6 and 10 percent, respectively). The models demonstrated that the real exchange rate
is generally in line with fundamentals over the medium term (undervaluation of 2½ percent (MB)
and overvaluation of 1 percent (ES)). The equilibrium real exchange rate approach, which is subject
to large uncertainties surrounding the estimates due to data limitations, showed that the dobra is
significantly overvalued in the short run (about 34 percent) and medium-term (about 37 percent).5
The potential adverse impact of the real appreciation of the currency since the adoption of the fixed
exchange rate regime, due the inflation differential between São Tomé and Príncipe and its trading
partners, is mitigated in part by other extenuating factors. On the one hand, the gradual disinflation
process currently underway can be expected to continue if fiscal prudence is sustained—thereby
significantly reducing the scope of the problem.6 In addition, the authorities’ commitment to social
investment spending and utilization of aid inflows for productivity-enhancing capital investment
5

The equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) approach is a reduced form regression model, unlike the two other
approaches which use behavioral based regression models. It does not perform well when there are data limitations
and short historical time series, as in the case of São Tomé and Príncipe.

6

Hamann and Prati (IMF, WP/02/228) examine the disinflation experience of a panel of countries and concluded that
exchange rate stabilizations were more likely to be successful than money-based stabilizations in the context of
durable and sufficient policy adjustment.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

should help to boost São Tomé and Príncipe’s underlying growth potential and strengthen its
fundamentals.
33.

Staff assess that the risk of capital reversals is low since the bulk of capital flows are in

the form of equity and public sector borrowing. The authorities have also been taking steps to
reduce their external vulnerabilities, including by building up international reserves, but will need to
accelerate structural reforms given the increased uncertainties surrounding oil production. In this
regard, staff advised the central bank to maintain a comfortable international reserves position, and
recommended a continuation of ongoing efforts to further diversify and expand the export base by
targeting reforms that improve the country’s competitiveness and business climate.
34.

Staff assessed that the central bank’s international reserves have reached levels that

are broadly in line with peer countries and considered adequate to withstand external shocks.
At about 5½ months of imports, international reserves at the central bank are in line with the
recommended five to six months of imports for low-income commodity exporters with a fixed
exchange rate.7 They are also significantly higher than traditional measures of adequacy, such as
three months of imports, 20 percent of M2, and the so-called IMF metric (30 percent of short-term
external debt, 15 percent of official foreign liabilities, 10 percent of M2, and 10 percent of exports).
In addition, the authorities have access to US$ 7.2 million in NOA deposits and €25 million from a
8

contingent credit line with Portugal.
35.

The authorities underscored their commitment to external sustainability, but

cautioned that unlocking the country’s growth potential would necessitate additional capital
investment. They added that it would take time to reduce the current account deficit given the
country’s infrastructure needs and structural trade deficit. While recognizing the vulnerabilities
caused by high debt levels, the authorities noted that a low risk of capital reversals was a mitigating
factor, lowering the risks of external borrowing for infrastructure development. At the same time,
they stressed that identifying additional sources of capital was critical to enable the country to reach
its full growth potential. They added that both the disinflation process and international reserve

In support of the exchange rate peg to the Euro, the authorities have an agreement with Portugal according to
which Portugal stands ready to provide support in the form of a credit line of up to €25 million, adding another 3½
months of imports cushion to international reserves.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

accumulation were encouraging signs and that the economic recovery was well underway, which
would enhance São Tomé and Príncipe’s external position. While they valued the staff analysis, the
authorities argued that the analysis could be further strengthened with better data and identified
the development of an international investment position (IIP) dataset as a top priority.
36.

The authorities remain fully committed to the fixed exchange rate regime and the

current level of the peg, which is seen as an effective nominal anchor for inflation. Thus, in
view of the pressing need to diversify and grow the economy’s productive and export base, staff
stressed that an added premium was placed on achieving external competitiveness through
continued tight demand management and structural reforms designed to raise productivity and
boost private investment. In addition staff identified factor price flexibility and improvements in the
business climate as critical elements of this strategy (see below).
37.

São Tomé and Príncipe continues to maintain one foreign exchange restriction. It avails

itself of the transitional arrangements under Article XIV, but does not maintain restrictions under
Article XIV. However, it maintains one measure subject to Fund approval under Article VIII—namely,
an exchange restriction arising from Article 3(i) and Article 10.1(b) of the Investment Code (Law
No. 7/2008) regarding limitations on the transferability of net income. As the authorities have not
provided a specific timetable for the removal of the existing restriction, staff do not recommend its
approval by the Executive Board.

E. Improving the Business Climate and International Competitiveness
38.

Fostering private sector led economic growth and diversification will require an

improved business climate. São Tomé and Príncipe has recently made progress in improving its
business environment, but more needs to be done to diversify production and put the economy on
a sustainable growth path. Although São Tomé and Príncipe was ranked as one of the top reformers
in 2011 in the World Bank’s 2012 Doing Business Survey,9 this effort was not sustained. In the
recently released 2014 Survey, São Tomé and Príncipe’s ranking slipped a few positions. Its ranking
is also lower than comparator small states and well below the average for sub-Saharan Africa.
Moreover, the 2014 survey shows a decline in eight out of 10 indicators, with only modest
improvements pertaining to the ease of getting electricity and enforcing contracts.

9

While the Doing Business Survey generally provides an indication of progress and areas in need of improvement its
results, including for São Tomé and Príncipe, should be interpreted with caution given, inter alia, limited coverage of
businesses constraints and small number of informants.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

39.

The authorities agreed that there was a pressing need for additional structural reforms

to boost private investment and raise productivity through an improved business climate.
Improvements to physical infrastructure and key legislative and administrative reforms are needed
with respect to: enhanced trade facilitation; strengthening property and investor rights, access to
credit, simplification of the payment of taxes, and improved access to construction licenses; as well
as improved transportation networks and utility services.
40.

Some of the concerns raised in the Doing Business Survey will be addressed by the

planned one-stop shop within the customs administration. Preparatory arrangements are now
underway for the launching the new trade-related one-stop-shop by early-2015. Once in place, the
new facility will reduce trade-related transaction costs and enhance São Tomé and Príncipe’s
external competitiveness. It will also have a positive effect on revenue collection, by permitting the
single and simultaneous payment of customs duties and other fees and taxes due to all institutions
involved in the clearance of goods. According to the authorities, key milestones include: establishing
by end-June 2014 the connectivity of the Customs and Tax Directorate (structural benchmark); and
the elimination by end-December 2014 of hard-copy documents and introduction of electronic
signing and approval of documents (structural benchmark). This facility will also compliment the
one-stop shop for investors established in 2011, which was designed to centralize the administrative
requirements for establishing a business in São Tomé and Príncipe and reduce investor costs.

F. Strengthening the Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the
Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) Framework
41.

The authorities have taken steps to address the deficiencies of São Tomé and

Príncipe’s AML/CFT framework. With technical assistance from the IMF’s Legal Department, they
drafted amendments to the AML/CFT Law and submitted the draft law to the National Assembly in
May 2013. The law was approved unanimously by the National Assembly, and President Pinto da
Costa has signed it. Passage of this law has facilitated the recent removal of São Tomé and Príncipe
from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)’s list of high risk and non-cooperative jurisdictions. The
FATF noted, however, that Sao Tomé and Principe’s AML/CFT regime still exhibited a number of
strategic deficiencies and has encouraged the authorities to work with the Inter-Governmental
Group Against Money Laundering in West Africa (GIABA) to address these issues, including by
strengthening the operations and core functions of the financial intelligence unit (FIU) through
improved resources, including staffing, equipment and training.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

STRENGTHENING THE STATISTICAL SYSTEM
42.

The authorities continue to strengthen the statistical system. In addition to the several

improvements listed above, INE is taking steps to improve the outdated consumer price index (CPI).
The household survey completed in 2011 is providing the basis for reweighting the CPI components
and introducing new goods and services to its basket (both were updated last about twenty years
ago). The introduction of the new CPI by end-December 2013 (structural benchmark) is expected to
greatly improve the measurement of inflation (Informational Annex).

PROGRAM MONITORING AND SAFEGUARDS
43.

Program monitoring. Staff and the authorities have reached agreement regarding PCs

for 2014, and the PCs, ITs, and structural benchmarks for the second half of 2013 and for 2014 are
presented in Tables 1–4 of Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP, Attachment I).
The definitions of quantitative PCs and ITs are provided in the Technical Memorandum of
Understanding (TMU, Attachment II). The third review is expected to be completed by April 2014,
the fourth review by October 2014, and the fifth review by April 2015.
44.

Safeguards. The commitment of the authorities to strengthen the central bank’s governance

structure and to mitigate the risks identified by the recent IMF safeguards assessment is welcome.10
Important milestones in this direction will include: (i) establishing independent oversight on audit
and control functions; (ii) transitioning to International Financial Reporting Standards; (iii)
implementing external auditors’ recommendations; and (iv) monitoring the main risks to the central
bank’s balance sheet.

STAFF APPRAISAL
The authorities are encouraged to continue pursuing sound policies and consolidating recent
macroeconomic gains despite a challenging external environment. This is particularly important given
a more uncertain outlook for oil production, which will also necessitate a gradual fiscal adjustment
over the medium term and continued heavy reliance on grant and highly concessional financing to
mitigate São Tomé and Príncipe’s high risk of debt distress. In addition, the authorities should work
with commercial banks to reduce the size of the banking system and increase the system’s efficiency,

10

Annex.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

profitability, and resilience. Fostering private sector led economic growth and diversification will
require further improvements to the business climate.
45.

Fiscal discipline needs to be maintained in the run-up to the 2014 local and

parliamentary elections, and gradual fiscal consolidation undertaken to help mitigate São
Tomé and Príncipe’s high risk of debt distress. Given the poor track record during electoral
cycles, the authorities should ensure that spending pressures are resisted, the 2013 budget is
executed as planned, and the forthcoming 2014 budget is realistic and in line with the ECF
supported program objectives. A gradual fiscal adjustment of 1.0 percent of GDP will be needed
over the medium term. Staff are of the view that this adjustment should be more heavily weighted
toward revenue enhancement and comprised of a mix of customs and tax administrative reforms
and, if needed, tax policy measures, to safeguard priority infrastructure and pro-poor spending.
46.

A comprehensive and credible solution to the long-standing cross-arrears problem is

needed to improve fiscal transparency and achieve lasting fiscal sustainability. This problem
has proven persistent and intractable, but needs to be addressed. With assistance from the IFC and
the World Bank, the authorities should be encouraged to draw up an actionable and viable plan for
improving EMAE’s cash flow, which would then form the basis for devising a strategy to pay down
over time their arrears to ENCO and prevent a recurrence of this problem in the future.
47.

Revenue mobilization efforts designed to increase tax compliance and broaden the tax

base should be diligently executed. In this regard, staff strongly support the decision to launch the
Taxpayer Inclusion Project, designed to register an additional 3,000 tax payers, as well as the
effective implementation of dedicated Large and Medium Taxpayers’ Units. Staff also support
ongoing reforms to establish the one-stop shop within the customs administration that will help to
enhance revenue collections by permitting the single and simultaneous payment of customs duties
and other fees and taxes due to all institutions involved in the clearance of goods. In addition,
completion of the second phase of ASYCUDA WORLD will enable the computerization of customs
clearance and greatly reduce the risks of under-invoicing.
48.

Staff support the authorities’ view that the fixed exchange rate regime has served São

Tomé and Príncipe well in the context of fiscal rectitude and an adequate level of
international reserves. However, further efforts are needed to make the economy more efficient
and boost competitiveness and exports, including through improvements to the country’s physical
infrastructure and the implementation of regulatory and legislative reforms. In this regard, staff
agree that the completion of the one-stop-shop within the in customs administration will further
enhance external competitiveness by reducing business costs. However, other complementary

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

reforms are needed, including: the elimination of regulatory and other price distortions, including by
moving toward cost recovery electricity tariffs within the context of structural reforms to EMAE to
strengthen its operational capacity; factor price flexibility; trade facilitation; strengthening property
and investor rights; improving access to credit; simplification of tax payments; and improved access
to construction licenses.
49.

The recent improvements in the central bank’s supervisory capabilities are welcome,

but further work is needed to strengthen financial stability. The central bank has increased its
vigilance over the financial sector through off- and on-site inspections of commercial banks. It
should also reinforce compliance with regulatory and prudential requirements, including by
ensuring that all commercial banks in operation in São Tomé and Príncipe maintain a minimum
capital-to-risk-weighted-asset ratio of 12 percent. The central bank should work with commercial
banks to reduce the size of the banking system and increase the system’s efficiency, profitability,
and resilience. In this regard, staff underscore the importance of adopting a crisis management and
bank resolution framework and developing restructuring solutions for banks that are unlikely to
restore profitability over the medium term. In addition, the central bank should continue to promote
financial literacy and transparency, which will enhance financial inclusion and boost confidence in
the financial system.
50.

Staff commend the authorities for the expeditious and unanimous approval of a

modern AML/CFT Law. The approval of this law has facilitated the removal of São Tomé and
Príncipe from the Financial Action Task Force’s list of high risk and non-cooperative jurisdictions,
and it sends an important positive signal to the investment and donor communities. Apart from the
passage of the legislation, the authorities are encouraged to take concrete steps to improve the
general effectiveness of the AML/CFT framework, including measures to strengthen the operations
of the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), with emphasis on additional staffing and equipment and
better training.
51.

In light of the good performance so far and the authorities’ commitment to strong

policies, staff support the authorities’ request for the completion of the second review under
the ECF arrangement and the third disbursement in the amount of SDR 370,000.
52.

It is proposed that the next Article IV Consultation with Sao Tome and Principe takes

place within 24 months, in accordance with the Decision on Article IV Consultation Cycles
(Decision No. 14747-(10/96), as amended).

Box 1. PRSP-II
As conveyed to their respective Executive Boards in the Joint Staff Advisory note (EBD/13/16 of
March 26, 2013), the staffs of the IMF and the World Bank “overall regard the PRSP-II as an
adequate foundation for achieving the government’s medium-term growth and poverty-reduction
objectives.” Nine months since this assessment was made, staff would reiterate this while calling
attention to the following developments:


The enhanced focus under PRSP-II has allowed the authorities to concentrate on fewer
objectives and use better poverty indicators. The authorities have sought to build on the
accomplishments under PRSP-I, by making the participatory process more inclusive, using a
more precise measure of poverty (daily caloric intake), and reducing the strategic povertyreduction axes to four. As confirmed by the authorities, this has allowed them better
monitoring and response capacity, which were areas for action flagged by staffs in the JSAN.



The use in the PRSP-II’s macroeconomic framework of two scenarios (oil and non-oil)
has proven to be farsighted given recent developments implying that oil production will not
start in 2015 as hoped for under the baseline oil scenario. Although the more ambitious
medium-term poverty reduction objectives under the PRSP-II will be adversely affected, the
PRSP-II strategy will remain valid under the alternative (non-oil) scenario that assumes no such
revenues during the PRSP-II implementation period.



Costing of poverty reduction programs remains an issue, and it has been aggravated by
increasing unpredictability of external support and export revenues. Staffs flagged in the
JSAN that while PRSP priorities were appropriately identified, their costing and funding were
not. This remains a concern in view of the delays in disbursement in donor assistance
during 2013 and the more uncertain outlook for oil.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

Box 2. Oil Production Prospects
The French oil company Total’s announcement that it would no longer seek to explore for
oil in Block 1 of the Joint Development Zone (JDZ) with Nigeria was a startling
development. TOTAL had been the last major oil company prospecting in the JDZ following the
departure of other major players (Exxon, Chevron and Sinopec) in 2007-12, who, like TOTAL, had
been disappointed with the results of their exploration drillings that indicated hydrocarbon
reserves were too small and costly to extract to warrant further investment.
São Tomé and Príncipe once again has its prospects for oil wealth delayed into the future.
Oil exploration in São Tomé and Príncipe started in 1997 and optimistic assessments at the time
indicated production could start as early as 2002. Oil companies paid sizable “signing bonuses” to
start exploration. Agreement with Nigeria on the creation of the JDZ was reached in 2001, and a
modern oil revenue management law was enacted in 2004. However, since then, the exploratory
oil drillings yielded unsatisfactory results. TOTAL’s withdrawal has diminished oil prospects for the
foreseeable future.
Prospects for oil exploration in São Tomé and Príncipe are now likely left to medium-size
companies with reduced deep-sea offshore drilling capabilities. However, the Joint
Development Authority (JDA), which was created to manage oil exploration in the JDZ, has
expressed confidence that the exploration block abandoned by TOTAL and other major oil
companies will be picked up by medium-size companies which, according to the JDA, could be
profitable at smaller extraction volumes.

30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level
of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities.

Appendix I. Letter of Intent
São Tomé, November 25, 2013
Ms. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
Dear Ms. Lagarde:
On July 20, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a new
three-year arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) in favor of the Democratic
Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe. This arrangement supports the Government’s medium-term
efforts to strengthen macroeconomic stability, foster sustainable and inclusive growth, and
reduce poverty in the context of the National Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper II. The first
review under the ECF supported arrangement was completed by the IMF Executive Board on
June 13, 2013. Recently, the Government concluded discussions on the second review with an
IMF staff mission, with focus on program implementation through end-June 2013, as well as on
the fiscal and financial measures to be implemented during the remainder of 2013 and in 2014.
Despite a challenging international environment, overall program implementation through endJune 2013 was good. All performance criteria were observed, and structural reforms progressed,
albeit at an uneven pace. Negotiations between the Government, the Water and Electricity
Company, EMAE, and the National Fuel Company, ENCO, on a lasting plan to clear EMAE’s
arrears to ENCO and to avoid a recurrence of this problem in the future continue to be difficult
and are expected to be completed by end-March 2014. A critical element of this strategy is to
improve EMAE’s cash flow. The Government has recently asked the World Bank and the IFC to
provide options to address this issue, which may include contracting out the management of
EMAE to a reputable international operator.
The Government is fully committed to continue building on recent achievements, which include a
reduction of the annual inflation to 6.4 percent in August 2013 (its lowest level in two decades).
Fiscal policy will be set to support macroeconomic stability and efforts to lower inflation further,
by ensuring that the domestic primary deficit is in line with available non-debt-creating
financing. Given the critical role of liquidity management and banking supervision in financial
stability, the Government intends to ensure that the Central Bank remain independent to conduct
its highly technical work.
São Tomé and Príncipe’s economic outlook will depend on strengthening the economy’s
resilience in the wake of diminished near-term oil prospects. The French oil company Total’s
unexpected withdrawal last September from Block 1 of the Joint Development Zone (JDZ) with
Nigeria is akin to a significant external shock. Until then, this was the most promising oil
production field, with the expectation that production could start in 2015. While several mediumINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

43

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

size oil companies are interested in taking over from Total the exploration of Block 1 of the JDZ,
there is increased uncertainty surrounding both the timing and volume of oil production. In the
absence of oil, fiscal and external debt sustainability indicators will improve more slowly than
expected. The Government will have to continue relying on grants or highly concessional
financing for many years to come, and more difficult budget financing prospects will necessitate
a tighter fiscal policy stance. Commercial banks will also have to adapt to the new reality, and the
ones that have entered the market lured mainly by the prospects of oil will have to change their
market strategy and strengthen their balance sheet, or leave the market. In addition, the
Government will have to promote even more forcefully the development of non-oil priority
sectors, such as tourism and agriculture, including by further improving the business climate and
upgrading the country’s infrastructure.
The Government believes that the policies set forth in the attached Memorandum of Economic
and Financial Policies (MEFP) are adequate to achieve the program’s objectives, but it will take
additional measures, if needed, to safeguard those objectives. São Tomé and Príncipe will consult
with the IMF on the adoption of these measures, and in advance of any revisions to the policies
contained in the MEFP, in accordance with the Fund’s policies on such consultation. The
Government will furnish the IMF with the necessary data for monitoring purposes on a timely
basis. That information as well as arrangements for monitoring program implementation and the
definitions of indicative targets and performance criteria are detailed in the Technical
Memorandum of Understanding (TMU), which is also attached to this letter. During the program
period, the Government will not introduce or intensify any exchange rate restrictions or multiple
currency practice that are inconsistent with Article VIII of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, or
introduce or intensify import restrictions for balance of payments purposes.
In light of the appreciable progress in implementing the program supported by the ECF
arrangement, the Government is requesting the completion of the second review as well as the
third disbursement of SDR 0.37 million under this arrangement.
The Government wishes to make this letter available to the public, along with the attached MEFP
and TMU, as well as the IMF staff report on the first review. We therefore authorize their
publication and posting on the IMF website, subject to Executive Board approval.

Yours truly,

/s/

Attachment 1. Memorandum of Economic and
Financial Policies for 2013 and 2014
I.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

1.
Real GDP growth decelerated to 4 percent in 2012 and is projected to remain at
4 percent in 2013. Many of São Tomé and Príncipe’s key development and investment partners
were hard hit by the global economic slowdown. As a result, São Tomé and Príncipe experienced
a scaling back of project financing and foreign direct investment. No acceleration in growth is
projected for 2013 in light of lingering uncertainties stemming from the challenging external
environment and related weak external financing prospects for investment projects (both official
and private).
2.
Annual inflation recently reached record lows. The adoption of the peg to the euro in
early 2010 combined with a prudent fiscal policy stance has helped reduce inflation, despite São
Tomé and Príncipe’s vulnerability to supply shocks. Although annual inflation reached
10.4 percent at end-2012, following unseasonably heavy rains, which disrupted the supply of
perishables, inflationary pressures receded by early 2013 and annual inflation reached
6.4 percent in August 2013 (its lowest level in two decades).
3.
Fiscal performance through end-June 2013 was favorable but cross-arrears flared
up again. Tax collections in the first half of 2013 were lower than projected given the weakening
economy and accumulation of fuel tax arrears by ENCO (in lieu of missed payments by EMAE),
and the wage bill was higher due to the adoption of new career ladders in the national security
sector and overtime payments for teachers that were not foreseen in the budget. These
developments, however, were more than offset by higher nontax revenue (frontloading of fishing
royalties and transfers from parastatals, and license fees related to the sale of the Government’s
stake in STP Cabo to an Angolan telecommunications operator), and by lower transfer payments
and domestically-financed capital expenditure, as well as lower goods and services outlays.
4.
Improving the banking system’s financial soundness remains elusive but its level of
dollarization has been gradually declining. The number of commercial banks in São Tomé and
Príncipe seems high in comparison to other small island states. Soundness indicators reveal low
overall profitability, a high and rising share of nonperforming loans, and a rapidly declining trend
in banks’ capital-to-risk-weighted-asset ratios. In addition, two commercial banks—one of them
already under Central Bank intervention—need to be recapitalized, sold, or closed. On the
positive side, dollarization in São Tomé and Príncipe’s commercial banking system continues to
decline, reflecting measures taken by the Central Bank to foster the use of the local currency, and
increased confidence in the local currency as inflation converges to international levels.
5.
The external current account deficit continues to decline and international reserves
to rise. Lower external financing has led to reduced demand for imports of goods and services

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

45

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

and an improved external current account balance. International reserves at the Central Bank
have been boosted by privatization receipts from the sale of the Government’s stake in STP
Cabo, and by grants from the World Bank and Timor-Leste. Central Bank’s international reserves
stand comfortably above the program’s floor of 3 months of imports and significantly exceeded
other traditional norms for reserve adequacy.

II.

RECENT PERFORMANCE UNDER THE ECF-SUPPORTED PROGRAM

6.
Program performance through end-June 2013 was satisfactory (Table 1). All
continuous and quantitative performance criteria (PCs) were met. However, the indicative target
(IT) on Dobra base money was narrowly missed reflecting higher international reserve
accumulation, and the IT on the non-accumulation of domestic arrears was missed stemming
from the resurgence of the cross-arrears problem.
7.

Structural reforms have progressed, albeit at an uneven pace (Table 2):



The on-site inspection of the country’s largest commercial bank was completed by endJune 2013 despite significant staffing constraints at the Central Bank pertaining to the
administrative takeover of Island Bank.



For the first time in over two decades, government accounts were prepared and
submitted for review: the 2010 accounts were finalized and presented to the Court of
Audit in June 2013. The Government is now working on the 2011 and 2012 accounts, but
preparing the latter using the accounting feature of SAFE-e will take longer than initially
envisaged given delays in the provision of technical assistance and training in this area.



The formulation of a plan to clear cross-arrears between ENCO, EMAE, and the Treasury
and to avoid their reoccurrence is still pending. A critical element of this strategy is to
improve EMAE’s cash flow. The Government has recently asked the World Bank and the
IFC to provide options to address this issue, which may include contracting out the
management of EMAE to a reputable international operator.

III.

ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS

8.
São Tomé and Príncipe’s economic outlook will depend on strengthening the
economy’s resilience in the wake of diminished near-term oil prospects. The French oil
company Total’s unexpected withdrawal last September from Block 1 of the Joint Development
Zone (JDZ) with Nigeria, due to concerns about high deep-sea exploration costs and the size of
oil reserves, is akin to a significant external shock. Until then, this was the most promising oil
production field, with the expectation that production could start in 2015. In the absence of oil,
fiscal and external debt sustainability indicators will improve more slowly. The Government will
have to continue relying on grants and highly concessional financing for many years to come,
and more difficult budget financing prospects will necessitate a tighter fiscal policy stance.
Commercial banks will also have to adapt to the new reality, and the ones that have entered the
market lured mainly by the prospects of oil will have to change their market strategy and
strengthen their balance sheets, including by further recapitalization. There is also a need to

46

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

restructure and strengthen the banking system through mergers and/or closure of distressed
and weak banks. Finally, the Government will have to promote even more forcefully the
development of non-oil priority sectors, such as tourism, agriculture, and fisheries, including by
further improving the business climate and upgrading the country’s infrastructure with private
sector support.
9.
While the Government remains confident about the prospects for oil production in
São Tomé and Príncipe, it has decided to cautiously adopt a non-oil baseline scenario.
Several medium-size oil companies are interested in taking over from Total the exploration of
Block 1 of the JDZ, and the Government has recently signed a new production sharing contract
for exploration rights in the Exclusive Exploration Zone (EEZ). However, there is increased
uncertainty surrounding both the timing and volume of oil production, suggesting the
importance of strengthening the economy’s resilience. In this connection, the Government will
implement during 2015-17 a cumulative adjustment in the domestic primary balance of
1 percent of GDP; and the Central Bank will require all commercial banks that operate in São
Tomé and Príncipe to have a capital-to-risk-weighted-asset ratio of at least 12 percent by endMarch 2014 (structural benchmark). A revised oil scenario will serve as the program’s alternative
scenario for debt sustainability analysis purposes.
10.
The outlook for 2014 continues to be affected by difficult global conditions. Real
GDP growth has been revised downward, from 5½ to 5 percent, reflecting lingering uncertainties
in the world economy, weak external financing prospects for investment projects, and the
changed oil outlook. Inflation is projected to reach 6 percent by end-2014, as inflation
expectations continue to be anchored by a prudent fiscal policy stance and the peg of the dobra
to the euro. The external current account deficit is expected to narrow further, with weaker than
previously projected economic activity leading to lower import growth; and the Central Bank’s
international reserves are expected to remain comfortably above 3½ months of imports (the
program’s new floor).
11.
Risks to the outlook are manageable. Downside risks include significant spending
overruns in the run-up to next year’s local and parliamentary elections, which in past election
cycles derailed fiscal rectitude. The Government, however, is fully committed to resisting
spending pressures. The outlook could also be adversely affected by the materialization of supply
shocks (leading to higher inflation and lower growth), spillovers from a further deterioration in
financial conditions in Europe (resulting in delays in project execution due to financing shortfalls),
and protracted right-sizing of São Tomé and Príncipe’s banking sector (leading to continued low
profitability in the sector and stagnant credit). Upside risks include the possibility of stronger
growth in Europe, lower-than-projected inflation for 2013, and oil production.

IV.

MACROECONOMIC POLICIES

A. Strengthening Public Finances
The fiscal program for 2013 and 2014
12.
The Government is on track to achieving the 2013 domestic primary deficit target
of 3.1 percent of GDP. This target is expected to be met despite higher personnel outlays—an
increase of about Db37 billion, or the equivalent to ⅔ percent of GDP, over the budgeted
amount—due to higher costs of introduction of new career ladders in the health, education, and
national security sectors, and an additional increase of 10 percent in teachers’ wages (effective
August 2013). Revenue collections will be higher-than-programmed because of higher nontax
revenue stemming from license fees associated with the sale of the Government’s stake in STP
Cabo, while the tax-to-GDP ratio will be unchanged (from 2012 levels) as ongoing efforts to
strengthen the tax and customs administrations, broaden the tax base, and collect fuel tax
arrears are expected to offset the adverse effect on tax collections of weaker economic growth.
Finally, non-interest recurrent spending is projected to remain in line with earlier projections,
despite higher personnel costs, due to non-wage recurrent and domestically-financed capital
expenditure reprioritization and restraint.
13.
The fiscal program for 2013 is fully funded. Additional external inflows more than
offset a delay in scholarship grants from Nigeria, which are now expected for 2014. Unanticipated
inflows in 2013 included: increased budget support from the World Bank (an additional
US$1.3 million); budget support from Timor-Leste (US$7 million); and proceeds from the sale of
the Government’s stake in STP Cabo (US$6.4 million). These inflows have funded a pickup in
project execution relative to the first half of year, and will be used to clear Treasury’s arrears to
EMAE by end-2013 (structural benchmark).
14.
The 2014 budget will maintain fiscal rectitude during an election year. It will target a
domestic primary deficit of 3.0 percent of GDP, which is fully consistent with available non-debt
creating financing from the World Bank, Nigeria, and transfers from the National Oil Account
(NOA). Gains from the widening of the tax base and improved taxpayer segmentation (designed
to enhance compliance among large taxpayers) are projected to result in an increase in the tax
effort. On the spending side, the Government is fully committed to containing the growth of the
public sector wage bill in line with projected average inflation. The elimination (in 2013) and nonaccumulation (in 2014 and beyond) of Treasury’s arrears to EMAE is expected to serve as a
catalyst for the reduction of EMAE’s arrears to ENCO and facilitate the elimination of ENCO’s fuel
tax arrears.
The medium-term fiscal framework
15.
Looking ahead, fiscal consolidation will be implemented gradually to limit its
contractionary impact. A cumulative adjustment in the domestic primary deficit of 1.0 percent

48

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

of GDP will be phased in over three years, starting in the year after local and parliamentary
elections. This will enable the Government to weather the initial negative impact of Total’s
decision and undertake the fiscal adjustment once a recovery is firmly underway. Given the
relatively low level of recurrent and domestically-financed capital expenditure, there is limited
scope for further expenditure containment. Thus, notwithstanding ongoing efforts at
strengthening expenditure prioritization, the needed fiscal adjustment will be more heavily
weighted toward revenue enhancement, comprising a mix of customs and tax administrative
reforms and, as needed, tax policy measures.
Structural reforms to strengthen public finances
16.

Specific achievements in 2013 in the fiscal area included:



Creation of a macro-fiscal unit, with representatives from the Ministry of Planning and
Finance, Central Bank, and National Institute of Statistics (INE), which has begun the
preliminary work toward implementing a medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF).



Ongoing steps to make the Government’s financial administration system (SAFE-e) fully
operational, including the activation of the system’s accounting module.

17.

Reforms that are ongoing and slated for 2014 include:



Adopting a comprehensive solution to the problem of cross-arrears. The plan to
eliminate cross-arrears between the Treasury, EMAE and ENCO and to avoid their
recurrence is now expected to be finalized by end-March 2014 (structural benchmark)
and the elimination of Treasury’s arrears to EMAE by end-December 2013 (structural
benchmark). In addition, quarterly ITs have been introduced to monitor during 2014 the
non-accumulation of Treasury’s arrears to EMAE.



Expanding the tax base by launching the “Operation Taxpayer Inclusion” project and
adopting and executing quarterly metrics for the number of newly registered taxpayers.
The project is designed to register on a cumulative basis 500 and 800 new taxpayers,
respectively, by end-June 2014 and end-December 2014 (structural benchmarks), and
ultimately targets registration of an additional 3,000 taxpayers by the project’s end.



Enhancing taxpayer management within the Tax Directorate by increasing security of the
Taxpayer Registry, and by creating a dedicated large taxpayer unit and a single taxpayer
computerized file system (structural benchmark, December 2013).



Progressing toward completion of the second phase of ASYCUDA World through
activation of all the functionalities and the establishment of a fully computerized
procedure (structural benchmark, December 2013).



Preparing the general government accounts for 2012 and presenting them to the
National Assembly and Court of Audit by end-December 2013 (structural benchmark).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

49

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE



Combating tax fraud and evasion by improving the selection of taxpayers for audit
through risk analysis, expanding tax coverage throughout the country, and strengthening
the National Tax Court, by allowing it to perform its duties with own resources.



Increasing taxpayer voluntary compliance by improving the quality of services provided
to taxpayers, simplifying and harmonizing tax procedures, extending tax services to the
more remote areas of the country, and conducting visits to newly created firms.



Providing the tax and customs administrations with the necessary resources, including
additional staff and equipment, to implement the reforms mentioned above.

B. Enhancing Liquidity Management, Financial Stability, and Safeguards
18.
The Central Bank continues to develop its monetary liquidity management
framework and bank supervision capabilities. It has now successfully extended the liquidity
forecasting horizon to one month and is adopting a systematic approach to analyze forecasting
errors as a precursor to the future introduction of money market instruments. In a bid to address
capacity constraints, the Central Bank has recently recruited three additional staff to the Banking
Supervision Department, but staffing levels remain below optimum. A program of on-site
inspections is currently in progress, and all commercial banks are now expected to be inspected
by end-June 2014 following the inspection of the two remaining banks that have not yet been
subject to on-site inspection (structural benchmark). In addition, the Central Bank, however, will
conduct by end-2013 a second on-site inspection of one bank that was previously inspected.
19.

Other specific achievements in 2013 included:



Completing the on-site inspection of the largest commercial bank in the first half of the
year.



Supporting the exchange rate peg by maintaining net international reserves at the
Central Bank above the equivalent of three months of imports, and investing central bank
international reserves in high quality and liquid financial assets.



Expanding the role of the Internal Audit Department to track more systematically the
implementation of external auditors’ recommendations and monitor the main risks to the
central bank’s balance sheet.



Taking over the operations of Island Bank, following the bank’s failure to comply with
supervisory requirements and to submit a remedial action plan.

20.
Reforms that are ongoing and planned for 2014 to strengthen the economy’s
resilience to shocks, bolster the Central Bank’s independence and supervisory practices,
and promote financial literacy and transparency include:

50

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE



Increasing the program’s floor on net international reserves from 3 to 3½ months of
imports to boost confidence in the wake of reduced oil prospects.



Reinforcing compliance with solvency and other regulatory standards by requiring that all
commercial banks that are open to the public have a capital-to-risk-weighted-asset ratio
of at least 12 percent by end-March 2014 (structural benchmark), and strictly enforcing
other banking regulations, such as reserve requirements and dissemination of data to the
credit registry, with application of penalties to non-compliant institutions.



Conducting on-site inspections of the two remaining commercial banks not yet subject
to on-site inspection by end-June 2014 (structural benchmark), and increasing the
frequency of on-site inspections thereafter, as well as improved analysis of the
commercial banks’ quarterly reports, made possible in part through the hiring of
additional bank supervisors.



Enhancing commercial bank transparency by ensuring that all commercial banks publish
their financial results for 2012 by end-March 2014. Commercial banks should aim to
publish their 2013 accounts by end-September 2014, or face penalties for noncompliance (structural benchmark).



Further strengthening liquidity management by developing a systematic approach
toward analyzing forecasting errors and examining the evolution of daily aggregate
liquidity conditions, with a view to introducing in due course money market instruments
and creating the foundations of an interbank market.



Developing and beginning to implement a work program to introduce a new chart-ofaccounts and reporting at the Central Bank in line with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS), with technical assistance from the Central Bank of Brazil.



Drafting by end-September 2014 a revised draft of the Central Bank Law that strengthens
the autonomy of the Central Bank in line with international standards, including in the
resolution of problem banks (structural benchmark).



Improving external communications policies to enhance financial literacy and boost
confidence in the financial system, including regular publication of reports and economic
bulletins, strengthening the capacity of the Office of Consumer Affairs, and promoting
financial literacy.



Encouraging the use of modern technology, including credit and debit cards, point-ofsale terminals, ATMs, and secure mobile-banking, with the objective of expanding the

BUSINESS CLIMATE

21.
Fostering private sector led economic growth and diversification will require an
improved business climate. São Tomé and Príncipe has recently made progress in improving its
business environment, but more needs to be done to diversify production and put the economy
on a sustainable growth path. In this regard, the Government plans to undertake additional
reforms to strengthen and simplify the country’s legal infrastructure, including in the areas of
contract enforcement, property registration, and protection to investors. The Government
remains committed to the pursuit of fiscal prudence and financial and monetary stability and the
maintenance of wage and price flexibility, with a view to keeping the real effective exchange rate
broadly consistent with its underlying fundamentals in the context of the fixed exchange rate
regime.
22.
Progress is being made toward the establishment of a one-stop-shop to facilitate
and promote foreign trade. Preparatory arrangements are now underway for the launching of
the new one-stop-shop by early-2015. Once in place, this facility will reduce transaction costs
and thereby enhance São Tomé and Príncipe’s external competitiveness. It will also enhance
efficiency, transparency, and potentially revenue collections by permitting the single and
simultaneous payment of customs duties and other fees and taxes due to all institutions involved
in the clearance of imports. Key milestones include: establishing by end-June 2014 the
connectivity of the Customs and Tax Directorate (structural benchmark); and the elimination of
hard-copy documents and introduction of electronic signing and approval of documents by endDecember 2014 (structural benchmark). This facility will complement the one-stop-shop for
investors established in 2011, which has centralized and simplified the administrative
requirements for establishing a business in São Tomé and Príncipe.

F.

ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING AND COMBATING THE FINANCING OF
TERRORISM (AML/CFT)

23.
The Government remains fully committed to addressing the deficiencies of São
Tomé and Príncipe’s AML/CFT framework. With technical assistance from the IMF’s Legal
Department, it drafted amendments to the AML/CFT law and submitted the revised draft law to
the National Assembly in May 2013. The draft law was approved unanimously by the National
Assembly; and President Pinto da Costa has signed it. Passage of this law facilitated the recent
removal of São Tomé and Príncipe from the Financial Action Task Force’s list of high risk and
non-cooperative jurisdictions. Complementary efforts to strengthen the operations of the
financial intelligence unit (FIU) through improved resources, including staffing, equipment and
training are expected to strengthen the FIU core functions—including receipt, analysis, and
submission to the General Attorney’s Office of suspicious transaction report.

G.

STATISTICS

24.
The Government continues to strengthen the statistical system. In addition to the
several improvements listed above, INE is taking steps to improve the outdated consumer price
index (CPI). The household survey completed in 2011 is providing the basis for reweighting the
CPI components and introducing new goods and services to its basket (both were updated last
about twenty years ago). The introduction of the new CPI (structural benchmark, endDecember 2013) is expected to greatly improve the measurement of inflation.

H.

PROGRAM MONITORING

25.
The PCs, ITs, and structural benchmarks for the second half of 2013 and for 2014 are
presented in Tables 1-4. The definitions of quantitative PCs and ITs are provided in the attached
Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU). The third review is expected to be completed
by April 2014, the fourth review by October 2014, and the fifth review by April 2015.

Attachment 2. Technical Memorandum of Understanding
November 2013
1.
This Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) contains definitions and adjuster mechanisms
that clarify the measurement of quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets in Tables 1 and 3,
which are attached to the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies for 2013 and 2014. Unless
otherwise specified, all quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets will be evaluated in terms of
cumulative flows from the beginning of each calendar year.
I. PROVISION OF DATA TO THE FUND

2.
Data with respect to all variables subject to performance criteria and indicative targets will be
provided to Fund staff monthly with a lag of no more than four weeks for data on net international reserves
of the Central Bank of São Tomé and Príncipe (BCSTP) and six weeks for other data. The authorities will
transmit promptly to Fund staff any data revisions. For variables that are relevant for assessing performance
against program objectives but are not specifically defined in this memorandum, the authorities will consult
with Fund staff as needed on the appropriate way of measuring and reporting. Performance criteria included
in the program, as defined below, refer to the domestic primary balance and net bank financing of the
central government, net international reserves of the central bank, external payments arrears, and nonconcessional short-term and medium- and long-term external debt owed or guaranteed by the central
government and/or the central bank.
II. DEFINITIONS
3.
Government is defined for the purposes of this TMU to comprise the central government, which
includes all governmental departments, offices, establishments, and other bodies that are agencies or
instruments of the central authority of São Tomé and Príncipe. The central government does not include the
operations of state-owned enterprises.
4.
Government domestic revenue (excluding oil revenue) comprises all tax and non-tax revenue of
the government (in domestic and foreign currencies), excluding: (1) foreign grants, (2) the receipts from the
local sale of in-kind grants (e.g., crude oil received from Nigeria, food aid, etc.), and (3) any gross inflows to
the government on account of oil signature bonus receipts and accrued interest on the National Oil Account
(NOA). Revenue will be measured on a cash basis as reported in the table of government financial operations
prepared by the Directorate of Budget and the Directorate of Treasury in the Ministry of Planning and
Finance.
5.
Domestic primary expenditure comprises all government spending assessed on a commitment
basis (base compromisso), excluding (1) capital expenditure financed with external concessional loans and
grants and (2) scheduled interest payments. Reporting of government domestic expenditure will be based

60

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

on the state budget execution prepared every month by the Directorate of Budget and the Directorate of
Treasury in the Ministry of Planning and Finance.
6.
Within domestic primary expenditure, pro-poor expenditure refers to government outlays recorded
in the budget that have a direct effect on reducing poverty, as agreed with the IMF and World Bank staffs.

Domestic primary balance is defined as the difference between government domestic revenue and
domestic primary expenditure. For reference, this balance for end-December 2012 was 163 billion dobra,
broken down as follows:
Government domestic revenue:
Less:
Government primary expenditure:
(As defined in paragraph 5)
Equals: Domestic primary balance:

9.
Domestic arrears are defined as the difference between expenditure on a commitment basis and
cash payments (amounts past due after 40 days and unpaid).
10.
Arrears to EMAE are defined as the obligations owed by the government to EMAE but not paid
within 40 days.
The program exchange rate for the purposes of this TMU1 will be 18,585 dobra per U.S. dollar, 24,500
dobra per euro, and 28,563 dobra per SDR for both 2013 and 2014.
11.
Net bank financing of the central government (NCG) is defined as the stock of all outstanding
claims on the central government held by the BCSTP and by other depository corporations (ODCs), less all
deposits held by the central government with the BCSTP and with ODCs, as they are reported monthly by the
BCSTP to the IMF staff. The balance of the National Oil Account (NOA) is not included in NCG. All foreign
exchange-denominated accounts will be converted to dobra at the program exchange rate. For reference, at
end-December 2012, outstanding net bank financing of the central government (excluding NOA) was
44 billion dobra, broken down as follows:
BCSTP credit, including use of IMF resources:
233 billion
Less:

depository corporations and cash in vaults—and banks reserves denominated in dobra. Bank reserves refer
to reserves of commercial banks – in dobra – held with the central bank and include reserves in excess of the
reserve requirements. For reference, at end-December 2012 dobra base money was 616 billion dobra,
calculated as follows:

Net international reserves (NIR) of the BCSTP are defined for program-monitoring purposes as
short-term, tradable foreign assets of the BCSTP minus short-term external liabilities, including liabilities to
the IMF. All short-term foreign assets that are not fully convertible external assets nor readily available to
and controlled by the BCSTP (i.e., they are pledged or otherwise encumbered external assets, including but
not limited to the HIPC umbrella SDR account and assets used as collateral or guarantees for third-party
liabilities) will be excluded from the definition of NIR. Securities whose market value on the last day of the
year differs by over 20 percent from their original nominal issue price will be assessed at their market value
as reported by the BCSTP’s Markets Department. The balance of (1) NOA at the BCSTP, (2) banks’ deposits
related to capital or licensing requirements, and (3) banks’ reserves denominated in foreign currency are
excluded from the program definition of NIR. All values are to be converted to U.S. dollars at the actual midpoint market exchange rates prevailing at the test date. For reference, at end-December 2012 NIR was

debt with an original maturity of one year or less (including overdraft positions but excluding normal import
credits) owed or guaranteed by the government and/or the BCSTP.2 With respect to the precautionary line of
credit from Portugal to support the pegging of the dobra to the euro, unpaid balances outstanding during
the first three quarters of a given year will be excluded from the short-term external debt limit. However,
outstanding balances at the end of a given year will be included in the assessment of compliance with the
short-term external debt performance criterion. For reference, at end-December 2012 the stock of shortterm external debt was zero.
15.
The performance criterion on nonconcessional medium- and long-term external debt is a
continuous performance criterion that refers to the contracting or guaranteeing of new external debt with
original maturity of more than one year by the government and/or the BCSTP.3,4 Debt being rescheduled or
restructured is excluded from the ceilings set on nonconcessional borrowing. Medium- and long-term debt
will be reported by the Debt Management Department of the Ministry of Planning and Finance (as
appropriate) by the BCSTP, measured in U.S. dollars at the prevailing exchange rates. The government should
consult with IMF staff before contracting or guaranteeing new medium- or long-term debt obligations.
16.
The non-accumulation of external payment arrears is a continuous performance criterion.
Government external payment arrears are defined as all unpaid external public debt obligations, according
to the data established by the Debt Management Department of the Ministry of Planning and Finance and
(as appropriate) by the BCSTP, except for arrears pending rescheduling arrangements. The latter are
considered as technical arrears. Debt would be deemed to be in arrears when it has not been paid by the
time it is due, unless arrears have otherwise been contractually defined. This performance criterion does not
apply to those arrears pending the signing of bilateral agreements in the context of debt-rescheduling with
the Paris Club, if any, and other bilateral creditors.
17.
Net external debt service payments are defined as debt service due less the accumulation of any
new external payment arrears, including technical arrears.

2

The term “debt” is defined as in point 9 of the IMF Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to External Debt in Fund
Arrangements adopted by the Decision No. 6230-(79/140) of the Executive Board of the IMF, as amended effective December 1,
2009. Debt will be understood to mean a current, i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual agreement through
the provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make one or
more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services at some future point(s) in time; these payments will
discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the contract.

3

This performance criterion applies not only to debt as defined in point 9 of the IMF Guidelines on Performance Criteria with
Respect to External Debt in Fund Arrangements adopted by the Decision No. 6230-(79/140) of the Executive Board of the IMF, as
amended effective December 1, 2009, but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not been
received.

4

The level of concessionality of loans is assessed -using a discount rate of 5 percent. - For least developed countries, such as
São Tomé and Príncipe, a loan is deemed to be on concessional terms if, on the date of initial disbursement, the ratio of the
present value of the loan, calculated on the basis of the reference interest rate, to the nominal value of the loan is less than 50
percent (in other words, a grant element of at least 50 percent).. This performance criterion does not apply to IMF facilities.

18.
Official external program support is defined as grants and loans, including in-kind aid when the
products are sold by the government and the receipts are earmarked for a budgeted spending item, and
other exceptional financing provided by foreign official entities and incorporated into the budget. Amounts
assumed in the program consistent with the definition are shown in Tables 1 and 3 of the MEFP as a
memorandum item labeled “official external program support.”
III. USE OF ADJUSTERS
19.
The performance criterion on the domestic primary deficit will have one adjuster. The limit on
the domestic primary deficit will be adjusted upward if the government finds budget support and
privatization receipts in 2013 and 2014 in addition to that described in the MEFP; this adjuster will be capped
at 50 billion dobra (about 1 percent of 2012 GDP) for 2013 and 2014.5
20.
Adjusters for the performance criteria on net bank financing of the central government and
net international reserves will be set. Deviations from amounts projected in the program for budget
transfers from the NOA, official external program support, net external debt service payments, and domestic
arrears will trigger adjustments on the above mentioned performance criteria. These deviations will be
calculated cumulatively from end-December 2012 or end-December 2013, as appropriate (MEFP, Tables 1
and 3). The following is an explanation of these adjustments:


Adjustors on ceilings on changes in net bank financing of the central government (NCG):
Quarterly differences between actual and projected receipts of budget transfers from the NOA,
official external program support, net external debt service payments, and domestic arrears will be
converted to dobra at the program exchange rate and aggregated from end-December 2012 or endDecember 2013, as appropriate, to the test date. The ceilings will be adjusted downward (upward) by
cumulative deviations downward (upward) of actual from projected net external debt service
payments, and by deviations upward (downward) in budget transfers from the NOA, official external
program support, and domestic arrears. The combined application of all adjusters at any test date is
capped at the equivalent to US$3 million at the program exchange rate.



Adjustors for the floor on net international reserves (NIR) of the BCSTP: Quarterly differences
between actual and projected receipts of budget transfers from the NOA, official external program
support, net external debt service payments, and domestic arrears in dobra, will be converted to
U.S. dollars at the program exchange rate and aggregated from end-December 2012 or endDecember 2013, as appropriate, to the test date. The floor will be adjusted upward (downward) by
the cumulative deviation downward (upward) of actual from projected net external debt service
payments of the central government, and by deviations upward (downward) for budget transfers
from the NOA, official external program support, and domestic arrears. The combined application of

5

Grants and related expenditures to cover the cost of the elections will be excluded from the measurement of the domestic
primary deficit.

all adjusters at any test date is capped in such a way that the adjusted floor does not fall short of
US$18.97 million in 2013 and US$24.5 million in 2014.

Appendix II. External Balance Assessment1
São Tomé and Príncipe’s external position is vulnerable owing mainly to the country’s narrow export base.
The current account is projected to remain in deficit over the long-term, reflecting heavy import dependence
for food, fuel, and project-related investment goods needed to unlock growth. The country’s external current
account deficit is financed mainly though foreign aid and foreign direct investment (FDI). Achieving external
sustainability requires accelerated reforms to the business environment to boost growth, create jobs, and
expand the export base. The main downside risks to the current account (including transfers) are supply
shocks and spillovers from a further deterioration in financial conditions in Europe which would limit the
availability of grants and highly concessional loans.
There is no conclusive evidence of a real exchange rate misalignment. The Dobra appears to be somewhat
overvalued in the short-run and broadly in line with fundamentals over the medium-term. Although the real
effective exchange rate (REER) has appreciated somewhat since the adoption of the peg to the Euro in
early 2010, a staff analysis suggests that there is no strong evidence of real exchange rate misalignment that
could lead to external instability in the medium term. Quantitative analysis drawing on the CGER
methodologies suggests external current account balance norms of -9½ percent of GDP (external
sustainability approach) and -13¼ percent of GDP (macroeconomic balance approach) compared with a
medium-term projection of -10½ percent of GDP. This translates into an overvaluation of about 1 percent
and an undervaluation 2½ percent, respectively. The equilibrium real exchange rate approach—which
yielded large uncertainties surrounding estimates due to data limitations —shows that the Dobra is
significantly (about 37 percent) overvalued.
The current level of gross foreign exchange reserves – about 5.4 months of imports - appears to be
adequate to withstand external shocks. After briefly falling below three months of imports in mid-2012, the
authorities have since accumulated international reserves considerably, taking advantage of privatization
receipts and inflows from the World Bank, Nigeria, and Timor-Leste. In addition, São Tomé and Príncipe has
access to US$7.2 million in National Oil Account (NOA) deposits and €25 million from a contingent credit
2
line with Portugal.
São Tomé and Príncipe has made some progress in improving its business environment but much more
remains to be done. The World Bank’s 2012 Doing Business Survey ranked the country a top reformer in 2011
because the authorities established a one-stop window for investors and eliminated a wide range of
licensing and minimum capital requirements. However, the country’s ranking slipped a few positions by 2014
and still ranks near the bottom of the list. There is a need for additional structural reforms to boost

In support of the exchange rate peg, the authorities have an agreement with Portugal according to which Portugal stands
ready to provide support in the form of a credit line of up to €25 million, which would add another 3½ months of imports
cushion to international reserves.

productivity and improve the business environment. Such measures include steps to strengthen the
country’s legal infrastructure (e.g., enforcing contracts, property registry, and protecting investors).
External current account
The external current account deficit has narrowed over the past few years as weaker economic activity led to
lower import growth. The current account is expected to remain in deficit throughout the medium-term,
reflecting the country’s heavy reliance on imports, including food, fuels, and capital goods. The deficit is
financed primarily by official transfers and FDI, both of which have been reduced by financial conditions in
Europe. The optimal path for the current account in the next five years should be a gradual improvement
over time as the country broadens its export base, increases food security, and undertakes a fiscal
consolidation.

Exchange rate assessment
São Tomé and Príncipe’s REER has appreciated considerably since the introduction of the peg to the Euro in
January 2010. Since then, there has been a gradual disinflation process, broadly in line with international
experience.3 However, domestic inflation has remained above the inflation in the country’s trading partners.

3

A comparison of São Tomé and Principe’s disinflation with the experiences of countries that tried to reduce inflation by
pegging their currencies to the currencies of low inflation countries shows that the path followed by São Tomé and Príncipe
has so far been closer to successful rather than failed attempts.

While external stability is particularly difficult to benchmark for a fragile, small country like São Tomé and
Príncipe with severe data limitations, the application of the three standard methodologies for exchange rate
assessment suggests that the real exchange rate is overvalued in the short-run and broadly in line with
fundamentals over the medium-term.
The results of the assessments of São Tomé and Príncipe’s exchange rate, based on the IMF’s Consultative
Group on Exchange Rate (CGER) methodologies, are presented below. The assessments focus on the
country’s baseline scenario for 2013 and the medium-term, which uses 2018 as the reference period.
In the macroeconomic balance (MB) approach, an equilibrium current account balance (norm) is estimated
by relating the current account balance to macroeconomic fundamentals. Typical fundamentals include the
fiscal balance, output growth, real income, oil balance, demographics, trade openness, and relative
productivity. In the short-run, applying the coefficients estimated by the CGER methodology extension by
Vitek (2013) yields a current account norm for São Tomé and Príncipe of -14 percent of GDP.4 This compares
to the projected current account balance of -20¼ percent of GDP. This would imply a currency overvaluation
of 6 percent in 2013 assuming an elasticity of the external current account balance relative to the REER of
minus 1.05.5 For 2018, the current account balance is projected to improve to -10½ percent of GDP while the
projected current account norm declines to -13¼ percent of GDP. This implies a current account gap of
2¾ percent of GDP and an undervaluation of the currency of 2.6 percent over the medium-term.

Projected Current Account

The external sustainability (ES) approach calculates the current account balance that would be consistent
with a benchmark value for net foreign assets (NFA). The main challenge in implementing the ES approach is
choosing the correct NFA target. This is particularly challenging in the case of São Tomé and Príncipe where
there are no reliable international investment position data available, meaning the NFA position can only be
broadly estimated. The ES approach shows that the Dobra is somewhat overvalued in 2013 (by 10¼ percent)
but becomes less overvalued over time, declining to about a 1 percent overvaluation by 2018.

The equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) approach is a reduced form regression model, unlike the two
other approaches which use behavioral based regression models. It does not perform well when there are
data limitations and short historical time series, as in the case of São Tomé and Príncipe. The ERER
methodology is also highly sensitive to the choice of variables used in the model. The ERER approach, based

Capital and financial accounts
São Tomé and Príncipe’s capital and financial accounts have remained in surplus in recent years despite the
global financial crisis. The capital account is dominated by foreign aid (averaging about 20 percent of GDP
per year) related to the government’s investment program. The financial account has two main components:
FDI, and public sector borrowing.
Reflecting the small size of the economy and the lumpy nature of some investments, FDI has been volatile in
recent years, accounting for 43 percent of GDP in 2008 (mainly due to the construction of a hotel resort) with
a median of 8 percent of GDP from 2000-12. FDI is predominantly composed of equity and, therefore, the
risk for sudden reversals is relatively low. Public sector borrowing has remained stable at around 9 percent of
GDP per year.
The authorities currently lack the proper tools to sterilize large capital inflows, relying primarily on direct
foreign exchange purchases and required reserves. To better manage large capital flows, the central bank is
taking steps to develop a liquidity forecasting framework, which is needed for the introduction in due course
of money market instruments.
While the lack of International Investment Position (IIP) data hinders the analysis of the country’s NFA
position, the central bank and commercial banks have been building their NFA positions in recent years. The
balance in the National Oil Account is projected to decline over the next few years absent any new signature
bonuses from companies wishing to develop São Tomé and Príncipe’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).
Foreign exchange reserves
The current level of foreign exchange reserves seems to be adequate to withstand external shocks and is
broadly in line with peer countries. Reserves provide not only insurance against external shocks but also are
a key tool for managing domestic financial instability. After falling below three months of imports in mid2012,6 the authorities have since accumulated international reserves considerably, taking advantage of
privatization receipts and inflows from the World Bank, Nigeria, and Timor-Leste. São Tomé and Príncipe’s
GIR reached US$43.8 million (about 5 months of imports) at end-2012, and US$58.5 million (about 5.4
months of imports) at end-September 2013. In addition, the authorities have access to US$7.2 million in
NOA deposits and €25 million from a contingent credit line with Portugal.

6

The level of international reserves fell below three-months of imports in mid-2012 as local commercial banks with long
foreign exchange positions increased U.S. dollar purchases from the central bank. But in July 2012 the authorities clarified the
procedures for such purchases.

1/ Nominal GDP and import data have been converted from annual to monthly using cubic spline interpolation. As a result, this chart
is not comparable to the other charts in this note which are based on annual data.
2/ Gross international reserves exclude the balance of the National Oil Account and commercial banks’ foreign currency deposits at
the BCSTP in order to meet reserve requirements or to comply with new licensing or capital augmentation requirements.

Policymakers often rely on rules of thumb to assess the adequate level of reserves, including import
coverage, the reserves-to-M2 ratio and the IMF’s reserve adequacy metric. Commonly used thresholds for
these measures are three months for the import coverage, and 5–20 percent for the reserves-to-M2 ratio.7
São Tomé and Príncipe’s foreign exchange reserves, as measured by these rules, are above traditional
thresholds but slightly lower than the median level for peer countries. However, if NOA deposits and the
credit line from Portugal are included, São Tomé and Príncipe’s reserves are higher than in comparator
countries.

The reserves to short-term debt ratio is used for emerging market economies and could be important for São Tomé
and Príncipe as its financial sector develops further, but it is not reported here due to data limitations.

External imbalances and competitiveness
São Tomé and Príncipe’s external current account deficit over the past decade was explained by relatively
low rates of private and public savings and significant public and private investments financed by foreign aid
and FDI. Given that São Tomé and Príncipe continues to have significant investment needs, policies to
address this imbalance over time will have to focus on increasing savings and fostering competitiveness. The
country will need to develop a comprehensive approach to improve competitiveness. Correcting external
imbalances through a nominal depreciation is unlikely to deliver a more depreciated real effective exchange
rate in the medium term because of the high pass through to domestic prices. A large price increase of
imported goods from an exchange rate depreciation could spill over to the other sectors of the economy,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

raise the overall domestic production costs, and might lead to unchanged or even weakening international
price competiveness.8 São Tomé and Príncipe’s fixed exchange rate regime has served the country well by
ending the inflation-depreciation cycle. Therefore, productivity should be enhanced by investments that
improve human capital and reduce infrastructure bottlenecks and sporadic shortages of key goods.
Qualitative competitiveness indicators point to significant structural and institutional bottlenecks in São
Tomé and Principe. The country is classified as a weak performer under the World Bank’s Country Policy and
Institutional Assessment (CPIA) and remains near the bottom of the 2014 World Bank’s Doing Business
Survey.

São Tomé and Príncipe has made some progress in improving its business environment but much more
remains to be done. The World Bank’s 2012 Doing Business Survey ranked the country as one of the top
reformers in 2011 because the authorities established a one-stop window for investors and eliminated a
wide range of licensing and minimum capital requirements. However, there is a need for additional structural
reforms to boost productivity and improve the business climate. Such measures include steps to strengthen
the country’s legal infrastructure (e.g., enforcing contracts, property registry, protecting investors). To further
improve the business climate, the government could establish platform for public-private sector dialogue
aimed at identifying obstacles to private sector development and proposing action plans to overcome them.

Appendix III. Financial Sector Diagnostics1
A.

São Tomé and Príncipe’s Financial Sector

1.
The financial system of São Tomé and Príncipe continues to grow despite a narrow base. The
total assets of the sector as a percent of GDP have grown to about 40 percent in 2012 from 23 percent
in 2004. Commercial banks account for about 98 percent of the market, and insurance companies the
remaining 2 percent. The microfinance sector is nascent and a draft law for their regulation was submitted to
the Government in 2013. There is no capital market. Since the system is predominantly bank-based, the
focus of this assessment is on the banking sector.
2.
The banking system is predominantly foreign-owned but with a significant proportion of
public sector ownership in the largest bank. Banco Internacional de São Tomé and Príncipe (BISTP), the
largest bank, has about 52 percent of foreign ownership held by CGD, a Portuguese bank, and BAI, an
Angolan investment bank. The Government maintains a controlling share of about 48 percent. Banco
Equador is also predominantly foreign owned by Grupo Mombanka and Mosquito but retains a local share
of 5 percent. The other commercial banks, Afriland First Bank, Island Bank, Commercial Bank of São Tomé
and Príncipe, EcoBank, Energy Bank and BGFI Bank, have 100 percent foreign ownership.

Methodology for Assessing the Banking Sector

3.
The methodology used in this note for assessing the banking sector is known as quantitative
benchmarking. It involves observing a set of indicators across time and countries. To capture the time
dimension, trend analysis of key indicators is conducted since financial sector development is a time-bound
process. For the cross-country comparisons, the assessment earmarked a group of small island states2 with

similar characteristics as well as sub-Saharan Africa (excluding South Africa and Nigeria).3 The São Tomé and
Príncipe economy is assessed with respect to its depth, access, efficiency, and stability comparators relative
to peer groups. The assessment also considers the status of banking supervision with respect to the BASEL
core principles as well as the central bank’s strategic plan for 2012-15. Limitations in the availability of data,
however, have constrained the scope of the exercise.

Trend Analysis

4.
The trend analysis focused on the evolution of the aggregates from 2004 to 2012. The analysis
constituted a static assessment of the banking sector in isolation from the selected comparators.

5.
Conventional metrics for measuring financial depth indicate that the banking sector of São
Tomé and Príncipe has deepened in recent years. Financial depth refers to the extent to which the
different segments of the population are able to use a range of banking services for savings and investment
decisions. Traditionally, the ratios of broad money and private sector credit to GDP are used to measure
financial deepening. According to Table 1, the ratio of broad money to GDP has increased from 28 percent
in 2004 to about 37 percent in 2012. Similarly, the ratio of private sector credit to GDP has more than
doubled from 17 percent in 2004 to 36 percent in 2012.
6.
São Tomé and Príncipe’s banking system penetration, as measured by the progress in building
more inclusive opportunities for balanced access to financial services, show some remarkable
improvements. According to the Financial Access Survey for 2012, the proportion of the banked population,
as proxied by number bank accounts per 100,000 adults, has improved from 51 percent in 2008 to
87 percent in 2012. This growth was supported by a large branch network per 100,000 adults which
expanded from a low of 4 percent in 2004 to 23 percent in 2012.
7.
Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs) were introduced in October 2011, and this has facilitated
access to banking resources by the population. Since its inception, the number of machines has grown
to 19–22 in 2012, and correspondingly the level of daily transactions has increased significantly. These
developments point to a general improvement towards more financial inclusion.
8.
Indicators of competition and efficiency portray a mixed picture for the banking sector in São
Tomé and Príncipe. From the perspective of the number of providers, over the last 8 years the competition
environment has improved as banks doubled to 8 in 2008, from 4 in 2004. This increase, however, was not
matched by a shift in market shares. The largest bank still retains about 50 percent of the market and the 3
largest banks asset concentration is very high at about 69 percent. Ideally, a well-functioning financial system
must offer a wide range of financial services. However, the banking sector in São Tomé and Príncipe has no
variety of financial instruments. Moreover, efficiency indicators are very weak as both the return on asset and
return on equity ratios have hovered around or below zero percent.
9.
A defining feature of São Tomé and Príncipe’s banking sector has been dollarization. There has
been a tendency of holding a large share of assets and liabilities in foreign exchange. As inflation peaked
from 9 percent in 2001 to about 28 percent in 2007, concern about an erosion of incomes in the wake of a
potential excessive depreciation of the foreign currency led to a high degree of currency substitution. The
ratio of foreign currency denominated deposits to broad money rose from 35 percent in 2001 to about
57 percent in 2007. Commercial banks operated largely with foreign currency and correspondingly foreign
currency loans accounted for 70–75 percent of the credit portfolio. However, efforts to reduce dollarization
in the financial system in recent years, which included prudential regulations regarding reserve requirements,
led to a reduction in the share of foreign currency loans from 77 percent in 2010 to 58 percent in 2012.
10.
The liquidity situation has changed significantly since 2011 with banks holding higher
involuntary balances over statutory requirements. Between 2004 and 2008, the ratio of liquid assets to
total assets averaged about 18 percent. In March 2010, the central bank introduced a reserve requirement on
foreign exchange deposits from 100 percent in foreign exchange to 100 percent in local currency. This policy

80

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

shift led to a tightening of liquidity conditions and non-compliance with the reserve requirement. In
December 2011, the central bank reduced the reserve requirement on foreign exchange deposits to
90 percent of local currency and further reduced the statutory requirement from 21 percent to 18 percent.
Coupled with a slowdown in credit, this led to a sharp pickup in excess reserves from 11.9 percent of reserve
money in January 2011 to 27.5 percent in March 2013. Aligned with this development, the ratio of liquid to
total assets doubled from 18 percent in 2008 to 36 percent in 2012.
D

Benchmarking the Banking Sector of São Tomé and Príncipe

11.
The benchmarking exercise allows an assessment of São Tomé and Príncipe’s financial sector
performance with respect to depth, access, dollarization, efficiency, stability and supervision.
Normalizing most of the assets and liabilities on GDP facilitates benchmarking the selected indicators and
comparisons across countries. The difference between the observed value and the median of the benchmark
suggests scope for policy action or successful progress.
Benchmarking depth
12.
Traditional metrics of depth indicate that São Tomé and Príncipe outperforms sub-Saharan
Africa but underperforms small island states. The ratios of private sector credit and broad money to GDP
have been rising since 2004 and have been significantly above their sub-Saharan Africa benchmarks. This
implies that over the years the banking sector of São Tomé and Príncipe has developed to levels comparable
to its regional peers. This outturn is a positive development but could also be symptomatic of an
unsustainable expansion in the wake of excessive risk taking shored up by oil expectations. Despite this
performance, São Tomé and Príncipe’s banking sector development still lags small island states. This
underperformance could be based on economic and structural characteristics such as population density.4

4

Since countries with lower population density are associated with shallow financial penetration and higher cost of financial
intermediation from diseconomies of scale, the size of the population could be an explanatory factor.

Benchmarking access
13.
Estimates for outreach of financial services indicate improved penetration of financial services
for São Tomé and Príncipe. Using deposit accounts relative to the adult population to estimate the share of
banked population, the high level of access at 70 percent outperforms the median of 29.2 percent for subSaharan Africa. This development is supported by the pickup in the percentage of commercial bank branches
per 100,000 adults from a low of 4.7 percent in 2004 to about 23.4 percent in 2011, exceeding the regional
benchmark of 3.5 percent. Overtime, the number of bank branches relative to the population has closed the
gap with small island states and beyond 2010 the industry has significantly outperformed the benchmark for
the small island states. Inclusiveness of the banking sector is further buttressed by the belated introduction
of ATMs which at 24 exceed the median for small island states (12). In general, the banking system has
become more inclusive but the higher performance with respect to branch network also indicates that the
country has more commercial banks than optimal. In fact, the median number of commercial banks for the
small island states is 4. Further, the costs of maintaining ATMs are higher yet their number exceeds
significantly sub-Saharan Africa and the small island states.
Benchmarking efficiency
14.
Entry of new financial intermediaries has not been matched by gains in the efficiency of the
banking sector. The sustainable development of the financial system and the degree to which it provides
support to the real sector depends on the efficiency with which intermediation occurs. When measured as
the spread between the lending and deposit rates for commercial banks, interest rate spreads despite
narrowing from 19.7 percent in 2008 to about 13.3 percent in 2012 have remained above the median for the
small island states. Anecdotal evidence indicates that the source of the spread is high overhead costs,
diseconomies of scale due to small size of markets, as well as inefficiency of the banks over the years which
have resulted into passing the high costs through to customers.
Benchmarking dollarization
15.
Financial dollarization has been a distinguishing feature of the banking sector of São Tomé
and Príncipe for the last 8 years. Measured as the ratio of foreign currency to total deposits as well as
foreign currency denominated loans to total, dollarization increased during 2004-12. The chart plots average
inflation for 2008-12 and foreign exchange to total loans for a similar period and it confirms that compared
to selected countries in sub-Saharan Africa and small island states, São Tomé and Príncipe is more dollarized.

16.
Financial dollarization has implications for financial stability. The central bank position can easily
become under pressure to be the dollar lender of last resort. Also, banks with larger domestic dollar
liabilities must balance their foreign exchange position by extending dollar lending to local currency earners
or holding assets abroad. Lending to un-hedged domestic clients creates a credit risk. More importantly, the
experience of most countries has been that dollarization is not easily reversed even when the underlying
causes have been removed resulting into “dollarization hysteresis” – persistence of dollarization after
inflation is subdued. In recent months, the decline in inflation has correlated with reduced dollarization.
17.
Recently, de-dollarization in São Tomé and Príncipe has been the result of market and
prudential forces. The authorities have pursued successful implementation of macroeconomic stabilization
policies, which have yielded stronger fundamentals in low inflation and further anchored expectations. In
addition, the authorities’ active management of reserve requirements and other prudential measures has
contributed de-dollarization.
D

Benchmarking Soundness of the São Tomé and Príncipe Banking Sector

18.
The soundness of the banking sector is assessed on the basis of tradition Financial Soundness
Indicators (FSIs) relating to capital adequacy, liquidity, profitability, and efficiency. The major finding is
that aggregated or system-wide indicators are broadly in line with prudential norms but generally conceal
large variations across banks.
Capital adequacy assessment
19.
Available information on solvency indicates that the São Tomé and Príncipe banking sector is
well capitalized. The average solvency ratio as measured by the regulatory capital to risk weighted assets
for the last nine years has exceeded the internationally acceptable standard of 8 percent with about six

84

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

banks consistently above 10 percent. This level of aggregate capitalization compares favorably with other
banking systems especially for sub-Saharan Africa but trails small island states.
20.
However, some banks are weakly capitalized. The number of banks with capital asset ratio below
6 percent has increased to 2 in March 2013. A prolonged existence of undercapitalized banks has the
potential to undermine the confidence in the central bank as a regulatory authority as strict enforcement of
capital requirements is critical to financial stability.
Benchmarking asset quality
21.
Asset quality, as measured by the ratio of non-performing to total loans has also deteriorated
and underperforms small island states and sub-Saharan Africa. Between 2000 and 2010, the country
enjoyed periods of high economic and credit growth. The rapid increase in credit was associated with
deterioration in asset quality. The ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans actually peaked at about
44 percent in 2006 but receded to 10.2 percent in 2010 before doubling to 23 percent in 2013. This pick up
was attributed to lapses in regulation standards which accommodated misclassification of assets and
excessive risk taking as optimism about the economy and oil spurred credit growth.
Benchmarking profitability
22.
Indicators of profitability for São Tomé and Príncipe’s commercial banks are very weak. Most
commercial banks are not profitable and the outturn is the same for both return on assets and return on
equity. Banks’ return on assets for the last 8 years has averaged -0.9 percent. Return on equity, a measure of
the extent to which available capital resources are put to profitable use, also averaged -3.2 percent for the
last 8 years. This compares unfavorably with the average for sub-Saharan Africa which was above 20 percent
for 2012. Interestingly, shareholders of the loss making banks have been willing to cover their losses and
augment their capital to maintain a foothold in anticipation of oil.

Benchmarking liquidity
23.
Liquidity ratios are high for São Tomé and Príncipe’s banking system. Prolonged excess liquidity
(above the perceived structural minimum) generates perverse market incentives and undermine the
credibility of the central bank in its pursuit of the dual goals of monetary and financial stability. To this end,
several IMF technical assistance missions have recommended the restoration of more neutral liquidity
conditions with a two way risk, i.e., excess or deficit to a larger extent also to preserve the fixed exchange
rate regime. Critically, addressing the excess reserves is also seen as a catalyst for the development of an
interbank market. It is therefore recommended that the authorities step up their efforts toward more
proactive liquidity management. This could be achieved by a proper assessment of the surplus liquidity
conditions, extension of the liquidity forecasting framework, and allowing in due course open market
operations.
24.
São Tomé and Príncipe’s commercial banks are largely deposit funded. The customers’ deposits
to loans ratio has been fairly stable. Banks also benefit from funding from foreign banks. The interbank
market is largely inoperative hence do not constitute a significant source of bank liquidity funding. This
situation is attributed to a number of factors. Despite ample liquidity in the system, this is not evenly
distributed. The market remains segmented as trading is infrequent and based on bilateral relationships or
with a counterpart deemed reliable based on preference or any other subjective criteria. Banks are generally
reluctant to lend to each other due to incapacity to evaluate counterparty risks. The need for an active
interbank market cannot be overemphasized as it will foster the efficacy and sustainability of the fixed
exchange rate arrangement.
D.

Benchmarking Banking Supervision and Regulation

26.
The methodology used for the assessment of banking supervision and regulation relied on the
Basel Core Principles (BCPs) for Effective Banking Supervision, developed by the Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision (BCBS). The BCPs provide a benchmark against which the effectiveness of bank
supervisory regimes can be assessed. The BCPs were assessed in the context of the progress made in
implementing the central bank of São Tomé and Príncipe’s Strategic Plan for 2012 and 2015. The BCPs
earmark a set of five conditions for a robust financial system which are (i) sound and sustainable
macroeconomic policies, (ii) adequacy of public infrastructure, (iii) effective market discipline, (iv) effective
procedures for the resolution of a problem bank, and (v) appropriate level of systemic protection.
Weaknesses or shortcomings in these areas may significantly impair the ability of the supervisory authority
to implement effective supervision.
Sound and sustainable macroeconomic policies
27.
The assessment focused on the capacity of the supervisors to assess vulnerabilities and risks
associated with macroeconomic policies both for the financial system and for the effectiveness of
bank supervision. In this regard, efforts made by the central bank to fulfill their strategic objectives
pertaining to improving the efficiency of monetary policy as well as strengthening the technical capacity of
the supervisory staff were assessed. Important strides have been made in recent years aimed at improving

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

87

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

banking supervision. Following technical assistance from the IMF (MCM), the authorities have managed to
develop an overnight liquidity forecasting framework for conducting active liquidity management. The
framework has been extended beyond a day to weekly and monthly horizons. The central bank has been
challenged however by the persistence of forecasting errors as well as sophistication of the framework. The
central bank also managed to design call reports for banks, created an electronic database, recommended
standardized reporting forms to the commercial banks, and introduced on-site inspections.
28.
Rounds of on-site inspections have progressed as planned with the central bank conducting
examinations of four banks between 2011 and 2012. The central bank is scheduled to complete the
inspection of the remaining commercial banks by end-June 2014. Leveraging on IMF technical assistance, the
authorities also developed operational procedures for emergency lending. In order to preserve financial
stability, the two banks undertook to raise their capital to risk weighted assets ratio above 10 percent.
29.
While the standards of supervision have evolved and the perimeter of regulation expanded,
human resource constraints remain. The Department of Banking and Insurance Supervision (DBSS)
supervisory capacity is insufficient. The central bank continues to struggle with low staff compliment to
handle the supervisory demands of the financial sector as well as recurrent staff turnover. The department
has a staff complement of 8 which includes a director and board member.
Adequacy of public infrastructure
30.
A well-developed public infrastructure that covers contract enforcement, efficient judicial
systems and international accounting standards is key for effective supervision. Assessment of public
infrastructure was made in the context of the central bank objective to modernize its institutional,
accounting and legal framework. Progress has been made in drafting procedures for infraction, harmonizing
the accounting conventions with internationally acceptable standards. The country also developed a National
Payment System, a prerequisite for maintaining and promoting financial stability.
31.
In a bid to encourage banks to extend credit to the private sector beyond the traditional circle
of large businesses, São Tomé and Príncipe developed a credit bureau. Ideally, the Bureau is supposed
to collect, manage and disseminate customer information to lenders with a view of improving access.
Commercial banks have been generally receptive to the establishment of the Bureau and submission of
information has since improved. Currently, it is estimated that 75 percent of creditors have been registered
and multiple lending from different banks has since declined.
32.
These developments notwithstanding São Tomé and Príncipe has a comprehensive set of
corrective and remedial measures but fails to invoke them on a systematic basis. The process to
establish directives and impose fines or sanctions involves a lengthy series of legal procedures which delays
the ultimate decision and compromises effectiveness of regulation. As a consequence, there are inefficiencies
in the system, which result into protracted delays in resolving disputes. Most importantly, there is a need to
update the Central Bank Organic Law to equip it with the necessary instruments and powers for the pursuit
of its objectives.

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

33.
The effective functioning of financial markets relies heavily on the expectation that high
professional, legal, and ethical standards will be observed and enforced. The authorities have taken
concrete steps to address the deficiencies of São Tomé and Príncipe’s AML/CFT framework. With technical
assistance from the IMF’s Legal Department, they drafted amendments to the AML/CFT Law and submitted
the draft law to the National Assembly in May 2013, which was later approved by the National Assembly and
signed by President Pinto da Costa. Passage of this law has facilitated the recent removal of São Tomé and
Príncipe from the Financial Action Task Force’s list of high risk and non-cooperative jurisdictions. However,
the FATF has noted that Sao Tomé and Principe’s AML/CFT regime still exhibits a number of strategic
deficiencies and has encouraged the authorities to work with the Inter-Governmental Group against Money
Laundering in West Africa (GIABA) to address these issues. This would include measures to strengthen the
operations and core functions of the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) through improved resources, including
staffing, equipment and training. These actions are meant to strengthen the FIU core functions, such as the
receipt, analysis, and submission to the general attorney’s office of suspicious transaction reports from
financial and non-financial institutions and professions.
Effective market discipline
34.
Assessment of the strength of market discipline considered issues of transparency, including
quality, timeliness, and clarity of the information available to the public; and the role of the
government in the financial system. Effective market discipline that is based on transparency and
disclosure supplements the central banks’ assessment of safety and soundness of the financial system. In the
absence of financial transparency, banks are denied of reliable financial information that allows assessment
of counterparty risk. In this regard, the assessment was contextualized in the central bank’s strategic
objectives of promoting international best practices with regards to transparency and efficiency. There is no
evidence of government efforts to influence banks’ lending operations. Despite timely, accurate, and credible
financial information for market participants being critical to the successful functioning of market discipline,
the central bank is yet to publish economic and financial information with a higher frequency. Efforts have
been in place to develop a framework for publishing fees and charges by the commercial banks. Pertinently,
the commercial banks do not publish their results as required by the Law. The explanation provided
attributed the situation to absence of media outlets and websites as well as apprehension on the part of the
central bank to convey to market participants the soundness of the banking system.
Procedures for effective resolution of problem banks
35.
Procedures for effective resolution of problem banks are being developed. The current state of
play is that supervisors have no sufficient and flexible range of procedures to achieve the efficient resolution
of problems in banks, including the capacity to conduct an orderly resolution with respect to problem banks.
Mechanism for providing an appropriate level of systemic protection
36.
Aligned with the strategic objectives of modernizing legal frameworks and strengthening the
office of consumer support, an assessment of financial safety nets was conducted. The examination
focused on elements designed to prevent situations in which the failure or potential failure of individual

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

89

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

financial institutions disrupts the intermediation function of financial markets and, thus, the broader
economic activity. A key element of financial safety nets is investor and policyholder compensation scheme,
which is designed to promote investor confidence in the functioning of financial markets and to protect
policyholders from the failures of financial institutions. São Tomé and Príncipe established a consumer
protection scheme whose funds act to maintain public confidence in the industry by protecting the interest
of small entities or uninformed customers and by ensuring a smooth exit mechanism for failing companies.
37.
A framework for management of financial crises is however lacking. Despite prospects for a
crisis being considered as highly remote and large foreign ownership being regarded as a cushion, a
contingency plan is needed to demonstrate the national authorities’ readiness to tackle a systemic crisis.
E.
38.

Areas for Improvement

The main vulnerabilities identified by this assessment can be summarized as follows:


Weak indicators of profitability and solvency.



High level of nonperforming loans.



Inadequate development of money and capital markets.



The need to enhance the supervisory infrastructure.

Weak indicators of profitability and solvency
39.
Healthy and sustainable profitability is vital for maintaining the stability of the financial
system. As retained earnings are the primary means of organic capital generation, low profits may prevent
banks from expanding and extending additional credit to the real economy. Irrespective of high solvency
ratios, poor profitability has the potential of weakening the capacity of banks to absorb more negative
shocks, which eventually affect solvency. Profitability is largely a mirror of the quality of the management
and shareholders, competitive strategies and efficiency. The low profitability is overshadowing the gains
made in financial deepening and underlines a tendency to maintain a foothold in the economy aimed at
tapping from oil resources. There is need for the central bank to address the weak profitability of commercial
banks to avoid episodic recapitalization by:

90



Following through on the commercial banks’ commitment to submit new business plans
which should include a set of measures and guidelines to ensure profitability.



Working with commercial banks to increase the system’s efficiency, profitability, and
resilience. It will be important to adopt a crisis management and bank resolution framework
and develop restructuring solutions for banks that are unlikely to restore profitability over
the medium term (i.e., recapitalization, or liquidation of institutions in the event of failure to
identify new capital or shareholders).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

High levels of nonperforming loans
40.
The deterioration in asset quality as proxied by the ratio of nonperforming to total loans is a
concern. Nonperforming loans, which had declined from 44 percent of gross loans in 2006 to 10 percent of
gross loans in 2009, have since more than doubled but recently stabilized at above 20 percent. The problem
is further compounded by some questions about the reporting accuracy. Some on-site examinations have
actually confirmed compliance with international financial reporting standards regarding impaired assets
could lead to an upward adjustment of the reported numbers by a few percentage points. There is scope for
cleaning up the bank balance sheets. It is therefore recommended that the authorities develop a
comprehensive market strategy to deal with nonperforming loans by:


Conducting a realistic evaluation of distresses assets and facilitate strict enforcement of
classification based on international norms.



Continuing to strengthen the oversight of risk management practices at the commercial
banks and credit enforcement laws.



Exploring options of restructuring some of the loans.

Development of money and capital markets
41.
Despite a progressive trend in headline indicators of depth and breadth of the financial
system, São Tomé and Príncipe should benefit from further improvements. Evidently, the financial
sector remains underdeveloped and hence provides inadequate shock absorption capacity. Underdeveloped
financial systems constrain the range and efficacy of available policy instruments, impede risk transfer, and
can engender adverse macro-financial feedback loops.
42.
Beyond the current efforts, the country could further benefit from increased access to a
broader range of instruments. The absence of avenues for maturity transformation of deposits or
alternative investments is what largely perpetuates excess reserves holdings. Also, available evidence
suggests that structural excess liquidity encourages buy-and-hold strategies by banks. In this regard, the
authorities should explore pursuing the:


Introduction of more money market instruments to leverage on the excess liquidity and
reduce their maintenance costs.



Resuscitation of interbank activity to play the arbitrative role between supply and demand of
liquidity in the banking system.

Enhancing the supervisory infrastructure
43.
There is need to address staff capacity constraints. The quantity and quality of human capital is
critical for banking supervision. Strengthening of the supervisory staff of the central bank is of the essence.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

91

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

Inadequate staffing is likely to derail the regularity of on-site visits. Equivalently high levels of staff turnover
are likely to undermine institutional memory as well as leveraging technical assistance.
44.
The central bank must enforce the publication of financial results by the commercial banks.
The evolving regulatory practices for banks and other financial institutions, in particular the New Basel
Capital accord, places a strong emphasis on harnessing market forces, through adequate disclosure and
enhanced transparency of financial institutions. The strengthening of transparency and market discipline is
designed to complement the capital requirements and supervisory review and other tools of official
supervision in promoting soundness. It is therefore expedient for the central bank to enforce publication of
results by commercial banks which should also facilitate assessments of counterparty risks.
45.
The authorities must also continue with efforts to improve the legal infrastructure for
supporting credit contracts and enforcement. Strengthening property rights and ensuring proper contract
enforcement are critical elements for a better protection of the legal rights of creditors. Such improvements
would better the chances of a commercial bank recovering its collateral through prompt and reasonably
priced court procedures.
46.
The central bank must establish well-defined guidelines for the management of problem
financial institutions and financial crises. Lack of formal frameworks, combined with limited experience,
inadequate staffing levels may frustrate the necessary quick action when problems do arise.

Safeguards Assessments:
An updated safeguards assessment of the Central Bank of São Tomé and Príncipe (BCSTP) was
completed in May 2013. The assessment noted the severe capacity constraints faced by the BCSTP,
including lack of independent oversight. External audits conducted by reputable audit firms
continue to serve as a critical safeguard mechanism, and the assessment recommended
strengthened coordination of the audits by senior BCSTP management to ensure prompt remedial
actions on audit findings. Other recommendations included strengthening of the internal audit
function and implementation of formal investment policies.
Exchange Arrangements:
The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg against the euro. Since
January 2010 São Tomé and Príncipe has pegged the Dobra to the euro at a rate of Dobra 24,500
per euro. The organic law of the BCSTP authorizes it to make decisions regarding exchange rate
policy. The commission on foreign exchange sales cannot be higher than 2% for the euro and 4% for
other currencies. Purchases of euros must be done at the rate published by the BCSTP and no
commissions are allowed. The official euro–U.S. dollar cross rate is based on the European Central
Bank (ECB) reference rate of the previous day. The BCSTP finances current international transactions
at the official exchange rate only after verification of the documentation establishing the bona fide
nature of the bank’s request. Access to foreign exchange is limited to institutions having a net
position in the transaction currency of less than 12% of qualified capital, a net position in total
foreign currency less than 25% of qualified capital, and which are in compliance with the central
bank’s regulations on bank liquidity and capital adequacy. Financial institutions are allowed access
to the central bank’s facilities regardless of the above conditions if the foreign exchange is to be
used for importation of goods and services in periods of crisis or for the importation of fuel.
Commercial banks that meet these requirements can buy foreign exchange directly from the central
bank, which can charge up to 1.5 percent commission on sales of euro and up to a 0.5 percent
commission on purchases of euro. The buying rate is mainly indicative because the BCSTP rarely
makes purchases. The new exchange rate system has eliminated the multiple currency practice
related to the existence of numerous exchange rate markets with differing effective exchange rates
for spot transactions that existed in previous years.
São Tomé and Príncipe continues to avail itself of the transitional arrangements under Article XIV,
but does not maintain restrictions under Article XIV. However, it maintains one measure subject to
Fund approval under Article VIII: an exchange restriction arising from Article 3(i) and Article 10.1(b)
of the Investment Code (Law No. 7/2008) regarding limitations on the transferability of net income
from investment. The restriction results from the requirement that taxes and other obligations to the
government have to be paid/fulfilled as a condition for transfer, to the extent the requirement
includes the payment of taxes and the fulfillment of obligations unrelated to the net income to be
transferred.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
Joint Managerial Action Plan (JMAP) for São Tomé and Príncipe
(As of October, 2013)
1.
The IMF and World Bank São Tomé and Príncipe teams held meetings to discuss macro
critical structural reforms for São Tomé and Príncipe and their respective work programs for the
period 2013–14.
2.
The World Bank’s work program is guided by an Interim Strategy Note approved in 2011
that focuses on accelerating sustainable and broad-based economic growth and on strengthening
governance, public institutions, and human capital. A new Country Assistance Strategy for 2013–
2016 will be completed in 2014, following the recent completion of a Joint Staff Assessment Note
(JSAN) on the country’s second National Poverty Reduction Strategy. Analytical underpinnings for
the new Country Assistance Strategy include a Country Economic Memorandum, “Success Beyond
Petroleum,” completed in 2011, a Diagnostic Trade Integration Study, which is expected to be
completed in 2013, and a Poverty Assessment, which is expected to be completed in June 2014. Two
Governance and Competitiveness budget support operations were approved in March 2012 and
June 2013. They represent the first and second of three annual programmatic budget support
operations for 2012–14. A Debt Management and Performance Assessment (DeMPA) report was
completed in October 2011, and an accompanying reform plan to improve debt management was
completed in March 2012.
3.
The IMF’s work program includes the Executive Board’s consideration of the first review
under the ECF-supported program, a staff visit, a mission to conduct the 2013 Article IV consultation
discussions and second review under the ECF-supported program, missions for the third and fourth
ECF-supported program reviews, and assistance with capacity development in the areas of public
financial management, revenue administration, statistics, monetary liquidity management, and
banking supervision.
4.

The Bank and the Fund are providing complementary support to help São Tomé and

Príncipe strengthen public financial management and make progress toward debt sustainability.
Regarding the latter, the teams prepared a Joint IMF-World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)
update in 2012, and a new update has recently been prepared to accompany the 2013 Article IV
Consultation discussions and second review under the ECF-supported program.

RELATIONS WITH THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
GROUP
(As of October, 2013)
1.
São Tomé and Príncipe (STP) became a member of the African Development Bank Group
(AfDB) in 1976. To date, the AfDB has financed 30 operations in the country. This comprises of 24
projects, including institutional support, and six studies, for a total net commitment of UA
113.099 million under the African Development Fund (ADF) (98.9%), and one special support
operation of
UA 1 million under the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF). The vast majority of these operations (94%) were
financed through loans with the remaining 6% through grants.
2.
As of November 6, 2013, the AfDB’s ongoing portfolio comprised of five active projects for a
total commitment of UA 20.4 million. These are: the Livestock Development Project II; the
Infrastructure Rehabilitation for Food Security (PRIASA); the General Population and Housing
Census; the Public Finance Management Project (PAGEF)1; and technical assistance and capacity
building at the Ministry of Planning and Finance2 (Table 1). In June 2013, the Bank conducted its
portfolio performance review for the country. The review concluded that the portfolio performance
is rated satisfactory at 2.18 on a scale of 0 to 3, representing an improvement when compared to the
score of 1.9 in 2011. During the review period, the portfolio’s average disbursement rate stood at
28.8 percent, compared to 25 percent in 2011, which represented 12 percent of the annual
disbursement ratio. As of November 6, 2013, the disbursement rate stood at 32.7 percent. The
average age of the active portfolio is 2.4 years which is significantly lower than the 5.4 years
recorded in 2011. Such improvement is mainly linked to new projects approved in the first quarter
of 2013. In terms of sector distribution, agriculture contributes a substantial proportion,
representing 45 percent of the portfolio, followed by multi-sector (37 percent). There are no
ongoing private sector or multinational projects.
3.
The AfDB current involvement in STP is guided by the new Country Strategy Paper
(CSP) 2012-2016, approved in July 2012. The CSP’s main objective is to prepare the authorities for
the forthcoming oil production era and the associated challenges and risks to the country’s socioeconomic development. The current strategy is anchored on a single pillar of Capacity Building and
Institutional Strengthening which absorbed the entire African Development Fund (ADF)-12 resources
of UA 5 million for STP. More specifically, the strategy aims at improving the capacity of key public
administration institutions, including human resource development, country systems, and strategic
legal and regulatory frameworks by the time the oil era begins.
1

PAGEF was approved on January 14, 2013, in the context of the new Country Strategy Paper (CSP) 2012-2016. It
aims at improving the economic and financial governance, strategic planning, and to create an environment for
private sector development.
2

Approved on March 4, 2013, joint assistance will be provided by the Regional South Department (ORSB) and the
African Legal Support Facility founded by the AfDB to offer legal advice and capacity building to African countries.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 9

4.
As part of its strategy and knowledge products, the AfDB organized a validation workshop
held in Gabon in November 2012. The findings of the regional study on Private Sector Investment
Constraints in the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS), of which STP is a
member, were presented for discussion to representatives from the government and the private
sector.
5.
STP reached the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) decision and completion points
in 2000 and 2007, respectively. To this effect, the country became eligible for the MDRI with an
estimated $99.56 million in debt service according to the terms of the MDRI. The AfDB total
assistance under HIPC and MDRI amounted to $187.92 million in debt relief. At the end of
December 2008, the AfDB provided $13.33 million in debt relief under HIPC and $99 million under
MDRI.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of October, 2013)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Although economic data are broadly adequate for surveillance, serious financial, human,
and technological resource constraints have slowed down efforts to strengthen the statistical
system.
National Accounts: Statistics on GDP/GNP are compiled on a yearly basis and provided at the time
of the Article IV consultation and program review missions. STA provided technical assistance in
national accounts to the National Statistics Institute (INE) in 2005, 2006, 2008 and 2009. Low
response rates and/or insufficient rigor of the responses to the business surveys, including those
from important enterprises, continue to affect the quality of the business data compiled. A technical
assistance mission is planned for November 2013 to assist the authorities to: (i) change the base
year of GDP series to 2008; (ii) assist the authorities to improve the flash GDP estimates based on
high frequency indicators; and (iii) assess the progress migrating the GDP series to an improved
statistical platform that better captures survey and market information and includes estimates of the
informal sector.
A new GDP series for the period 2007–10 with base year 2001 became available in mid–2011. The
new estimates cover: (i) GDP by production approach at current and constant prices; and (ii) crossclassification tables by industry sectors. The revised series reflect more accurately recent economic
developments. This system became the basis for preparing flash estimates of GDP based on data
from the most recent population census, corporation census, and living conditions survey. It
attributed higher weights to the sectors that experienced faster growth, such as trade,
transportation and communication, and services. While the revision of the GDP series represented a
significant improvement, a number of shortcomings remain. Further improvements would require
input from the recently completed household expenditure survey (rather than living conditions
survey), using producer prices, and better estimates for agricultural production.
Consumer price statistics: Since 1997 the CPI weights have been based on a three-month
household survey conducted in 1995. A household expenditure survey was conducted in 2010 and
AFRISTAT assisted the National Institute of Statistics (INE) to change the product mix and update the
weights. Current price surveys only cover the capital, although there are plans to use the results of
the 2010 household survey to expand coverage nationwide, provided INE has the resources for field
staff. The November 2013 STA mission will provide methodological advice on consolidating the local
market series into a single, national consumer price index.
Government finance statistics: Detailed revenue and expenditure data are compiled and reported
to AFR. The main areas that need to be strengthened are (i) monitoring of expenditures on projects
financed by donors; and (ii) financing operations. All project loans financed by donors are
programmed in the budget, but some are executed independently. The government has requested
development partners to help in recording all external financing in the budget. The recording of

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 11

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

financing operations and stocks is expected to improve since the debt data management capacity is
expected to be strengthened.
The 2010 government accounts were finalized and presented to the Court of Audit in June 2013 (the
first time in over two decades that government accounts have been prepared and submitted). The
authorities are working on the 2011 and 2012 government accounts, but preparing the latter using
the accounting feature of SAFE-e has taken longer than expected, highlighting the need for
additional technical assistance and training in this area.
An October 2004 government finance statistics (GFS) mission helped the Ministry of Finance to
compile and disseminate GFS for the general government in accordance with the Government
Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001). The mission prepared bridge tables between national
budget classification and GFSM 2001 classifications to be used to compile GFS for reporting to STA
and AFR, as well as in Ministry of Finance policy work. The mission also reviewed the classification of
oil revenues under the Oil Revenue Management Law and made recommendations on classification
of such transactions. A September 2007 follow-up mission found some progress with regard to the
recommendations made by the 2004 mission. In particular, in January 2007 a new budget law was
approved that significantly improved national budget classifications. Notwithstanding these efforts,
faster statistical progress is hampered by an inadequate accounting system. Successive FAD
missions aimed at improving public accounting have begun to address this issue.
Monetary and financial statistics: STA missions provided technical assistance on monetary
statistics in December 2004, April/May 2006, June 2007 and September 2010. As a result, the
accuracy and timeliness of the monetary data reported in the standardized report forms (SRF) for
the central bank and the other depository corporations data have improved.
The missions found that the BCSTP monthly trial balance sheets were broadly adequate to compile
monetary statistics in line with the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM).
A new plan of accounts of other depository corporations (ODCs) was introduced in January 2010.
The September 2010 mission reviewed the new plan of accounts for the financial system, and found
it adequate for a proper classification, sectorization, and valuation of financial instruments, and in
line with the methodology of the MFSM. However, the mission detected serious shortcomings in the
information reported by some banks and an inconsistent approach in the way banks report to the
BCSTP. The central bank has begun to collect data from insurance companies which opened in the
past few years. The asset size of insurance companies remains small enough not to warrant inclusion
in monetary statistics at this time.
The central bank produces a quarterly FSI table. MCM TA missions on banking supervision have
helped expand the coverage of the table and improved the data quality. The additional information
compiled could permit the beginning of stress testing exercises in the near future.

External sector Statistics: There are significant weaknesses in the collection of source data related
to merchandise trade. Some transactions, including certain imports related to investment, are not
fully captured in the balance of payments (BOP). Monthly data on the main exports and imports are
reported to AFR regularly, and unit prices and volumes of exports are only occasionally included.
AFR does not receive any data on São Tomé and Príncipe’s international investment position (IIP) as
these data are not yet compiled by the BCSTP.
A March 2012 mission found inconsistencies in the classification of BOP operations and that certain
components continued to be largely estimated. Resource constraints, particularly with regard to
qualified staff, contribute to the lack of improvement in the response rate to surveys. The mission
recommended improving coordination and data sharing among data-producing agencies,
intensifying contacts with survey respondents, and using alternative sources to improve source data.
The mission assisted the authorities in creating a bridge table to report data in the Balance of
Payments Manual (BPM6) format and outlined a set of recommendations and detailed work plan to
improve compilation capacity. Resource constraints at the BCSTP have prevented the development
of IIP data.
The authorities have built on previous efforts to strengthen debt data management, and a unit was
created in late 2003 within the Ministry of Finance. The authorities are reconciling debt records with
creditors and the Commonwealth Secretariat debt recording and management system is being
operationalized.
II. Data Standards and Quality
The country has participated in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since
April 20, 2004. The metadata and plans for improvement have not been updated since the original
metadata were posted on the DSBB. Over the period 2003–09, the country has benefited from
technical assistance from STA and other providers, largely under the GDDS project for Lusophone
Africa.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION AND SECOND REVIEW UNDER THE
EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITY ARRANGEMENT—
DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS1
Approved By
David Owen and
Dhaneshwar Ghura (IMF) and
Marcelo Giugale and Jeffrey
Lewis (IDA)

Prepared by:
International Monetary Fund and International
Development Association staffs in collaboration with
the authorities of São Tomé and Príncipe.

São Tomé and Príncipe is at a high risk of debt distress according to this update of the
joint Bank-IMF low-income country debt sustainability analysis (DSA). The update
reflects the adoption of a non-oil scenario baseline in light of increased uncertainty
regarding the volume and timing of the start of oil production following Total’s recent
withdrawal from Block 1 of the Joint Development Zone (JDZ) with Nigeria, as well as
recent economic data and forecasts. Despite the revised projections, the assessment of
high risk of debt distress is unchanged from the DSA published in August 2012; the debt
ratios, however, are now projected to remain higher for a longer period of time. In
particular, the PV of debt-to-exports ratio is expected to remain above the countryspecific indicative threshold for an extended period due to the country’s narrow export
base. Reaching a projected debt profile that is consistent with manageable – if high risk –
debt dynamics would require an additional fiscal adjustment of 1 percent of GDP
over 2015–17, continued heavy reliance on grants and highly concessional lending, and
further efforts to diversify the economy and expand the export base over the medium
term.

1

The DSA was prepared by IMF and World Bank staff in collaboration with the authorities of São Tomé and
Príncipe. The analysis updates the previous Joint DSA dated July 6, 2012 (IMF Country Report No. 12/216). The
DSA follows the IMF and World Bank Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the Joint Fund-Bank Debt
Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries (January 22, 2010). The DSA uses the unified discount rate
of 5 percent set out in Decision No 15462 (October 11, 2013).

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

BACKGROUND
1.
The previous DSA for São Tomé and Príncipe was undertaken as part of the 2012 Request
for a Three-Year Arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility.2 It concluded that São Tomé and
Príncipe was at a high risk of debt distress, but showed a more favorable dynamics of debt indicators than
the current assessment because its baseline scenario included the start of oil production in 2015. The earlier
assessment also assumed that disbursements from the National Oil Account (NOA) would be sufficient to
fund the government’s capital investment program, mitigating the need for additional borrowing.
2.
São Tomé and Príncipe reached the completion point under the enhanced HIPC initiative in
March 2007, received topping-up assistance in December 2007, and later on benefited from
HIPC/MDRI debt relief. MDRI, in particular, brought substantial debt service savings, since 54 percent of
total debt before the HIPC completion point was with IDA, AfDB, and IMF. Debt relief from Paris Club
members also helped improve the country’s
debt profile.
Table 1. São Tomé and Príncipe: External Debt Stock
3.
São Tomé and Príncipe’s
medium- and long-term public and
publicly guaranteed external debt was
estimated at $221.6 million (84 percent of
GDP) as of December 2012 (Table 1).3 The
debt burden increased from $200.1 million
at end-2011 (due to disbursements from
Portugal and Nigeria) yet remains
significantly below the pre-debt relief high of
$359.5 million at end-2006. Total public
sector debt is composed solely of debt
contracted or guaranteed by the central
government, and there is currently no stateowned enterprise external debt. Debt
composition has shifted after the HIPC
completion point. The share of multilateral
debt declined from nearly 60 percent before
the completion point to 20 percent. Portugal
is now the country’s main bilateral creditor,
and IDA is its main multilateral creditor.

4.
To implement the terms of the May 2007 Agreed Minutes, the authorities have signed
bilateral agreements with all its Paris Club creditors. Russia was the final Paris Club member to sign the
bilateral agreement in 2012. São Tomé and Príncipe received debt relief from Algeria in 2011. Efforts are
underway to conclude additional debt relief with other non-Paris club creditors.

MACROECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS
5.
The authorities have cautiously migrated to a non-oil baseline scenario given increased
uncertainty regarding volume and timing of the start of oil production following Total’s recent
withdrawal from the JDZ. The main assumptions in the baseline scenario for 2013–33 are as follows:


A subdued recovery from the global economic crisis, with annual output growing at 4 percent
in 2013, 5 percent in 2014, and 5½ percent in 2015. Over the long-term, growth is projected to
be sustained at around 5½ percent per year, similarly to the historical norm and unchanged
from the growth assumption under the alternative non-oil scenario of last year’s DSA. The main
drivers of growth are expected to be construction, tourism, agriculture, and fisheries. Stronger
macroeconomic policies, further measures to enhance the business climate, and successful
implementation of a tourism development strategy would be needed to sustain growth at
5½ percent a year over the long term.



A decline in average annual inflation from 10.6 percent in 2012 to 8.3 percent in 2013, and
further to around 5 percent in 2015. Inflation is then assumed to remain around 3 percent over
the long term. This reflects continued fiscal prudence and the effects of the peg of the dobra to
the euro, which has been in effect since January 2010. The GDP deflator in US dollar terms is
projected to decline from an average of 13.3 percent in 2013 to 10 percent in 2014, and further
to around 3 percent by 2015. It is expected to remain around 2 percent over the long term.



A domestic primary deficit that is in line with available non-debt creating financing. Any
domestic financing needs are assumed to be met via a drawdown of National Oil Account (NOA)
deposits and budget support grants. The domestic primary deficit will be 3 percent of GDP
in 2014 but will be adjusted by a cumulative 1 percent of GDP over 2015–17 (i.e., to 2 percent of
GDP by 2017) to keep it in line with projected non-debt creating financing. The fiscal adjustment
would come mainly through measures to enhance revenue mobilization. No domestic borrowing
is envisaged.



Total grants are projected to increase from their current level of about 14 percent of GDP
in 2013 to an average of 17 percent of GDP a year in 2014-17. After peaking at over 18 percent
of GDP in 2018, grants will decline in importance and average around 10 percent of GDP a year
over the longer term.



The DSA assumes a level of loan concessionality of at least 50 percent. To fund the
government’s capital investment program, additional loans of about 8 percent of GDP are
projected for 2014. New borrowing will average about 4 percent of GDP a year from 2015-21
and ¼ percent of GDP thereafter. No financing from future privatization operations, no

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

3

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

commercial loans, no domestic borrowing, and no short-term loans are assumed throughout the
DSA projection period.


A recovery in capital inflows, as the economy in Europe improves. The authorities expect
continued investment in infrastructure projects to support tourism and agriculture development.
FDI is projected to stabilize around 7 percent of GDP over the long-term.



The non-interest current account deficit (including official grants) is expected to narrow as the
government further consolidates its position. The current account deficit, currently
over 20 percent of GDP, is projected to gradually decline to a longer-term average of 10 percent
of GDP. Export growth will be driven by increases in cocoa production, the start of palm oil
production, and increased tourism as São Tomé and Príncipe rehabilitates its infrastructure.



Downside risks include significant spending overruns in the run-up to the 2014 local and
parliamentary elections. The outlook could also be adversely impacted by supply shocks (leading
to higher inflation and lower growth), spillovers from a further deterioration in financial
conditions in Europe (resulting in delays in project execution), and delayed action on reducing
the size of the banking sector (leading to continued low profitability for the sector and stagnant
credit growth).

6.
São Tomé and Príncipe’s prospects to become an oil producer, though more uncertain,
remain good. For illustrative purposes, the DSA includes an alternative oil scenario to assess the debt
outlook in the event of oil. The details of the alternative oil scenario assumptions are as follows:


Oil production is expected to begin in 2019 in Block 1 of the JDZ, boosting GDP growth
to 19 percent in that year and 27 percent in 2020 as oil production approaches its peak. Non-oil
real GDP growth is assumed to be equal to the baseline non-oil scenario. The total available
reserves in Block 1 of the JDZ have been revised from 100 million barrels to 60 million barrels.



Production is assumed to be about 5,000 barrels per day in 2019 and peak at about 18,300
barrels per day in 2021–22. Production will average about 8,000 barrels per day over the 20-year
life of the project. This is expected to yield, on average, $294 million of annual export earnings,
of which $195 million would go to the JDZ partners, with 40 percent ($78 million) belonging to
São Tomé and Príncipe.4 In accordance with the Oil Revenue Management Law (ORML), once oil
production starts, the bulk of current revenues are to be transferred into a sub-account of the
NOA—the Permanent Fund of São Tomé and Príncipe. Resources in the Permanent Fund are to
be invested with a view to generating a permanent income stream for the NOA. In steady state,
all revenues are deposited in the Permanent Fund while a long-term real rate of return (capped
at 5 percent) applied to the previous year’s closing balance will be used to determine the
amount annually transferred to the budget.

4

The DSA assumes an oil price averaging $111 a barrel from 2019-39. The previous DSA prepared by Fund staff
assumed a price of $96 per barrel from 2015-35.

The country would remain eligible for IDA grants until the start of oil production.

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
A. Baseline
7.
Under the baseline non-oil scenario, several external debt indicators remain just around or
significantly above their relevant indicative thresholds over the next few years (Figure 1, blue lines).5
Reflecting São Tomé and Príncipe’s narrow export base, the PV of public and publicly guaranteed (PPG)
external debt-to-exports ratio is almost three times the indicative threshold of 100 percent and is expected
to remain above the threshold until 2030. The PV of PPG external debt-to GDP ratio remains hovering just
above the threshold through 2020 and the debt service-to-exports ratio breaches the threshold
through 2014. The PV of external debt-to-revenue and debt service-to-revenue remains below the
thresholds for the entire forecast horizon. All of the indicators show improvement over time as a result of
growth, fiscal consolidation, slower debt accumulation, and expansion of the export base.

B. Sensitivity Analysis and Alternative Scenario
8.
Stress tests show the highest vulnerability of debt sustainability differs for debt stock and
debt service indicators (Figure 1, dashed red lines).6 The country’s debt-to-GDP and debt-to-revenue
ratios are vulnerable to a one-time 30 percent nominal depreciation, while the debt-to-exports ratio is
susceptible to a shock to export growth. This highlights the need to maintain the credibility of the
exchange rate peg and to maintain international reserves at prudent levels. A one-time depreciation would
significantly alter the PV of debt, leading to each of the indicators breaching the threshold for a long
period. The stress test results for the debt-to-exports ratio do not fall below the threshold until almost the
end of the projection period. The debt service indicators are particularly susceptible to changes in the terms
of public sector borrowing. This shows that the country is highly exposed to changes in the level of
concessionality of loans and emphasizes the need for the government to seek out only highly concessional
financing. A shock to the terms of public sector borrowing would keep the debt service-to-exports ratio
hovering around the threshold until 2025 while the debt service-to-revenue ratio remains well below the
threshold for the entire projection period.
9.
Under an alternative oil scenario, São Tomé and Príncipe’s projected debt indicators would
greatly improve and all indicators would fall quickly below the thresholds (Figure 1, orange lines).
Under this scenario the levels of concessional financing could be phased out as the country first moves
from IDA grants to IDA loans, and then seeks market financing as needed.

5

São Tomé and Príncipe’s quality of policies and institutions as measured by the average World Bank’s Country
Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) for the period 2010–12 is 3.03 ( weak performer). The corresponding
indicative thresholds are: 30 percent for the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio; 100 percent for the NPV of debt-to-export
ratio; 200 percent for NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio; 15 percent for the debt service-to-exports ratio; and 18 percent
for the debt service-to-revenue ratio.

The country was most vulnerable to a shock to non-debt creating flows in the previous DSA.

PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
10.
There is essentially no difference between the external and public sector DSAs. This is
because the government of São Tomé and Príncipe does not have any domestic public debt stock and is
not projected to issue domestic debt in the baseline scenario.7 However, the debt dynamics appear
unsustainable under two alternate scenarios. The debt indicators continue to rise throughout the projection
period when real GDP growth and the primary balance are at historical averages (Figure 2, dotted green
line) or when the primary balance is unchanged from 2013 (Figure 2, black dashed line). These shocks
highlight the importance of continued fiscal prudence to ensure debt sustainability and structural reforms
to improve the business environment and thus support private sector led growth. Public debt is most
sensitive to a combined shock to the projected growth of nominal GDP, exports, private transfers and FDI.
The public debt service-to-revenue ratio is most sensitive to a one-time 30 percent depreciation of the
dobra.

CONCLUSION AND THE AUTHORITIES’ VIEW
11.
São Tomé and Príncipe remains at a high risk of external debt distress. However, the country
is able to service its current obligations and while some external debt indicators are projected remain
above their respective thresholds they show a clear downward trend in the long term. Compared to the
prior DSA, the indicators remain just around or significantly above the thresholds for longer periods due to
the absence of oil. In this context, the DSA underlines the need for measures to mitigate risks:


Remain committed to maintaining the exchange rate peg. It will be important to maintain an
adequate level of international reserve to boost confidence in the wake of reduced oil prospects;



Maintain fiscal prudence, particularly in the run-up to the 2014 local and parliamentary elections;



Accelerate reforms to improve policy and institutional performance to enhance the growth
potential of the country;



Restructure and strengthen the banking system through either further recapitalization or
mergers and/or closure of distressed and weak banks;



Ensure favorable financing terms in the form of grants or highly concessional borrowing; and



Develop and implement a comprehensive strategy to reduce the cost of doing business and
attract private investment that can broaden the export base.

12.
The biggest risks to external debt sustainability come from exchange rate shocks and less
favorable terms on new public sector loans. Debt sustainability could deteriorate if significantly higher

Data on cross-arrears between the Treasury, the state-owned Water and Electricity Company (EMAE), and National
Fuel Company (ENCO) are not included in this analysis as a plan to clear such arrears is being developed.

global food and fuel prices materialize, raising the import bill and putting pressure on the current account.
The risks appear manageable over the medium-term if the authorities are able to move forward with the
planned fiscal adjustment in the coming years and safeguard international reserves. These vulnerabilities
also underscore the importance of sound macroeconomic policies to fulfill the country’s growth potential
on a sustained basis. The development of sound public debt management, anchored in a medium-term
debt management strategy and medium-term fiscal framework, will be essential to guide future
development financing. Additionally, with respect to the public investment plan, priority should be given to
projects which would help generate high growth and employment as well as exports to help ensure debt
service capacity in the future.
13.
The authorities broadly agreed with the key macroeconomic assumptions and analysis
underpinning the joint DSA. They have cautiously moved to the non-oil baseline scenario following
Total’s decision to abandon the Block 1 of the JDZ. However, the authorities remain confident about the
prospects for future oil production, citing interest from medium-size firms to take over from Total, the
recent signing of a production sharing agreement in the EEZ, and the potential for joint off-shore
exploration of along the maritime frontier shared with Equatorial Guinea. While acknowledging that São
Tomé and Príncipe remains at high risk of falling back into debt distress, they highlighted that supporting
growth and diversification requires mobilizing sufficient resources to implement the country’s public
investment program, which will continue to require highly-concessional borrowing to the extent that
sufficient grant financing is not available. Finally, the authorities noted that additional borrowing did not
pose an immediate concern as debt service levels are at or below the thresholds.

Includes both public and private sector external debt. Technical arrears which are currently being renegotiated are excluded.
Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock

Press Release No. 13/533
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 19, 2013

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with the Democratic
Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe
On December 16, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and
Príncipe.
After significant real economic growth volatility and high inflation through 2009, growth has
become more stable and inflation has reached record low levels. However, real economic
growth slowed to 4 percent in 2012, reflecting a scaling back of project financing and foreign
direct investment as many of São Tomé and Príncipe’s key partners were hard hit by the
global economic slowdown. Growth is projected to remain unchanged at 4 percent in 2013 in
light of lingering uncertainties stemming from the challenging external environment. Despite
São Tomé and Príncipe’s vulnerability to supply shocks, inflation has continued to recede
following the adoption in January 2010 of the peg of the dobra to the euro: annual inflation
reached 6.4 percent in September 2013 (its lowest level in two decades).
The fiscal stance has been prudent in recent years. After an initial slippage in 2009, the
domestic primary balance has improved steadily thereafter, reflecting efforts to increase tax
revenues and contain non-priority spending. However, the authorities have had difficulty
sustaining the tax effort, which dipped to 14 percent of GDP in 2012, reflecting the effect of
the weakening economy on customs duties and consumption and profit taxes, as well as a
still narrow tax base and the persistence of fuel tax arrears.
Monetary aggregate growth has been consistent with maintaining the credibility of the
exchange rate peg. Broad money growth accelerated in 2012, reflecting a larger than
projected accumulation of foreign assets. However, it has since abated and year-on-year
growth in broad money is now broadly in line with nominal GDP growth.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2

The financial soundness of the banking system was adversely impacted by rapid credit
expansion until 2011 in the context of poor risk management and lending practices. The data
reveal low overall profitability, a high and rising share of nonperforming loans, and a rapidly
declining trend in banks’ capital-to-risk-weighted-asset ratios. On the positive side,
dollarization in the banking system continues to decline, reflecting measures taken by the
central bank to foster the use of the local currency, as well as the public’s increased
confidence in the dobra as inflation converges to international levels.
The external current account deficit continues to decline and central bank’s international
reserves to improve. Weaker economic activity has led to reduced imports of goods and
services and an improved external current account balance. After falling below three months
of imports in mid-2012, the central bank has since accumulated international reserves
considerably. International reserves, which have been boosted by privatization receipts and
grants, stood at around 5.5 months of imports at end-September 2013.
The outlook for 2014 continues to be affected by difficult global conditions. Real GDP
growth has been revised downward, from 5.5 to 5 percent, reflecting lingering uncertainties
in the world economy, weak external financing prospects for investment projects, and the
changed oil outlook. Inflation is projected to reach 6 percent by end-2014, as inflation
expectations continue to be anchored by a prudent fiscal stance and the exchange rate peg.
The external current account deficit is expected to narrow further, with weaker than
previously projected economic activity leading to lower import growth.
São Tomé and Príncipe’s medium-term economic outlook will depend on strengthening the
economy’s resilience in the wake of more uncertain oil prospects. Fiscal and external debt
sustainability indicators are expected to improve more slowly following the French oil
company Total’s decision in September 2013 to withdraw from Block 1 of the Joint
Development Zone (JDZ) with Nigeria. As a result, the authorities will have to continue
relying on grants and highly concessional financing for many years to come; commercial
banks that have entered the market lured mainly by the prospects of oil will have to change
their market strategy and strengthen their balance sheets, or leave the market; and the
authorities will have to promote even more forcefully the development of non-oil priority
sectors, such as tourism, agriculture, and fisheries, including by improving the business
climate and upgrading the country’s infrastructure with private sector support.

3

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors noted that economic growth has been sustained while inflation has been
reduced notwithstanding a challenging global environment. They also commended the
authorities’ fiscal prudence in recent years and the steps they have taken to strengthen the
financial sector. For the period ahead, Directors encouraged the authorities to maintain fiscal
discipline, including in the run-up to elections, given a more uncertain economic outlook.
They also recommended taking further steps to bolster the economy’s resilience, including
strengthening the financial sector and improving competitiveness.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ cautious medium-term fiscal plans. They stressed the
importance of keeping the domestic primary deficit in line with available non-debt creating
financing, and of mobilizing additional domestic revenue to boost priority infrastructure and
pro poor spending. Prudent external borrowing will mitigate São Tomé and Príncipe’s high
risk of debt distress. In particular, grants and concessional loans should be sought to finance
the public investment program. Directors looked forward to a comprehensive solution to
eliminate the longstanding issue of cross-arrears.
Directors highlighted the importance of preserving financial stability. Noting the relatively
high number of commercial banks, they encouraged the authorities to monitor closely banks’
profitability and capital adequacy. They also recommended reinforcing compliance with
prudential requirements and taking steps to bolster the efficiency of the banking system.
Directors welcomed the expeditious approval of a law to combat money laundering and the
financing of terrorism and encouraged the authorities to address remaining obstacles to its
rigorous enforcement.
Directors agreed that the fixed exchange rate regime has provided economic and financial
stability to São Tomé and Príncipe in the context of a prudent fiscal stance and an adequate
level of international reserves. Nonetheless, the country’s high current account deficit is a
source of vulnerability and Directors recommended continued efforts to raise productivity
and competitiveness. Further infrastructure investments as well as deeper regulatory and
legal reforms will help improve the business climate and promote economic diversification.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views
of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. An explanation of any
qualifiers used in summing up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

IMF Executive Board Concludes the Second Review under the Extended Credit Facility
Arrangement with São Tomé and Príncipe
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the second
review under the three-year arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) for São
Tomé and Príncipe. The completion of the review enables the disbursement of an amount
equivalent to SDR 0.37 million (about US$ 0.57 million), bringing the total disbursements
under the arrangement to SDR 1.11 million (about US$ 1.71 million).
The Executive Board also concluded the 2013 Article IV Consultation with São Tomé and
Príncipe. A press release will be issued in due course.
The three-year SDR 2.59 million (then about US$ 3.9 million) ECF arrangement with São
Tomé and Príncipe was approved by the IMF’s Executive Board on July 20, 2012 (see Press
Release No.12/272).
Following the Executive Board’s discussion, Mr. Min Zhu, Deputy Managing Director and
Acting Chair issued the following statement:
“The authorities are to be commended for a satisfactory performance under the Fundsupported program. Steady economic growth and disinflation have been maintained in a
challenging global environment, and a prudent fiscal stance has underpinned the fixed
exchange rate regime.
“Looking ahead, it is important to continue to strengthen economic resilience, particularly in
light of uncertain prospects for oil production. Fiscal discipline, particularly in the run-up to
the 2014 elections, will be crucial. In this regard, improvements in revenue mobilization
continue to be necessary to create additional space for public investments and social
spending. Reliance on grant and concessional financing will help mitigate the risk of debt
distress.

“Policy priorities for the financial sector are to reinforce compliance with prudential
requirements and to promote the efficiency and profitability of the banking system.
“Continued efforts to improve productivity and competitiveness are necessary to reduce
external vulnerabilities. Upgrades in infrastructure and further regulatory reforms will help
improve the business climate and promote economic diversification.”

Statement by Kossi Assimaidou, Executive Director for São Tomé and Príncipe
and Woury Mamadou Diallo, Alternante Executive Director
December 16, 2013
The São Toméan authorities are grateful to Fund Staff for the constructive discussions held
in São Tomé and Washington D.C during the 2013 Article IV consultations and second ECF
review in September and October 2013. The policy discussions focused on the need to
maintain fiscal and external debt sustainability in light of reduced oil prospects, strengthen
the resilience of the economy, and reduce financial sector vulnerabilities. My authorities
remain committed to consolidate the progress achieved over the years in strengthening
economic growth and macroeconomic stability. They broadly concur with the main policy
recommendations of the staff report which will help them implement their National Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper II.
1.

Recent Economic Developments and Performance under the ECF Arrangement

The economy of São Tomé and Príncipe has been impacted negatively by the global
economic slowdown affecting many of the country’s key development and investment
partners. After reaching 5 percent in 2011, Real GDP growth slowed to 4 percent in 2012
and is expected to remain at this level in 2013 as a result of weaker external financing
prospects for public and private investments. The exchange rate peg to the euro as well as
the authorities’ prudent fiscal policy stance contributed to a declining trend in inflation from
an annual average peak of 32 percent in 2008 to 12 percent in 2012. Annual inflation even
reached a record low level of 6.4 percent in August 2013.
The authorities continued to make progress as regards fiscal consolidation. The domestic
primary deficit target of 3.1 percent of GDP is expected to be achieved in 2013. Although
tax collections in the first semester of 2013 were below projected levels as a result of the
slowdown of the economy, non tax revenue as well as expenditures control allowed to
compensate for the shortfall. The authorities implemented several structural reforms aimed
at strengthening public finances, notably the creation of a macro-fiscal unit comprised of
representatives from the Ministry of Planning and Finance, the Central Bank and the
National Institute of Statistics. The macro-fiscal unit has started the preliminary work to
implement a medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF). Other noteworthy achievements are
the completion of the second phase of the implementation of ASYCUDA World in the
Customs administration, and enhanced taxpayer management through increased security of
the Taxpayer Registry, creation of a dedicated large taxpayer unit and single taxpayer
computerized file system. The authorities also continue to work on resolving the issue of
cross-arrears between the Treasury, the National Fuel Company ENCO, and the electricity
and water company (EMAE) which contributed to the shortfall in tax revenue.

In the monetary sector, the authorities improved monetary policy management by reducing
the dollarization of the commercial banking system, promoting the use of the local currency
and reducing inflation. They took steps to strengthen the supervisory framework of the
banking sector and ensure that troubled banks are recapitalized or restructured in order to
improve the soundness of the financial system. In this regard, they have completed the onsite inspection of the largest commercial bank and taken over the operations of another
bank, following its failure to comply with supervisory requirements and submit a remedial
action plan.
As a result of the weaker economic activity and reduced imports, the external current
account deficit declined while international reserves continued to increase boosted by
privatization receipts and grants received from the World Bank and Timor-Leste. The
authorities have supported the exchange rate peg by maintaining net international reserves at
the Central Bank above the equivalent of three months of imports.
The performance of the ECF-supported program at end-June was overall satisfactory. All
continuous and quantitative performance criteria were met while two indicative targets
related to the Dobra base money and the non-accumulation of domestic arrears were missed.
As regards structural reforms, progress was achieved, notably as regards the on-site
inspection process of commercial banks and the preparation and submission of the 2010
government accounts to the National Assembly and Court of Audit. The authorities are
currently working on the 2011 and 2012 accounts and anticipate a longer than expected
period for their submission given the delays in the provision of technical assistance and
training in this area.
2.

Medium term Policy and Reform Agenda

The authorities are committed to pursue their efforts to achieve macroeconomic stability,
sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction as formulated in the National Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper II. While the authorities are confident about the prospects for oil
production, despite the withdrawal of the petroleum company Total, they have nonetheless
decided to adopt a cautious non-oil baseline scenario as there is still uncertainty regarding
the timing and volume of oil production.
Fiscal consolidation and structural reforms
The authorities will pursue gradually their fiscal consolidation efforts with the view to limit
its contractionary impact on the economy. The 2014 budget aims to maintain fiscal
discipline in an election year and targets a domestic primary deficit of 3 percent of GDP, in
line with available non-debt creating financing from external partners and transfers from the
National Oil Account. A cumulative adjustment in the primary deficit of 1 percent of GDP
will be phased in over three years, starting in the year after the local and parliamentary
elections in order to limit the shock created by the withdrawal of Total. The authorities will
be in a better position to undertake their fiscal adjustment once economic recovery takes a
strong hold.
They are mindful of the need to enhance revenue mobilization, as the scope for further
expenditure restrictions is limited given the low level of recurrent and domestically-financed

capital expenditure. In this regard, the reforms aimed at improving tax collections and
customs and tax administration efficiency will be stepped up while creating additional fiscal
space for infrastructure and pro-poor spending, and keeping the domestic primary deficit in
line with non-debt creating financing. Among the measures envisaged, the authorities will
adopt a comprehensive plan to resolve the problem of cross-arrears with assistance from the
IFC and the World Bank by March 2014. Steps will be taken to further expand the tax base
by better registering taxpayers, and combat tax fraud and evasion by improving the selection
of taxpayers to be audited through risk analysis. However, in order to increase tax payer
voluntary compliance, the authorities are aware of the need to improve the quality of
services provided to taxpayers and extend them throughout the country, as well as simplify
and harmonize tax procedures. They intend to provide the tax and customs administrations
with the necessary resources notably additional staff and equipment to allow them to
implement these reforms.
Liquidity Management, Financial Stability, and Safeguards
In order to strengthen the resilience of the economy to shocks and promote the sound
development and transparency of the financial system, the authorities will reinforce
supervisory practices and monetary policy management. With regard to reinforcing the
resilience of the economy, they intend to increase the floor on net international reserves
from 3 to 3.5 months of imports in order to boost confidence given the less optimistic
prospects for oil production.
With respect to the regulatory and supervisory framework, they will focus on reinforcing
compliance with solvency and other regulatory requirements. In this context, they will
require, among other measures that all banks in operation in the country have a minimum
capital-to-risk-weighted-asset ratio of 12 percent. The banks that do not comply would need
to be intervened or closed. The process of on-site inspection, which was completed for the
largest commercial bank, will also continue for the remaining commercial banks by
June 2014, and the Central Bank intends to increase the frequency of these inspections
thereafter.
The Central bank will pursue its efforts to introduce as soon as possible money market
instruments and create the foundations of an interbank market. In this regard, liquidity
management will be strengthened by the development of a systematic approach to analyze
forecasting errors and the development of daily aggregate liquidity conditions. The
autonomy of the Central Bank will be enhanced through a revision of the Central Bank Law
in line with international standards, and a draft law is expected to be prepared by endSeptember 2014.
Financial transparency will be further promoted by ensuring that all commercial banks
publish their financial results for 2012 and 2013 respectively by end-march and endSeptember 2014, and penalties applied in case of non-compliance. With the technical
assistance of Brazil, the authorities are also taking steps to develop and implement a new
chart of accounts and reporting at the Central Bank according to international financial
reporting standards.

The authorities are committed to ensure that Sao Tome and Principe’s financial system is in
compliance with the AML/CFT standards. With technical assistance from the IMF, they
have drafted amendments to their AML/CFT law which was passed by the National
Assembly. Accordingly, Sao Tome and Principe has been removed from the Financial
Action Task Force’s list of high risk and non-cooperative jurisdictions, and the authorities
intend to increase the resources of the financial intelligence unit (FIU) to strengthen its core
functions and operations.
My authorities recognize the need to continue to improve the business climate in order to
increase the export base and diversify the economy. They have made progress in
establishing a one-stop-shop which will facilitate and promote foreign trade by reducing
transactions costs and increasing the country’s external competiveness. Additional reforms
are planned to be implemented in order to strengthen and simplify the country’s legal
infrastructure, notably for contract enforcement, property registration and the protection of
investors.
3.

Conclusion

My São Toméan authorities are committed to pursuing sound macroeconomic policies and
strengthen and diversify growth. They will continue to build on recent achievements notably
by reducing inflation and maintaining the domestic primary deficit in line with available
non-debt-creating financing. Their efforts will also focus on improving liquidity
management and banking supervision in order to maintain financial stability. My authorities
are mindful of the challenges in strengthening the resilience of the economy in the context
of diminished near-term oil prospects. Therefore, they will continue to implement prudent
fiscal and monetary policies and strengthening debt management will remain a priority, with
the authorities relying on grants or highly concessional financing for projects. In light of the
satisfactory progress in program implementation, I would appreciate Directors’ support for
the completion of the second review.
