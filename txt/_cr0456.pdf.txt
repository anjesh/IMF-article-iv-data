Article IV Consultation discussions were held in London during December 3–18, 2003. The
mission comprised Messrs. Cottarelli (Head), Chadha, Escolano, Ms. Honjo, and Ms. Koeva (all
EUR). Mr. Scholar, Executive Director, and Mr. Kelmanson (OED) attended the meetings. Staff
met with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Governor of the Bank of England (BoE), the
Chairman of the Financial Services Authority (FSA), other senior government officials, members
of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the BoE, representatives of employers’ and
employees’ organizations, and financial institutions.

•

At the conclusion of last year’s consultation in February 2003, Directors welcomed the growth
performance of the UK economy during the slowdown, sustained by the timely easing of monetary
and fiscal stances. However, they called for vigilance regarding the risks posed by high household
debt and house prices. Directors also saw downside risks to the authorities’ revenue projections and
called for expenditure restraint to lower over time the structural fiscal deficit and avoid inefficiency
in spending. Directors welcomed the conclusions of the Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP) indicating the financial supervision framework was strong and banks were highly
profitable and capitalized, but called for sustained vigilance of the insurance industry.

•

The authorities’ policies continue to be broadly in line with Director’s appraisals in earlier
consultations. The macroeconomic policy and financial supervision frameworks remain at the
forefront internationally and are consistent with Fund recommendations. The authorities, however,
have not yet responded to the call for moderating the growth of public spending, in spite of fiscal
outturns that have remained weaker than targeted.

•

The United Kingdom has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. The
exchange system is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international
transactions (Appendix II).

The United Kingdom has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard, and data
provision is adequate for surveillance (Appendix III).

The authorities released the mission’s concluding statement and have agreed to the publication of
the staff report.

-4EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
After faltering in the wake of the Iraq war, economic activity has staged a strong recovery.
Real GDP grew by over 2 percent in 2003, with quarterly growth rates rising above trend in
the second half. The upswing reflects not only strengthening external conditions but also the
continued buoyancy of domestic demand driven by expansionary monetary and fiscal
policies, robust increases in house prices and rising household debt. The labor market has
been resilient, with unemployment remaining near a 20-year low during the downturn. RPIX
inflation remained close to its target, though CPI inflation remains some 0.6 percentage
point below the new target of 2 percent. Near term prospects are for an acceleration in
growth before settling down to trend rates later this year. Further out, the main risk relates to
a hard landing in house prices and private consumption.
Policy Discussions
Staff and the authorities broadly agreed that against a backdrop of strengthening external
demand, macroeconomic policies needed to tighten. The discussions focused on whether or
not policy actions were required for the necessary fiscal consolidation and on calibrating the
required tightening in monetary policy. The discussions also encompassed structural policies
for raising productivity, the outlook and risks for the pension system, financial sector issues
and the authorities’ assessment of readiness for EMU entry.
•

Fiscal consolidation. Over two-thirds of the five percentage point deterioration in the
fiscal position between 2000/01 and 2003/4 is estimated by staff as structural. It reflects
primarily deliberate increases in spending on public services and unexpected shortfalls in
tax receipts attributable to the bursting of the global equity bubble. Staff and the
authorities concurred that a gradual strengthening of the fiscal position was needed to
respect the government’s fiscal rules going forward, improve fiscal fundamentals, and
support monetary tightening at this cyclical juncture. The authorities saw the deficit
improving sufficiently with the cyclical upswing, a rebound in revenues from the
financial sector, improvements in tax collection, and rising effective tax rates from the
fiscal drag. In contrast, staff saw the deficit declining only modestly over the medium
term without new measures, to 2¾ percent of GDP, some 1 percentage point above the
authorities’ projections. Thus, additional measures were likely to be needed. In particular,
staff saw a case for moderating the government’s ambitious spending plans, as a more
gradual increase in public spending would reduce the risks of inefficiencies.

•

Monetary tightening. There was agreement that a strategy of gradual, early interest rate
increases was called for. Uncertainties as to the likely response of consumption to
changes in interest rates, related to the unusually high household debt level, called for
gradualism. In the staff’s view, the case for gradual—and correspondingly “early”—
increases was strengthened by the risk that late and, thus, larger increases could
precipitate a sharp downward adjustment in house prices.

as the global economy recovers. The tightening needs to be carefully calibrated so as to
steer consumption and housing markets to a soft landing.
•

The fiscal deficit should decline to strengthen fiscal fundamentals, meet the fiscal rules
and support the needed monetary tightening going forward. But this decline may
conflict with the authorities’ ambitious medium-term spending plans, launched in the
late 1990s, unless the revenue-to GDP ratio, hard hit by the financial market downturn in
recent years, recovers rapidly. Whether this will be the case is highly uncertain.

4.
These issues were at the core of the 2003 discussions. Staff also discussed
structural policies for growth, financial sector issues, and the authorities’ assessment of the
five tests for EMU entry published in June 2003.

6.
There was broad agreement that the recovery
was likely to continue in 2004, with staff pointing, in particular, to the strong
momentum of consumption. The staff’s baseline outlook projects a gradual shift of demand
from domestic to external sources as the global recovery gathers pace, and exports benefit

-7-

from the 5 percent nominal effective depreciation of sterling during 2003. But private
consumption is projected to remain the key driver of growth through at least mid-2004,
supported by the pick up in disposable income and the lagged effect of recent rises in house
and equity prices.1 Later, consumption would decelerate, as the impact of (expected) higher
interest rates feeds through and house price increases moderate. Staff expects business
investment to rise only modestly in 2004, reflecting the same factors that hampered it last
year. Overall, growth is projected to rise above trend through mid-2004—averaging
3.1 percent in the year—before settling down to potential rates of just above 2½ percent.
With the external outlook improving, and sterling on average over the last year at levels
regarded by staff, authorities and business representatives as sufficiently competitive, the
external current account deficit was projected to edge down gradually starting in 2004
(Table 4).2
7.
The authorities saw a more balanced composition of domestic demand, with
private investment playing a more prominent role. The December Pre-Budget Report
(PBR) projected a growth rebound to around 3–3½ percent in 2004, close to staff’s
projections. However, business investment was expected to pick up more rapidly than in the
staff’s baseline. This more sanguine investment outlook relied on confidence effects, as
uncertainties regarding geopolitical factors and the global recovery dissipate, and on the
increasing appetite for corporate debt shown recently by capital markets. In contrast, the
authorities saw consumption slowing to trend already in late 2003. Consumption indicators
published after the conclusion of the discussions do

Differences, particularly between staff
and Treasury, were more marked regarding the
current degree of slack in the economy, with
implications for growth beyond 2004. Treasury
estimated the output gap at 1½ percent below
potential in 2003, against the staff’s ¾ percent
(closer to other observers’ estimates; see text
figure). Staff, in particular, stressed the low level of
unemployment, which, at about 5 percent, had
hardly been affected by the cyclical downturn

2

This assessment of competitiveness is consistent with the staff analysis in IMF Country Reports
02/39 and 02/46, Ch. III, which finds that the equilibrium rate may have appreciated in the late
1990s reflecting a shift of exports to higher value-added and knowledge-based goods and
services, and productivity differentials. Moreover, staff analysis does not suggest any
relevant external sustainability problems (Appendix IV).

-8-

(Figure 4). While the rise in public employment and self-employment had helped, the impact
on the labor market of the reduced activity had been muffled by lower labor earnings growth,
which had declined to about 3½ percent during the past two years. Thus, as the flip side of
improved labor market flexibility, staff saw little room for increased labor utilization without
a pickup in earnings and inflation. The Treasury representatives, however, stressed that hours
worked had also declined during the downturn and this provided room for noninflationary
growth. These differences of views on the current degree of slack in the economy also
implied that Treasury saw room for faster noninflationary growth beyond 2004 than the staff.
The PBR envisaged the output gap to close by 2006, with GDP growth of 3–3½ percent in
2005, and 2½–3 percent in 2006.
9.
The near term growth outlook is subject to upside risks on the domestic front
and, although fading, downside risks on the external front. On the former, consumption
could turn out to be stronger, particularly as house price inflation, while declining from the
2002 peak, has recently remained high (Figure 5). On the latter, with the global recovery
gathering momentum, the risks have been diminishing. However, exports could suffer from
weaker-than-expected recovery in the euro area, the destination of half of UK exports, or a
further depreciation of the dollar.
10.
But, beyond the immediate future, there was agreement that the main risk
related to a hard landing scenario of house prices and consumption. Staff noted recent
cross-country evidence suggests housing price booms

a rise in the debt level that households can bear and,
given a relatively inelastic housing supply, in the
equilibrium price of houses. And, second, the abrupt interest rates hike that had pricked the
early 1990s bubble was unlikely to occur in the present more credible inflation-targeting
framework, and in the absence of exchange rate constraints. Rather, the symmetry of the
targeting framework would allow the BoE to promptly cut interest rates in the event of a
negative shock. But, the authorities concurred, risks remained. The current strength of

-9-

household balance sheets was highly dependent on house prices; and information on the
distribution of debt as well as liquid assets across households, while limited, indicated it was
uneven, thus suggesting high exposure of some segments (Box 1). Moreover, household
balance sheet adjustment in a low inflation environment would likely be slower, possibly
protracting the adjustment. As to household income gearing ratios, they were low now, but,
as recently noted by one MPC member, would rise significantly if rates increased as implied
by the current yield curve. More generally, households’ response could be particularly sharp
if a supply shock affected both inflation, prompting a rise in interest rates, and
unemployment, making it difficult for households to service debt and possibly triggering a
credit crunch. Altogether, staff and authorities concurred that this called for caution in
calibrating monetary policy, avoiding sharp unexpected changes.
Box 1. Household Balance Sheets
During 2003, household balance sheets have grown further. In Q3
household debt stood at 130 percent of disposable income, a record
high, reflecting rises in both secured and unsecured debt.
Households’ wealth has also rebounded, to around 650 percent of
disposable income (Figure 3). While the size of wealth dwarfs that
of debt, the former is highly dependent on the valuation of houses.
Moreover, the distribution of debt is uneven.

A recent BoE survey on unsecured debt confirms the findings of the
2000 British Household Panel Survey (Box 2, IMF Country Report
No. 03/48). During 1995–2003 the average unsecured debt to income ratio of debtors doubled. The
increase between 1995–2000 was fairly wide spread across the income distribution. By contrast, the
increase since 2000 has been somewhat more concentrated in households with mid to higher income.
There is also some evidence that the concentration of debt among riskier borrowers has increased over
time. As to the distribution of assets across households, updated survey evidence is limited. However, it
appears that only 20 percent of households with high unsecured debt have financial assets compared with
40 percent in the debtor population as a whole. Moreover, based on the 2000 British Household Panel
Survey, indebted households do not have larger liquid assets than the average, raising their exposure to
adverse shocks.

B. Calibrating Monetary Policy
11.
Inflation has been low and stable since last year’s consultation (Figure 3). The
retail price index (RPIX) increased by 2.8 percent during 2003. The EU harmonized
consumer price index (called CPI in the United Kingdom) rose by 1.4 percent in the same
period.
12.
There was broad agreement that the recent shift in the inflation target definition
from RPIX to CPI would unlikely have material implications for monetary policy. Last
December, with a view to facilitating convergence with the euro area, the Chancellor
changed the MPC’s remit to targeting 12-month CPI inflation, rather than RPIX inflation,
and because of the different statistical properties of the two indices, lowered the numerical
inflation target from 2½ percent to 2 percent. Staff noted that, in principle, the new inflation

- 10 -

target was somewhat less ambitious: over the long run, RPIX had tended to rise faster than
CPI by some ¾ percentage points, which was not fully offset by the cut in the numerical
target. But this difference was modest. The current difference between the two indexes was
larger (1¼ percentage point), but was due to the house price boom, and was thus expected to
be temporary. As to the transparency of the inflation targeting process, the new target might
complicate communication of forthcoming interest rate hikes, as CPI inflation is currently
well below target. This was seen perhaps as the most significant issue by MPC members. But
it was viewed as manageable, as the forward-looking nature of inflation targeting was now
accepted not only by the cognoscenti but also by the public at large (Box 2).
13.
Regarding actual monetary policy implementation, staff supported the recent
rate increase and concurred that further increases were likely to be needed if the
cyclical upswing continued. After over two years of cuts, the MPC raised rates by 25 basis
points last November and again by 25 basis points
in February (to 4 percent). The MPC minutes

imported inflation was now expected to rise with
the global recovery and the pass-through of
sterling’s 2003 depreciation. Altogether, on current demand projections, CPI inflation was
expected to edge up from the current 1.4 percent level towards the 2 percent target, and to
exceed it in the absence of rate changes. In the staff’s view, the case for tightening was
reinforced by the ebullience of the housing and household credit markets. On the latter point,
MPC members agreed that asset price considerations should be factored into an inflation
targeting framework, but views among them differed as to the extent to which this was, in
practice, possible (Box 3).
14.
There was also agreement that a strategy of gradual, early interest rate increases
was appropriate. MPC members emphasized that the uncertainties as to the likely response
of consumption to changes in interest rates, related to the unusually high household debt
level, called for gradualism. Staff also noted that the case for gradual—and correspondingly
“early”—increases was strengthened by the risk that late and, thus, larger increases would
precipitate a sharp downward adjustment in house prices. Staff also stressed that gradualism
in interest rate increases would be facilitated by supportive fiscal policies.

- 11 Box 2. Does the Shift from RPIX to CPI Matter?
The ¾ percentage point long term difference between RPIX and CPI inflation is due in part (½ percent) to
the use by the latter of geometric averages, rather than arithmetic averages. This “formula effect” is offset
by the change in the numerical target. The residual long term-difference (¼ percentage point) mostly
reflects the fact that RPIX includes a distributed lag of house price increases (as proxy for house
maintenance costs), which have tended to rise faster than CPI. This difference may disappear as the EU’s
HICP (and hence the UK’s CPI) is broadened to include imputed

(in percentage points)
The current difference is larger: 1¼ percentage point and ¾ after
adjusting for the formula effect. Does it matter? Probably not.

Difference

The current difference reflects the unusually large house price
inflation. But, as noted by MPC members, inflation targeting

was forward looking, and house price inflation was not
expected to continue at these levels. More generally, house prices
were hard to predict and so their direct effect on MPC decisions

Moreover, indexation practices (of benefits, tax schedules, and interest payments) have never used RPIX
anyway (but the more traditional RPI, which includes the effects of mortgage interest payments). Social
partner representatives believed that agents could see through these definitional differences and that wage
negotiations would not be affected either.

Asset prices may affect policy decisions in an inflation targeting framework essentially in two ways:
(i) through their impact on demand via wealth and liquidity effects; and (ii) because a bubble might
eventually burst possibly causing major recessionary effects on demand and inflation sometime down
the road. Views across MPC members varied as to the extent to which this second channel could in
practice be taken into account. Difficulties included: identifying the existence of a bubble,
anticipating the effect that interest rate increases would have on it, and having to choose between
facing an immediate, likely, but possibly small, inflation undershooting (if interest rates were raised
to contain the bubble) and a possibly larger, but uncertain, undershooting (if rates were not raised, the
bubble kept growing, and eventually burst).1
Staff acknowledged these difficulties 2 but noted that the MPC minutes had explicitly (and
appropriately) referred to this second channel to justify its interest rate decisions (including in
explaining the November 2003 rise).
In this respect, staff also suggested that, in order to facilitate communication of the rationale of
certain interest rates decisions, the Inflation Report of the BoE could usefully discuss inflation
forecasts beyond its standard 2-year horizon, as the potential effect of asset price bubbles may extend
over time. The authorities acknowledged that reducing the emphasis on the 2-year horizon was in line
with the inflation targeting remit (requiring keeping inflation at 2 percent at all times). But, they
stressed, focusing on a single time horizon had the advantage of simplicity.

C. Does the Fiscal Correction Require New Measures?
15.
The budget position has swung from a 1½ percent of GDP surplus in 2000/01 to a
projected 3½ percent of GDP deficit in 2003/04. Over two thirds of this five-percentagepoint deterioration is structural (that is, unrelated to the business cycle) and reflects primarily
deliberate increases in spending on public services, especially in health, education, and
transport; and unexpected shortfalls in tax receipts. The latter are due to the bursting of the

Reflecting the unexpected shocks,
fiscal outturns have fallen short of targets for
three consecutive years, in both nominal and
structural terms. This year the PBR revised
the projected deficit up by about one percentage
point of GDP for entirely noncyclical reasons
only six months after the publication of the
budget.

This affected both corporate income taxes (from the taxation of financial company profits)
and personal income taxes (from the taxation of incomes of financial sector employees).

The golden rule requires the current balance to be non-negative in the average of the
business cycle, which the authorities estimate to have begun in 1999/00 and to end in
2005/06. The sustainable investment rule requires the net public debt-to-GDP ratio to be at a
stable and prudent level, which Treasury has regarded to be below 40 percent. While the
second rule is also defined over the cycle, Treasury is committed to keep the debt ratio below
40 percent at all times.

Against this background, staff and authorities concurred that a gradual and
predictable strengthening of the fiscal position was needed to: (i) respect the fiscal rules
going forward; (ii) improve fiscal fundamentals—the current structural primary deficit would
imply a rising debt stock over time (Box 4); and

this range would allow net public debt to stabilize
at about 35 percent of GDP, leaving room for accommodating shocks within the sustainable
investment rule. The lower end of the range would reduce crowding out of private investment
and provide an additional buffer against potential liabilities, particularly those from
population aging. The latter were well below those of euro area countries, which justify a less
tight structural fiscal target, but, while difficult to quantify, risks were not trivial (see
Section E).
Box 4. Fiscal Sustainability
Staff’s analysis—using the standard cross-country template and taking staff projections as the baseline
(Appendix IV)—shows that, on unchanged policies, public debt would keep rising, reflecting the current
primary structural deficit and the cautious assumption that, on
2
average, the interest rate on debt exceeds the GDP growth rate.

But a correction would eventually be needed, because fiscal
trends would be increasingly unfavorable as debt and interest
payments rise. The more so if one allows for the fact that the debt
increase may affect the yield on government securities. Indeed,
there is some evidence, including econometric results controlling
for differences in cyclical positions, that UK yield differentials
vis-à-vis the euro-area have recently been unfavorably affected by
rising relative supply of UK bonds (see figure).

But views differed as to whether new fiscal measures would be needed to
improve the fiscal accounts.

In the PBR projections, the deficit
improves without any new measures,
reflecting: the cyclical upswing; a rebound
of tax revenue related to the financial
sector to levels close to the late 1990s
boom; improvements in tax collection; and
rising effective tax rates due to the fiscal
drag (since tax brackets are uprated with
prices rather than incomes). Altogether,
the tax revenue to GDP ratio was projected
to rise above recent historical peaks over
the next few years (see text figure).

In contrast, staff projections indicated that without new measures the deficit would
decline more modestly than projected by the authorities, both in 2004/05 and over the
medium term. The gap would be about ½ percent of GDP in 2004/05, and rise gradually
to 1 percent of GDP by 2008/09. In particular, staff projected lower revenue growth
reflecting the lower estimate of the output gap (see paragraph 10 above), which implied a
weaker cyclical rebound of revenue; and a more subdued recovery of tax receipts from
financial activities, as staff saw those receipts as abnormally boosted by the financial
boom of the late 1990s.7 In this baseline scenario, the golden rule would barely be met in
this business cycle and the current balance would be in deficit at the start of the new
business cycle. Additional fiscal risks would arise if a sharp unwinding of the house price
bubble led to a period of prolonged economic weakness.

19.
Staff acknowledged the substantial uncertainties associated with these
projections but emphasized the need to act promptly if, as in the recent past, fiscal
developments turned out to be disappointing. New fiscal slippages would increase the
burden on monetary policy at a delicate juncture and the risk of triggering a hard landing
scenario. Moreover, breaching the golden rule could involve a severe credibility loss for the
authorities. The authorities remained confident their projections would materialize, noting
that: (i) there were already signs this year that financial sector incomes were recovering
rapidly; and (ii) while revenues had been overprojected during the last three years, they had
been underprojected in the late 1990s, suggesting no systematic bias. In any case, they
remained committed to introducing new measures if needed to meet their fiscal rules with a
sufficient margin.

More importantly, while direct indicators of public services delivery did show some
improvement since 1997, in most cases this improvement had taken place before the
recent spending surge. Survey evidence also suggested a limited improvement in the
population’s satisfaction with public services. The authorities explained these
developments mainly with gestation lags between spending and delivery—but noted that
they would continue to monitor developments closely.

The United Kingdom has also pioneered the use of Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) and
Private Finance Initiatives (PFI). Projects under PPP/PFI aim to involve the private sector in
those public delivery areas where private initiative has a comparative advantage, and are
subject to special accountability and transparency requirements to safeguard the
comprehensiveness of the budgetary process and avoid contingent liabilities. Unlike PPPs,
the PFIs involve risk sharing between the private and public sectors.

D. Assessment of the Five Tests for EMU Entry9
22.
Since the last consultation, in June 2003 the Treasury published its assessment of
the five economic tests for EMU entry and concluded that the case for entry was not yet
established. The UK government decided in 1997 that it would support EMU entry once the
economic case for joining appeared to be “clear and unambiguous” based on five economic
tests to be assessed by Treasury (see text table). The assessment published in June 2003
concluded that only the “financial services test” on whether entry would benefit the financial
services industry, was considered as met.
Two tests (the “investment test” and the

Treasury highlighted that, reflecting differences in the structure of the housing and household
debt markets, the UK economy was subject to idiosyncratic shocks and featured an
idiosyncratic monetary transmission mechanism. Treasury, however, found that there had
been significant progress in meeting the conditions for entry since the 1997 assessment. On
this basis, the government has decided to take steps to facilitate euro-convergence (Box 5),
and to review progress at the time of the budget in 2004.

Box 5. Steps to Facilitate EMU Entry
In addition to adopting the EU harmonized inflation index as monetary policy target, the government
launched two reviews to identify reforms to dampen house price and consumption volatility. While
final conclusions are not due until Spring 2004, the interim reports of the reviews were recently
published:
The Barker Review is focusing on why UK housing supply is price inelastic. The interim report
identifies several contributing factors—such as a stifling planning system and infrastructure barriers,
adverse behavior of the housebuilding industry, and limited incentives for local authorities to build
new houses—and discusses policy options in the areas of taxation, regulation, and subsidies.
The Miles Review is investigating why the share of long-term fixed-rate mortgages is relatively low in
the United Kingdom. Its interim report concludes that the existing bias towards variable-rate
mortgages is not due to institutional impediments or market failure but to poor understanding of risk
and lack of information on the part of consumers. It thus calls for improved awareness initiatives.
The assessment also reiterates the government’s commitment to promote flexibility in labor, product,
and financial markets, which should facilitate meeting the flexibility test, and reviews the ongoing
initiatives in this area. Finally, the government opened a discussion on possible reforms of the fiscal
framework that, after joining EMU, could reinforce the stabilization role of fiscal policy.

23.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ extensive analyses of the economic pros and cons
of EMU entry. These analyses were of very high quality and had helped clarify the issues
and the authorities’ approach to them. The assessment paper and its eighteen background
studies covered in great depth issues such as the benefits from entry arising from increased
trade, the implications of the permanent loss of monetary flexibility, and the short-term costs
of entering when cyclical conditions were different from those of the euro area. It also
stressed that, given the irreversibility of entry, the authorities needed to feel confident that the
case for entry had been established with a sufficient degree of certainty, and that otherwise it
would be appropriate to allow more time to permit a more informed assessment. In that vein,
the reform steps that the government was considering to reduce housing market volatility
were not only consistent with the goal of EMU entry but appropriate in their own merits.
24.
Looking to the next assessment of the five tests, staff suggested that further
attention could be given to some difficult, yet critical, issues. In particular, the recent
assessment had taken the view that the large potential long-term gains from entry (arising
essentially from increased trade) would materialize only if the United Kingdom entered once
a sufficient degree of convergence had been achieved. However, further empirical work
would be helpful in quantifying the effect of insufficient convergence on those long-term
gains. On another plane, while agreeing that further structural reforms to enhance flexibility
were in any case desirable, more could be done to explain the benchmarks by which
flexibility should be regarded to be sufficient (the recent assessment regarded flexibility
insufficient in spite of the progress made since 1997 from an already enviable position).

- 18 -

Finally, more attention could also be paid to evaluating some costs of postponing entry. A
more complete treatment of these issues would strengthen any conclusion reached by the
next assessment.
E. Structural and Financial Sector Issues
25.
The authorities’ approach to ensuring adequate pensions remains centered on a
high and increasing role of private pension schemes as the population ages. Current and
future public pension obligations are modest compared with most other European economies.
This reflects less unfavorable demographics and higher reliance on private pension schemes,
as public pensions are expected to provide only basic pension benefits, and are partly means
tested.10 Official projections indicate that public pension spending will remain stable at about
5–5½ percent of GDP over time, as overall age-related spending needs increase by
3½ percentage points of GDP by 2050. In the same period, the share of pensioners’ income
from private sources is projected to rise from the current 40 percent to 60 percent.
26.
However, the financial (and political) viability of this system depends crucially
on whether people are saving enough for retirement; this is far from clear.11 Over the
past few years, the authorities have enacted several measures with the goal of fostering
private savings through new saving vehicles—e.g., new easy-to-transfer standardized pension
and saving products aimed at low- and middle-income sectors. But some recent
developments have raised concerns. These include indications that pension-related saving,
particularly among low-income sectors is too low; financial difficulties experienced by the
life insurance industry; and significant deficits in some company-sponsored occupational
pension schemes. Staff noted that these developments, if not corrected, may involve sizable
future liabilities for the fiscal accounts (as pressure for widening the benefits provided by the
state would rise, and as more people would qualify for means tested benefits). A proactive
approach was thus required to assess the performance of the current strategy and change
course if needed. In this regard, they welcomed the establishment of an independent Pension
Commission, entrusted with assessing the need for further reforms, including the potential
advantages of strengthening compulsory saving elements in the system.

10

The features and long-term prospects of the pension system are discussed in the Special
Issues Paper, “Aging and the U.K. Pension System.”
11

For example, evidence from the 2002 Green Paper suggests that at present about 3 million
people are seriously under providing for their retirement, while a large group of 5 to
10 million may need to save more or work longer in order to achieve a replacement rate of
66 percent.

- 19 -

27.
Another key structural challenge is raising UK productivity—which lags about
20 percent behind other comparable economies.12

28.
While staff reiterated its support of recent initiatives in these areas, it saw a need
for systematic monitoring and evaluation of ongoing programs. This would allow for the
retirement of unsuccessful initiatives, the extension of successful ones, and a targeted
prioritization over time. The extension of the R&D tax credit to all corporations and the
expansion of training programs reflect good reception by the business community and
positive appraisals by independent evaluations and researchers. But initiatives in this area
have proliferated in recent budgets and the strategy could benefit from a pruning of
programs. Discussions also focused on the institutional setting for promoting competition
which had been substantially reinforced in recent years by expanding the powers and
independence of the Competition Commission and the Office of Fair Trading. The
implementation of the Enterprise Act in June 2003 culminated this phase of reform of the
system, with the emphasis now shifting to ensuring its effective operation.
29.
Programs for further enhancing the already high employment rate may also
need closer monitoring. Both authorities and independent analysts indicated that some of
the active labor market policies concentrated around the New Deal programs, particularly
those targeted at the unemployed aged 18–24, had been successful. Staff welcomed the
announcement in the PBR of plans to enhance this approach for those aged over 24. But the
effectiveness of other New Deal programs aimed at incorporating specific groups into the
labor market was still to be demonstrated. Some of these programs may need stronger job
search incentives.
30.
Overall, the UK financial system has proved resilient to the global slowdown and
is set to benefit from the ongoing recovery in growth and stock markets.

12

This issue was discussed more extensively during the 2002 Article IV consultation; see
IMF Country Report 03/47 (Ch. II).

•
Banks’ profitability and capitalization levels remain high. Going forward, the mix of
risks will evolve with changes in the macroeconomic environment. As the 2002 FSAP
indicated, banks’ portfolios may experience a deterioration as a result of higher interest rates
and significant declines in property prices, given the high levels of household and corporate
indebtedness. However, banks’ high profitability and capitalization levels should allow them
to absorb likely macroeconomic shocks without systemic distress.13 Over the medium term,
the ongoing trend compression of margins owing to increased competition in retail banking
may dampen profitability as credit growth decelerates.
•
The insurance industry has been under considerable stress in recent years. Conditions
have now stabilized and capitalization has improved, including through resort to capital
markets. The sector has also benefited from the rebound in equity markets in 2003. But, as
documented in the FSAP, weaknesses remain—although the authorities indicated that they
affected mostly firms with little systemic impact. The ongoing reform of insurance regulation
by the FSA aims to apply a risk-based framework (now primarily used for banking
supervision) to the insurance industry. When implemented, it will strengthen the sector and
minimize the risks of systemic stress.
•
The authorities have also further strengthened the procedures and institutional
arrangements of the payment and settlement systems with a view to enhancing their
efficiency and minimizing settlement and counterparty risk.
F. Other Issues
31.
The United Kingdom has consistently supported trade liberalization within the
context of EU membership. Staff welcomed the authorities’ intention to press for resuming
negotiations under the Doha round and for further flexibility in the EU on the “Singapore
issues” (investment, competition, government procurement, and trade facilitation) in the
context of the round. The authorities also reiterated their support for CAP reform. They
thought there was room for going beyond the Commission’s proposal in some areas (for
example, they would prefer a higher level of compulsory decoupling for cotton and olive oil,
and a more liberalized regime for sugar with prices closer to world levels). They also
indicated that the UK, after the 10-year transition phase, was ready for the elimination of the
quota regime for textiles and clothing (the “multi-fiber arrangement”), except for some small
businesses. Regarding less developed countries’ access, the United Kingdom was advocating
13

A fall in real estate property prices was among the scenarios explored by the FSAP as part
of its stress testing. The analysis indicated that this scenario had a relatively large loss
potential—particularly if the fall in real estate prices were to coincide with high
unemployment and interest rates. Nevertheless, the FSAP concluded that the potential losses
were unlikely to exceed annual profits or represent a large portion of banks’ capital. More
recently, both the Financial Stability Review of the BoE and the Financial Risk Outlook of
the FSA also highlighted the risks to bank profitability that could arise from this source.

- 21 -

that the European Commission review its Rules of Origin requirements to ensure that the
intended countries would be able to take full advantage of current preferential agreements,
such as the Everything-But-Arms initiative.
32.
The government has continued strengthening the legal framework to combat
money laundering and the financing of terrorism (AML/FT). The anti-money laundering
provisions of the new Proceeds of Crime Act were implemented in February 2003 expanding
AML coverage and reporting obligations—which the authorities are extending further to
accountants, lawyers, and other relevant agents, as recommended by the FATF, through new
AML regulations coming into force on March 1, 2004. This completes the implementation of
the Second EU Money Laundering Directive. The OECD Bribery Working Group considers
that UK legislation addresses the requirements of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention.
33.
The United Kingdom is committed to increase ODA from 0.32 percent of national
income in 2002/03 to 0.4 percent in 2005/06, with the final goal of achieving the United
Nations target of 0.7 percent.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
The UK economy has weathered the global slowdown well, supported by an
appropriately countercyclical monetary policy and an expansionary fiscal stance.
Growth has been resilient relative to other industrial countries, inflation has remained close
to target, and unemployment has been low and stable. Crucial to this performance,
macroeconomic policies have been expansionary without undermining confidence—owing to
well established and transparent monetary and fiscal policy frameworks with a distinct
medium-term orientation. The driving force has been domestic consumption, supported by
continued increases in house prices and household debt. This strong performance also
reflected structural factors, including the flexibility of labor, product, and financial markets
which have been deeply reformed over the last twenty years.
35.
With the external environment improving, and continued strong momentum of
domestic demand, the growth outlook remains favorable. The pace of consumption
continues to be strong, but is expected to moderate during 2004, as the impact of higher
interest rates feeds through, thus making room for the projected strengthening of external
demand. Overall, growth is projected to remain above trend at 3 percent in 2004 before
settling down to potential rates of around 2½ percent.
36.
The main risk to this outlook stems from an abrupt correction in housing and
credit markets. In the immediate future, given its strong momentum, the risks for
consumption and output growth are still on the upside. But, further out, the possibility of a
reversal remains. House price and household debt developments in recent years are
reminiscent of those of the late 1980s, whose reversal contributed to the early 1990s
recession. Admittedly, the overall structural conditions of the UK economy, including its
policy frameworks—albeit untested in a period of major stress—are considerably stronger
than in the early 1990s. But, in the presence of considerable uncertainty on the distribution of

- 22 -

asset and liabilities of households, and on the latter’s exposure to a sharp rise in interest rates
and unemployment, the possibility of a disruptive correction cannot be ruled out. To
minimize these risks, cautious macroeconomic policies are needed.
37.
In the fiscal area, the deficit needs to be kept on a predictable adjustment path.
The deficit has widened rapidly, including in structural terms, in the last three years,
exceeding every year the initial budget projection. Lowering the deficit from the 3½ percent
of GDP projected for 2003/04 is needed to meet the fiscal rules, strengthen fiscal
fundamentals, and support monetary policy during the cyclical upswing. An adjustment of
½ percent of GDP in the structural deficit already in 2004/05, in line with the PBR
projections, would provide a visible signal of change in course. The adjustment in the
structural position should continue in later years, with the goal of lowering the structural
deficit to 1–1½ percent of GDP over the medium term. The upper bound of this range would
stabilize public debt at around 35 percent of GDP, leaving a reasonable margin under the
40 percent of GDP debt ceiling; the lower bound would allow an additional margin to face
future contingent liabilities, including those from population aging, and involve a lower
crowding out of private investment. The automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate
fully around this adjustment path.
38.
But the authorities’ fiscal projections are subject to considerable risks and
additional measures will likely be needed. The PBR projects the deficit to fall along a path
only slightly less ambitious than indicated above in the absence of measures, reflecting a
sharp recovery in revenues. But under staff’s more conservative assumptions, the deficit on
current policies would decline to only 2¾ percent of GDP over the medium term—
1 percentage point above the PBR projections—only a modest adjustment with respect to the
current level, with a gap already emerging in 2004/05. Thus, the authorities should follow
developments closely and take corrective actions promptly, if needed. New fiscal slippages
should be avoided as the risk of breaching the golden rule would not be trivial and as
slippages would involve excessive strain on monetary policy in a delicate cyclical phase.
39.
Moderating the ongoing steep escalation in spending would limit the risk of
inefficiencies and help fiscal consolidation. The authorities have continued strengthening
the expenditure management framework. However, there is not yet enough evidence that
increased spending is producing value for money. A slower spending pace would provide
room for assessing better whether the new procedures set in place to guarantee efficiency are
working. Likewise, a wider resort to user fees for public services would help rationalize
demand and reduce strains on the budget.
40.
Monetary policy should continue to tighten to contain the pace of domestic
demand as the external outlook improves, and facilitate a soft landing scenario. With the
estimated output gap small, recovery momentum building, and the restraining effects of low
import price inflation receding, CPI inflation is set to rise gradually above target. This calls
for raising rates preemptively. The case for tightening is reinforced by the ebullience of the
housing and household debt markets.

- 23 -

41.
An “early but gradual” strategy of rate increases is needed. The increased
sensitivity of the debt servicing burden to base rate changes, the potential vulnerability of a
segment of borrowers to rate hikes, and, more generally, the increased uncertainty on the
response of consumption to interest rate increases call for gradual, and correspondingly early,
increases in rates. Against this backdrop, the November and February rate hikes of 25 bps
were appropriate. Looking ahead, if and as the baseline unfolds, rates should steadily be
raised in small steps.
42.
The MPC’s forward looking approach is well-equipped to deal with the
challenges posed by the change in the inflation target. With CPI inflation running well
below its new target, the change seems to pose a greater challenge for monetary policy in
communicating rate hikes. But, the forward looking-orientation of monetary policy, focused
on inflation forecasts rather than outcomes, is now broadly accepted and provides a strong
basis for explaining the need to raise rates preemptively in a cyclical upswing.
43.
A key challenge is to ensure adequate provision of pensions as the population
ages. The authorities’ approach to facing the challenge of population aging, centered on the
goal of raising the share of pensioners’ incomes from private sources, remains appropriate.
But the viability of this approach depends on whether people are saving enough and
indications are that this may not be the case. This increases the risk that public pension
liabilities may be higher than currently projected. The establishment of a Pension
Commission, in charge of monitoring developments in this area and recommending
corrective actions if needed, is thus appropriate.
44.
The publication of Treasury’s assessment of the five tests for EMU entry is
welcome. It clarifies the government’s position and represents a major analytical contribution
to the debate on this critical decision. The next assessment could benefit from further work
on some difficult issues that are key to the entry decision (such as the long-term implications
of entering before full convergence has been attained, the benchmarks to be used to assess
whether flexibility is sufficient, and some costs of delaying entry). Among the initiatives
launched by the authorities to follow up on the assessment, the reviews of the working of the
housing and household debt markets are particularly timely.
45.
The authorities’ policy agenda to boost productivity and promote employment
properly encompasses a variety of fronts, but should be reassessed regularly. This would
allow streamlining or scrapping ineffective programs. Some active labor market initiatives,
such as the New Deal for 18–24-year olds, have succeeded, partly because they strengthened
job search incentives. Other New Deal programs would benefit from a similar strengthening.
The various ongoing initiatives to boost productivity should also be monitored closely with
the goal of streamlining them as needed.
46.
As reported in the 2002 FSAP, the UK financial supervisory framework is in
many aspects at the forefront internationally and the banking system is sound. Looking
forward, the possibility of a decline in mortgage collateral values deserves special vigilance.
Also, as credit growth decelerates, compressed margins may erode profitability—although

- 24 -

from high levels. The current reform of insurance supervision and regulation will strengthen
the sector and minimize the risk of future systemic stress. Reforms in the settlement and
payment systems have further reinforced their safeguards and efficiency.
47.
The United Kingdom’s strong stand in favor of trade liberalization is
commendable. Efforts to reform CAP, reintroduce momentum in Doha round negotiations,
and increase the effective access of less developed countries to industrial country markets
should be maintained. While the ongoing increase in ODA spending is welcome, the UN
target of 0.7 percent of GDP remains distant.
48.

The further strengthening of the United Kingdom’s AML/FT legislation is welcome.

49.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

On September 16, 1992, the U.K. authorities withdrew the pound sterling from the
exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System and have since maintained a
floating regime. As of January 30, 2004 the exchange rate for sterling was $1.82. In
accordance with UN resolutions and EU restrictive measures, the United Kingdom
applies targeted financial sanctions under legislation relating to Al-Qaeda or Taliban, and
individuals, groups, and organizations associated with terrorism; certain persons
associated with the former Government of Iraq and its state bodies; and on specific assets
of certain persons associated with to important government functions in Myanmar, the
former government of the Republic of Yugoslavia, and Zimbabwe. These restrictions
have been notified to the Fund under Decision 144-(52/51).

APPENDIX III

United Kingdom: Statistical Information
The United Kingdom maintains high standards of economic data provision. The authorities
publish a full range of economic and financial data that is available electronically and have
subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). The UK shifted to ESA95 in
September 1997. While most of the changes related to the introduction of ESA95 have been
implemented, the timetable for the implementation of the reminder of ESA95 extends to
2005. In recent years, the authorities implemented a number of important methodological
changes to the national accounts dataset, most of which were related to the adoption of
ESA95. In 2003 the authorities introduced further revisions reflecting a shift to annual chainlinking, corrections for import fraud, and revisions in some volatile construction data. As a
result of these revisions, the level of GDP was revised upwards, notably during 1999–2000
and the first half of 2003.

APPENDIX IV

United Kingdom: Sustainability Exercise
Fiscal sustainability
The analysis for the United Kingdom, conducted using of the standard template14 shows that
the rise in public debt is unlikely to cause financing difficulties over the next few years,
given that public sector debt starts from a low level and increases only slowly over time.
In the baseline scenario assuming that no policy action is taken, the public debt-to-GDP ratio
grows from about 32¾ percent of GDP in 2003/04 to over 38½ percent of GDP in 2008/09,
given the staff projection that the primary balance remains in deficit during this period
(Table A1).15 This rise in the public debt ratio is unlikely to create debt management, given
that it is relatively slow and from a level that is one of the lowest in the OECD. Nonetheless,
the stabilization of the public debt ratio would eventually require an improvement of the
primary balance, under the assumption that overtime the average interest rate on public debt
will exceed the GDP growth rate.
In the alternative scenarios, the public debt-to-GDP ratio evolves similarly to the baseline.
Only Scenario A1 shows a decline in the debt ratio, mainly reflecting the assumption
(consistent with the historical average) that the primary balance is in surplus. Scenario A3
indicates a slightly larger increase in the debt ratio (to about 39¾ in 2008/09), consistent with
the assumption of lower growth in 2004.
Even in the extreme (bound test) scenarios, the debt ratio stays below 50 percent of GDP in
most cases. Its worst deterioration—to about 50¼ percent in 2008/09—is in the case when
the primary balance is at its historical average minus two standard deviations (Scenario B3).
External sustainability
External debt sustainability does not appear to be an issue in the United Kingdom; the UK
net investment position has remained in the small negative range of 3–5 percent of GDP in
2000–02 and more recently close to balance, partly reflecting large investment abroad by UK
oil companies’ foreign subsidiaries (Table A2). Recent increases in oil prices have prompted
greater earnings from overseas operations, contributing to an improvement in the current
account balance. The level of gross external debt is much higher but this reflects the role of
London as an international financial center (Table A3). The FSAP concluded in February
2003 has also found that the large financial operations associated with the role of London as
international financial center do not pose a systemic risk to the domestic financial system
(Table A3). Table A3 provides a summary set of external and financial vulnerability
indicators as well.

15

See Public Information Notice No. 02/69 and “Assessing Sustainability,” IMF, 5/28/2002.

The debt-to-GDP ratio would also grow over time under the authorities’ projection (to
about 35½ percent of GDP in FY2008/09).

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Concludes 2003 Article IV Consultation with the United Kingdom
On March 3, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the United Kingdom.1
Background
The UK has weathered the global slowdown well. After faltering in the wake of the Iraq war,
economic activity has staged a strong recovery. Real GDP grew by 2.3 percent in 2003, with
quarterly growth rates rising above trend in the second half. The upswing reflects not only
strengthening external conditions but also the continued buoyancy of domestic demand driven
by expansionary monetary and fiscal policies, robust increases in house prices and rising
household debt. The labor market has been resilient through the downturn, with
unemployment at a 30-year low. Inflation, measured by the RPIX remained near its target of
2.5 percent, while CPI inflation has been for some time some 0.6 percentage point below the
new target of 2 percent set in December 2003.
In the first increase in three years, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of
England hiked rates by 25 basis points in November 2003. It then followed through with an
additional 25 basis point increase in February this year, taking the policy rate to 4 percent. In
doing so, the MPC noted the world economic recovery had become more broadly based,
growth in the second half of last year had been above trend and surveys pointed to a pickup in
the pace going forward. Further, household spending and borrowing remained resilient and the
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

housing market strong. Continued growth above trend meant inflationary pressures were likely
to pick up gradually over the next two years. While CPI inflation is currently below the 2
percent target rate, an increase in rates was necessary to keep it on track to meet the new
target in the medium term.
The budget position has swung since 2000/01, from a surplus of 1½ percent to a projected
deficit of 3½ percent of GDP in 2003/04. The weakening reflects not only cyclical factors but
also planned increases in spending to improve public services and unexpected revenue
shortfalls attributable in particular to declines from the financial sector since the global equity
market bubble burst. The fiscal expansion has been consistent with the UK fiscal framework,
based on a golden rule and a sustainable investment rule, because of wide margins
accumulated in the late 1990s. With the cyclical upturn, the recovery in financial market
activity, improvements in tax collection and rising effective tax rates from the fiscal drag, the
deficit is expected to decline, though views differ on the extent to which this will happen in the
absence of policy actions.
The Treasury’s June 2003 assessment of the five tests for EMU entry concluded that the case
for entry was not yet “clear and unambiguous”. In reaching this conclusion, the Treasury
highlighted the differences in structure of the housing and household debt markets between
the UK and the euro area, though there had been significant progress in meeting the
conditions for entry since the initial 1997 assessment. To facilitate convergence with the euro
area, the government has taken several initiatives, including the adoption of an inflation target
formulated in terms of the EU harmonized inflation index and reviews to identify reforms on
both the demand and supply sides of the housing market.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the continued strong performance of the United Kingdom’s economy.
Growth remained resilient in the face of the global slowdown and has picked up well ahead of
most other industrial countries, while inflation remained close to target and unemployment is at
record lows. Directors attributed this robust performance to countercyclical monetary and
expansionary fiscal policies within well established and transparent policy frameworks, and to
structural factors such as high flexibility of labor, product, and financial markets following
decades of reform. Directors, however, noted that the buoyancy of domestic consumption has
also been fuelled by robust increases in house prices and household debt, which has
increased uncertainty on future developments.
Looking ahead, with external conditions improving and domestic demand maintaining its
momentum, Directors expected growth to remain strong. The main risk to this outlook
stemmed from the possibility of an abrupt adjustment in house prices and a consolidation of
household balance sheets, with possibly protracted effects on consumption. Although the
monetary and fiscal frameworks lowered this risk, Directors stressed that the possibility of a
hard landing in house prices and consumption cannot be ruled out, particularly given

-3-

uncertainties about the distribution of household assets and liabilities. To minimize these risks,
prudent macroeconomic policies are needed.
Directors agreed that monetary policy should continue to tighten to facilitate a soft landing
scenario. They stressed that there is a strong case for raising rates preemptively given limited
slack in the economy, the strength of the ongoing recovery, as well as the ebullience of the
housing and household debt markets. They noted that the increased sensitivity of households’
debt servicing burden, and the higher uncertainty on the response of consumption to interest
rate hikes called for an “early but gradual” strategy of rate increases. In this context, they
viewed the November and February rate hikes of 25 basis points as appropriate. Some
Directors noted that the implications for monetary policy of rising asset prices were not clearcut. Directors generally agreed that the recent shift in the inflation target from RPIX to CPI
seems unlikely to have major implications for the conduct of monetary policy, and were reassured that the reason for the change in the inflation target has been well communicated to
the public.
Noting the widening of the fiscal deficit (including in structural terms) over the last three years,
Directors concurred that the fiscal deficit needs to decline in the period ahead in order to
observe the fiscal rules, strengthen fiscal fundamentals, and support monetary policy during
the cyclical upswing. However, many Directors recommended a somewhat larger decline in
the fiscal deficit in the medium term than that projected in the November pre-budget report. In
the view of these Directors, a larger decline in the deficit is important to provide more room for
counter-cyclical fiscal policy and private investment in the future, and to achieve a fiscal
balance more consistent with long-term fiscal requirements. To achieve the recommended
fiscal adjustment, these Directors recommended that new fiscal measures be adopted. They
considered that reliance on cyclical effects and a rebound in revenues from the financial sector
may not be sufficient to achieve the desired decline in the deficit. A number of Directors,
however, considered the pace of fiscal adjustment projected in the pre-budget report to be
appropriate, particularly in view of the low inflation rate and public debt. In any event, Directors
urged the authorities to follow developments closely, especially revenue collections, and to
take any necessary corrective actions promptly.
Directors in general called for moderating the growth of spending in areas where current plans
involve sharp increases. This would limit the risk of inefficiencies and help fiscal consolidation.
In this regard, Directors welcomed the continued strengthening of the expenditure
management framework, including the special transparency and accountability requirement for
public/private partnerships and private finance initiatives to safeguard the comprehensiveness
of the budget process and avoid contingent liabilities. However, they recommended that the
authorities take further measures to ensure that increased spending is delivering value for
money. Moderating the growth rate of spending would allow time to evaluate whether the new
framework is working, and to improve it if needed. Some Directors welcomed recent measures
to broaden the application of user fees in public services, and they suggested that both
efficiency and fiscal adjustment would benefit from further measures in this regard, including in
the health care sector.

Directors agreed that current and future public pension obligations are modest compared with
most other European economies. They viewed the authorities’ strategy on pensions, centered
on increasing the share of pensioners’ income from private sources, as appropriate. However,
Directors observed that the success of this approach is contingent on private saving increasing
enough, and that there are some indications that this has not been the case so far. In this
context, Directors saw risks that public pension liabilities could be higher than currently
projected. Therefore, Directors welcomed the establishment of an independent Pension
Commission, entrusted with assessing the need for further reform, including the potential for
introducing compulsory elements to the pension system.
Directors endorsed the authorities’ agenda for raising productivity in the United Kingdom,
observing that productivity continues to lag behind that in other industrialized countries.
Although they viewed the authorities’ multi-pronged approach as appropriate, Directors saw a
particular need for systematic monitoring and evaluation of ongoing programs in order to allow
for retirement of unsuccessful initiatives, the extension of successful ones, and a targeted
prioritization over time. A few Directors also emphasized the importance of human capital
development.
Directors welcomed the publication of the Treasury’s assessment of the five tests for EMU
entry, noting its contribution to informing the public debate on this important decision.
They also welcomed the initiatives launched by the authorities to follow up on the assessment,
especially the reviews of the demand and supply sides of the housing market. Some Directors
noted that the change in the inflation target moves the UK monetary framework closer to the
EMU framework. Directors considered that the next assessment could be enriched by
elaborating on some difficult issues, such as the long-term implications of joining EMU before
full convergence is achieved and the potential costs of delaying entry. However, some
Directors pointed out that it would be difficult to take a decision on EMU entry based on
technical considerations alone.
Directors concurred with the assessment that the United Kingdom’s system of financial
supervision is sound. They observed that, as reported in the 2002 FSAP, UK banks appear to
be sufficiently profitable and well-capitalized to absorb possible macroeconomic shocks
without systemic distress. Nevertheless, Directors urged the authorities to be vigilant about the
adverse effects of a possible decline in mortgage collateral values. Directors welcomed the
ongoing reform of insurance supervision and regulation and noted that, after several years of
considerable stress, conditions in the sector had stabilized. They also welcomed the
authorities’ ongoing efforts in the area of combating money laundering and terrorism financing.
Directors commended the United Kingdom’s commitment to promoting trade liberalization,
including reforming the Common Agricultural Policy. They encouraged the authorities to
continue to use their position in international institutions to reintroduce momentum in the Doha
round negotiations, and to increase the effective access of the least developed countries to
industrial country markets. Directors welcomed the ongoing increase in official development
assistance and encouraged further efforts to achieve the UN target of 0.7 percent of GNP.

It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with the United Kingdom will be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Public Information Notices (PINs) are issued, (i) at the request of a member country, following the
conclusion of the Article IV consultation for countries seeking to make known the views of the IMF to the
public. This action is intended to strengthen IMF surveillance over the economic policies of member
countries by increasing the transparency of the IMF's assessment of these policies; and (ii) following
policy discussions in the Executive Board at the decision of the Board. The Staff Report for the 2003
Article IV Consultation with the United Kingdom is also available.

Statement by Tom Scholar, Executive Director for the United Kingdom
March 3, 2004

My authorities are most grateful to staff for an interesting and high quality set of papers, and
will take careful note of their comments.
Economic prospects
The economic fundamentals in the UK remain sound: 45 consecutive quarters of growth, the
longest unbroken expansion on record; growth in 20031 of 2.3%; inflation at 1.4%, interest
rates at 4%, and employment at record levels of over 74%. With a strengthening global
economy, growth is forecast (in the 2003 Pre-Budget Report) to be 3% to 3½% in 2004 and
2005; and inflation is expected to remain at, or close to, target. As staff note, there are risks:
my authorities remain vigilant to these and agree with staff on the need for cautious
macroeconomic polices, to which they are fully committed.
Policy framework
My authorities will continue to set policy on the basis of the policy framework established in
1997, and based on the principles of transparency, responsibility and accountability:
•

•

Fiscal policy set according to two fiscal rules:
o the Golden Rule—over the cycle, the Government will borrow only to invest;
o the Sustainable Investment Rule—over the cycle, public sector net debt will
be held at a stable and prudent level, defined as 40% or less;
Monetary policy set by the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to
meet a symmetric inflation target.

As staff note, the inflation target has been recalibrated to 2% on the harmonized consumer
price index definition. My authorities agree that this is unlikely to have material implications
for monetary policy, and are confident that the reasons for, and implications of, the change
have been well communicated and are widely understood in the markets, and more broadly.
The MPC will remain vigilant and forward-looking to ensure that inflation remains at or near
target at all times.
Fiscal policy
Staff recommend a gradual and predictable strengthening of the fiscal position; a slower rate
of growth of public expenditure; and close monitoring of fiscal developments, including
corrective actions if needed.

On 25 February, National Statistics published revised figures for GDP in 2003: these show
annual GDP growth in 2003 of 2.3% (the previous estimate was 2.1%).

-2My authorities note that the fiscal rules are widely understood by markets and others as the
guiding principles of fiscal policy, and have proved very successful in anchoring
expectations. The credibility of this framework is key. My authorities will meet the fiscal
rules, and – building on the platform established since 1997, with public sector net debt
falling from 44% in 1996-97 to 33% in 2003-04 – they will entrench not relax their fiscal
discipline. And they have announced that the rate of spending growth in the next spending
round (this summer) will be lower than in this round.
Fiscal policy will, as usual, be set in the Budget. The latest available projections (in the PreBudget Report) show a gradual reduction in the deficit to 1¾% of GDP; with an average
annual surplus on the current budget of 0.2% over the cycle; and net debt stabilising at 35½%
of GDP. My authorities are thus on track to meet the fiscal rules.
Staff see downside risks to the revenue projections. My authorities are confident about these
projections and note that they are based on deliberately cautious assumptions (e.g. growth at
the lower end of the forecast range, and trend growth 0.25% below the neutral view).
Furthermore, they note that financial sector incomes are recovering rapidly, suggesting a
rebound in tax revenues.
Structural issues
Staff have rightly noted the legacy of under-investment in public services. Public sector net
investment fell by 15% annually in real terms between 1991-92 and 1996-97 leaving the UK
with the lowest level of public investment of any large EU country. To address this, and
recognising the importance of public sector infrastructure for private sector productivity, my
authorities aim to raise public sector net investment to 2¼% of GDP by 2007-08.
The key issue, however, is not the level of spending but the quality of the public services
delivered. My authorities agree with staff on the need to improve efficiency and
effectiveness, and have set out a broad agenda for reform, based on five principles:
• clear, measurable, long-term goals, that focus service providers on the outcomes the
authorities seek to achieve;
• independent audit and inspection (separating responsibility for setting and monitoring
targets);
• maximum local flexibility and discretion to innovate (with additional freedoms and
flexibilities as performance improves);
• transparency (through monitoring and reporting publicly against targets, including
local and national comparisons).
• efficiency (last year an independent review of efficiency in the public sector was
commissioned, and initial work suggests substantial scope for efficiency savings:
allocations in the 2004 spending review will be conditional on this).
With reforms based on these principles, and extra resources being channeled to the best
performers, my authorities are determined to ensure value for money in public services.

-3My authorities agree with staff on the central importance of raising productivity, and have set
out a comprehensive programme of microeconomic reform to remove the barriers that
prevent markets from functioning efficiently. These measures aim to improve competition,
promote enterprise, support science and innovation, raise skills and encourage investment;
and they are regularly monitored and assessed.
On membership of the single currency, my authorities published their assessment of the five
economic tests in June 2003. They concluded that a clear and unambiguous case for UK
membership had not been made and that a decision to join at that time would not be in the
national economic interest. The assessment set out a reform agenda to promote convergence
and flexibility. Next month’s Budget will report on progress on the issues identified, to
determine whether a further assessment of the five tests should be undertaken this year. My
authorities are grateful for the staff’s analysis in the Selected Issues paper, and will study
their comments carefully.
My authorities agree with staff’s overall assessment of the UK financial system.
Other issues
My authorities will continue to support trade liberalization, progress under the Doha round,
and CAP reform. They will increase ODA to 0.4% of GDP in 2005-06, and are committed to
the target of 0.7%. They are seeking international agreement on a doubling of global aid
flows through their proposal for an International Finance Facility.
