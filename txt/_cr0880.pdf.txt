Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2007 Consultation with Germany
Approved by Michael Deppler and G. Russell Kincaid

Executive Summary
Though strengthened by far-reaching reforms, the economy faces a severe test. The
achievements are reflected in strong employment gains, a sound fiscal position, and robust
competitiveness. GDP growth in 2007 was solid at 2.5 percent. However, the moderation of the
global economic cycle has coincided with heightened financial tensions alongside a pause in the
domestic reform process. GDP growth is projected to slow to 1.7 percent in 2008, but the greatly
increased uncertainties impart substantial downside risks. To protect against these risks and to
consolidate the gains achieved, the policy recommendations center on ways to foster a resilient
financial sector, while raising the growth potential and securing fiscal sustainability.
Strengthening the financial sector’s stability and efficiency requires policy attention. The
immediate priorities are preserving the integrity of the financial system and maintaining economic
confidence. However, significant medium-term challenges remain. Bank restructuring consistent with
international financial integration is necessary to ensure that unviable banks do not take excessive
risks. Staff also proposed a bank resolution policy to permit prompt action while maintaining
incentives for prudent management. To increase accountability in banking supervision, the authorities
are working to reduce overlap in responsibilities and improve coordination between BaFin, the
regulator, and Bundesbank. Further corporate governance reforms are needed for capital market and
productivity growth.
Stepping up productivity remains key to sustaining growth. Economic performance in the current
cycle has not yet been evidently stronger than in past upswings. The authorities recognized that
continued buoyant performance will require addressing emerging skills shortages, and they stated
their commitment to continued reduction of red tape and openness to foreign capital. Staff expressed
concern that recent labor market measures, motivated by a concern for fairness, were a step back and
could have adverse effects on employment and growth.
Further efforts are needed to bolster and reinforce commendable gains in fiscal outcomes. Staff
agreed that the authorities’ medium-term fiscal goals are appropriately ambitious but saw a need for
additional measures to achieve these goals. The authorities were not persuaded that new measures
were needed—or feasible—in the short term, but agreed that long-term sustainability would require
attention, especially to further healthcare reform.

Germany, however, faces key challenges, with a growing risk that these may
interact in insidious ways:
•

The rescue of two German banks in the summer of 2007 raised concerns that the
problems may be more widespread. With the international subprime fallout still
ongoing, the drip of bad news has continued, generating appreciable risks to
economic confidence and short-term prospects.

•

These developments come at a time when—despite progress—a sustainable increase
in potential growth has not yet been secured and German consumers remain
ambivalent about future prospects.

•

The hard-won competitiveness gains could be eroded without an impetus to
productivity growth. Wages remain high for unskilled labor and low returns to human
capital contribute to skilled emigration.

Pressing ahead with reforms, therefore, remains crucial. The immediate priorities
are preserving the integrity of the financial system and maintaining economic confidence.
However, significant medium-term challenges remain (Box 1). These include further efforts
to foster employment and growth, while confronting the pressures from global movement of
labor and capital and also achieving regional balance within Germany. This, in turn, will

The prospects for further reforms have
dimmed with no major policy proposals

require a continued reorientation of traditional, corporatist institutions—wage bargaining,
relationship banking, insider-dominated corporate governance, and federal decision making.
Preserving solidarity through shared gains, while accommodating the forces of global
competition, is the overarching challenge.
Box 1. Past Fund Policy Recommendations and Implementation
Following much progress in implementing policies recommended by Directors, the reform
momentum has slowed noticeably:
Foundations for employment and growth. The authorities regard rationalization of programs
under Hartz IV as a priority, but implementation has lagged. There has also been no progress in
reforming employment protection legislation. Despite Directors’ urging to refrain from
introducing minimum wages, a sectoral minimum wage has been instituted for postal workers..
The proposed extension of unemployment benefits for elderly workers also goes against the
Directors’ advice to increase the incentives for work. Initiatives for cutting red tape are, however,
proceeding through the Normenkontrollrat.
Financial sector efficiency. Directors have underscored the importance of an efficient financial
sector. To date, bank restructuring initiatives have been limited, as has been the role of private
capital—which Directors have seen as vital. The authorities are exploring rationalization of
banking supervision. Following the introduction of real estate investment trusts, a push on capital
market development is not imminent; indeed, risks are associated with some proposed measures.
Fiscal consolidation and reforms. Directors have welcomed the authorities’ strong expenditurebased measures for fiscal consolidation and the substantial progress in reducing long-term aging
costs. But they have cautioned that fiscal sustainability will not be assured even if the structural
deficit were to be eliminated by 2010. Accordingly, they have encouraged the authorities to
pursue a broad-based approach, encompassing both fiscal adjustment and growth-enhancing
reforms.

II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

The upswing maintained traction in 2007. From the cyclical trough in 2004, GDP
growth accelerated to 2.9 percent in 2006, the highest rate since unification (except in 2000).
Output grew by 2.5 percent in 2007, with an

Indeed, the labor market has shown signs of tightening with increasing vacancy rates and a
pick up in wage growth (Figure 3). Collective wage agreements imply an average gross wage
increase of about 2 percent in 2008.

A balanced budget is the result of sustained effort. From 4 percent of GDP at the
trough of the cycle in 2004, the general government deficit reached balance in 2007.
Although this adjustment coincided with the upswing, substantial policy effort contributed to
a structural adjustment of about three percent of GDP between 2003 and 2007. Much of this

Inflation has remained moderate despite domestic and global pressures. In the
4.0
first 11 months of 2007, headline inflation was

2.2 percent at an annualized rate, and core inflation 3.5
was 2.0 percent. The sizable VAT hike in January 3.0

the sustainability of the gains achieved. Last summer, IKB (a private bank, but with a onethird ownership by the governmentChanging perspectives on crisis centers

main and longer-term ECB refinancing operations fell below 50 percent from about
55 percent in the first seven months of 2007. However, revelations of further write-downs
have continued and German banks—notably West LB, another state-owned bank—remain
under watch (text table below). Moreover, many banks have not released year-end statements
and further negative surprises seem likely.

Box 2. The Smoothing of the VAT Increase
The smaller-than-anticipated inflation spike following the January 1, 2007 VAT hike
was the consequence of a long announcement period—13 months. Consumers made
advance purchases, and retailers raised prices prior to the VAT-hike implementation. An
econometric analysis of sectoral inflation trends shows that 0.3 percentage point of the
increase in core inflation in 2006 can be attributed to the anticipated VAT hike.1 Advance
price increases were higher for durable goods and commodities with less competitive markets.
Core inflation accelerated already in 2006…

A. Short-Term Outlook

11

Box 3. Germany’s Growth Linkages1
U.S. and European growth
impulses have a significant
bearing on German growth. A
vector autoregression (VAR) of
real GDP growth in the U.S.,
Japan, Germany, the rest of the
euro area, and new EU members
finds that changes in U.S. GDP
growth affect activity in Europe
but not vice versa.2 Growth
impulses from other euro area
countries translate almost one for
one into higher growth in
Germany and the rest of Europe.
Growth spillovers from
Germany were limited in the
past but are more prominent
now. Estimates for the most
recent period (1998-2007)
indicate that a ½ percent increase
of German GDP raises growth in
the rest of the euro area by
¼ percent and by about
½ percent in the new EU
member countries after three
quarters. These effects point to

However, the uncertainties have increased considerably and risks are firmly on
the downside. A sharper-than-anticipated slowdown in the United States would have a
potentially sizeable impact on German growth, all the more so if it undermined confidence.
Strong external production linkages imply significant spillovers from Germany to the rest of
Europe, especially emerging Europe (text figure). Euro appreciation associated with a
disruptive unwinding of global imbalances and, hence, sharply lower world growth would
also amplify the consequences of a strong euro (Box 4). Higher-than-expected oil prices
would act directly and, by dampening sentiments, weaken the consumption recovery; the
oil-price effect, however, would be mitigated if the euro also appreciates.

The negative effects can, however, increase
significantly in a global downturn. Staff estimates
show that a real exchange rate appreciation in
Germany has up to twice the direct effect when the
global output is well below potential. Although such
events have been rare, the risks to global growth raise
the possibility of a more significant negative growth
effect of a euro appreciation.

The authorities are acutely conscious that the greatest uncertainty arises from
the unfolding international financial developments. In this context, they have taken
valuable steps to assess the exposures of German banks. Consistent with their preliminary
conclusion that the exposures are limited and have not impaired capital positions, credit
flows thus far have remained relatively unaffected. Banks came into the crisis well
capitalized and with cyclically strong profits. Moreover, the reliance of German businesses
and households on financial credit is relatively modest and apparently declining (text figure).
However, the authorities recognize that the turmoil has proved to be a moving target and,
hence, the findings from bank examinations and stress tests can become quickly outdated.
Recent indications are that lending standards have tightened, although less than elsewhere in
the euro area. The continuing turbulence could further impact asset valuations and capital
levels—with adverse and cascading consequences for credit availability and growth.

Inflation should slow somewhat, to 2.1 percent in 2008, but the risks are on the
upside. The price increase following the 2007 VAT hike will exert a dampening base effect.
Oil and food price inflation are projected to add an inflationary bias, though the effects are
expected to ease slowly. Higher outcomes from the new wage bargaining create risks of
second-round spillovers, which, however, are likely to be mitigated by slower growth.
B. Competitiveness
14.
Germany’s competitiveness is adequate, with some evidence of a modest
undervaluation. This conclusion, which the authorities broadly agreed with, is based on
several considerations:
•

The current account surplus is largely structural and is expected to contract in
the medium term. Despite strong investment trends, the current account surplus
widened to an estimated 5.6 percent of GDP in 2007 (Tables 1 and 2). The surplus
was, however, boosted by temporary factors, in particular, the increase in the VAT
rate that increased private and public savings. Stripping out these and other temporary
factors from long-term trends, staff’s estimate of the current underlying surplus is
about 4¼ percent of GDP.

•

For Germany, the CGER exercise estimates a medium-term current account
norm (reflecting long-term trends in a multilateral setting) of 3.3 percent of
GDP. This norm is higher than that of other major European countries, reflecting
mainly savings for old age and European financial integration that generates capital
flows from Germany to the less advanced European economies. The authorities’
estimates show that about half of Germany’s current account surplus derives from
within the euro area, with a surplus on the trade account, reflecting competitive
strength in manufactured goods, and a deficit on the services account.

•

According to CGER estimates, the real exchange rate is close to equilibrium.
These estimates show that the valuation of the real effective exchange rate (REER) to
range from 3 percent overvaluation (equilibrium real exchange rate approach) to a
10 percent undervaluation relative to equilibrium (external sustainability approach,
see text table), with large standard errors. The mid-point of the range—suggesting a
3-5 percent undervaluation—is normally considered a reasonable benchmark and also
coincides with the estimate from the macroeconomic balance approach.

•

The implication is that the depreciation during the late 1990s and early this
decade has mainly corrected the overvaluation of the mid-1990s. As that
overvaluation declined, Germany gained market shares; these shares have now begun
to stabilize. The authorities emphasized the uncertainties in measuring equilibrium
exchange rates. Their favored approach—treating the average over the past three
decades as the “equilibrium”—also finds a small undervaluation.

C. Medium-Term Outlook

Labor productivity growth 2000-2006

15.
Growth is projected to slow to the potential rate of 1¾ percent annually, unless
measures are taken to step up total factor productivity growth. The strength of the
current upswing has not clearly surpassed previous ones (although it is notable in its unusual
composition—buoyant investment and lagging consumption) (Figure 7). The output gap,
created following the poor performance earlier in the decade, is just about closed. Looking
ahead, productivity growth—crucial to maintaining the growth momentum—is difficult to
predict, but recent trends are not comforting. Labor

IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
16.
Against the background of short-term uncertainties and medium-term
challenges, the discussions focused on:
•

strengthening employment and growth;

•

safeguarding financial stability and reforming the financial sector; and

•

consolidating fiscal progress to deal with near-term uncertainties and aging pressures.

17.
The authorities were cautious about the likely pace of further reforms. They
emphasized that recent policy measures had entailed sacrifices, generating a demand for
“dividends.” Staff cautioned against policy reversals and suggested that an appropriate
balance was possible between efficiency and inclusiveness—to support growth, equity, and
stability. Fairness is better achieved by continuing in the spirit of the Hartz IV reforms to

18
focus on people rather than on specific labor market outcomes. Also, while maintaining their
commitment to the Soziale Marktwirtschaft (social market economy), the authorities had
allowed more options outside the framework of traditional institutions. Both sides agreed that
striving for this balance would continue to prove fruitful.
A. Strengthening Employment and Productivity
18.
Skills shortages need to be addressed. With a stronger labor market, a paradoxical
phenomenon has emerged. While vacancies have increased, especially in skilled occupations,
the inflow of immigrants to fill these positions has remained subdued, and highly trained
Germans have chosen to seek employment elsewhere in Europe (Figure 10). The reasons for
German emigration are complex and often specific to particular professions, but include a
search for lower tax rates, higher returns to expertise, and more robust economic
opportunities. These shortages are expected to increase rapidly with aging. The authorities
agreed that a two-pronged strategy is necessary: invigorating education and training, and
encouraging skilled immigration (Box 5). Immigration is politically sensitive, but restrictions
for engineers from the new member states have been relaxed.

19

Box 5. Alleviating Shortages of Skilled Labor1
A dynamic general equilibrium model was used to simulate the long-term effects of
increasing the labor force by 100, 000 persons a year (a 0.3 percentage point increase).
The model incorporates demographics, life-cycle earnings, and savings dynamics. Skilled
labor can be increased through domestic measures (such as retraining) or by increasing
immigration. The two experiments lead to similar consequences for growth, but increased
immigration also increases the size of the population and mitigates the aging problem; hence
the focus on the latter scenario here.
This annual increase in immigration of 100,000 adults compared with the baseline could
raise real GDP by 0.2 percentage point a year. With more adults joining the workforce,
investment and capital stock would rise. A virtuous cycle of increases in income and
consumption would then follow. The current account would deteriorate initially, but improve
later as individuals start saving for retirement and older cohorts become more numerous.

Staff cautioned that the remarkable turnaround on the labor market was
jeopardized by a misplaced focus on minimum wages to pursue social objectives. The
authorities viewed the minimum wage for postal workers and extended unemployment
benefits for the elderly as measures to achieve “fairness.” Staff cautioned that wage floors
were not an efficient instrument for social goals. The minimum wage for postal workers was
already having unintended consequences: with competitors unable to match these wages,
competition in postal services could be undermined. Additional sectoral minimum wages
would raise the costs of, and reduce the demand for, low-skilled labor, especially in regions
with endemic unemployment. Also, extension of the unemployment benefit period for older
workers could open more such demands and signal a weakening commitment to improving
incentives for work.

Perspectives on other labor market initiatives converged more. Staff supported
the authorities’ intent to rationalize job training and placement programs and urged more
vigorous implementation. Staff also noted that the proposed child care programs will help
increase the participation of women in the labor force, although care will be needed to keep
them well targeted.
21.
The authorities agreed that a broad range of measures are needed to boost the
investment climate. They reported progress in the efforts of the national Normenkontrollrat
as part of the government’s program to reduce red tape and simplify regulations. They
recognized that reducing the corporate tax rate (which remains one of the highest in Europe)
and tax wedge on labor would eventually be desirable, but noted that, following the measures

recently undertaken, a further fiscally responsible
reduction in capital and labor taxes was not feasible
in the short run. They were clear that any
amendments to the Foreign Trade and Payments Act
would be undertaken in a manner that preserves
Germany’s long-standing reputation for openness to
foreign capital. Staff also noted that a financial
sector that efficiently finances innovation can
complement the high patent rates to spur growth
while also improving economic welfare by allowing
greater consumption smoothing than recently
achieved (text figure).

B. Financial Sector Stability and Efficiency
22.
The ongoing turbulence has served as a wake-up call. Despite the progress
achieved, long-standing concerns about the relatively low profitability of the still-fragmented
banking system have—by creating incentives for excessive risk taking—intersected with new
concerns about financial stability (Tables 3 and 4).2 The size of the capital market and its
ability to enhance efficient allocation of resources and improve consumption smoothing
leave room for considerable progress.
23.
Against this background, the mission held extensive discussions on financial
sector issues, with emphasis on:
•

banking sector restructuring;

•

crisis prevention and management;

•

supervision; and

•

continued strengthening of capital markets.

Banking sector restructuring
24.
Both sides were concerned that, absent further banking sector restructuring,
systemic and fiscal risks could rise. In line with international trends, the number of banks
has fallen sharply in recent years and the number of employees per bank has increased
(Table 5 and text table). The sector’s fragmentation contributes to low interest rate margins
and still modest income from nonbanking services (Figure 11). Banks unable to generate
adequate profits are likely to take on greater risks. The recent turbulence has again raised the
2

See Germany: Selected Issues, IMF Country Report No. 06/436.

22
question of whether many banks, especially the Landesbanken, have viable business models.
Although the banking and financial system faces major challenges, the authorities stressed
that it had nonetheless proved to be stable and functionally viable, even in a clearly stressful
operational setting. They recognized, however, that the domestic banking system could come
under further pressure with the globalization of finance and the framework set by European
competition policies. Besides creating wider systemic concerns—as it briefly did this past
summer—staff noted that the fragility also generates contingent fiscal liabilities, which can
turn only too real as in the case of the State of Saxony, Sachsen LB’s owner.

However, views differed on how to achieve further restructuring. Staff
supported a market-based process of takeovers and exits, cautioning that the current ad hoc
approach to public mergers may not achieve viable business models. Policy measures must,
therefore, ensure that market forces and private capital can play their legitimate role. The
authorities saw scope for restructuring through consolidation mainly within “pillars” in the
three-pillar system of private, state-owned, and cooperative banks. Indeed, some of the
stronger Landesbanken have forged deeper vertical links with the local Sparkassen (savings
banks) and, as such, are thought to be viable. But staff argued that these vertically integrated
but regionally oriented banks may not offer a long-term solution. Policy commitment to such
vertical, state-based silos could prove unsustainable and pressure for market-based
restructuring will continue to increase in an era of global finance and the European
Commission’s initiatives to create a framework for integrating retail financial markets in the
context of its financial services policy. The authorities recognized that breaking the regional
restrictions for the Sparkassen may be needed. However, given the rights of the Länder, the
federal authorities noted their constraints in influencing the process. Staff nevertheless sees a
role for the federal authorities in pushing the reform agenda and cautioned that interim
measures (for example, vertical integration within the public pillars) could have unintended
consequences that close future restructuring option

23

26.
The authorities regarded the developments at Sachsen LB and IKB as
unforeseeable “tail events.” While staff was concerned about gaps in the Germany
supervisory system, and the authorities did recognize gaps that needed to be addressed, they
nevertheless stressed that the problems at the two banks that needed to be rescued were the
consequence of failures in mortgage origination in the United States and an internationally
accepted rating methodology. The unusual nature of the banks’ off-balance-sheet activities
and the liquidity commitments to their conduits were, at least in broad terms, known to the
Bundesbank and Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin), but were not
viewed as alarming at the time. As elsewhere, the risk that the commercial paper market
could freeze up was not recognized.
27.
They agreed, however, that more transparency was needed. Looking ahead, staff
recommended that supervisors should require banks to file financial statements on a quarterly
basis and encourage a more widespread use of IFRS reporting (which mandates
consolidation of group activities). The authorities agreed that regular stress tests, which were
sensitive to the newly revealed vulnerabilities, were needed. They noted that the SarkozyMerkel-Brown initiative and the Ecofin decisions will likely establish further norms for
enhancing transparency and other arrangements for financial stability.
28.
Staff argued for a bank resolution framework with better incentives for
prudent operations. As the two German banks felt the full force of the U.S. subprime crisis,
rapid action by the authorities helped preserve confidence in the system. Nevertheless,
broader questions about Germany’s resolution policy remain. The authorities noted that
measures to contain the damage from potential bank failures sought to balance the need for
quick action with maintaining incentives for prudent behavior by bank managers and owners.
The authorities explained that, in the case of IKB, private shareholders stakes had not been
diluted, in part because the process would have entailed considerable delays under the
corporate insolvency procedures. Staff recommended that the German insolvency framework
should recognize the role of banks in the payment system and the macro economy and
incorporate greater flexibility to allow for quick resolutions and dilution of the equity claims
of all shareholders.
Supervision
29.
Prompted by recent events, the authorities are reviewing ways to improve
coordination between BaFin and Bundesbank. BaFin is the consolidated financial sector
supervisor, similar to that found in some other countries. Enforcement actions can only be
taken by BaFin based on its sole determination of the circumstances at a bank. Under the
law, the Bundesbank performs on-site and off-site monitoring of banks under the guiding
principles issued by BaFin in agreement with the Bundesbank. BaFin can accompany
Bundesbank staff and can also commission auditors to perform special audits. These
overlapping mandates have been viewed by banks as unnecessarily duplicative. More

24
important, the coordination problem inherent in the existing structure weakens accountability
and risks poor decisions and delays in problem situations. The Finance Minister has called on
BaFin and the Bundesbank to revise the above-mentioned guiding principles.
30.
Though agreeing that enhanced supervisory accountability should be a
principal objective, the authorities were not persuaded by staff’s structural suggestions.
Staff recommended that accountability would be increased by consolidating supervision of
banks in one of the two agencies. The supervising agency should also have enforcement
powers to lower a bank’s risk profile, recognizing that the ultimate step of closing a bank
could require a joint decision involving the Ministry of Finance. Thus, if the Bundesbank
were to supervise, BaFin would retain its regulatory role, but not its enforcement powers. If
accountability were better achieved by consolidating supervision under BaFin, the
Bundesbank would still need full access to information on systemically important banks and
on other banks as needed, given its financial stability and lender-of-last-resort
responsibilities. The authorities were not persuaded that such a consolidation of supervision
was practical. Giving the Bundesbank additional authority would, they felt, dilute the BaFin
model of integrated supervision. And BaFin could not in the near term take on the full task of
supervision, especially given the need to attract skilled supervisors at premium wages. Staff
conceded that even a partial streamlining of the current arrangement could improve
accountability but remained concerned that coordination problems would continue.
31.
Under any arrangement, the urgent need for upgrading supervisory capability
is evident. IFRS and Basel II should help deal with evolving issues of greater transparency
and liquidity risks, but new challenges will also arise. The Capital Requirements Directive
(CRD) will fully introduce Basel II in Europe from 2008. Pillar 2 of Basel II requires a more
integrated approach to risk management, and pillar 3 fosters further disclosure.
Implementation will require establishing new norms, including on the extent and frequency
of disclosure (especially of complex financial products), management of liquidity through
access to adequate contingent funds, and increased emphasis on the use of risk models and
management. With the growing sophistication of financial markets and the complexities
introduced by Basel II, the authorities agreed that the reliance on external auditors must
decline with stepped-up efforts to attract and retain skilled supervisors. The same skills will
be demanded by banks. The 9 percent add-on to civil service salaries available to the
Bundesbank’s staff, flexible contracts that offer targeting of specialized skills, and training
programs are the authorities’ means to deal with these challenges.
Capital markets
32.
Despite steps taken to strengthen capital markets, these remain
underdeveloped and not widely used for investment by firms and households.
Traditionally, Germany has had a significant public bond market. The stock market, though
still small, has made strides helped by regulatory easing, with greater liquidity and more new
capital raised (Figure 12). Yet the equity market is dominated by relatively few firms and the

the recent market turmoil, Pfandbrief credit spreads traded below benchmark yield curves,
whereas other covered bond spreads widened by up to 50 basis points.

widely viewed as cumbersome, if not ineffective. Recent studies point to the crucial
importance of efficiently functioning boards for value maximization and productivity growth.
The authorities noted that several supranational companies (text table below), responding to
global pressures, had exercised the option of operating either under a one-tier board or
smaller board sizes permitted under the 2004 law governing the Societas Europea (the
European Company Law) and such an option could be extended to a wider range of
companies.3 Second, continued ownership concentration, albeit declining, creates the risk of

self dealing—diversion of assets by insiders at the cost of minority shareholders. While selfdealing transactions need to be declared in an annual report, staff suggested that the current
practice of limiting the availability of this report to the supervisory board should be changed
and the report distributed to all shareholders to strengthen internal control. The authorities
were concerned that lengthy court proceedings related to self-dealing could undermine
shareholder rights. Finally, while they agreed that activity in the takeover market remained
sluggish, they were less concerned than staff about management’s scope for defensive
measures.

New governance initiatives carry risks. Staff expressed concern that the draft Risk
Limitation Law may create legal uncertainties and stifle legitimate shareholder opposition to
management. The authorities agreed on the need to ensure a level playing field, and intend to
clarify the draft in this respect. The authorities were aware of views that the draft Law on
Modernizing the Framework for Venture Capital and Private Equity could have been
stronger, to establish a unified legal and regulatory framework for this important industry.
They pointed to the need of targeting the law at those activities that truly merit tax relief.
Staff acknowledged that a more far-reaching law would result in higher revenue losses,
another reason for continued expenditure moderation to accommodate such initiatives. Staff
also cautioned against the proposal to introduce profit sharing, which, though consistent with
the authorities’ objective of Soziale Marktwirtschaft, could further complicate corporate
governance. Such arrangements might be best undertaken on a voluntary basis rather than
through legislation.
C. Strengthening Public Finances

35.
After absorbing the costs of two tax reforms in 2008, the authorities plan to
achieve a structural surplus of ½ percent of GDP by 2011. Following structural balance in
2007, the current year’s budget is projecting a deficit of more than ½ percent of GDP. The
deterioration is primarily due to two tax measures: a corporate income tax reform (0.3
percent of GDP) and a reduction of the unemployment insurance rate from 4.2 to 3.3
percentage points of personal income (0.2 percent of GDP). Healthcare reform and research
and development subsidies will increase spending by 0.1 percent of GDP. Moving forward,

27
in their latest Stability Program, the authorities have set the medium-term target of a
structural surplus of ½ percent and a primary surplus of 3½ percent of GDP. Achieving this
objective would aid long-term sustainability; in fact, the present discounted value of
government’s net worth would be almost balanced assuming that such adjustment is
maintained and, importantly, that the authorities’ estimates of aging costs hold (text table
balance sheet).

The slippage in 2008 is regrettable and achieving the appropriately ambitious

particular, corporate taxes tend to increase on the upswing, but can decrease dramatically
during a downturn. As such, the downside risks to growth create a corresponding risk to
fiscal outcomes, even in structural terms.

Staff therefore proposed that additional measures be taken to create a
37.
precautionary buffer. Since delays in achieving the primary balance target have longlasting implications, identifying and implementing subsidy-cutting measures and
rationalization of tax expenditures remain important tasks—also to create the room for
reducing tax rates in a responsible manner. Although the Stability Program identifies
potential savings from a wide range of measures, the authorities felt that the likelihood of
their implementation was low, given the current “reform fatigue.” If, however, the risks to
the fiscal position did materialize, there could be more appetite for these measures.

38.
Securing a sound fiscal position today will protect against the risk that
healthcare costs have been underestimated. While pension reforms have helped greatly,
the authorities recognize that the costs from healthcare will pose an increasing burden. Since
the trajectory of the public debt-to-GDP ratio is very sensitive to long-term assumptions (text
table4 and Figure 15), higher rates of cost increase implying rapid debt accumulation. Staff
was concerned that the authorities’ forecast of a rise in healthcare costs of 1.2 percentage
points of GDP over the next 45 years may be too low. Other estimates show increases of up
to 5.6 percent of GDP (for example, the IFO Institute), while staff considers a 3.0 percent of
GDP increase as highly likely, given past cost dynamics, the structure of age-related benefits,
and the costs of new treatments. The authorities plan to review their estimates in the context
of the 2008 long-term sustainability report.

39.
Several options to deal with aging costs were discussed. Staff proposed that a
more automatic tie between the retirement age and population longevity would contain the
growth of pension outlays under the first pillar. Also, the second pension pillar, linked to the
individuals’ employment, limits the employees’ risk diversification and serves implicitly to
subsidize the employer. Hence, more options to place employee savings into financial
instruments, as in the third pillar, would help. Addressing the greater challenge of escalating
healthcare costs, the authorities noted, would require stronger incentives for cost savings by
insurers. This would require revisiting the arrangements through which insurers are
reimbursed by the Health Fund. They also recognized that, while ensuring basic health
coverage for all, the private burden for traditionally publicly financed services would have to
continue to rise to ensure the sustainability of the social security system.
40.
Past breaches of the Maastricht budget deficit criteria and enforcement
problems with the existing fiscal rule have led to a review of the fiscal framework. The
existing “golden rule” requires that borrowing at the central government level not exceed
gross investment. With reduced public investment needs, the rule implies a close-to-balance
budget, leaving little room for automatic stabilizers; it has lost credibility since an escape
clause (declaration of macroeconomic disequilibrium) was repeatedly invoked. The
authorities have proposed a new fiscal rule, which calls for a (close to) structurally-balanced
budget for the central government and states every year but with some room for the operation
of automatic stabilizers. Staff agreed that the new rule would be better aligned with the

30
Stability and Growth Pact and would serve to anchor and improve incentives for fiscal selfdiscipline. Staff recommended, in addition, that the rule should require further belt tightening
when necessary for long-run sustainability. Moreover, the effectiveness of the rule will
depend on how the discretion is used—or abused. Imparting greater transparency remains
crucial. In this regard, staff welcomed the authorities’ effort to embed more systematic
program evaluation into fiscal decisions (for example, assessment of tax expenditures, as
presented in the Stability Program) but also called for standardized fiscal reporting at all
levels of government.
41.
Reform of fiscal federalism is also needed. The medium-term fiscal targets are
based on the assumption of budget surpluses at the subnational level. Ensuring this goal
requires increased fiscal efficiency at the subnational level, necessary also to control subnational debt and prevent budget crises. The authorities and staff shared the diagnosis. The
current system, based on the cooperative principle of uniform spending standards, is
inefficient and is also not achieving the authorities’ goal of greater equality across states
(Box 6). Spending is financed by horizontal transfers across the Länder (primarily from
shared taxes with the federal government), together with vertical transfers from the federal
government. Most Länder have few incentives to manage their public finances efficiently,
given the rigidity in spending, the limited authority over tax policy, and a de facto bailout
guarantee. The system encourages unproductive tax competition through Länder tax
administration decisions. The arrangement is under stress, with the surplus Länder
disinclined to subsidize those with deficits.
42.
But the politics for achieving the needed reforms is unfavorable. Greater Länder
tax autonomy (for example, by allowing them to set personal income tax rate surcharges
within defined bands), along with centralization of tax administration, could help establish
greater accountability at the subnational level. As international experience shows, tax
autonomy and clarification of obligations at different levels of government would also
improve effectiveness of local service delivery while maintaining the objectives set within a
cooperative framework. Finally, timely and consistent data on Länder finances, including on
subnational debt, are needed for transparency and monitoring of general government
finances. The difficulty is that each measure, taken in isolation, faces considerable opposition
from a number of states. A package of measures in line with other countries’ experiences
may help achieve the necessary compromises to move ahead on the broad agenda.

V. STAFF APPRAISAL

43.
Bold reforms have strengthened the German economy. From the economic
doldrums early in the decade, Germany has made valuable gains. These include strong GDP
growth, substantial employment gains, an impressive increase in the share of longer-term
jobs with social security benefits, and fiscal position in the best shape since unification.
Wage moderation helped competitiveness, in turn, allowing firms to profit from the global
upswing. With the improved competitiveness, the real exchange rate is estimated to be close
to equilibrium, with some evidence of a modest undervaluation.
44.
The economy has so far withstood the financial turmoil—but downside risks
are substantial. Strong cyclical bank profitability before the turbulence and the low reliance
of enterprises and households on credit have helped maintain normalcy in lending. Writedowns have continued as assets have had to be revalued, but systemically important banks
have dealt with these without impairing their core capital. However, the tightening lending
standards and the deepening turbulence raise the risk of a cascading decline in lending and
growth.
45.
To protect against the unfolding risks and build on the hard-won gains, the
outstanding challenges must be tackled. The authorities have stepped up their assessment
of bank exposures to credit and liquidity risks, a vigilance that must continue in view of the
yet unknown dimensions and fast-moving nature of the current turmoil. A significant
unfinished policy agenda remains—in labor markets, the general investment climate,
financial sector stability and efficiency, and fiscal policy. Persevering with this agenda holds
the enticing promise of substantial improvements in living standards for all. This goal can be
met by fostering efficiency and growth, while enhancing the sustainability of the Soziale
Marktwirtschaft (social market economy).
46.
A pause in the broader reform process would be unfortunate, and reversals
risk undermining the gains achieved. In the second half of the electoral cycle, the next
generation of reforms will no doubt confront difficult political challenges and pressures for a
front-loaded sharing of the “reform dividend.” However, economic performance in the
current cycle has not yet been evidently stronger than in past upswings. Moreover, the recent
strength has been aided by an unusually long and strong global cycle. As such, continuation
of the buoyant performance is far from assured.
47.
Enhancing Germany’s growth potential and resilience requires interrelated
measures. To alleviate skills shortages, a two-pronged strategy is necessary: invigorating
education and training, and encouraging skilled immigration. Sectoral minimum wages will
not serve the goal of fairness and risk distorting competition; and diluting work incentives
could hurt the progress of Hartz IV. Instead, more vigor in rationalizing active labor market
and placement assistance programs and enhanced child care availability for women to
participate in the labor force would strengthen the labor market. Finally, the investment

33
climate would be strengthened by continued reduction of red tape, a reduction of taxes on
capital and labor (offset by expenditure reductions), and preserving Germany’s reputation for
openness to foreign capital.
48.
Policy on banking sector restructuring should be mindful of, and consistent
with, the forces of international financial integration. The recent events highlighted the
concern that the fragmented banking structure generates only modest profits and, therefore,
creates incentives that risk destabilizing the system. Measures to foster bank restructuring
should be guided by the goal of creating robust and sustainable banks, while allowing private
capital to play its role. As global competition intensifies, eroding the traditional businesses of
banks that only serve targeted communities, their market share will likely continue to
diminish and the structure of German banking will evolve. While such localized services are
important, these banks should operate in response to market demand. Where political
compromises are made, these should not be at the cost of constraining future options.
49.
Greater transparency and stronger incentives for prudent action will support
crisis prevention and management. The bank resolution framework should allow for quick
resolution but improve management incentives by allowing for dilution of private
shareholders’ equity. Supervisors should require more frequent financial statements and
encourage more widespread use of IFRS reporting to better capture off-balance-sheet
activity.
50.
Structural and coordination improvements are needed for enhancing
supervisory accountability. Consolidation of bank supervision and prudential enforcement
in either the Bundesbank or BaFin would increase accountability. Regulation will need to
stay with BaFin to maintain its role as a consolidated supervisory agency and, under any
supervisory arrangement, the Bundesbank would need all necessary information to fulfill its
financial stability and lender-of-last-resort responsibilities. Effective implementation of
Basel II will require reduced reliance on external auditors and stepped-up efforts to attract
and retain skilled supervisors.
51.
The further development of capital markets will be aided by creating
additional options for, and greater transparency in, corporate governance. Such steps
that hold the promise of raising economic productivity. In particular, the large size of the
supervisory boards slows decisions. The option available to some German companies for
rationalizing their boards under the Societas Europea rules could be more widely extended.
Internal and external discipline can also be fostered through further improvements in
disclosure standards, especially on board members’ financial dealings, and by lowering
barriers to takeovers. A number of new initiatives in the pipeline carry risks of further
strengthening insiders or rendering governance more complex.
52.
Building on their significant recent achievements, achieving fiscal sustainability
is within reach—and the ingredients for doing so are clear. Although the fiscal situation

34
is expected to deteriorate mildly in 2008, the incremental gains from measures already taken
should help continued consolidation. Additional measures now will help mitigate the shortterm risks, especially those from an asymmetric decrease in revenues were growth to decline
sharply. Because short-term slippages accumulate, precautionary belt tightening will also aid
long-term sustainability. In that regard, tackling healthcare expenditures is the priority. The
authorities’ move to a fiscal rule that achieves close to structural balance is in the right
direction, but the rule should also allow for additional measures for preserving long-term
sustainability. The second round of fiscal federalism reforms offers the opportunity for a
significant increase in efficiency and mitigation of fiscal risks. A package of measures that
includes centralized tax administration but increased Länder autonomy on tax policy would
create better incentives for fiscal management.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:

Germany’s currency is the euro, which floats freely and independently against other
currencies.
Germany is an Article VIII member and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on
payments and transfers for current international transactions. It maintains measures adopted
for security reasons, which have been notified to the Fund for approval in accordance with
the procedures of Decision 144 (EBD/08/5, January 16, 2008)and does so solely for the
preservation of national or international security.
VIII.

Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT)

The authorities have moved towards a more risk-based approach, in which the intensity of
audits and inspections should reflect institutions' AML/CFT risk. A dialogue with the
associations of certified public accountants and other auditors has led to a revised AML/CFT
assessment methodology in 2005. Legal revisions also granted the BaFin the power to freeze
funds without a court order or other involvement of prosecution authorities if facts suggest
that funds serve the purpose of terrorist financing. BaFin can now also require financial
holding groups and financial conglomerates to develop a coordinated risk management
approach for the whole group.

APPENDIX II. Germany: Statistical Issues

Germany’s economic and financial statistics are adequate for surveillance purposes.
Germany has a full range of statistical publications and subscribes to the Fund’s Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS). The authorities make substantial use of the Internet to
facilitate on-line access to data and press information.
Germany adopted the European System of Integrated Economic Accounts 1995 (ESA95)
in 1999. The 2005 ROSC Data Module mission found that the macroeconomic statistics
generally follow internationally accepted standards and guidelines on concepts and
definitions, scope, classification and sectorization, and basis for recording. However, the
sources for estimating value added for a few categories of service industries could be
improved. A direct source for quarterly changes in inventories, which is an important
contributor to short-term deviation in the trend GDP growth rate, is lacking. There is no
systematic, proactive process to monitor the ongoing representativeness of the samples of
local units and products between rebases of the producer price index.
Comprehensive data reporting systems support the accuracy and reliability of the
government finance and balance of payments statistics. However, although explanatory
documentation exists, the lack of a table bridging the general government data in the ESA95
classification and the general government cash data on an administrative basis is impairing
fiscal analysis; Germany publishes general government revenue, expenditure, and balance on
an accrual basis every six months (ESA95). Monthly data are only disseminated on a cashbasis.
Germany is participating in the Coordinated Compilation Exercise for financial soundness
indicators (FSIs). In 2006, as part of this exercise, the German authorities compiled a
comprehensive set of FSI data and metadata.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
GERMANY
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the European Department
(In consultation with the Policy Development and Review Department)
Approved by Michael Deppler and Adnan Mazarei
February 20, 2008
This supplement provides an update on economic developments and prospects in Germany.
With clearer evidence of weakening in the fourth quarter of 2007 and downward revision of
global growth prospects, staff now forecasts German growth in 2008 at 1.5 percent, slightly
below the projection in the staff report. The fiscal deficit is projected to rise correspondingly.
Further write-downs have been reported at German banks and public sector financial
commitments to capital injection have continued to increase. BaFin and the Bundesbank
have reached a tentative agreement on coordinating supervision, but one that is not
sufficiently far-reaching. The new information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.
Staff projects a deceleration of GDP growth to 1½ percent in 2008 (Table 1). The
growth projection for 2008 has been marked down from 1.7 to 1.5 percent, reflecting slower
projected growth in the U.S. and Europe. Also, in line with view that the global environment
will begin to improve in the later part of 2008, a modest upturn to 1.6 percent is projected for
2009.
2.
At this point, staff considers the risks to the forecast to be still tilted to the
downside, albeit modestly. While the revised forecast incorporates much of the downside
risk embedded in the previous baseline, the tensions in the international financial system
remain elevated (Figure 1). While the spreads on the inter-bank lending rates have moderated
since the large liquidity injection by the ECB, the stress has shifted to credit markets,
reflected in the credit default spreads. In particular, there have been continued disclosures of
write-downs and losses by banks (as reported below). While larger banks have also been
affected, the core of the problem continues to persist with some mid-sized banks. Recent
news does not indicate if these financial developments have had implications for real growth
over and above the tightening credit standards reported in the staff report. The greater risk, as
the preliminary fourth quarter estimates warn, is a loss of consumer confidence (Figure 2).

2

3.
The 2008 fiscal deficit is now expected to be slightly larger than originally
projected. With the revised GDP projections and assuming that automatic stabilizers are
allowed to operate, staff now projects the overall deficit of the general government to reach
0.7 percent of GDP in 2008. The staff report had projected a shift from a balanced budget for
the general government last year to an overall deficit of 0.6 percent of GDP this year, largely
reflecting reductions in the corporate tax rate and the contributions towards unemployment
insurance.
4.
Further write-downs have been reported at German banks, resulting in
increased public financial support. Additional write-downs have been reported at a number
of banks, including West LB, IKB, Bayerische LB, and Commerzbank. This has added to the
call on public money to support the public sector banks and at IKB (which though technically
a private bank has KfW, a state-owned financial institution, as its principal shareholder).
With the new developments, the cumulative support, including by KfW, implies a significant
governmental commitment (exceeding €11.75 billion, or about ½ percent of GDP, text table).
Reportedly, the government is leading a further €1.5 billion package in a third effort to
stabilize IKB. With write-downs possible, these commitments are set to increase. The
continued reliance on public support for the ongoing bank rescues underscore staff’s call for
greater transparency, a resolution mechanism that injects incentives for prudent action, and,
looking ahead, a more systematic restructuring of the banking sector.

5.
Pursuant to the instructions by the Ministry of Finance, BaFin and the
Bundesbank have made some progress on their coordination efforts. Progress has been
achieved on reducing duplication of supervisory visits by BaFin and the Bundesbank, in
response to the perceived intrusiveness by banks of such visits. Yet, staff’s reading of
available public information is that the core issue of increasing accountability has not been
tackled. Supervisory accountability would be best achieved, as noted in the staff report, by
combining supervision and enforcement actions in either BaFin or the Bundesbank;
alternatively, clear protocols for coordination would need to ensure accountability.

Background
Far reaching reforms have strengthened the German economy, but a weakening global cycle is
dampening near-term growth prospects. Strong external competitiveness generated a robust
recovery since 2004 with beneficial spillovers to Europe. A flurry of investment activity and a
belated decline in unemployment have held up growth throughout 2007 despite the VAT hike.
Policy credibility has been enhanced by determined fiscal consolidation.
GDP growth is projected to slow to 1.5 percent in 2008 from 2.5 percent in 2007. A slowing U.S.
economy and weaker world trade is pulling down GDP growth given Germany’s strong external
dependence. To a lesser extent a strengthened euro and high oil prices are weighing down on
output growth. On the positive side, a pick-up in consumption is helped by steady employment
gains and limited wage moderation. Inflation is expected to slow moderately to 2.2 percent in
2008.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during
the February 22, 2008 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

Productivity picked up in recent years, but sectoral trends are not comforting. Potential growth is
estimated at 1½-1¾ percent annually but will likely slip back on account of population aging
unless total factor productivity growth rebounds. Labor productivity growth has accelerated only
in the manufacturing sector. The much larger service sector has, however, shown little
improvement, especially in real estate related and financial services. Moreover, shortages of
skilled labor are pronounced and wide ranging, and particularly in the export oriented sector,
health care and education, are holding back growth.
The financial sector has made much progress, but the recent turbulence highlighted unmet
challenges. Long-standing concerns about low banking sector profitability and incentives for
high-risk taking have now come to the fore. On the upside, considerable banking consolidation
has already occurred and capital markets are growing rapidly, although from low levels.
Through a sustained effort Germany balanced its budget. Although the adjustment was helped
by the upswing, policy efforts contributed in a major way. In 2006, the structural balance
improved by more than one percentage point, a year ahead of the excessive deficit procedure
schedule, and the adjustment continued steadily in 2007. This considerable up-front adjustment,
and the ambitious goals to reach a primary surplus of 3½ percent of GDP by 2011 has improved
public finances sustainability significantly. Nonetheless, longer-term fiscal challenges remain, as
costs from health care will pose an increasing burden.
Executive Board Assessment
The Executive Directors welcomed the marked strengthening of Germany’s economic
performance of the past few years, and commended the consolidation and reform policies that
have made these gains possible, including an impressive increase in employment and the best
fiscal position since unification. Nonetheless, the reform agenda remains unfinished, and the
near-term outlook is for slower growth and higher inflation, with the balance of risks modestly on
the downside. Looking forward, Directors agreed on the need for the authorities to maintain
short-term stability, especially in the financial sector, and to persist with the outstanding
medium-term reform agenda.
Directors noted that the global economic slowdown, the strength of commodity prices, and
financial tensions are having their impact on Germany. Fortunately, the relatively sound
financial position of most banks and the low reliance of enterprises and households on credit
have so far helped maintain normal lending, and while growth is slowing, it is expected to
remain close to potential. At the same time, consumer and business confidence have
weakened, credit standards have tightened recently, and some banks are facing continuing
difficulties. In view of the yet unknown dimensions and fast-moving nature of the current global
financial market turmoil, Directors urged the authorities to remain vigilant.
Directors observed that the fiscal position is moving from overall balance in 2007 to a moderate
deficit in 2008. They generally considered that this fiscal loosening should help cushion the

3

effects of the anticipated economic slowdown. Looking further ahead, Directors viewed fiscal
sustainability as within reach, and they encouraged the authorities to move to complete the
reform process and associated consolidation steps in order to secure it. In particular, achieving
long-term fiscal sustainability will require tackling healthcare expenditures. Directors welcomed
the authorities’ intention to move to a fiscal framework centered on maintaining the overall
deficit close to balance in cyclically-adjusted terms. They urged the authorities to press ahead
with a second round of fiscal federalism reforms to improve incentives for prudent fiscal
management.
Directors underscored that one of the authorities’ key objectives must be to preserve confidence
in the financial sector. While this has been achieved thus far by using public resources to
rescue banks that faced insolvency, the fiscal costs of these rescues have mounted. Directors
recommended adopting a bank resolution framework that is fully transparent and allows for
quick resolutions, while providing stronger incentives for prudent management through the
dilution of shareholders’ equity in recapitalized or intervened banks.
Directors welcomed ongoing discussions to strengthen banking supervision. Looking ahead,
they urged more frequent financial statements and more widespread use of International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) reporting to better capture off-balance-sheet activity.
They considered that despite recent efforts, further measures are needed to enhance
supervisory accountability and raise the quality of supervision. Directors therefore welcomed the
recent protocol to improve coordination between the Bundesbank and the financial sector
supervisory authority (BaFin).
Directors noted that the intensification of international financial integration suggests a need to
restructure the German banking sector. Global competition is likely to continue to erode the
traditional business models of banks that only serve targeted communities. Directors considered
that bank restructuring should be guided by the goal of creating robust and sustainable banks,
while allowing private capital to play a role.
Directors called on the authorities to safeguard their hard-won economic gains by pressing
ahead with their medium-term reform agenda in the areas of labor markets, the general
framework for investment, the financial sector, and fiscal policy. They pointed to the risks
attached to any pause in the broader structural reform process for the achievement of long-term
sustainability.
Directors recommended that a coordinated effort be made to raise Germany’s growth potential.
To that end, skills shortages need to be addressed by improving education and training, but
also by encouraging the immigration of skilled workers. Directors welcomed efforts to rationalize
active labor market programs and make child care more readily available. However, they
cautioned that the new sectoral minimum wages could undermine work incentives and the
success of Hartz IV labor market reforms. Directors called for enhancing the business climate
by continuing to reduce taxes on capital and labor, but in a budget-neutral manner.

4

Directors welcomed efforts to further develop capital markets, and underscored the importance
of promoting transparency in corporate governance. They considered that rationalizing
company supervisory board structures could help raise efficiency, and they saw a role for
strengthening disclosure standards to improve internal and external discipline imposed on
company managements. Directors cautioned against initiatives that would further empower
insiders or render governance more complex.

Statement by Klaus Stein, Executive Director for Germany
February 22, 2008
We would like to thank the staff for a solid and thoughtful report and a set of insightful
Selected Issues chapters. The report offers a balanced reflection of what my authorities
considered to be a very constructive and candid dialogue during the consultations.
Economic Situation
The upswing of the German economy continued in 2007, supported by sound
fundamentals. At 2.5 percent, real GDP grew considerably faster than initially expected.
The unemployment rate declined by 1½ percentage points and external competitiveness
remained strong. Furthermore, the general government posted a balanced budget for the
first time since reunification and well ahead of schedule. Economic activity remained
largely unaffected by the fiscal contraction, high oil prices, the euro appreciation, and the
financial market turbulences. Meanwhile, inflationary pressures have clearly intensified
and are expected to moderate only gradually.
The German economy is increasingly benefiting from the sustained adjustment
efforts in the private sector and the broad and far-reaching reforms implemented
over the past several years. Unfortunately, these reforms go largely unmentioned in Box
1 discussing previous policy implementation. They essentially comprise policy measures
in the labor market and structural changes in the social security system, combined with a
phased strategy of expenditure-based fiscal consolidation. At the same time, my
authorities are well aware that further challenges lie ahead.
For 2008, the government projects economic activity to slow to 1.7 percent, which is
somewhat above the staff projection. Growth will be driven mainly by private
investment and a gradual strengthening in private consumption. Factors supporting
consumption include higher employment, a pick-up in wage growth, and a further
lowering of unemployment insurance contributions.
My authorities consider the risks to their forecast to be broadly balanced. They
agree that developments in – international and domestic – financial markets give rise to
particular uncertainty at this juncture. The economy appears, however, well-placed to
weather tensions in this context, given high capacity utilization and a large order backlog
in the manufacturing sector. Also, sentiment among businesses remains fairly positive
and balance sheets are generally strong. Reliance of German businesses and households
on external financing is relatively low. Moreover, available evidence points only to a
moderate tightening of lending standards, also when compared to the rest of the euro
area. Furthermore, growth of credit to businesses remains undiminished. That being said,
vigilance is warranted going forward.

2
Fiscal Policy
The steep reduction of the fiscal deficit ratio by 3½ percentage points since 2005 has
been the result of buoyant revenues and sustained expenditure restraint, and was
supported by improving cyclical conditions. The public spending ratio declined from
48½ percent to 44 percent of GDP over the last five years. This has been accompanied by
efficiency-enhancing reforms strengthening both the tax structure and the composition of
spending.
My authorities are keenly aware of the remaining challenge of securing long-term
fiscal sustainability in the face of rising aging-related costs. As laid out in the latest
Stability Program, Germany is going to keep the general government budget close to
balance or in surplus, in line with the Stability and Growth Pact. As a part of this policy,
the government intends to eliminate the deficit at the federal level by 2011. Among the
reforms needed to ensure long-term sustainability are further measures to increase
competition and transparency in the healthcare system.
The government is confident that the modest and temporary increase in the deficit
expected this year is consistent with their proven strategy of growth-oriented fiscal
consolidation. The temporary loosening is mainly the result of the coming-into-effect of
the corporate income tax reform at the start of this year as well as the further round of
reductions in unemployment insurance contributions, which will further foster
employment. Both steps, along with the ongoing redirection of spending towards R&D
and education, will promote growth and thus fiscal consolidation down the road.
Indeed, the fiscal loosening that is already in the pipeline for 2008 may prove
opportune from the point of view of cushioning the incipient softening of economic
activity. In the event of a stronger-than-expected downturn, automatic stabilizers would
be the effective way to further support the economy.
Strong fiscal institutions are an important element in promoting prudent policies.
The existing constitutional golden rule has shortcomings in that it leaves undue room for
discretion and lacks symmetry between cyclical upswings and downturns. Building on
the first round of federalism reforms of 2006, my authorities plan a revised deficit rule in
a second round of reforms next year. They are of the view that, by ensuring a structurally
balanced budget, the new rule is sufficiently ambitious. They are not convinced of the
need for a contingent requirement of further belt-tightening as suggested by the staff. The
government will continue to update its estimates of aging-related costs, including through
its periodical sustainability report, and take corrective measures as needed. Moreover, it
considers that the necessary trigger and quantification of a further belt-tightening
requirement would be difficult to operationalize.

3
Structural Reforms
The recent economic upswing is not just cyclical but also a reflection of the
sustained restructuring efforts in the business sector and the far-reaching reforms
undertaken in the labor market and in other areas. Mainly on account of the reforms,
potential output growth is estimated to have risen over the last years by around a quarter
percentage point to between 1½ and 1¾ percent.
Looking ahead, further increases in trend economic growth are both achievable and
necessary to confront the challenges posed by globalization and population aging.
The most recent steps to this end include the above-mentioned lowering in social security
contributions and the corporate income tax reform involving a steep reduction in effective
tax rates to below 30 percent. These measures, along with the ongoing expansion of child
care facilities, will help boost the investment climate, job incentives, and labor
participation going forward.
At the same time, anchoring reforms in a sufficiently broad consensus and
balancing efficiency considerations with social security concerns has served
Germany well. In the government’s view, there is a need to ensure that citizens
increasingly share in the fruits of the upswing. That being said, Germany will stay the
course in terms of economic policy and will continue the successful reforms of recent
years. This does not rule out selective modifications in distinct cases.
On labor market issues, it is worth noting that the extension of the unemployment
benefit period for elderly workers is being accompanied by targeted wage subsidies and
strengthened job search requirements to protect job incentives. As regards wage
bargaining, the continuing decline of the share of employees covered by collective wage
agreements and the more adaptable working hour arrangements testify to increasing
flexibility in labor markets.
On the issue of skills shortages, we would caution that the factors contributing to
German emigration are difficult to gauge empirically. That said, the staff rightly points to
the policy challenges involved. Besides the high priority the government places on
improvements in education and training, selective steps were taken last fall to facilitate
immigration, and further opening is being considered.
Finally, on the planned amendment to the Foreign Trade and Payments Act in the
context of sovereign wealth fund investments, my authorities reiterate their firm
commitment to undertake this in a manner that preserves Germany’s long-standing
reputation for openness to foreign capital.

4
Financial Sector
Supervisory authorities continue to monitor financial sector developments closely.
Risks related to international financial turbulence remain, and further writedowns cannot
be ruled out. However, it is worth underscoring that the German banking system has
remained robust and fully functional throughout the turmoil, notwithstanding the
subprime-related capital injections that became necessary in a limited number of cases. A
supporting factor has been bank profitability, which – while not yet on par with
international levels – has improved appreciably over recent years.
The turmoil has highlighted the need for further restructuring of the Landesbank
sector and for a review of individual business models. Besides the ongoing process of
vertical integration, horizontal integration across regions is an option that attracts
increasing attention. Indeed, the reform debate, including on opening the sector to private
capital, has picked up considerable momentum of late. While outside of its purview, the
federal government welcomes and supports this process.
As regards Deutsche Industriebank (IKB), losses on subprime-related investments
necessitated two recapitalizations in 2007. A third package of support, including from the
government, is currently being devised. Each time, difficult choices had and have to be
made involving trade-offs between the evolving concerns of safeguarding financial
stability, containing fiscal costs and moral hazard, and paving the way for selling the
shares of IKB held by Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW).
As for the staff’s reservations about relationship banking, we would note that the
links between banks and large industrial enterprises were dramatically loosened in
the nineties. Capital markets in Germany, including securitization markets, continue to
grow at a high pace. As regards SMEs, even in the context of global competition, there
are strong economic reasons for maintaining relationship banking, especially to reduce
information asymmetries and to stabilize SME’s access to loans over the business cycle.
On the bank resolution framework and possible revisions thereof, this issue should
be viewed in a European context to ensure a level playing field across the EU. The
relevant EU provision for bank insolvencies, the so-called winding-up-directive, is
currently being reviewed.
As regards supervision, an agreement was reached this month on a revised guideline
governing the respective competencies of the Deutsche Bundesbank and the BaFin.
The revised guideline further specifies the tasks of the two agencies and directs their
focus more clearly on the respective mandates of banking supervision on the one side and
prudential enforcement and regulation on the other. The revision will thus go a long way
towards clarifying the division of labor and eliminating any overlap. It should thereby

5
further improve transparency and efficiency of banking supervision. By contrast, my
authorities are not persuaded by the staff recommendation to consolidate bank
supervision and enforcement in one of the two institutions. Leaving out BaFin would run
counter to the basic principle of integrated financial supervision, a course that the
authorities adopted only in 2002. Leaving out the Bundesbank would mean foregoing its
extensive infrastructure and bank contacts and weakening it in the performance of its
financial stability responsibility. Moreover, the issue thus far has been one of duplication
of work, not of lack of accountability, as suggested by the staff.
On corporate governance, a proposal for a new EU statute for private companies similar
to the Societas Europea statute is due to be put forward in the near future. It is also worth
noting that the draft Risk Limitation Law mentioned by the staff may yet be modified to
address concerns about legal uncertainties and undue constraints on shareholder rights.
Finally, on a more general note, my authorities attach great importance to
addressing structural issues in international financial markets that may have
contributed to excessive risk-taking. They support expedited efforts among relevant
international bodies and supervisory authorities, in particular, to review and improve
capital requirements and liquidity management standards and to increase transparency in
areas such as off-balance sheet vehicles and rating agencies.
