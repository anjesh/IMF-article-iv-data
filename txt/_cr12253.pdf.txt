STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context: After a robust rebound following the 2008–09 crisis, economic activity in
Finland has slowed markedly, owing to gyrations in euro area (EA) financial markets,
which have dragged down external demand and impaired domestic confidence. Risks
to the outlook are tilted to the downside with the main risk being an intensification of
the EA sovereign debt crisis that could spill over to Finland. A slowdown of world
growth or an adverse oil price shock could also negatively impact the economy. While
competitiveness remains broadly satisfactory, margins have been eroded and it may
become a concern should current trends continue.
Further strengthening the financial sector: While the banking sector is well
capitalized, risks emanating from the crisis as well as heightened requirements
envisaged under Basel III warrant higher capital and liquidity buffers, which should be
accomplished in moderate steps to prevent deleveraging. With a majority of assets
controlled by subsidiaries of foreign banks, the sector is vulnerable to a short-term
funding shortfall and spillovers from a worsening of the EA crisis. Given the heavy
concentration of the banking sector, nationally systemic banks should be subject to
closer supervision and more stringent prudential requirements. At the same time,
strengthening macro-prudential tools would help mitigate risks in the housing market.
Balancing near- and longer-term fiscal objectives: The near-term fiscal stance is
appropriately neutral as it avoids pro-cyclical withdrawal of support when growth is set
to weaken while not endangering long-term sustainability. As the recovery strengthens,
the structural fiscal position should be gradually tightened to close the sustainability
gap. Budget retrenchment should be implemented flexibly, allowing automatic
stabilizers to operate if macro conditions are less favorable than anticipated.
Raising potential growth: With a rapidly aging population, structural policies to
enhance potential growth should focus on lengthening working careers. In addition,
further competition in the service and health care sectors as well as municipal reform
could spur productivity and help close the sustainability gap.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

FINLAND

INTRODUCTION
1.
Despite strong fundamentals and a track record of good policies, Finland’s near-term
outlook is threatened by intensifying external strains. Activity in the EA is set to contract in 2012
on the back of the protracted sovereign debt crisis, financial sector deleveraging, and additional
fiscal consolidation in several European countries. Spillovers to Finland already have been significant,
given its highly open economy and trade and financial linkages with Europe, and, as a result, growth
decelerated at the end of 2011. Though activity in the first quarter was slightly stronger than
expected, growth is projected to slow significantly in 2012. Thus, the key immediate policy concern
is to cushion the downturn, while mitigating financial, fiscal, and structural vulnerabilities.
2.
Downside risks prevail. A further deterioration of financial market conditions could have
severe negative spillovers for Finland. Increased concern about fiscal sustainability in the EA, forcing
additional front-loaded fiscal tightening, would dampen further the prospects for near-term
recovery. In case of a strong intensification of the EA crisis, leading to heightened financial stress
and associated deleveraging, a sharp recession would be inevitable.
3.
The Finnish economy also faces important longer-run challenges. Rapid aging and
slowing productivity, coupled with recent cost pressures that have eroded competitiveness, threaten
longer-term growth and fiscal sustainability. Growing financial integration in Europe and complexity
create new risks and test supervisory abilities.

The capital adequacy ratio (CAR) stood at
14¼ percent at end-2011, well above
regulatory standards. At 13½ percent at
end-2011, the core Tier 1 capital ratio was

The non-performing loan (NPL) rate, at
½ percent in March 2012, remains low.
However, the NPL to capital ratio, at
5½ percent in Q411, increased slightly
relative to one year earlier due mainly to an
uptick in troubled loans to households and, to
a lesser extent, to corporations.
Profitability has deteriorated amid weakening
interest income and increased competition for

addition, the Finnish banking sector is highly concentrated, with a majority of assets
controlled by subsidiaries of foreign Nordic banks, and heavily dependent on wholesale
funding. This heightens the vulnerability to a short-term funding shortfall and spillovers
from a possible worsening of the EA crisis (AN1 1). Moreover, the net external position of
Finnish banks has deteriorated over the past year, reflecting both higher foreign exposure
and greater dependence on foreign funds.
7.
The insurance and pension fund sectors are weathering well the ongoing crisis, but
not without suffering losses.

The deep economic downturn combined with the low level of interest rates and highly
volatile equity and bond markets led to reduced solvency margins for insurers in 2010–11.
However, at 3¾ and 4 times the regulatory requirement for nonlife and life insurance
respectively, such margins remain high relative to European peers. Investments of Finnish
insurers returned a loss just shy of 2 percent at end-2011.
Compared to other European countries, Finnish pension funds have given preference to
equity over debt instruments in their portfolios. Hence, tumbling share prices during the
height of the crisis caused deeper losses, from which pension funds are still healing.



8.
Household indebtedness has surged. Household debt as a share of disposable income
increased sharply during the past decade, rendering household balance sheets riskier. With
mortgages overwhelmingly of the floating-rate variety, decline in interest rates and longer
repayment terms have lowered borrowing costs. In addition, banks have first charge at default and
full recourse against borrowers. Thus, default rates have remained low. Unlike other EA countries,
mortgage growth in Finland has been stable throughout 2011, exceeding the EA average by about
4 percentage points. The share of highly indebted households, likely to face heightened repayment
problems in 2012 as unemployment increases again, is rising.

Box 1. Finland: Cross-Border Spillovers1
Finland’s financial and trade linkages to the other Nordics make it sensitive to growth
slowdowns in the region. Although Finland’s trade pattern across countries is relatively
diversified, its financial linkages are more concentrated in the Nordics. Foreign direct investment
in Finland is dominated by Sweden with close to 60 percent of the total for Finland. Similarly,
cross-border banking flows are dominated by Sweden and other Nordic countries.
A diversified trade pattern and limited
exposure to countries with large
consolidation plans help limit spillovers
from fiscal consolidation in the euro area.
Despite notable consolidation plans in some of
its trading partners, the impact on Finland’s
growth in 2012 and 2013 from worldwide
consolidation will likely be low. Simulation
results imply that domestic consolidation plans
are likely to generate a more significant drag
on GDP with a likely reduction in 2012 of
¼ percentage point, while foreign
consolidation will reduce output growth by
around 0.1 percentage points in 2012
and 2013.

50 percent of the outstanding sovereign claims would entail no notable losses to Finnish banks.
Further, losses would remain small even if Finnish banks lose 30 percent of their asset value in
the three program countries. Claims on Sweden and Germany are more relevant and a
10 percent haircut on these assets reveals a more severe loss of around 2 and ½ percent of GDP,
respectively.

Real estate prices are at historically high levels but broadly in line with fundamentals.
After moderate retrenchment in 2009, house prices recovered the pre-crisis growth path and
according to some indicators real house prices and credit are above their long-run trend (Box 2).
Nevertheless, the increase in housing prices exceeded income growth only marginally in recent
years, suggesting the absence of major real estate bubbles (AN 2). The fall in rental rates for office
space in 2011 is likely the harbinger of a modest price correction for commercial real estate,
particularly with banks tightening lending policies.

The fiscal position deteriorated sharply during the acute 2009 recession, and, while
consolidation has begun, the costs of population aging loom large. Reflecting both automatic
stabilizers and discretionary stimulus, the general government (GG) headline balance deteriorated
by 7 percent of GDP in 2009, spawning a deficit of about 2¾ percent of GDP in 2009–10
(Tables 3–4, Figure 5). In 2011, the budgetary stance tightened by about 1 percent of GDP in
structural terms. This followed from a hike in energy taxes and the full-year impact of a
1 percentage point raise in the standard rate of VAT to 23 percent in mid-2010, while, on the
expenditure side, the stimulus measures started to be phased out. Nonetheless, with weaker-thanprojected growth, the headline deficit stood at around ¾ percent of GDP and gross debt continued
to increase, ending 2011 at close to 49 percent of GDP. Meanwhile, population aging remains a
challenge for long-term fiscal sustainability, with associated GG costs estimated at 6½ percent of
GDP per annum by 2016 (AN 6 and ¶31). Related to below-the-line operations, Finland has secured
collateral for its financial assistance to some debtor countries through the EFSF.

Financial variables have strengthened the
economic recovery but support is fading.
The low interest rate environment and the
improvement in the situation in the banking sector
in 2010 have stimulated demand for mortgage
loans and housing prices. This in turn strengthened
household asset positions, which underpinned
robust private consumption growth. The recovery
lost steam as asset markets started to deteriorate
and the outlook clouded over, slowing investment

The historic relationship between credit,
housing, and output growth is strong in
Finland, making output susceptible to negative
shocks in real estate and credit markets. Vector
Autoregressions (VARs) suggest that a negative
shock to credit availability of 5 percent could be
associated with a reduction in output by ¼ to
½ percent after one year and 1 to 1¾ percent
after 2 years. Housing prices would be lower by ¼
to 2½ percent in the first year and 2¼ to
2¾ percent in the second year. At the current level
of output, housing prices and credit are above
their long-run trend.

The credit market is broadly in equilibrium and
major disruptions from the credit market to
economic growth are less likely. Credit demand
declined with economic prospects. With the
relative resilience of the banking sector to the
woes in the euro area, the impact on credit
provision has been limited. Thus, there has been
little misalignment in the credit market throughout
the earlier phases of the crisis and the recovery
phase.

Previous large current account surpluses have waned, suggesting that
competitiveness, while still adequate, has eroded. With the collapse in exports of 2009 and a
renewed slowdown in trading partner growth at end-2011, the current account turned from a
2½ percent of GDP surplus in 2008 to a ¾ percent of GDP deficit in 2011. Exports, which in 2008
accounted for more than 45 percent of GDP, have now fallen below the 40 percent mark
(Tables 5–7, Figures 6–7). Additionally, Finland has continued to lose export market share (Box 3).
Nonetheless, econometric estimates do not suggest misalignment. On balance, in staff’s view,
competitiveness remains broadly satisfactory, though margins have been eroded and it may
become a concern should current trends continue. While the authorities share this assessment, they
highlight that most of the structural export decline (from outsourcing by the ICT and paper
industries) already has taken place, limiting the risks of further deterioration. The relatively robust
external position limits vulnerabilities from capital flows, with the net international investment
position improving steadily since 2007 and expected to remain comfortable. Both assets and
liabilities have been rising at a strong pace with considerable direct investment net assets, while
portfolio and other investment are in net liability.

Box 3. Finland: External Competitiveness
Various price and quantity indicators imply some deterioration in competitiveness. Real
effective exchange rates (REERs) based on various cost and price indices have, on average, moved
broadly sideways. Meanwhile, the current account has continued its downward trend, reaching a
deficit (of 0.7 percent of GDP) in 2011—the first time in nearly two decades.
Real effective exchange rates hint at a worsening of relative profitability in manufacturing.
Using the ratio of the REERs based on HICP and on unit wage cost in manufacturing as a proxy for
relative profitability points to deteriorating conditions. After trending upward for more than a decade,
albeit with temporary interruptions, including during the 2008–09 crisis, this measure now again is
showing a decline in relative profitability.
Finland has continued to lose export market share. Finland’s export market share in the world has
been on a declining trend for more than a decade. Since 2008, the decline in export share in the EU
market has also intensified, not least on the back of declining exports of electronics due to both
outsourcing of production and a downsizing of the ICT industry.

Box 3. Finland: External Competitiveness (concluded)
The IMF’s multilaterally-consistent
methodologies suggest the real
exchange rate is broadly in balance.
Recent external balance assessment (EBA)
estimates support the view that the real
exchange rate, or more generally the
external position, is broadly in line with
fundamentals. Specifically, while the EBA
real exchange rate approach continues to
flag mild real undervaluation, the
macroeconomic balance approach points
to the opposite. In the external
sustainability approach, the current
account is exactly aligned with
fundamentals. However, CGER
methodologies indicate the real exchange
rate is moderately weaker than implied by
fundamentals. In particular, the three
different approaches produce a deviation
from fundamentals-based values in the
range of 2 to–18 percent depending on
the CGER method used, averaging a
-6 percent deviation, suggesting moderate
real undervaluation.

On balance, staff estimates that the real exchange rate and the external balance are broadly in
line with fundamentals. As discussed above, developments in non-econometric indicators suggest
competitiveness has deteriorated, thereby eroding the moderate margins of competitiveness estimated
in the past, but without resulting in real overvaluation. Moreover, IMF econometric methodologies do
not show significant deviations from fundamentals-based values overall.

projections are slightly higher for 2012 and lower
for 2013 than staff’s, while the Bank of Finland is somewhat more sanguine for 2012.

Medium- and Long-Term Prospects
13.
The renewed deceleration is likely to exacerbate the permanent output loss, and aging
will weigh further on potential growth. The latter will remain below pre-crisis values as weak
investment in 2008–09 and again in 2012 is taking its toll (Table 1). A potential output loss of as
much as 8 percent by 2017 is estimated relative to the pre-crisis trend (AN 3). At the same time, the
rapidly aging population will constrain growth of working-age cohorts. With manufacturing
productivity set to expand below 2 percent, growth prospects are lackluster in the absence of
increases in the participation rate or reforms to boost productivity.

Risks to the Outlook
14.
The authorities agreed that risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside, with
heightened uncertainties. Downside risks primarily relate to uncertainty about financial market
gyrations in the EA and spillovers from a deeper and more protracted EA recession than currently

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FINLAND

projected (AN 1 and Risk Assessment Matrix). On the positive side, financial market reactions to EA
crisis resolution actions could surprise on the upside, leading to a faster return to normalcy than
currently expected. Further depreciation of the euro could have a similar effect. Over the longer run,
persistent expansionary monetary conditions and safe-haven capital inflows could be conducive to
overheating and asset-price bubbles. More specifically:


The baseline scenario includes a gradual easing of European financial market tensions.
However, heavier deleveraging and a credit crunch are a possibility.



Persistence of negative investor sentiment could lead to widening spreads also for Finland,
prompting further domestic fiscal retrenchment to avoid losing the coveted AAA rating.



More fiscal tightening abroad than anticipated or stronger-than-expected adverse effects of
the budget retrenchment assumed in the baseline could hit Finnish exports hard (AN 1),
given the very open nature of the economy. In general, though, the authorities are more
optimistic on the impact of fiscal consolidation.



Negative growth impacts could also derive from a significant reduction in Finnish real estate
prices, an adverse oil supply shock, or a slowdown of world growth.

In principle, each of these factors could drive deviations from the baseline in either direction and
impact staff’s central projection for activity accordingly. Nevertheless, the probability of downside
outcomes is deemed prevalent—with unusually pronounced dispersion—as reflected in the
discussion above.
15.
A strong intensification of the EA crisis, leading to more acute financial stress, would
generate severe negative spillovers. The Finnish banking system, with its close integration with its
Nordic neighbors, could suffer a strong adverse impact. This would likely take the form of liquidity
withdrawal by parent banks, amid difficulties in wholesale funding, forcing a strong deleveraging of
Finnish banks and likely an associated credit crunch. As a consequence, real activity would also be
impaired and contract severely. Staff simulations suggest that, amid sharp increases in sovereign
and corporate risk premia, accompanied by further fiscal consolidation, Finnish GDP could shrink by
4 percent below the baseline in 2012–13 (AN 4).

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
16.
Against this background, Finland must address existing vulnerabilities and long-term
sustainability issues, while paying due attention to short-term growth.


In the financial sector, proactive efforts should be undertaken to lift capital to the levels
envisaged under Basel III. More emphasis should be given to liquidity provisioning as
heightened stress in the wholesale market is a key risk and new regulation under Basel III will
require further adjustment efforts by banks. In light of squeezed profit margins, supervision
should ensure that the prudential business model is maintained and no excessive move to
higher risk-return portfolios is undertaken. Cross-border supervision should be further
intensified because financial flows have increased, in particular across the Nordic region.



Fiscal policy must strike a delicate balance between supporting short-term economic activity,
mitigating recessionary forces, and addressing the sustainability gap. Given the deteriorated
outlook, this argues for allowing automatic stabilizers to work fully in the near term and
planning a gradual pace of consolidation over the medium term.



Further structural policies to spur potential growth should be implemented. This includes
raising the effective retirement age and boosting labor supply. Moreover, strengthening
competition in the service and health care sectors could enhance productivity, while, in the
public sector, merging municipalities could realize economies of scale.

C. Maintaining Financial Stability
Bank Capitalization and Liquidity
17.
The consensus was that, while the banking sector is sound, individual institutions may
need to strengthen capital and liquidity, especially the latter. Banks already meet the minimum
capital and conservation buffer requirements envisaged under Basel III, though the authorities
acknowledged that not all credit institutions satisfy the leverage ratio requirement. Furthermore,
compliance with Basel III liquidity requirements will entail some additional effort as regards the asset
composition of the liquidity buffer and the size of long-term stable funding (AN 5). As the banking
system is substantially funded through foreign sources and wholesale markets, staff argued that
banks ought to be encouraged to build up capital and above all liquidity buffers gradually. The
authorities concurred, emphasizing that these objectives should be accomplished in measured but
steady steps over the medium term to avoid fostering pressures for deleveraging.

Supervisors confirmed that, according to stress tests, capital buffers are sufficient,
while liquidity provision should be improved (AN 5). Under a prolonged recession scenario
for 2012–15, banks overall remain above the current minimum capital requirement. Nevertheless,

19.
The authorities concurred on the need for preemptive action to mitigate the
considerable risk posed by potential interruptions of bank funding from abroad. A renewed
worsening of the EA crisis could hamper long-term wholesale funding and exacerbate vulnerabilities
posed by large international groups. Hence, the mission argued that stepped-up efforts are needed
to ensure preparedness to prevent or alleviate potential disruptions in cross-border flows, by
designing contingency plans (encompassing burden-sharing agreements) with home authorities, the
European Banking Authority, and the European Central Bank, including clear delineation of
responsibilities of each institution.

Other Micro Supervision and Regulation of Financial Institutions
20.
Though cross-border banking activities have received increased attention, supervisors
recognized that additional steps would be useful. Several memoranda of understanding
(MoUs)—in line with best international practice—have been signed with foreign (mainly Nordic and
Baltic) supervisors and supervisory colleges have been active. Nevertheless, the authorities noted
that MoUs are not binding, which hampers enforcement actions. It would be helpful to strengthen
their legal status. At any rate, closer harmonization in application of international standards as well

FINLAND

as common reporting systems and supervisory approaches would buttress effectiveness of crossborder supervision. Similarly, it was agreed that enhancing cross-border sharing of supervisory
information could facilitate preparedness in host and home countries. This would require
appropriate legal changes and would pave the way for the application of a more holistic toolkit for
assessing risks from cross-border exposures. Finally, advances in cross-border crisis-handling and
bank resolution would be crucial (¶25).
21.
Supervision of the insurance sector conforms to international standards but staff
counseled speedier enactment of the new regulatory framework. The 2010 Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP) update recommended strengthening the analysis of the (consolidated)
risk profile of complex financial groups by integrating procedures and practices of banking and
insurance supervision (Table 8). This has been partly implemented and further work is ongoing. The
new supervisory framework should be complemented by prompt introduction of supporting
regulations, clarifying inter alia requirements on the level and structure of capital as well as eligible
instruments for bank-insurers, a key step given the prevalence of the banc-assurance model in
Finland.

Macro-Prudential Supervision
22.
Heavy concentration in the banking sector implies high contagion risk from systemic
banks and requires enhanced supervision. The mission reported that, according to bank
contagion maps based on balance sheet inter-linkages, a few institutions act as liquidity hubs, thus,
rendering them systemically crucial in the event

23.
There was agreement that close monitoring of banks’ risk taking behavior is
warranted, particularly in the current low interest rate environment. The mission noted that the
high degree of variable-rate loans combined with low rates have made the private sector more
vulnerable to a rapid rise in the interest rate. Further, the authorities were concerned that very low
rates over a prolonged period may encourage more risk taking by banks to increase short-term

profitability, including by accelerating credit
expansion, ultimately with an adverse impact on
financial sector health. The mission also advised
that protracted accommodative monetary
conditions could in the long run fuel excessive
credit growth and asset bubbles. In this
connection, it noted that the estimated adverse
impact of potential housing price shocks on
household consumption and economic activity is
sizable.

Discussions concluded that macro-prudential management would benefit from
strengthening limits to loan-to-value (LTV) ratios and other tools. Officials reported and staff
welcomed: (i) plans to define national competencies for macro-prudential supervision; (ii) the indepth survey of vulnerabilities related to the housing and credit markets; (iii) publication of standard
definitions to calculate the LTV ratio; and (iv) the prospective introduction of countercyclical capital
buffers. While the authorities currently recommend a maximum LTV ratio of 90 percent, staff
endorsed giving the Financial Supervisory Authority (FIN-FSA) authority to set binding LTV ceilings
and recommended formulation of a plan to reduce gradually LTV ratios. Further, staff would support
introduction of a national loan registry (NLR). Though the authorities generally agreed, they
explained that large banks may resist the NLR as it could dent their oligopolistic position. In
addition, the mission reiterated the desirability to limit further interest rate deductibility on
mortgage loans.

Crisis Resolution
25.
Officials concurred that crisis and bank resolution frameworks should also be
reinforced. Supervisors noted that the Deposit Guarantee Scheme has increased available
resources, with earlier and faster payouts in crisis conditions. Staff argued that contingency planning
should be developed in cooperation with home country supervisors, to ensure coordination of
interventions in parent banks and their subsidiaries in case of crisis, in particular with ex-ante
burden-sharing guidelines to limit the scope for contagion from abroad. Regarding bank resolution,
staff shared the authorities’ preference for a common bank-resolution framework at the EU level.
The authorities concurred that, if progress at the EU-level lags, it would be beneficial to formulate
proactively national or regional resolution frameworks.

D. Fiscal Policy
Short-Term Fiscal Policy
26.
The short-term fiscal stance is neutral. The general government (GG) structural primary
surplus is expected to stay virtually unchanged in 2012, consistent with a worsening of the headline
GG deficit by slightly more the ¼ percent of GDP (to around 1 percent of GDP). With pension funds
exhibiting a 2¾ percent of GDP surplus and local governments in a slight deficit, the central
government (CG) headline deficit is estimated to weaken by a similar amount.

Staff supported the authorities’ 2012 fiscal stance.



The authorities’ budget for 2012 provides
for virtually full operation of automatic
stabilizers, leading to an increase in the
headline deficit, thereby supporting
domestic demand. This is desirable,
because the outlook for near-term growth
is weak and the output gap is still sizable
(at least based on the production function
approach, used also by the European
Commission and the authorities). On the
other hand, the long-term fiscal
sustainability gap is also considerable (¶31),
owing to the impact of population aging on
public expenditures. This remains true even
though gross public debt, at below
50 percent of GDP in 2011, is comparatively
low and GG net financial assets are positive.
Thus, staff concurred that a broadly
neutral 2012 fiscal policy is appropriate,
avoiding pro-cyclical withdrawal of support
to the economy while preventing damage
to long-term sustainability prospects.

Medium-Term Fiscal Policy
28.
The authorities pursue substantial fiscal adjustment through 2015, but measures
specified so far fall short of the target. The government program aims at setting the CG
debt-to-GDP ratio on a declining path and reducing the CG deficit from around 3 to 1 percent of
GDP between 2011 and 2015 (the end of the government’s term).2 However, under current policies
and macroeconomic assumptions, staff expects the CG deficit to stay above 1½ percent of GDP
in 2015, broadly in line with the Ministry of Finance projections. At the same time, as lower growth
has permanent effects on potential output and aging costs mount, the GG structural primary
balance fails to improve markedly over the medium term. Gross public debt is projected at slightly
more than 50 percent of GDP in 2015, hence rollover risks are limited. The retrenchment is equally
divided between revenue and expenditure, though some measures are still to be properly defined.
For example, the government program also includes generic steps such as shrinking the grey
economy. The authorities agreed that current measures may prove insufficient and will review
annually progress toward meeting the deficit and debt targets, identifying additional measures if
needed.

29.
The authorities’ consolidation plan is apt, given long-term fiscal sustainability
challenges. Fiscal policy in the medium-run must balance the conflicting objectives of supporting
growth and making progress toward closing the sustainability gap (AN 6). Staff argued that a
gradual structural adjustment, about ½ percent of GDP per annum, would strike an appropriate
balance between output stabilization and fiscal sustainability. It would close the sustainability gap in
10 years with growth sufficient to eliminate the output gap over the medium term. The authorities’
plans through 2015 are broadly in line with such an adjustment path (though, as noted earlier, in the
absence of additional measures, actual tightening will be lower). Nevertheless, some officials
expressed concern that adjustment fatigue and the political cycle could jeopardize fiscal tightening,
were it smoothed over 10 years.
30.
But discussions highlighted that it should be implemented flexibly to avoid harming
growth.



22

With the renewed slowdown in economic activity, the mission stressed that the planned
adjustment should be delayed if growth were to falter significantly below potential. At least
automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate fully, and further structural consolidation
postponed until a recovery has taken firm hold. Indeed, negative effects on demand from
budget consolidation are likely to be higher when monetary policy has very limited ability to
accommodate budget tightening as is currently the case. In addition, simultaneous fiscal
consolidation in several European countries could have a larger-than-expected
contractionary impact.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FINLAND 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT



The need for immediate fiscal consolidation is lessened by the fact that Finnish authorities
have a strong track record in fiscal discipline. As noted, rollover risks are marginal. Despite
the sustainability gap, financial markets still regard Finland as low risk. Moreover, the GG
structural balance is expected to remain above the limit agreed at the European level over
the medium-term without measures beyond those already identified.



These considerations suggest that flexibility in the implementation of the planned fiscal
adjustment is both possible and desirable. The authorities generally agreed, but noted that,
to warrant relaxation of their plan, the shock to the recovery would have to be considerable.



The authorities and staff also considered that it might be preferable to substitute part of the
headline tightening with structural measures that improve significantly fiscal sustainability,
but only modestly impact the government balance and domestic demand in the short run.
These include increasing the retirement age and boosting productivity in the public service
system—the average effective retirement age was around 60 in 20073, and productivity in
local governments has been on a declining trend for several years.

Long-Term Fiscal Sustainability
31.
The long-term GG position is not yet fully sustainable, reflecting a rapidly aging
population and the impact of the crisis. Specifically, staff estimates a sustainability gap of about
4¼ percent of GDP. This is lower than the assessment at the time of the last consultation (6 percent
of GDP) because of stronger-than-anticipated fiscal performance in 2010 and adjustment in 2011
(AN 6). Nonetheless, with the onset of aging and

consistent with previous recommendations
(Table 9, Figures 8–9).

Measures to Achieve Sustainability
32.
With an already high revenue ratio, it was accepted that there is little scope for further
increases in the tax burden. Revenue measures should therefore focus on a broadening of the tax
base and a shift from labor taxation to consumption and property-based taxation. Consumption and

property taxes are generally less distortionary than income taxes. In this connection, the
one percentage point increase in the standard VAT rate and the energy tax hike are steps in the
right direction; but more should be done, including by reducing the number of items on reduced
VAT rates. Property tax rates are low by international comparison and the authorities agreed that
higher rates would provide municipalities with a more stable source of income, creating scope for
reducing municipalities’ reliance on highly cyclical corporate taxes. Staff endorsed the authorities’
plans to lower mortgage interest deductibility, which subsidizes home ownership and promotes
indebtedness by households, potentially heightening vulnerabilities of the financial system.
33.
Therefore, expenditure measures will need to account for the majority of adjustment.
With a rapidly aging population and associated increasing health care costs, priority should be given
to measures that help restrain growth in demand for health- and long-term care, while improving
efficiency in the provision of such services, as advocated by the OECD4 and contain local
government spending growth. The generosity of the social and unemployment benefits system
could also be moderated. For example, unemployment and disability pipelines to early retirement
should be further restricted (Table 10). Tuition fees and more loans in lieu of student grants for
tertiary education could also help generate some expenditure savings, but also, and more
importantly, encourage faster graduation and entry into the work force.
34.
There was agreement that reform of the fiscal framework, especially for local
governments (LG), could facilitate reaching sustainability. The authorities acknowledged that
increased attention should be given to contain rapid expenditure growth in LG. This aim could be
supported by moving toward expenditure ceilings for municipalities and by smoothing their revenue
stream to avoid pro-cyclical spending peaks and troughs, thus strengthening long-term budget
planning. Moreover, additional mergers of municipalities would pave the way for efficiency
improvements. Nevertheless, officials remarked that constitutionally protected autonomy of LG
complicated implementation of these steps, which required steady consensus-building among
municipalities. As a result, LG reform has been postponed until at least 2013. Separately, staff argued
that an independent fiscal council could analyze the macroeconomic framework to assess the
realism of budgetary projections, together with a greater focus on risk analysis and the effects of
potential downside scenarios (AN 7).

4

OECD Economic Surveys: Finland, 2012, February. Notably, substantial efficiencies could be gained by merging
municipalities—which provide the bulk of health care services—into sufficiently large units, and rationalizing the
inefficient parallel funding system for health care. Long-term home care should also be encouraged.

With population aging and an imminent decline of working age cohorts, there was
consensus that actions are needed to increase labor supply. Studies, including by the OECD and
IMF5, find a significant positive long-term effect of labor and product market reforms on total factor
productivity, growth, and employment. The authorities noted that they have raised the effective

36.
Similarly, re-orienting R&D expenditures and strengthening competition in the service
sector would enhance productivity, and thus growth. The authorities acknowledged the results
of a recent review by the OECD6 whereby R&D expenditure should be refocused on basic research
with incentives adjusted to reward academic quality and are studying options in this area. Staff also
observed that tuition fees and more reliance on loans rather than grants for students would improve
the cost effectiveness of higher education. Additionally, the large productivity differential between
manufacturing and services should be reduced by opening the service sector to more competition,
particularly in wholesale and retail trade, not least by relaxing excessive municipal zoning
restrictions. These efforts should be supported by strengthening resources and powers of the
competition authority to enforce the new competition law of 2011. Opening the health care sector
competition could also improve efficiency and help contain the buildup of aging pressures.

Further municipality reform would also enhance public sector efficiency. Staff noted
that such reform (¶34), together with more systematic benchmarking, could generate productivity
gains at the LG level. This would be particularly important for the health-care sector, which is
primarily within the purview of municipalities.

STAFF APPRAISAL
38.
Despite strong foundations and policies, Finland’s near-term outlook is threatened by
intensifying external strains. As a result of adverse spillovers from the marked slowdown of
activity in the EA, GDP growth is to decelerate markedly in 2012. Accordingly, output will fall further
below potential in 2012 and inflation will moderate. Though activity should start to recover late
in 2012, volatile financial market conditions and to a lesser extent structural fiscal consolidation (also
in trading partners) will remain a hindrance. Competitiveness, albeit still adequate, has worsened
significantly in recent years. Risks to the outlook—primarily from external sources—are tilted to the
downside, with heightened uncertainties. The supply potential of the economy may have been
significantly curbed by the crisis and the recent deterioration in competitiveness, aggravating the
problems posed by aging, not least to fiscal sustainability.
39.
Bank capital and, above all, liquidity buffers should be gradually enhanced. Though the
Finnish system is well capitalized and liquid, progress is needed in some institutions with respect to
the leverage ratio and liquidity to meet the prospective Basel III requirements. Moreover, volatile
financial market conditions suggest that strengthening both capital and liquidity buffers would be
prudent. To ease concerns posed by marked reliance on wholesale funding, high concentration, and
dependence on foreign parent banks, upping liquidity cushions is particularly important. These aims
should be pursued in stages over the medium term to prevent deleveraging.
40.
Further steps toward strengthening supervision of nationally systemic banks and
reinforcement of macro-prudential tools would be desirable. Contagion risk from systemic
banks acting as liquidity hubs is exacerbated by heavy concentration in the Finnish banking system.
Hence closer supervision and possibly more stringent prudential requirements for nationally
systemic banks, such as additional capital buffers, higher liquidity provisions, and topped-up
contributions to the Deposit Guarantee Fund would be appropriate. Supervisors should scrutinize
carefully bank risk-taking behavior, in light of incentives to seek higher short-term profits, not least
by pushing on credit growth, in an environment of low interest margins, given that most loans are
based on floating rates and tied to Euribor rates, currently at historical lows. Allocation of the
macro-prudential responsibility to the FIN-FSA in cooperation with other authorities as well as
publication of standard definitions to calculate the loan-to-value ratio (LTV) and the planned
introduction of countercyclical capital buffers are welcome. These steps should be complemented by
granting the FIN-FSA authority to make LTV ceilings binding and implementing a national loan
registry to guard against excessive borrowing.
41.
There is scope to buttress further the effectiveness of cross-country supervision and
crisis resolution mechanisms. MoUs are not binding and consideration should be given to

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

27

FINLAND

strengthen their legal status. Mutual sharing of supervisory information could facilitate preparedness
in host and home countries and should be enhanced. Joint contingency planning with other national
authorities for cross-border resolution should be advanced with ex-ante burden-sharing guidelines
defined to limit contagion. A common bank-resolution framework at the EU level would be
preferable, but national or regional plans are advisable in the interim.
42.
The fiscal stance planned through 2015 is appropriate, but should be implemented
flexibly. Fiscal policy must balance the conflicting objectives of supporting growth and making
progress toward closing the sustainability gap, arising from the impact of population aging on
public expenditures. Thus, the broadly neutral fiscal policy for 2012 and the gradual structural
tightening envisaged for 2013–2015 are appropriate, avoiding pro-cyclical withdrawal of support to
the economy while beginning progress toward long-term sustainability. Specifically, this adjustment
path eliminates the sustainability gap in 10 years, and allows for a steady reduction and eventual
disappearance of the output gap by 2017. Given the unusual downside risks surrounding the
recovery, the authorities should nevertheless stand ready to loosen budget policy if growth
underperforms considerably, in particular letting automatic stabilizers operate fully and delaying
further structural consolidation until a recovery has taken firm hold.
43.
Measures that directly reduce the impact of aging on public expenditures or broaden
the tax base should form a key plank of medium-term adjustment efforts. These include steps
to mitigate the expected rise in health- and long-term care costs and further tighten unemployment
and disability pipelines to early retirement as well as increases in the statutory minimum and
maximum retirement ages. With an already high revenue ratio, there is little scope for further
increases in the tax burden. Hence, revenue measures should focus on broadening the tax base, and
shifting from labor taxation to less distortionary consumption- and property-based taxation,
especially for LG, not least by reducing special treatments under the VAT and mortgage interest
deductibility.
44.
Improvements to the fiscal framework, notably for LG, would help achieve
sustainability. Expenditure ceilings for municipalities could contribute to slow down increases in
spending in LG. Reduced dependence on highly cyclical revenue sources would buttress long-term
budget planning. Additional mergers of municipalities would pave the way for economies of scale.
45.
To maintain potential growth amid the looming decline of working age cohorts and
aging, policies should encourage greater labor force participation and productivity. Apart from
raising statutory retirement ages, overhaul of tax and benefit systems ought to curtail disincentives
to enter or stay in the labor market. Moreover, public R&D expenditures should be refocused on
basic research rather than direct support to business R&D. Tuition fees and more reliance on loans
rather than grants for students would likely improve higher education efficiency. Additionally, the
large productivity differential between manufacturing and services should be reduced by opening
the service sector to more competition. Similarly, opening the health care sector to competition
could improve efficiency and help contain the buildup of aging pressures.
46.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the current
24-month cycle.

 = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and  = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [- (1+g (1+r1+g+ +g ) times previous period debt stock. increases with an appreciating domestic currency (> 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels

(iv) improving the synergies between the Bank of Finland’s
(BOF) Research and Financial Stability Divisions and the FINFSA. Exercise can be conducted quarterly.
Make available quarterly core financial soundness indicators
using the data dissemination system already in place.
Enhance the current framework to assess systemic risk by:
(i) using more detailed information on cross-border
exposures; (ii) including all nonbank elements of the financial
sector and cross-border linkages; (iii) establishing crossborder cooperation on systemic risk assessment with other
authorities; and (iv) integrating the framework in the set of
supervisory tools, to better feed into policy action.

Implemented.
Implemented: Regional MoU (2010); supervisory
colleges set up that use detailed quarterly liquidity
reports and closely monitor cross-border financial
institutions.

Safety Net

Supervision and Regulation
Improve FIN-FSA’s supervisory powers to impose
administrative fines and/or penalty payments beyond the
current securities markets related scope; increase the
maximum amount of such fines and penalties.

Partly implemented: Securities: Higher penalties and
stronger authority of FIN-FSA; insurance: FIN-FSA
lacking sanctioning power except for reporting issues;
banks: enhanced supervisory powers only with Basel III.

Increase the effectiveness of cross-border supervision,
including information sharing with home supervisors with
respect to the activity of foreign branches.

Largely implemented: Nordic/Baltic countries MoU
(08/2010) on exchange of information, enhanced
cooperation framework, and management and
resolution of cross-border systemic crises.

Increase the focus on liquidity risk, using the forthcoming
liquidity standard of FIN-FSA as a catalyst for detailed
analysis of supervised institutions’ funding profiles.

Implemented: BoF and FIN-FSA quarterly monitor banks'
liquidity and are in the process of developing liquidity
stress tests. Collateral availability and quality is reviewed
weekly bank by bank.

Further integrate procedures and practices of banking and
insurance supervision, with a view to enhancing FIN-FSA’s
analysis of the (consolidated) risk profile of complex financial
groups active in Finland.

Mostly implemented: Unified on-site inspection and
supervisory processes; cross-utilization of expertise in
supervising market risks and in model validation.

1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - (1+g  - g + (1+r]/(1+g++g)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate;  = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;  = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and  = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as (1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Table 10. Finland: Proposed Structural Fiscal Measures
Measure
Further pension reform:

 Raising retirement
age.
 Lowering accrual rate
for pension benefits.
 Tightening early
retirement.

Savings in health and
long-term care:

 Increase in user fees.
 Tightening
entitlements to
long-term care.
 Productivity increases.
 Benchmarking.

Rationale

Authorities’ View

The average effective retirement age was
around 60 in 2007, and the OECD
estimates that raising it to 67 would
suffice to close the sustainability gap.
Even partial movement would greatly
facilitate adjustment efforts. Sizable
savings could be accrued by lowering the
accrual rate for pension benefits—
particularly for periods of parental leave,
unemployment, and education—and
tightening early retirement via disability
or unemployment (disability pension
recipients total about 8½ percent of the
working age population, well above the
OECD average of 5¾ percent).

The authorities do not
dispute the need for such
measures. Steps already
taken are expected to raise
the effective retirement
age by close to two years,
and additional measures
are to be introduced
by 2017. Also, since 2010
new pensions are adjusted
downward as life
expectancy rises.

Health-care and long-term care
expenditure are projected by the EC to
rise to around 3¼ percent of GDP
by 2060 with population aging, due to
expensive advances in medical
technology and real income growth,
given high income elasticity of healthservices demand. Thus, an increase in
user fees could moderate demand
growth, although care should be taken to
prevent overburdening the chronically ill.
Tightening entitlements in long-term
care could spawn savings in an area
where aging pressures will be strong.
Productivity increases in health- and
long-term care of ½ percent a year
(which has been achieved in some OECD
countries) would significantly lower
upward projections for spending.
Domestic and international
benchmarking to identify best practices
would also be beneficial.

The authorities agree on
the need to contain costs
and increase productivity
and have made some
progress in these areas.
But they also emphasize
the need to keep extensive
availability of social
services given societal
preferences.

Table 10. Finland: Proposed Structural Fiscal Measures (concluded)
Measure
 Reform of local
government (LG):
 Reduce reliance on
corporate taxes and
enhance reliance on
property taxes.
 Ceiling on municipal
income tax rates.
 Broader competitive
bidding.
 Merger of municipalities.

Improved rate of return on
government financial assets.

Rationale

Authorities’ view

Spending at the municipal level has
grown faster than in the rest of the
general government (GG) and
municipality productivity has
declined by about 10 percent
over 2000–08. Reliance on corporate
taxes at the municipal level—which
have funded strong expenditure
increases in good times due to their
high cyclicality—ought to be
reduced, offset by higher property
taxation or, possibly, central
government (CG) transfers. A ceiling
on municipal income tax rates,
expenditure ceilings at the municipal
or local government level, and
restraint in the growth of CG
transfers would strengthen incentives
for LG spending consolidation. Also,
competitive bidding in the provision
of services to LGs should be
broadened to generate cost savings.
Finally, there is scope for efficiency
gains through mergers of
municipalities.

The authorities support the
measures in principle but
stress that the Finnish
constitution gives local
authorities broad autonomy.
Thus, the consensus of the
local government must be
sought prior to introducing
the reforms, which is not easy.
The authorities have put
forward a proposal for
mergers of municipalities but
any potential reform has been
postponed until after the
local elections in the autumn
of 2012.

General government financial assets
exceeded 100 percent of GDP
in 2010 and substantial portions of
these assets are low-yielding,
reflecting a cautious investment
approach. Given the large stock, an
asset management strategy that
generates a modest increase in
returns could make a significant
contribution to close the
sustainability gap.

The authorities are
considering options to do so
while limiting any significant
increase in risks.

III. PAST FUND STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS AND
IMPLEMENTATION
Past Staff Recommendations

Fiscal Policy

Although the general government deficit is
manageable, the overall fiscal position under
current policies remains unsustainable. While the
large fiscal impulse in 2009 was warranted from
a cyclical perspective, the composition of fiscal
measures raised concerns as not all would be
automatically reversed once growth resumed. A
strong and credible commitment to a measured
budget consolidation is required to restore
sustainability. Stronger consolidation would be
possible only if growth turns out to be more
robust than expected. The twin objectives of
reducing output and fiscal sustainability gaps
must be balanced. Fiscal adjustment efforts
should focus on expenditure restraint, notably at
the local level and via pension, old age and
healthcare reforms, as well as tax base
broadening, although scope remains for raising
indirect and property taxes. The efficiency of
public services needs to be increased.

Implementation

Local government reform is being discussed with
the aim of reducing the number of municipalities
to a smaller total, which can provide basic public
services more cost effectively and efficiently.
However, the decision has been postponed. The
standard VAT rate was increased by one
percentage point to 23 percent and energy taxes
were increased on average by 150 percent.
Excise duties were raised while the corporate
income tax rate was cut. Municipalities were
given a greater share of revenues, and also
raised municipal tax rates. Significant reforms in
the pension system were adopted in 2005 with
little action subsequently, though on
January 1, 2011 the age limit for the part-time
pension was increased to 60 years for individuals
born after 1952. Further plans include increasing
pension contributions by 0.4 percentage points
in both 2015 and 2016.

Labor Market Policy
The wage bargaining system needs to allow for
greater flexibility in wage setting. Measures are
needed to ease labor market mismatches, reduce
structural unemployment, and induce early entry
into the labor force. Reforms of tertiary
educational financing could also promote earlier
employment among the youth. At the other end
of the age spectrum, the unemployment pipelines
ought to be further restricted or eliminated.

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

The government has undertaken to expand labor
participation through reforms of the tax and
benefits system and intensified training. The
Finnish central-level labor market organizations
concluded a broad-based framework agreement in
October 2011. The new agreement sets the
framework for pay and cost increases in branchlevel collective agreements for a period of
25 months. Wage increases were moderated in
exchange for a 0.5 percent cut in the corporate
income tax. On education, in 2011 there was a
minor tightening of annual minimum
requirements for progress in study to qualify for
financial support, while university funding rules
remain unchanged. A social guarantee, coming

FINLAND

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

into force in 2012, will offer youth, within
3 months of becoming unemployed, a job,
on-the-job training, a study place, or a period in a
workshop or retraining.
Competition Policy
Increase competition in services (for example,
liberalizing shop operating hours) and product
markets, especially in ‘sheltered’ sectors, to
boost productivity growth.

Finland has raised R&D investment to 4 percent
of GDP in 2010 in line with its target. The
government will review the use of R&D tax
incentives over direct subsidies for businesses
and start-ups. The 2011 Competition Act
brought regulation in line with
recommendations from the European
Commission. It allows for stricter merger control,
enhanced damage compensation,
whistle-blowing instruments, and expanded
investigative powers for the Finnish Competition
Authority.

Financial Sector Policy
Actions in support of the financial system have
been appropriate but bank cost efficiency should
be improved, while excessive risk-taking
avoided. Supervision and crisis management
frameworks for large cross-border institutions
must also be strengthened. A bank-specific
resolution regime would render the process
faster and more cost-effective. Vigilance on
liquidity risk and banks’ funding and risk profiles
should be stepped up. There is also scope to
further strengthen the analytical frameworks for
stress testing and systemic risk assessment.
Intense competition has reduced banks’ net
interest margins. Further cost reductions will be
important as funding stresses, associated with
the euro area sovereign debt crisis, could persist.

A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on
financial stability, crisis management and crisis
resolution was signed by the ministries of
finance, central banks, and financial supervisory
authorities in Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland,
Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, and Sweden. The
supervisory authorities of the participating
countries also set up a cross-border stability
group. A uniform financial sector stress test was
conducted between March and May 2012 by the
FIN-FSA in cooperation with supervised entities.
Supervision exercises were more risk-based
throughout 2011 and on-site inspection activity
increased.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Finland
August 27, 2012

1.
This statement summarizes developments in Finland since the issuance of the
staff report (www.imf.org). The additional information does not change the thrust of the
staff appraisal.
2.
Economic developments in 2011 have proven somewhat weaker than indicated in
the staff report, while staff now also projects lower growth in 2013.
•
Recent revisions to the official data reveal that real GDP growth in 2011 reached
2.7 percent, down from the 2.9 percent previously estimated. In addition, revisions to
the current account statistics now put the corresponding 2011 deficit at 1.2 percent of
GDP, compared to 0.7 percent of GDP before.
•
Real GDP growth for 2013 is now expected at 1.4 percent (compared to 1.6 percent in
the staff report), reflecting up-to-date information pointing to a longer-lasting period
of weak growth than anticipated in the staff report, owing to continuation of the
weakness in the euro area. In particular, new orders in manufacturing continued their
worsening trend in June and consumer confidence has deteriorated.
3.
Staff projects the 2012 headline fiscal balance to be also slightly weaker. The
deficit for 2012 is now expected at 1.3 percent of GDP (compared to 1.1 percent before),
partly owing to lower-than-expected tax collections, which has prompted a downward
revision of general government revenue.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Finland
On August 27, 2012 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Finland. 1
Background
While Finland has strong fundamentals and a track record of good policies, the near-term
economic outlook is highly vulnerable to external developments. This owes in particular to the
high export dependence and financial sector interlinkages with other Nordic countries.
Spillovers to Finland have already been significant with growth decelerating at end-2011 as the
euro area sovereign debt crisis intensified. Although Finland has benefited from safe-haven
status during the European sovereign debt turmoil so far, risks to the outlook are tilted to the
downside.
After the deep recession of 2008–09, the Finnish economy rebounded robustly in 2010 but the
sovereign debt turmoil in the euro area dragged it to a standstill in late 2011. Though activity in
the first quarter of 2012 turned out slightly stronger than expected, weak investment continued
to point to a deteriorating growth outlook, consistent with a deterioration in construction and
producer confidence indicators. The unemployment rate came down gradually in 2011, after a
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
moderate increase during the 2008–09 crisis partly due to labor hoarding, but it ceased to
improve in the second quarter of 2012. Meanwhile, inflation started to moderate in the second
half of 2011 after the effects of indirect tax increases waned. While competitiveness remains
adequate it has deteriorated markedly as Finland continued to lose export market shares during
the past decade, and for the first time in nearly two decades recorded a small current account
deficit in 2011.
The banking system has remained generally sound despite the increasing strains in the euro
area financial markets. Capital comfortably exceeds regulatory requirements and the nonperforming loan rate remains low, though it increased somewhat during 2011. However, banks’
operating profits have declined amid weakening interest income and increased competition for
retail business. In addition, the Finnish banking sector is highly concentrated with a majority of
assets controlled by subsidiaries of foreign Nordic banks, exposing it to the risk of short-term
funding shortfall and financial-sector spillovers from a potential intensification of the euro area
crisis. The insurance and pension fund sectors have weathered the ongoing crisis well, though
the insurance sector has suffered a reduction in solvency margins during 2010–11.
Nonetheless, these still remain high and well above regulatory minima. Household debt has
risen rapidly during the past decade and now accounts for more than 110 percent of disposable
income, while house prices appear broadly in line with fundamentals.
The fiscal position improved markedly in 2011 after a sharp deterioration in 2009. As fiscal
policy turned to support growth through automatic stabilizers and discretionary budget stimulus,
the general government budget position worsened by about 7 percentage points of GDP in
2009 but remained below the Maastricht deficit limit in 2009–10. With some policy tightening
and continued economic recovery into 2011, the headline deficit of the general government
improved markedly to less than 1 percent of GDP, and gross debt, while continuing to increase,
ended 2011 at below 50 percent of GDP. Nonetheless, projected weak growth in 2012 will likely
result in a renewed worsening of the headline deficit and population aging remains a challenge
for long-term fiscal sustainability.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Finland’s strong economic fundamentals and continued sound
policy management. Directors noted, however, that as a small open economy, with deep trade
and financial linkages, the country is sensitive to adverse spillovers from the turmoil in the euro
area. Economic activity has slowed and risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. The
economy also faces longer-term challenges arising from an aging population and slowing
productivity, which could impact competitiveness and growth. Against this backdrop, Directors
welcomed the authorities’ commitment to prudent policies aimed at improving internal and
external imbalances, safeguarding financial sector stability, and ensuring long-term fiscal
sustainability.

3

Directors welcomed that the banking sector is sound and well capitalized. In light of the high
dependence on wholesale funding and foreign parent banks, they emphasized the importance
of gradually building up bank capital and liquidity buffers. This will also be important with regard
to the transition to Basel III and the additional efforts needed for some individual institutions to
satisfy leverage ratio and liquidity requirements.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ plans to strengthen macroprudential supervision and
underscored the need to strengthen limits to loan-to-value ratios and to introduce a national
loan registry to guard against excessive borrowing. They also recommended close monitoring of
banks’ risk-taking behavior given the vulnerability of households to a rapid rise in the interest
rate owing to the large share of variable-rate loans.
Directors highlighted the need to enhance cross-country supervision and crisis resolution
frameworks in response to increased cross-border banking activities and the prominent role of
large international groups. While a common bank-resolution framework-along with a common
enforcement mechanism—at the EU level is preferable, most Directors noted that national or
regional plans should be designed in the interim.
Directors supported the current broadly neutral fiscal stance and the authorities’ adjustment
plan aimed at addressing long-term fiscal challenges and closing the sustainability gap. They
agreed that automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate if downside risks materialize, and
many Directors saw merit in a flexible approach to implementing medium-term consolidation
plans, in particular if growth underperforms significantly.
Directors observed that fiscal efforts should focus on mitigating the expected rise in health and
long-term care costs and further tightening unemployment and disability pipelines to early
retirement as well as increasing the statutory minimum and maximum retirement age. On the
revenue side, they recommended broadening the tax base and a shift from labor taxation to
consumption and property-based taxation. Improvements to the fiscal framework to slow down
increases in local government spending could also help achieve sustainability.
To boost potential growth and competitiveness, Directors emphasized the need for reforming
the labor market and improving productivity. They welcomed the recent steps to increase the
effective retirement age and adjust pension entitlements, but highlighted the need for further
efforts towards greater labor force participation. They also recommended refocusing public R&D
expenditures toward basic research, further competition in the service sector, and increased
flexibility in wage setting.

Statement by Benny Andersen, Executive Director for Finland
and Kari Korhonen, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director
August 27, 2012
The Finnish authorities once again welcome the candid dialogue with the mission and agree
on balance with the findings presented in the staff report.
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
The authorities share the staff’s views on recent developments and outlook. Following the
onset of the global financial crisis Finland’s economy plummeted in 2009, but recovered well
during 2010, driven by external demand and strong residential building construction, and has
weathered the euro area (EA) crisis relatively well until the end of 2011, supported by robust
private consumption and investment. This is largely due to the fact that at the outbreak of the
crisis there were no major imbalances in the Finnish economy.
However, the outlook has recently deteriorated due to the deepening and prolonging of the
EA sovereign debt crisis. GDP declined by 0.3 percent in Q2 of 2012 from the same period
of last year. Growth is expected to come almost entirely from private consumption in 2012.
The latest forecast by the Ministry of Finance as of June sees an annual rate of growth of
1.2 percent in 2013.
Last year, exports declined in volume terms by close to 1 percent and the trade balance
moved into a deficit. This year, exports are forecast to grow only slowly owing to weak
demand in our main export markets in Europe. Finland’s international competitiveness has
deteriorated since 2010 and this is reflected in some loss of market share. Consumer price
inflation peaked at 3.7 percent in July 2011, but has since decelerated to 2.9 percent this past
July. The Ministry of Finance forecasts the harmonized inflation rate to moderate from
3.0 percent in 2012 to 2.4 percent in 2013.
In line with the deceleration of economic activity, the increase in employment came to a
standstill by the end of 2011. The risk of higher than forecast unemployment rate is
warranted, in particular, if the uncertain situation and weaker confidence were to continue
both in Finland and in the rest of Europe. The recent announcement by Nokia of a substantial
cut of jobs in Finland along with other companies’ layoff news is reflected in the latest
confidence surveys that show increased pessimism. Employment in the public sector
increased during the past two years. There is pressure to increase staffing in the social
services sector, in particular in health and old age care. Hence, it is expected that public
sector employment will continue to increase in spite of the tight fiscal situation in
municipalities.
In spite of the EA crisis, the state of the financial system has remained stable in Finland. The
low ECB policy rates have had a positive impact on the economy. Moreover, Finland has

2
been able to afford expansionary fiscal policies when needed in order to support employment
and growth. Households have clearly benefited from the low interest rate environment and
have not been forced to deleverage. The authorities have, however, repeatedly cautioned
banks/households about the risks of excessive lending/borrowing for housing and
consumption.
Risks to the Outlook
The authorities agree with staff on the risks to the outlook presented in the staff report. The
current account has turned from a sizeable surplus in the past decade into a small deficit.
There are several explanations for this outcome such as sector-specific problems in the
forestry and electronics industries, adverse commodity price developments and weakened
international competitiveness since 2010. Given the low interest rates since 2009, household
consumption and housing investments have been boosted by debt-financing. This
development has contributed to the rebalancing of the current account. While the current
account deficit is still small, and its financing does not pose a problem, it nevertheless points
to a risk of emerging external imbalance should the deficit continue to grow.
Regarding the stability of the financial system, spillovers due to the EA crisis pose
potentially serious risks for Finland as well. As pointed out by staff, the risks from domestic
sources emanate mainly from mortgage financing, which is mostly linked to very short-term
interest rates. The authorities agree with staff that the household debt could burden the riskbearing capacity of Finland’s financial system and the economy in the longer term if it
continues to increase as it has in the past few years.
In view of the weakened economic outlook in Finland and in her main trading partners, the
risk of higher unemployment has become more evident over the summer. The authorities do
share staff’s concern about the risks facing the economy in the short and longer term and are
committed to implementing policies that aim for a better internal and external balance and
maintenance of financial sector stability.
Financial stability
The authorities concur with staff’s view that the main risks to Finland’s financial stability
originate currently from the EA crisis. A mitigating factor for the banking sector is the fact
that the Nordic banks operating in Finland are only moderately exposed to the EA crisis
countries.
Staff and the authorities agree that while the banking sector is currently sound and meets the
minimum capital and conservation buffer requirements envisaged under Basel III, some
institutions would benefit from stronger capital and especially liquidity buffers in order to
better withstand adverse market conditions. The authorities will encourage the financial
sector to build up capital and liquidity buffers gradually in order not to induce deleveraging.

3
With regard to staff’s recommendation on an extra capital charge for SIFIs, a high level
working group is analyzing whether such a charge should be implemented through the
Finnish legislation.
On the bank funding situation, staff and authorities agree that a worsening of the EA crisis
has the potential to put wholesale funding at risk, because the Finnish banking sector is
highly concentrated and largely dependent of wholesale funding.
The increase of cross-border banking activities requires commensurate strengthening of the
supervision and regulation framework for the maintenance of financial stability at all times.
Accordingly the authorities envisage a continued enhancement of cross-border cooperation
bringing benefits to all parties involved. While they appreciate the current cross-border
cooperation agreed in the Memoranda of Understanding, they see merit in making them more
effective. The recent initiative to move towards a Banking Union at EU/EA level in a
relatively short timeframe is a major step forward in strengthening cross-border supervision.
The recovery and resolution framework for banks should be developed. This issue was
discussed also during the 2010 and 2011 consultations and the authorities voiced their
preference for a common EU-level framework. For the authorities, the latest (June 2012)
proposal by the EU Commission for an EU recovery and resolution directive provides a good
basis to move forward in this area. Similarly, the pending FSAP recommendation on the
supervisory framework for bank-assurance will be accomplished when implementing the new
EU regulations (CRD4 and Financial Conglomerates Directive).
House prices and household debt increased strongly in Finland before the financial crisis, as
in most other developed economies, but the level of household debt remained relatively low
in international comparison. There are no clear indications of real overvaluation in Finnish
house prices; rather they are in line with fundamentals.
Nevertheless, the authorities are well aware of the potential risks emanating in the housing
market in view of the uncertain economic outlook and rising unemployment. The authorities
have cautioned households of being perhaps overly optimistic about their future income
growth and the continuation of the very low level of interest rates as more or less permanent.
Likewise, the authorities have reminded the mortgage lenders of requiring adequate down
payments from borrowers and calculations of mortgage servicing capacity at significantly
higher interest rates than at the current historically low rates. It seems that the authorities’
advice is working, because the latest data on individual mortgages shows that interest
margins are on the rise and that borrowers are motivated to lower the interest margin by
increasing their down payments, which reduces Loan-to-Value ratios (LTV).
Staff’s advice to policymakers for mitigating risks of household debt is to design policy tools
which could be implemented quickly in order to moderate debt growth in case that is deemed

4
necessary. For instance, setting binding LTV ratios would be one such potential tool, and the
authorities welcome the plan to legislate such powers for the FIN-FSA. Banks would also
start to report standardized LTV ratios to the supervisor in the future. Staff suggested the
establishment of national loan registry, whose implementation – and effectiveness as a
macro-prudential tool – in Finland will be explored. Traditionally, Finnish homeowners are
reliable mortgage borrowers, firstly, because the homeownership is the most common form
for building equity and, secondly, affordable rental housing for family needs is scarce.
Fiscal policy
The authorities share the staff’s view on the fiscal position and fiscal policy stance. The
government’s fiscal strategy is focused on the achievement of long-term sustainability. The
government is committed to a substantial reduction in the central government debt-to-GDP
ratio by 2015 as well as to cutting central government deficit to below 1 percent of GDP.
In view of the weakened economic outlook, the government is looking into new measures to
revive economic activity and to build up consumer and industry confidence. Continuation of
structural reforms plays an important role in this respect. In spite of the formidable challenge
the government now faces, it is determined to continue fiscal consolidation within the
Government Program for 2012-2015. The closing of the fiscal sustainability gap as planned
does not allow slippages.
The plan ahead is as follows: during spring of 2013, after the government has made an
assessment of the progress in the Program targets, additional revenue and expenditure
measures will be determined, if needed, to keep the Program on track.
Even though the Finnish general government deficits and debt are relatively low compared to
those of many other countries, bringing the debt ratio on a declining path is a must and will
enable Finland to maintain the AAA rating. Demographic ageing reduces potential growth,
increases age-related spending and poses a tough challenge on the sustainability of public
finances. This challenge has been aggravated by the deterioration of the public finances in
the wake of the financial crisis. Tax revenue has dropped, while public expenditure has
continued to grow. In relation to GDP, public expenditure is expected to remain at an
elevated level in the next few years despite recent consolidation measures.
Closing the sustainability gap of 4¼ percent over 10 years implies now an adjustment of
½ percent of GDP per annum. The authorities agree with staff on the suggested measures to
achieve sustainability. These measures are in line with the ones already discussed during the
2010 consultation and the 2011 staff visit. They are included in the government’s program.
There is full agreement between staff and the authorities on the fact that the scope for
increasing income taxation is limited and that the tax base should be broadened to taxing

5
consumption, energy and property. Staff’s suggestion to eliminate items on reduced VAT
deserves merit, but the authorities have faced opposition, for instance, on the grounds that
raising VAT on food items would mainly hurt persons on fixed incomes, low income earners
and families with dependent children. The lower VAT rates were earlier introduced on some
services in order to raise demand for them and thus generate employment in the service
sector, which is the fastest growing sector in terms of employment.
On the expenditure side, the government is currently working on measures to limit the
growth of fiscal expenditures related to old age care and thus preparing in advance for the
future aging related costs. In this vein, the ongoing project of municipal mergers is expected
to have a significant impact on containing costs when the baby boom generation reaches the
age of 75 and over in about 10 years.
The issue of tuition fees appears regularly in the consultation discussions concerning saving
in the tertiary education, which up to now has been free in Finland. There is a strong
consensus in the Finnish society that education should be provided free of charge to those
who qualify, and reforms should not lead to less equal opportunities and limit upward
mobility. In fact, measures have been already taken to speed up the graduation from tertiary
education by limiting the number of years of obtaining educational grants. This financial
incentive has already had an impact by shortening the average time spent toward graduation
with Master’s degrees.
Structural reforms to promote growth
Upon observations of the structural reforms recommended by Fund staff during the
Article IV consultations of the past decade, one finds that there has been significant progress
on most of them such as the pension reform, lengthening of working life on both ends and
municipal consolidation. It takes time to garner political support for major structural reforms,
but the prevailing negotiation process involving the authorities at the central and local level,
and employee and employer organizations has turned out to be a workable model.
In the social services sector, the authorities see room for more private-public partnership in
order to provide diversification of services and to enhance cost efficiency. There is also room
for improvement to find a better balance between unemployment benefits and incentives to
work such that accepting employment would become clearly preferable to living on benefits
and transfers.
Also, promoting competition in various sectors of the economy would increase potential
output. International cost-competitiveness of Finnish production must be enhanced such that
further weakening of the external balance is to be avoided. At the same time, increased
flexibility in wage setting at the firm and industry level is needed. This would promote costcompetitiveness and the ability of the economy to adapt to changes.
