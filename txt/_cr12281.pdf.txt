STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 13, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Background. The economy continues to recover at a steady pace, buoyed by strong
activity in the oil and gold sectors, as well as public investment. In the wake of the
January 2011 devaluation and concurrent increase in taxes, the fiscal balance shifted
from a deficit of 3 percent of GDP in 2010 to a surplus of 1 percent in 2011. The
balance of payment also strengthened significantly, boosting reserves to nearly
US$1 billion (5¼ months of imports) at end-2011. With still-tight monetary conditions,
12-month inflation dropped to 3.6 percent in May 2012, from a peak of over
22 percent in April 2011.
Focus of discussions. Discussions focused on the need to continue building on the
sound policies implemented over the past 18 months, in order to sustain
macroeconomic stability and boost long-term growth. Staff advised the authorities to
save surplus mineral revenues for future generations and to continue restraining
current spending growth while resisting large, backward-looking wage increases. With
respect to capital outlays, staff recommended carefully selecting and prioritizing
investments in human and physical capital.
Exchange system. In the wake of the devaluation, the authorities established a
currency band (SRD 3.25–3.35 per US$1) within which foreign exchange market
transactions are allowed to take place. Suriname maintains multiple currency practices
subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 3.
Past surveillance. During the 2011 Article IV consultation, Executive Directors
encouraged the authorities to tighten fiscal and monetary policies to avoid the
development of a wage-price spiral. In the aftermath of the January 2011 devaluation,
the authorities did tighten policies significantly, contributing to an impressive
stabilization of the economy, with the fiscal accounts improving noticeably and
inflation coming down to lower single digits.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
The pace of economic activity has remained strong, and inflation pressures have
abated considerably (Figure 1). Newly-released national accounts data, rebased to 2007, show
that the level of nominal GDP in 2010 was about 20 percent higher than previously assessed (Box 1).
After slowing to 3 percent in 2009, economic growth picked up to just over 4 percent in both 2010
and 2011, supported by robust activity in the oil

2.
The fiscal balance strengthened markedly in 2011 (Figure 2). Despite a significant drop
in grants (1¼ percent of GDP), on account of the near-depletion of the Netherlands Treaty Funds,
the fiscal balance shifted from a deficit of about 3 percent of GDP in 2010 to an estimated surplus
of just under 1 percent in 2011. Revenue benefitted from:


The positive impact on tax collections from
the devaluation;



A spike in direct taxes, driven primarily by
record profits in the oil and gold sectors;



Stronger indirect tax collections, thanks to
higher taxes on domestic fuel products
(January 2011) and on alcohol, tobacco,
and casinos (October 2011); and

Box 1. Rebasing the National Accounts
Suriname’s national accounts estimates have undergone a major revision. Current and
constant price estimates of GDP by production were revised and rebased from 1990 to 2007,
using improved and updated methodologies. The broader coverage (including with respect to
financial intermediation), and the conceptual and methodological changes and improvements
(using System of National Accounts 1993 concepts and methods) led to higher estimates of
nominal GDP. On average, nominal GDP was revised upward during 2007–2010 by about
18.5 percent. Real GDP growth rates have also been affected, albeit only slightly.

The composition of the economy has not changed considerably. The main contributors to
GDP growth remain mining and quarrying, manufacturing, and trade. However, while the mining
and quarrying sector is contributing less to GDP under the revised estimates (down from
19 percent to 8 percent), the contributions of manufacturing (which includes the processing and
refining of bauxite, gold, and oil) and, particularly,

The higher nominal GDP estimates affected the
main fiscal and external ratios proportionally. For
instance, the debt ratio in 2010 was about
3 percentage points of GDP lower under the revised
GDP estimates. Another example is per capita GDP,
which increased in 2010 from US$ 6,123 under the old

Box 2. Suriname’s Oil Trade Balance
While Suriname produces moderate volumes of crude oil,
it remains a net importer of oil. Staatsolie, the state-owned
oil company, is the sole producer and exporter of oil in
Suriname, with a production volume of about 6 million barrels
of crude oil per year. However, given the lack of refining
capacity, a large portion of Staatsolie’s crude oil production is
exported, while refined petroleum products such as gasoline
and diesel are imported. Overall, the oil balance is in a small
deficit, amounting in value terms to 1.3 percent of GDP during
2010 and 2011.

While high oil prices increase the oil import bill, they also
112.3
tend to raise Staatsolie’s profitability and its contribution
to Suriname’s public finances. An automatic pricing mechanism ensures that domestic petrol prices
at the pump are not subsidized and move in tandem with international oil prices. Meanwhile, given
that Staatsolie’s crude oil production costs are well below international market prices, its overall
operations are not only very profitable, but also improve with rising oil prices. In 2011, Staatsolie’s
profits before taxes amounted to about US$467 million (about 10¼ percent of GDP). Being wholly
state owned, its contributions to government revenue during that year amounted to just under US$300
million (6.5 percent of GDP), mainly in the form of corporate tax and dividends payments, and
equivalent to one quarter of total government revenue.

Over the past few years, the realized price for Staatsolie’s crude oil sales has increased
substantially. Apart from the general upward movement in international oil prices, the benchmark
price for Staatsolie’s crude oil (U.S. Gulf Coast No. 6, 3 percent sulfur) has risen more sharply than other
reference prices, due to idiosyncratic developments in the oil market. Thus, between 2005 and 2011,
the price for Suriname’s oil increased by 161 percent, while that of APSP (the simple average of the
spot prices for Brent, West Texas Intermediate, and Dubai) rose by 95 percent.

With the completion of a US$700 million new refinery, the structure of Suriname’s oil trade will
change significantly. At present, Staatsolie exports (including sales to ships) about 60 percent of its
total crude oil production, up from 40 percent in 2007. The remaining balance is sold to SURALCO, the
aluminum mining and refining company, and EBS, the state-owned electricity company. Once the
refinery is completed in 2014, Staatsolie’s refining capacity will more than double, potentially covering
all its crude oil production. With a higher value added accruing domestically, the oil trade balance will
improve, as locally-refined petroleum products replace those that are currently being imported.

On the expenditure side, savings on wages (1 percent of GDP) and spending on goods and services
(0.6 percent of GDP) were offset in part by a jump in capital spending (1.1 percent of GDP),
reflecting stepped-up implementation of large donor-financed public infrastructure projects. The
authorities also appeared to have cleared most domestic payments arrears, estimated at about
SRD 100 million at end-2010 (0.7 percent of GDP). The non-mineral fiscal deficit remained practically
unchanged in 2011, at just over 7 percent of GDP.

The exchange rate has stabilized, and the balance of payments has improved
significantly. Since the devaluation, the parallel market premium has practically disappeared.
Meanwhile, mineral exports, particularly gold, have increased considerably, reflecting both higher
prices and volumes. The trade surplus rose markedly in 2011, but this improvement was more than
offset by a deterioration in the services and income accounts, reflecting in part higher profit

5.
The authorities have now cleared all their longstanding external payments arrears. In
July 2011, Suriname signed an agreement with the United States to repay, over a period of three
years, the last of its outstanding external payments arrears (US$32 million), which had accumulated
since the 1990s. In May 2012, the authorities paid off the remaining balance on this loan (US$21.6
million) ahead of schedule. In recent months, citing the clearance of all external payments arrears
and the improved economic outlook, both Fitch and Standard and Poor’s upgraded Suriname’s
sovereign debt rating by one notch, to B+ and BB-, respectively.2

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
6.
Building on the macroeconomic stabilization in 2011, the medium-term economic
outlook is favorable. Continued strong commodity prices and FDI inflows would help improve the
balance of payments and raise international reserves to very comfortable levels.


Large planned private and public investments in the mining, energy, and transportation
sectors are expected to boost construction activities in the short term and raise the
country’s growth potential in the medium term.3 As a result, growth is expected to pick up
to about 5 percent over the coming years.



Staff presented to the authorities an illustrative medium-term scenario that would bring the
non-mineral fiscal deficit back to around 5 percent of GDP, similar to the level that was
achieved prior to the 2009 deterioration. This would be consistent with an overall fiscal
surplus of 1–1½ percent of GDP over the medium term—with significantly higher surpluses
in the longer term, once revenues from major resource projects (gold, oil refining, and
bauxite) materialize.



The proposed fiscal path would allow the authorities to sustain increased levels of public
investment, aimed at developing the country’s human and physical capital. The fiscal
surplus would also provide for a gradual decline in the already-low public debt levels, while
setting aside some savings in the proposed sovereign wealth and stabilization fund
(Appendix I).

2

On July 10, 2012, Fitch upgraded Suriname’s sovereign debt rating by another step to BB-.

3

Of these, the expansion of Staatsolie’s oil refinery at a cost of US$700 million (about 15 percent of GDP) is on course
to be completed by April 2014. Other oil drilling and exploration activities are also continuing in both on- and offshore fields.

7.
While the economic outlook for Suriname is positive, it is predicated on a benign
external environment and continued buoyant commodity prices. The recent international
financial crisis was accompanied by a sustained increase in gold and international oil prices—despite
some weakening in recent weeks. Should commodity prices fall significantly and remain at low levels
for a prolonged period of time, affecting all of Suriname’s major commodity exports, this would
negatively impact Suriname’s economy. The authorities recognized that under such an adverse
confluence of events, economic activity and government revenue would decline considerably, and
planned investments in the mineral sector might be put on hold or cancelled altogether. They
agreed that the best way to mitigate these risks was for them to continue building buffers and
reserves in the near term. Over the medium term, they agreed to press ahead with meaningful
structural reforms that would strengthen the country’s human capital and institutions, thereby
helping to diversify economic activity in Suriname.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
8.
Policy discussions focused on the challenges faced by the authorities in the context of
expected strong growth over the medium term. There was general agreement that the policies
implemented in recent years have helped set the stage for strong and sustainable growth. The
authorities agreed on the need to ensure that public finances remain well managed and the
domestic financial market is appropriately regulated and supervised. In the area of public finances,
there was agreement that it would be critical, as mineral revenues increase over the medium term,
to save the surpluses for future generations. In this context, the authorities reiterated their plans to
establish a sovereign wealth fund (SWF) by year’s end. They also reaffirmed their plans to restrain
current spending growth, with a view to making space for carefully selected and executed capital
projects. Staff and the authorities also concurred that there might be some space for easing
monetary conditions in the coming months, provided that inflation and demand pressures remained
in check.

A. Fiscal policies
9.
The authorities reaffirmed the importance that they attach to maintaining strong
fiscal policies. They indicated that they were aiming at achieving a small overall surplus in the
accounts of the central government in 2012, as in 2011. The sharp improvement registered in the
fiscal accounts in 2011 had enabled the authorities to put on hold their envisaged plans to raise the
sales tax rate by 2 percentage points and reinstate the motor vehicle tax. At the same time, however,
they have reiterated their plans of introducing a VAT system by end-2013.4 Staff encouraged them
to press ahead with their efforts in that area and, in view of the need to strengthen the domestic
non-mineral revenue base, recommended that the proposed VAT system aim at enhancing revenue.
10.
The authorities are also aiming at boosting tax collections from the informal gold
sector. So far, progress in collecting a fairer share of revenue from the growing informal gold sector
has been slow. The authorities explained that their work in this area had been hampered by the lack
of adequate administrative capacity and the inaccessibility of the regions where informal mining is
taking place. Staff encouraged them to pass legislation that would enable them to increase
collections from the informal gold sector through higher license fees or other presumptive taxation
schemes.
11.
Staff advised the authorities to maintain tight controls on current spending. Average
non-interest current spending during 2009–10 was about 2 percent of GDP higher than in the
previous two years, driven mainly by marked increases in spending on civil service wages and goods
and services. While the authorities succeeded in stemming this trend in 2011, staff encouraged them
to seek further gains over the medium term in this area, by ensuring that current spending increases
at a slower rate than nominal GDP. In this context, staff underscored the importance for the 2012
civil service wage settlements to be forward looking and reflect the improved outlook for stable
prices. Staff also noted that this year’s round of civil service wage negotiations was being closely
watched by the private sector, and its outcome would be critical to preserving Suriname’s
international competitiveness. With respect to social policies, the authorities agreed that it was
important to rationalize and improve the targeting of transfers programs to the most vulnerable
groups. They considered that this would help open fiscal space for sustaining higher levels of capital
investments. The authorities noted that they were availing themselves of technical assistance from
the Fund and the IADB to strengthen their public expenditure management capabilities.
12.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ plans to establish a SWF. The President’s
announcement in October 2011 that his government would work toward establishing a Sovereign
Wealth and Stabilization Fund was met with widespread support across the political spectrum and
civil society. It underscores the importance of maintaining prudent fiscal policies that would allow
the government to save surplus mineral revenues and accumulate buffers that can be used in the
4

This project, which is supported by technical assistance from CARTAC and FAD, has fallen behind schedule, and the
authorities will need to step up their implementation efforts significantly to launch the VAT system in the second half
of 2013.

event of negative shocks. Staff advised the authorities to ensure that the proposed fund is clear in its
mandate, has an efficient and representative governance structure, and is transparent in its
operations and finances. It will also be important that the legislation establishing the SWF clearly
defines the rules and conditions governing the payments into, and withdrawals from, the fund, as
well as its main objectives.
13.
Suriname’s public debt is among the lowest in the region. Following the successful
clearance of the arrears with the United States, Suriname has no external payments arrears
outstanding. The strong fiscal performance in 2011 also allowed the authorities to clear short-term
arrears to domestic suppliers. At present, Suriname’s

expertise. In that respect, the authorities noted that
the IADB has raised its lending portfolio to Suriname to US$300 million for the period 2011–15, in
support of programs to strengthen government institutions, diversify the economy, and improve the
social safety net. The authorities agreed with staff that it was important for them to strengthen their
capacity to select, plan, and implement large capital projects across relevant line ministries,
including public works.

B. Monetary and exchange rate policies
14.
Staff’s computations suggest that the exchange rate level is broadly in line with
fundamentals (Appendix II). The introduction of a band, within which the Suriname dollar has
been trading vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, has served the country well. Calculations using 2009 data
pointed to a substantial overvaluation prior to the January 2011 devaluation. All three CGER
methods suggest that the current exchange rate presently lies near, or somewhat below the
equilibrium exchange rate. The positive external environment, combined with prudent domestic
policies, has allowed for a comfortable build-up of reserves and contributed to a stable foreign
currency market.
15.
Suriname maintains multiple currency practices (MCPs). These arise from: (i) the
existing spread of more than 2 percent between the buying and the selling rates in the official
market for the government’s foreign exchange transactions; and (ii) from the potential spread of
more than 2 percent between the official rates for government transactions and those in the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SURINAME

commercial markets. Staff recommended that the authorities eliminate the remaining MCPs, by
narrowing the current exchange rate band to less than two percent.5 Staff also advised the
authorities to move toward a more market-determined exchange rate regime over time. While
agreeing in principle, the authorities pointed to the continued volatility in international markets as
well as the extreme sensitivity attached to foreign exchange market developments by economic
agents in Suriname. Against this backdrop, they argued that this was not an opportune time to
introduce further reforms in this market.
16.
Monetary conditions have been appropriately tight in the wake of the devaluation,
and there may be space for the central bank to gradually loosen its stance in the future. Over
the past year, tight financial policies have contributed to a sharp reduction in inflation to lower
single digits. As noted, in recent months the government also switched from a position of net
borrower from the domestic banking system to that of a net depositor. Against this background,
and assuming that moderate wage settlements in the public and private sectors are concluded, staff
considered that there may be room for a somewhat more accommodative monetary policy stance in
the second half of this year by gradually reducing reserve requirements. The authorities agreed that
their policy actions would greatly depend on the outcome of ongoing wage negotiations. They also
indicated that they planned to gradually move away from reserve requirements, which remain the
central bank’s primary monetary policy tool, and toward a more market-based framework. The Fund
has been providing the authorities with technical assistance in developing indirect monetary policy
instruments.

C. Financial sector policies

As of end-June 2012, the spread was about 3 percent.

In recent years, significant progress has been made toward de-dollarizing the loan
portfolio of banks. Measured at a constant exchange rate, the ratio of foreign currency credit to
total credit declined significantly between 2007 and 2010, before leveling off in 2011. During that
period, however, the ratio of foreign currency deposits to total deposits remained broadly stable.
This development reflected in part the

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

this would help financial institutions internalize better the risks of lending in foreign currency. The
authorities saw merit in these measures and agreed with staff that, ultimately, de-dollarization would
remain a gradual process that can be best achieved through sustained efforts to promote
macroeconomic and political stability. Staff also recommended that the authorities monitor real
estate prices closely, with a view to identifying and forestalling any emergence of asset-price
inflation at an early stage. The monetary authorities indicated that they planned to seek expert
advice in this area from abroad.
18.
After several years of preparation, a new Bank Supervision Law (BSL) was enacted in
2011. Staff welcomed the new law, which benefitted from Fund technical assistance and has
bolstered the regulatory regime and supervisory powers of the central bank considerably. Building
on this legal framework, it advised the authorities to take steps to strengthen the Supervision
Department, introduce more rigorous training of staff, and reinforce supervisory procedures and
practices. Staff welcomed the authorities’ ongoing efforts to issue prudential regulations for financial
institutions in the areas of risk management, corporate governance, consolidated supervision, and
audit and licensing procedures. The authorities explained that they had recently engaged a longterm foreign expert to advise them on strengthening the Supervision Department’s work.
19.
Commercial banks are generally well capitalized, although the financial position of
three small state-owned banks remains weak. Commercial bank profitability, which had declined
in recent years, has stabilized since the devaluation. The nonperforming loan (NPL) ratio for the
banking sector as a whole has remained practically unchanged over the past three years, at about
8 percent. Staff noted that there was considerable variance among banks, with the NPL ratio for the
three small state-owned banks standing at about twice the system’s average. An MCM mission
advised the authorities on options to address the weaknesses of three small state-owned banks. The
authorities explained that, in line with MCM’s recommendations, they had recently engaged an
external auditor to conduct a proper valuation of these banks’ assets and liabilities. Based on the
outcome of the audits, they plan to develop a strategy for these institutions.
20.
The authorities agreed with staff that further efforts are needed to improve their
anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regime. The 2009
Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF) assessment report shows overall low compliance with
the international AML/CFT standards. While progress has been made with the enactment of a law
criminalizing the financing of terrorism in 2011, bills are pending regarding the reporting of
suspicious transactions and customer due diligence. Staff noted that, once enacted, this revised legal
framework would need to be effectively implemented.

D. Structural issues
21.
The authorities are taking steps to improve the management of large state-owned
enterprises. Some of these enterprises suffer from structural and institutional weaknesses that had
been aggravated by the large increases in public sector wages granted during 2009–11. Staff
encouraged the authorities to provide more light on the complex system of cross-subsidization and
arrears accumulation within the public sector, especially with respect to the production and

distribution of electricity and water (Box 3). Staff noted that this web of subsidies and transfers was
contributing to resource misallocation while likely benefiting household income groups that did not
require such support. The authorities recognized the need to address these weaknesses, and
explained that they had commissioned a reputable international auditing firm to conduct an
assessment of the accounts of several large state-owned companies. They indicated that they would
use the auditor’s assessments, expected to be completed by end-2012, to define a strategy to
improve the productivity and efficiency of public utilities. They were also seeking technical
assistance from the IADB and the World Bank to help articulate a comprehensive program to
improve the management and governance of these enterprises, and reform the tariff structure of
key utilities.
22.
The authorities are continuing to improve the business environment and diversify the
economy. The government has streamlined its licensing procedures for new enterprises, thus
significantly reducing the time needed to register a limited liability company. Staff noted the
authorities’ efforts, with the support of the IADB, to modernize public agricultural and extension
services, disseminate new technologies among farmers, and improve transport, drainage, and
irrigation systems in rural areas. They are also investing in developing the Port of Paramaribo, the
largest in the area, to become a regional cargo hub. With assistance from the EU, France, and China,
port facilities are being upgraded, and the road corridors along the northern coast are being
broadened and asphalted to accommodate heavy trucks to neighboring countries. In the tourism
sector, the authorities are taking steps to professionalize the industry and target new markets.
23.
Discussions are at an advanced stage with two gold mining companies for long-term
mining concessions. Specifically, a large Canadian mining company is negotiating with the
government to expand its current mining concession and area of activity, with a view to significantly
raise its gold production. 6 In addition, a joint venture between two American companies has been
negotiating the development of a large new mining and refining operation in Eastern Suriname. If
these negotiations are successful and the envisaged investments (US$1–1.5 billion) materialize as
planned, Suriname could, over the next 3–4 years, more than double its commercial gold
production. Given the importance and long-term impact that such mining agreements would have
on Suriname’s economy, staff advised the authorities to conclude these agreements only after a
careful assessment of their economic and environmental impact. It was also important for the
authorities to put in place an appropriate and efficient taxation and royalty regime for the mining
sector that would ensure that the country collects a fair share of revenue from the exploitation of its
natural resources. To this end, staff encouraged the authorities to avail themselves of Fund technical
assistance in this area.

6

It is estimated that exports of this company account for about 40 percent of total gold exports, with the remaining
60 percent originating from the “informal” gold sector (small and medium-size gold mining enterprises).

Box 3. Subsidies and Arrears in the Public Sector
The authorities support state-owned utility companies through a complicated web of cross subsidies and
transfers. While most of these payments are made to the electricity company and, to a lesser extent, the water
companies, they are not always reflected explicitly in the central government budget. In the case of the energy
sector, they involve primarily the de facto free provision of
hydro-generated electricity and crude oil for the thermal

generation of electricity.

However, over the past years, EBS has not reimbursed the government for these energy purchases, thus
1

accumulating large arrears, which in 2011 alone amounted to US$47 million (1 percent of GDP).

The country’s energy supply is supplemented by thermal generation plants. One such plant is owned and run
by EBS, which buys diesel fuel for its generators, imported by Staatsolie, the state-owned oil company. As a general
practice, EBS does not pay Staatsolie for these fuel deliveries. In order to recover its importing costs, Staatsolie has
an agreement with the central government that allows it to deduct these unpaid claims from the regular dividend
payments that it makes to the government. In 2011, these deductions amounted to US$37 million (0.8 percent of
the GDP). Finally, Staatsolie also has its own thermal generation plant, and it sells the excess electricity that it
generates to EBS for distribution to the local market. The electricity provided from this source also remains unpaid
by EBS. As of 2011, the cumulative amount arising from these unpaid bills and other obligations by EBS amounted
to US$24 million (½ percent of GDP).
These transactions mask the full extent of the government transfer payments. On a consolidated public sector
basis, while these payments are fully effected and do not generate arrears vis-à-vis the rest of the economy, they
constitute opaque subsidies that, for 2011, were estimated at US$84 million (about 1.8 percent of GDP). Moreover,
these netting out operations involving cross payments and accumulation of arrears at various institutions understate
not only the full amount of transfer payments from the budget but also the gross revenue that is due to the budget.

_______________________

The remaining part of the hydro-generated electricity (about 25 megawatts) is sold by the government at market

prices to a large Canadian commercial gold mining and refining company. In 2011, these sales amounted to
US$18 million.

Staff welcomed improvements in the compilation, processing, and dissemination of
macroeconomic data. As noted, in the national accounts area, work was recently completed on
revising and rebasing the nominal and constant GDP series to 2007. The authorities have also
enhanced the presentation and dissemination of monetary and other economic data on the external
webpage of the Central Bank of Suriname (CBvS). Commendable efforts have also been made in
revising the balance of payments data for 2010 and 2011. Staff encouraged the authorities to press
on with their efforts, particularly with respect to balance of payments data, price statistics, compiling
the national accounts from the expenditure side, and generating higher frequency indicators for
economic activity.

STAFF APPRAISAL
25.
Suriname’s economic outlook remains favorable. The tight financial policies
implemented in the wake of the January 2011 devaluation have helped contain domestic demand
pressures and stabilize prices. The Suriname economy is likely to continue expanding at a
respectable pace in 2012 and over the medium term, buoyed by strong prices for its key commodity
exports and large private and public investments in the mining, energy, and transportation sectors.
Once completed, these projects are expected to raise the country’s growth potential, boost
government revenue, and strengthen the balance of payments.
26.
A challenge for policymakers will be to manage well the projected increase in mining
revenue over the medium term. The authorities’ plans to establish a sovereign wealth fund are
well taken, as this will help them build fiscal buffers while key commodity prices remain strong. Staff
commends the authorities on this initiative and advises them to ensure that the proposed fund is
clear in its mandate, relies on an efficient and representative governance structure, and is
transparent in its operations and finances.
27.
Staff welcomes the significant improvement registered in the fiscal accounts in 2011.
Revenues benefitted from stronger tax and nontax collections, reflecting the effects of the
devaluation, record profits in the oil and gold sectors, and higher indirect tax rates. Current
expenditures—mainly on wages and goods and services—were kept under tight control. The
regularization and clearance of all external payments arrears is a welcome development, as
recognized by the upgrades extended by credit rating agencies.
28.
Staff supports the authorities’ objective to achieve a modest increase in the fiscal
surplus in 2012. To this end, it encourages them to continue to hold current spending under check.
In the wake of the devaluation, wage adjustments in the public and private sectors will need to be
moderate and forward looking, in order to avoid entering into a new wage-inflation spiral and to
preserve international competitiveness.
29.
Staff encourages the authorities to press ahead with fiscal reforms to strengthen the
domestic revenue base and reduce the budget’s dependence on volatile mineral revenues. It
calls on the authorities to continue with their efforts to introduce a VAT system by the end of next
year. They should also press ahead with their preparations to collect a fairer share of revenue from

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SURINAME

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

the informal gold sector. On the expenditure side, it will be important to gradually reduce current
spending and enhance the quality of public spending, including by better targeting transfer
payments to vulnerable groups and prioritizing capital investments.
30.
While firm monetary conditions have helped bring inflation down to lower single
digit levels, there may be space for a more accommodating stance in the coming months. A
moderate conclusion of the current wage negotiations and continued price stability will be essential
for any monetary easing. Staff computations suggest that the exchange rate level is broadly in line
with fundamentals. The authorities continue to maintain two multiple currency practices and, in the
absence of a firm timetable for their removal, staff does not recommend their approval by the
Board.
31.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ steps to strengthen the supervision of the banking
sector. The recent passage of the new Bank Supervision Law is an important milestone in these
efforts. The authorities are encouraged to enhance the supervision of financial institutions by issuing
prudential regulations to ensure that banks’ lending standards and risk-management practices are
strengthened. Staff also welcomes the authorities’ intention to take prompt action with respect to
three weak, small state-owned banks, once proper audits have been completed.
32.
The authorities are making commendable strides to improve the business
environment and diversify the economy. To that effect, they have streamlined licensing
procedures, reduced the time needed to register a limited liability company, and are seeking
assistance from multilateral agencies to improve the management of public utility companies. They
are also working with international partners to develop the agriculture, tourism, and trans-shipment
services sectors. Finally, staff congratulates the authorities’ on important progress that they have
made in improving their data compilation and dissemination capabilities, and encourages them to
persevere in these efforts.
33.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Suriname be conducted
on the standard 12-month cycle.

APPENDIX I. ILLUSTRATIVE MEDIUM-TERM
PROJECTIONS AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSES
Staff undertook fiscal and external debt sustainability analyses, based on reasonable assumptions
and a medium-term outlook that were discussed with the authorities.

A. Government Finances
Key assumptions and outlook
Revenue, as a percent of GDP, is projected to fall somewhat from its exceptionally high level
of 2011. The outlook for weaker oil prices will reduce the profitability of Staatsolie and, thus, oil
revenues accruing to the budget over the next 2–3 years. However, this decline in Staatsolie’s
profitability and contribution to the budget is likely to be partially reversed starting in 2015, i.e.,
once the refinery, currently under construction, is completed. In the latter years, it is assumed that
revenues will be boosted by large planned gold projects that would come on line. Meanwhile,
indirect tax collections are projected to increase starting in 2014, reflecting the introduction of a
revenue-enhancing VAT system in late-2013.
On the expenditure side, it is assumed that current spending will continue to moderate,
particularly spending on wages and goods and services. This will be achieved by the authorities’
holding the growth rate of non-interest current spending below that of nominal GDP. These savings
will allow them to maintain capital expenditure at a sustainable and relatively high level of about
5½ percent of GDP over the medium term.
The fiscal balance will decline in the early years of the projection period, before picking up to
about 1½ percent of GDP over the medium term. As revenues stabilize and total spending
moderates, the government will be in a position to save about 1 percent of GDP of the annual fiscal
surpluses in a sovereign wealth and stabilization fund.
Assessment of the fiscal DSA
Suriname’s public debt position and vulnerability is low. Over the medium term the debt-toGDP ratio is projected to decline to 15 percent (down from its current level of 19 percent), thanks to
a robust fiscal position and prudent debt management. The outlook thus assumes that foreign
borrowing will be contracted on favorable terms, mainly from bi- and multilateral sources. The debt
levels will be sensitive to standard shocks. However, even under various stress scenarios, the debtto-GDP level is not likely to exceed 20 percent. Accordingly, there is only a low risk of debt distress.

B. External Sector
Key assumptions
The medium-term projections for the balance of payments are predicated on the assumptions
that current external sector policies will be maintained. Specifically, it is assumed that a number
of large projects in the energy and mining sectors will be completed, with their financing provided
for through: (a) self-financing combined with limited commercial borrowing (for Staatsolie’s refinery
expansion); or (b) foreign direct investment (for the large anticipated gold mining projects).
The medium-term outlook assumes a continued stable macroeconomic environment.
Construction activity in connection with the large mining and energy projects is expected to boost
economic growth in the early years of the projection period. Thereafter, as these projects are
completed and production is scaled up, the country’s growth potential is expected to be lifted to
about 5 percent. With domestic demand well contained, inflation is expected to remain below
5 percent.
Despite an initial weakening of the current account balance, gross reserves are expected to
increase over the medium term. In the early years of the projection period, the large planned
investment projects will be associated with large imports of capital goods. However, since these
imports will be financed externally (through FDI and other private inflows), the overall balance of
payments would remain in surplus, and gross reserves would rise to 8½ months of imports by 2017.
These reserves would include the funds that would be set aside in the context of a sovereign wealth
and stabilization fund.

Assessment of the external DSA
Suriname’s external debt burden is low, at 10 percent of GDP. Following the clearance of all
external payments arrears, the authorities have carefully increased their foreign borrowing from
multilateral sources to support their reform and infrastructure projects. Once these projects are
completed and mineral exports pick up, the current account balance is expected to improve
substantially, to a surplus of over 3 percent of GDP. Looking ahead, external debt is projected to
remain flat and, even under most stress scenarios, it is unlikely to rise above 20 percent of GDP. The
sole exception is a non-interest current account shock, which would increase the external debt level
almost three-fold. This reflects the country’s reliance on widening current account deficits over the
next 3-4 years in connection with the sizable capital projects.

APPENDIX II: EXTERNAL STABILITY ASSESSMENT

PPP estimates (based on 2009 data) show
an overvaluation of the currency. Using a
sample of 169 countries from all regions and
income levels, these estimates show that the
pre-devaluation exchange rate was about
11 percent above the one-standard-deviation
band around its expected value. The 20 percent
devaluation of the exchange rate in January
2011 corrected the overvaluation and is likely to
have placed the current exchange rate within
the band.

Estimates from CGER-type methodologies
suggest that the exchange rate is broadly
in line with medium-term fundamentals.
The macroeconomic balance approach shows
that, over the medium term, the projected
current account is around 4.7 percent higher
than the estimated norm. The current
account norm is estimated based on a set of
indicators using the generalized method of
moments (GMM).7 For Suriname, the main
determinants of the current account norm
include the fiscal balance, relative income,
and terms of trade. Over the short term, the
projected current account lies below the

Domestic price level relative to U.S. prices

The devaluation of the Surinamese dollar
in January 2011 corrected an appreciation
of the currency that had built up since
early 2008. The real effective exchange rate
appreciated markedly in 2008 and early-2009
and again in 2010, before easing with the
January 2011 devaluation. However, inflation
differentials have offset part of these
competitiveness gains during 2011.

estimated norm due to large anticipated foreign direct investment projects, which entail high
imports of capital goods and construction-linked services.
The external stability approach suggests that the projected current account is above the level
needed to stabilize the net foreign asset position. Using reasonable elasticities, these projections
indicate an undervaluation of the exchange rate of around 6.4 percent.
Finally, the equilibrium real exchange rate approach indicates that the projected real effective
exchange rate is expected to be below the predicted equilibrium exchange rate over the
medium term. This approach relates the real exchange rate to a set of indicators including: goods
terms of trade, relative productivity (compared to trade partners), relative government consumption,
and remittances. Over the medium term, the projected real effective exchange rate lies on average
less than 10 percent below the predicted equilibrium real exchange rate.

Based on the three methods that were applied there is no evidence of significant deviation of
the exchange rate from fundamentals. In the next few years, given Suriname’s continued
comparative advantage in natural resources, the country is expected to attract substantial amounts
of capital inflows, reflecting large foreign direct investment projects in the booming gold and oil
sectors. As the business environment improves and efforts to diversify the economy take hold, new
opportunities for forward and lateral linkages will emerge. Such capital inflows will also entail the
import of large stocks of capital goods and related services, leading to a temporary deterioration of
the current account. Over the medium term, as capital inflows abate and mineral exports strengthen,
the current account balance is expected to revert to a healthy surplus.

Nonfinancial Relations with the Authorities
Exchange rate arrangements
The national currency is the Surinamese dollar (SRD), which replaced the Surinamese guilder in
January 2004 at a conversion rate of 1,000 guilders per SRD 1. On January 20, 2011, the authorities
devalued the currency by 20 percent vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar in the official market. With the
devaluation, the authorities set a band of SRD 3.25–3.35 per US$1, within which all official and
commercial market transactions are allowed to take place. The de facto exchange rate arrangement
is classified as “stabilized.” In conjunction with the devaluation, the authorities also did away with an
existing multiple currency practice (MCP), in the form of a special exchange rate for imports of infant
formula. Suriname maintains MCPs arising from the spread of more than 2 percent between the
buying and the selling rates in the official market for government transactions and also from the
possible spread of more than 2 percent between these official rates for government transactions
and those in the commercial markets that can take place within the established band.

The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on May 2, 2011 (IMF Country

II. RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of May 31, 2012)
In 1980 Suriname joined the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), which at present is its largest
multilateral lender. As of May 2012, Suriname’s outstanding debt to the IADB stood at US$177
million. Disbursements have increased markedly due to improved absorptive capacity and the use of
new financing instruments.
Through the IADB Country Strategy with Suriname 2011-2015, the government of Suriname is
expanding its partnership for development with the IADB. The Strategy proposes a notable increase
in lending, from US$103 million (in the previous Country Strategy period, 2007-2010), to about
US$300 million. The main focus is on supporting the transition to modern public governance
structures, diversifying the economy, and expanding social benefits. The priority areas include:
(i) agriculture, (ii) energy, (iii) education, (iv) financial sector development, (v) public investment
management, (vi) social protection, and (vii) transport. Dialogue will continue on other areas in need
of strengthening: water and sanitation, disaster risk management, tax administration, health, private
sector development, and natural resources and environmental management with a view to possible
additional lending support.

The portfolio has improved significantly, especially as four operations (Basic Education
Improvement Project, Health Sector Facility, Strengthening of Public Sector Management, and
Trade Sector Support Program) exited. The active loan portfolio consists of seven operations,
totaling US$115 million. The average age of the loans in the entire portfolio is 2.5 years. In
2012, new operations will support (i) the rehabilitation of the Meerzorg-Albina road;
(ii) improvements in public capital expenditure management; (iii) the education sector; and
(iv) the energy sector.
The Technical Cooperation portfolio for Suriname comprises of 12 operations (US$6.5 million), of
which 40 percent has been disbursed.

III. RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of March 31, 2012)

The World Bank Group is now in the process of re-engaging with the Surinamese authorities after a
30 years hiatus. Its involvement in Suriname has been limited to a few knowledge products and the
last significant activity was a proposal for a hydropower plant in 1980. In September 2011, Suriname
became the 183rd member of the IFC and 14th in the Latin America Region. At the request of the
authorities, the World Bank Group conducted an Auditing and Accounting Report on the
Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) and began activities towards Candidate status in the
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). An Interim Strategy Note (ISN), which sets out the
World Bank Group’s support to the government’s reform program, is expected to be approved by
the Board in September 2011. It has been agreed with the government that initial World Bank
support would focus primarily on providing knowledge services for institutional strengthening and
capacity building for the Government and the Central Bank. The IFC support focus on advisory
services for Public and Private Partnerships (PPPs).

IV. STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provided to the Fund has some shortcomings, but they are broadly adequate for
surveillance purposes. Although timeliness remains an issue with some data, the authorities are
making an effort to improve the quality and dissemination of economic data. In March 2012, the
authorities published newly rebased national accounts data.
National accounts: The lack of timely, reliable source data on price indices for tourism services,
transportation and communication adversely affect production-based GDP estimates.
Component weights of sub-indices within the CPI are not available.
The expenditure breakdown of national accounts is still limited, and there is also no
reconciliation between the national accounts and the balance of payments, which hampers an
accurate evaluation of the savings and investment balance.
With extensive support from CARTAC, the General Bureau of Statistics concluded and released its
revision of the National Accounts Statistics, with 2007 as the new base year. This revision
improves substantially the coverage and quality of GDP data by sectors of production. Work is
ongoing on GDP data from the expenditure side.
Government finance statistics: Public finance statistics are limited to those for the central
government. Estimates for revenue and expenditure components often differ among the Ministry
of Finance, the Central Bank of Suriname, and the Central Paymaster data, increasing the
uncertainty about the true fiscal position.
The institutional coverage of fiscal statistics needs to be broadened to the nonfinancial public
sector so as to better assess the fiscal risks associated with total public sector debt. The actual
number of public enterprises remains difficult to determine, and most of these enterprises do not
produce accounts on a timely basis. In 2012, the authorities commissioned the audit of the five
main nonfinancial public enterprises, which is expected to provide the basis for widening the
scope of fiscal analysis and policy action. Available public debt statistics cover only debt
contracted or guaranteed by the central government.
Monetary and financial statistics: More recently, the timeliness of monetary and financial
statistics has been improved to two weeks for the central bank accounts and two months for the
accounts of other depository corporations. The quality of monetary and financial statistics
continues to improve, and the reporting to the IMF’s Statistics Department is regular. The central
bank has started to publish regularly monetary and financial data on its external website.

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SURINAME

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

External sector: The authorities are working with an external expert to improve the coverage
and accuracy of the balance of payments data. They have recently revised and significantly
improved the coverage of external data for 2010 and 2011. However, there still remain significant
shortcomings in the area of balance of payments statistics, particularly for earlier years, such as
weak data collection, under-coverage, misclassification, and deviations from the balance of
payments manuals. Going forward, while trade data are relatively reliable, efforts should continue
to enhance compilation of data on services and private capital in- and outflows. Estimates of the
components of the financial account (especially private external debt) also need to be improved.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Suriname participates in the GDDS.
III. Reporting to STA
Suriname currently does not report fiscal statistics for inclusion in either International Financial
Statistics, or the Government Financial Statistics Yearbook.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 10, 2012

International Monetary Fund

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Suriname
On September 7, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Suriname.1
Background
Economic activity in Suriname remains strong, and inflation pressures have abated
considerably. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth is estimated to have picked up to about
4¼ percent in 2011, from 4 percent in 2010, supported by robust activity in the oil and gold
sectors, as well as in public investment. In the wake of the 20 percent devaluation of the official
exchange rate in January 2011, and the simultaneous increase in domestic fuel taxes, twelvemonth inflation spiked to 22.6 percent in April 2011. Since then, it has fallen steadily, to
3.6 percent in May 2012. Core inflation has levelled off, at around 4½ percent.
The fiscal balance strengthened markedly in 2011, shifting from a deficit of about 3 percent of
GDP in 2010 to an estimated surplus of just under 1 percent. Revenue benefitted from strong
tax collections related to the devaluation and new taxes introduced during the year. On the
expenditure side, savings on current spending were offset in part by a jump in capital outlays on
infrastructure projects.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares
a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this
summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can
be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
Monetary conditions in the wake of the devaluation have been appropriately tight. While the
external current account surplus narrowed from 6½ percent of GDP in 2010 to 5½ percent in
2011, the capital and financial accounts improved noticeably. Gross international reserves rose
to nearly US$1 billion (5¼ months of imports) at end-2011. The Surinamese dollar is now
trading at virtually the same level in the official and parallel markets.
In May 2012, the authorities cleared long-standing arrears with the United States. Citing the
clearance of external payments arrears and improved economic outlook, Fitch, Standards and
Poor’s, and Moody’s have recently upgraded Suriname’s sovereign debt rating.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their tight financial policies, implemented in
the wake of the January 2011 devaluation, which have helped contain domestic demand
pressures and stabilize prices. The outlook for the economy remains favorable, underpinned by
strong prices for key commodity exports and large private and public investments. Once
completed, these projects should raise the country’s growth potential, boost government
revenue, and strengthen the balance of payments. Directors welcomed the clearance of all
external payments arrears, which contributed to Suriname’s recent sovereign rating upgrades.
Directors underscored the need for sound management of future mining revenues and building
policy buffers. They welcomed the plan to establish a sovereign wealth fund that has a strong
governance structure with transparent operations, in accordance with best international
practices and the Santiago Principles.
Directors welcomed the significant improvement in fiscal accounts, and the authorities’
commitment to prudent policies going forward. To broaden the revenue base, they looked
forward to the timely introduction of a VAT and an efficient taxation regime for the mining sector.
On the expenditure side, it will be important to continue current spending restraint, better target
transfer payments to vulnerable groups, and prioritize capital investments. Moderation in public
and private wage adjustments will avoid a new wage-inflation spiral and preserve international
competitiveness.
Directors noted that tight monetary and fiscal policies contributed to a sharp decline in inflation
and that there might be room for a more accommodative monetary policy stance. A moderate
conclusion of the current wage negotiations and continued price stability will be essential
preconditions for any monetary easing. Directors welcomed the stabilization of the exchange
rate and the practical elimination of parallel market premiums. They encouraged the authorities
to take steps towards removal of the remaining multiple currency practices, and to move
gradually towards a more market-determined exchange rate regime, over time and as
conditions permit.

3
Directors commended the steady progress in de-dollarization and the steps being taken to
strengthen bank supervision. They welcomed the passage of the Bank Supervision Law and
looked forward to additional prudential regulations. Directors called for further efforts to address
the weaknesses of three small state-owned banks and effective implementation of the AML/CFT
regime.
Directors supported the authorities’ efforts underway to diversify the economy by enhancing the
business environment and pursuing other structural reforms, including improving the
management of state-owned enterprises. They commended the important progress made in
strengthening Suriname’s data compilation and dissemination capabilities, and encouraged the
authorities to persevere in these efforts.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Paulo Nogueira Batista, Executive Director for Suriname;
Kevin Finch, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director; and
Karel Eckhorst, Advisor to the Executive Director
September 7, 2012
1.
On behalf of the Surinamese authorities, we thank the mission chief and his team for
very constructive meetings and the well-researched staff report. The authorities highly
appreciate the report and concur with most of the recommendations. They remain committed
to the identified needs for capacity building in the public sector and for reforms in the
regulation and supervision of the financial system. The authorities seek the continued support
of the Fund for technical assistance in these and other areas as they believe this assistance is
critical to Suriname’s economic stability and reform efforts.
Recent macroeconomic developments
2.
The macroeconomic outlook has remained favorable since the mission’s visit on
account of both domestic policies and the external environment. A prudent fiscal stance has
been sustained. The authorities have kept a tight lid on current spending and continued the
policy of increasing the local currency component of government transactions. Despite a
moderate rise in investment spending, a fall in international commodity prices and an
expected initial transfer into the Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF), the overall fiscal balance for
2012 is projected to remain in slight deficit at an estimated ½ percent of GDP.
3.
The authorities are also closely monitoring developments in the interbank, credit, and
foreign exchange markets, with a view to gauging monetary and financial conditions and
stand ready to deal with any pressures as they arise. The outlook confirms relative stability in
the foreign exchange market, while moderate growth in net credit to the private sector seems
to be indicative of continued robust activity in primary and non-primary sectors. The
combined ratio of non-performing loans has continued to come down, although for foreign
currency loans the ratio has tended to fluctuate somewhat. The rate of growth of monetary
aggregates through August appears in line with the forecast for the year.
4.
In recognition of the authorities’ measures to improve macroeconomic stability and
the external debt indicators, Fitch upgraded Suriname’s sovereign debt rating one notch to
BB- in July 2012. In August, Moody's upgraded the foreign currency rating of the
Government of Suriname to Ba3 and changed the outlook from stable to positive. This means
that during the past 18 months, Suriname has received four rating upgrades. The latest
upgrade from Moody’s is based on their expectation of continued prudent fiscal
management, positive short-to-medium-term growth prospects, anticipated greater resilience
to external economic shocks and enhanced access to concessional financing from multilateral
and bilateral creditors.

2
5.
The Surinamese authorities, while grateful for this recognition of diminished
economic risks for the medium-term horizon, remain aware that there are non-negligible
problems going forward. Two main problems were identified: (i) vulnerability of the
Surinamese economy to fluctuations in the international prices of primary export products;
and (ii) limited institutional capacity. The authorities are taking measures to mitigate these
problems through the establishment of the SWF, economic diversification to limit
vulnerabilities to exogenous shocks, capacity building and institutional and regulatory
reforms.
Authorities’ views on the report and staff recommendations
6.
The authorities concur with the staff’s view on the fiscal path going forward.
Reducing the non-mining deficit gradually will not only be achieved through expenditure
moderation, but also by the net positive revenue impact of tax reforms.
7.
The staff report notes that the illustrative fiscal path will allow some savings to be set
aside in the proposed SWF. This is somewhat inaccurate. The SWF bill defines the maximum
growth rate in mining-related tax revenue that can accrue to the budget with all extra income
to be transferred to the SWF. The revenue going to the SWF is therefore independent of the
fiscal stance. By limiting growth in revenue that accrues to the budget, the SWF acts as a
stabilizing mechanism.
8.
In 2011, the authorities increased the reserve requirement on foreign currencydenominated deposits at the commercial banks from 33 percent to 40 percent to stabilize the
exchange rate and discourage dollarization in the immediate aftermath of the Surinamese
dollar (SRD) devaluation. At the same time, they continue to see merit in prudential
measures – such as higher provisioning requirements for foreign currency loans and the
establishment of limits on open foreign currency positions – which can help financial
institutions to better internalize the risks of lending in foreign currency. De-dollarization will
remain a gradual process that can best be achieved through sustained efforts to promote
macroeconomic stability and growth, which in turn will foster confidence in the currency.
9.
There may be space for a more accommodating monetary stance in the coming
months. Careful monetary and fiscal policies and a benign international inflation
environment have helped to bring down inflation faster than projected in the staff report.
Inflation has fallen further from 3.6 percent in the 12-months to May to 2.8 percent at endJuly. In addition, wage agreements in the public and private sectors have been moderate.
With labor union consent, there have been no salary increases for public sector employees for
2012. The private sector appears to have taken this signal, granting on average only moderate
wage increases. Further moderate wage agreements and continued price stability would
create opportunities for possible monetary easing.

3
10.
The authorities concur with the staff’s view that the exchange rate level is in line with
fundamentals. However, they are of the opinion that it is not an opportune time to alter or
fundamentally reform the foreign exchange market, in particular by changing the width of the
band between official buying and selling rates. With continued volatility and uncertainty in
international markets, the close attention placed on foreign exchange market developments
by local market participants and the lack of depth and integration of the foreign exchange
market in Suriname, any change could be destabilizing at this juncture.
Structural reforms and capacity building
11.
The authorities are committed to a more diversified production base, which will better
shield the economy from global economic cycles and reduce dependency on non-renewable
resource mining. As for current policies in this regard, windfall surpluses from the oil and
gold industries are being saved and will be placed in the SWF after its establishment or
allocated for prioritized and carefully selected projects in the non-mining sectors.
12.
During the staff visit, the authorities discussed their plan for a SWF that would be the
vehicle for such savings. The SWF also aims at insulating the economy and the budget from
fluctuations in international mining prices and from pro-cyclical fiscal spending, as strict
accumulation and spending rules would apply. Such rules will be transparent and will allow
only minimal political decision-making. Legislation for the SWF has been drafted in
accordance with international best practices and the Santiago Principles. The draft has been
circulated to the Cabinet and other stakeholders for comments and a final draft is scheduled
for presentation to Parliament in October 2012. The asset management team is being trained
and supported by international advisors and the World Bank.
13.
In the meantime, higher growth potential from mining is still being sought.
Discussions are at an advanced stage with two international gold mining companies for longterm mining concessions. These are expected to be concluded before the end of the year.
Money and banking sector
14.
As discussed with staff, the authorities plan to gradually move away from reserve
requirements toward indirect monetary policy instruments, such as open market operations,
to manage liquidity in the economy. However, the scope for conducting open market
operations for monetary purposes would improve with more developed local money and
capital markets. In a broader context, the authorities are contemplating strategies for deeper
and more dynamic domestic bond and equity markets.
15.
Legislation amending the Reporting of Suspicious Transaction Act and the
Identification Requirement for Service Providers Act was adopted by Parliament in July and
entered into force in August.

4
16.
The bill concerning Supervision of Money Transaction Offices was forwarded to
Parliament for discussion and approval. Parliament started deliberations in August and is
expected to conclude in the first week of October 2012.
Fiscal sector
17.
Financial management and fiscal monitoring will be improved by a thorough reform
of the Public Finance Management framework, which will enable real-time revenue and
expenditure monitoring and significantly improve the budgetary management capabilities of
the Ministry of Finance. Within the Ministry, two special units for investments and
procurement were established, streamlining the administrative operations and enabling better
monitoring and cost control. The implementation plan for a new integrated financial
management and information software from an international company is being finalized. The
system will be put in place gradually in the coming years, with operationalization expected in
early-2013. In addition, the tax authorities anticipate that the VAT system will be
implemented in the second half of next year. A draft of the law is being finalized with
technical support from the Fund, after which hearings will be held with the business
community. The draft will be send to Parliament for approval in late-2012.
18.
Legal and administrative reforms are also being contemplated for state-owned
enterprises. This would allow an expansion of the coverage of public sector operations,
including public sector financial operations and debt statistics. An external auditor’s
assessment of five public enterprises has been finalized and is currently being studied by the
government. The authorities may seek technical assistance from the Inter- American
Development Bank (IDB) and the World Bank to help articulate a comprehensive program to
improve the management and governance of public sector enterprises and reform the tariff
structure of key utilities.
19.
The tax authorities have prepared a draft law to regulate and tax the informal gold
sector. The draft has been submitted to the government. Simultaneously, and in cooperation
with the Presidential Gold Sector Planning Committee, the authorities have identified key
entrepreneurs such as machine owners and shopkeepers operating in the main gold mining
areas and have sent out tax assessment forms. Improved enforcement is however awaiting the
passage and implementation of the new law.
Social sector
20.
The government is taking measures to enhance the targeting and spending efficiency
of non-contributory social protection programs, in particular through a Conditional Cash
Transfers (CCT) program supported by a loan from the IDB. The reform also includes
capacity strengthening at the Ministry of Social Affairs and Public Housing to plan,
implement, monitor, and evaluate the program. It also includes the design of additional social

5
services such as health and education to meet any further demand generated through the
CCT. Preparations are underway to implement a pilot CCT project in January 2013.
Statistics
21.
Substantive progress has been made in all areas of macroeconomic statistics in the
last two years with regards to the quality of compilation, expansion of coverage and public
dissemination. The authorities regret that the staff report has failed to effectively capture the
vast progress made. Instead, the statistical issues section of the Informational Annex makes
various erroneous references to untimeliness and unavailability of data and their breakdown,
while downplaying the extent and impact of improvements.
22.
The authorities would like to report on the achievements in the reform of the
statistical compilation and reporting systems. Data quality assessments were conducted in
late-2010 for the most relevant datasets, which were used to develop comprehensive action
plans to improve the quality of statistics. Such assessments aimed at covering all relevant
aspects, such as the legal and institutional environment to compile data, the adequacy of
resources dedicated to statistical functions in data-producing agencies, the methodological
soundness and accuracy of the data, existing procedures for disseminating the data and the
adequacy of data to support sound policy making and monitoring. In addition, a wide public
awareness campaign was carried out to emphasize the importance of reliable and timely
statistics and to generate support for the government’s efforts to produce good statistics. The
Central Bank of Suriname (CBvS) has collaborated closely with the Ministry of Finance and
the General Bureau of Statistics on the statistical reform and its implementation.
23.
In the process, the authorities organized hands-on training for compilers and seminars
for users of macroeconomic statistics both within and outside the CBvS. In addition, the
CBvS prepared and posted on its website a comprehensive set of data and metadata for
public dissemination. Although the country does not subscribe to SDDS, Suriname is
publishing a National Summary Data Page (NSDP) and the data are maintained by the CBvS
on its website which is updated regularly. At the same time, the Suriname page on the IMF’s
Data Standards Bulletin Board is updated for both data and metadata. Since March 2012, an
advance release calendar for monetary and balance of payments statistics has been posted on
the CBvS website.
24.
In light of the limited and somewhat erroneous coverage of statistical issues in the
staff report, the substantive progress achieved so far and the continued commitment to
enhance the availability and quality of statistics, the authorities believe it is useful to
highlight in more detail the progress achieved thus far.
 National Accounts – The General Bureau of Statistics concluded and released its
revision of the National Accounts Statistics, with 2007 as the new base year. This
revision improves substantially the coverage and quality of GDP data by all sectors of
production. Work is ongoing on GDP data from the expenditure side. Further work on

6
reconciliation between the national accounts and other macroeconomic data needs to be
undertaken.
 External Sector – Work is ongoing to improve the coverage and accuracy of external
sector statistics, starting with data for 2010 and 2011. Improvements include the
coverage and accuracy of services and financial accounts, which has also facilitated the
publication of data on private external debt. Balance of payments transactions and
valuation changes are also separated. Efforts have also focused on improving source
data collection. A detailed electronic survey-reporting has been introduced for a more
efficient and timely capture of bank transaction data. Training to statistics compilers and
source data providers forms part of the efforts.
 International Reserves –With support of the IMF’s Statistics Department, Suriname now
compiles international reserves data consistent with the IMF’s Data Template on
International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity. The first section of this data
template will be published within a few weeks on the CBvS website. Furthermore,
preliminary International Investment Position (IIP) data for 2011 has been estimated
based on a survey of major companies that collect information on foreign direct
investment flows and positions.
 Monetary and Financial Statistics – There have been important improvements to quality
and timeliness of monetary and financial statistics. The depository corporations survey,
the central bank analytical accounts, and the other depository corporations analytical
accounts are published on the CBvS website within 5 weeks. The regular reporting to
the IMF’s Statistics Department is usually within 2 days after the national release
timeline.
 Government Finance Statistics – Substantial efforts have been made over the last year to

improve public sector statistics. Detailed financing data and the overall fiscal position
are now published monthly on the CBvS website, while the accuracy of revenue and
expenditure data has improved significantly. Legal and administrative reforms are
underway to reform revenue management and the timely provision of revenue data. At
the same time, an integrated financial programming framework was put in place which
has increased the inter-sectoral consistency of data and also focuses on correcting
statistical deficiencies. Within the framework of a reform of state-owned enterprises,
efforts are underway to monitor enterprises, which would allow an expansion of the
coverage of public sector operations and an inclusion of their liabilities in the debt
statistics.
