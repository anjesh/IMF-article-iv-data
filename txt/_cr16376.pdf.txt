IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Chile
On December 7, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
1

the Article IV consultation with Chile.
GDP growth has been weak, with activity slowing in October. However, conditions are in place
for the economy to recover. After expanding by a moderate 1.7 this year, growth is forecast to
increase to 2 percent in 2017. Faster growth in main regional partners and more stable copper
prices are expected to lift exports and investment. The recovery is, however, projected to be
gradual, held back by slow wage and job growth and still low business confidence. Inflation is
expected to continue to decelerate to 2.7 percent next year.
The balance of risks is on the downside. The main external risk is an unexpected slowdown in
Chile's main trading partners, China and Brazil. Possible changes to the U.S. policy path have
added uncertainty to the outlook. External risks could be magnified by high corporate leverage
and reliance on foreign currency debt. Domestically, the main risks are a delayed recovery in
business confidence and investment related to larger the expected uncertainties surrounding a
new labor bill. Also, should a pension reform be approved, an increase in contribution rates
could dampen growth over the medium term. On the upside, a fiscal expansion in advanced
economies could raise external demand above expectations.
The financial sector appears healthy. Banks profitability is declining but capital buffers are
adequate and non-performing loan rates are low. Discussions about a strengthening of the
regulatory framework, especially Basel III, and a strengthening of supervision have been
underway for some time.
The macroeconomic policy mix remains accommodative. Amidst fast disinflation and slow
activity, the policy rate has remained unchanged throughout 2016 and policy guidance is now
setting the tone for an easing cycle. The strong net public-asset position has allowed the use of

fiscal space so far, and the envisaged consolidation is gradual and geared toward pro-growth
spending.
Structural reforms are setting the stage for stronger growth. Investment in infrastructure,
especially roads and electricity, have come underway. Implementations of the previously
approved education reform is proceeding. More recently a package of measures aimed at raising
productivity has been passed.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities’ sound macroeconomic management, which has
contributed to Chile’s resilience to large terms-of-trade shocks. At the same time, Directors
noted that less favorable external conditions, declining trend growth, and an urgent need to
address social needs could impact the country’s economic prospects. Directors welcomed the
authorities’ continued commitment to strong policies and reforms aimed at achieving higher and
more inclusive growth and tackling the challenges ahead.
Directors welcomed the current monetary policy stance which is based on an inflation-targeting
framework and a flexible exchange rate regime. They supported the ongoing monetary policy
accommodation and agreed that further easing could be considered in case disinflationary
pressures broaden and growth risks intensify. They recommended that monetary policy decisions
should continue to be data dependent.
Directors commended the authorities’ shift toward fiscal consolidation, given the sizable
structural deficit, and recommended a gradual consolidation path so as to minimize the drag on
the recovery. They noted that the role of the Advisory Fiscal Council could be strengthened to
buttress fiscal credibility.
Directors noted that although Chile’s pension system is sound, it is not delivering adequate
benefits. They welcomed the authorities’ plans to reform the pension system, including ensuring
adequate old-age income by strengthening the private and public solidarity pillars, and by
reducing the costs of pension fund administration. Directors highlighted that consideration
should also be given to increases in contribution rates, retirement ages, and mandatory coverage.
In addition, they underscored that economic effects of these reform efforts need to be carefully
assessed for their impact on growth as well as on current and future pensions.
Directors noted that the financial sector is healthy. However, they encouraged the authorities to
closely monitor vulnerabilities as weaker-than-expected growth could strain the solvency of

highly leveraged firms and less resilient small-and medium-sized enterprises, with potential for
amplification via strong inter-sectoral balance-sheet linkages. Directors underscored the need to
further improve resilience by adopting Basel III capital standards and to move towards riskbased supervision of insurers. They also called for more effective oversight of conglomerates and
stronger corporate governance and investor protection.
Directors emphasized that ambitious structural reforms are necessary to promote stronger and
more inclusive growth. They welcomed the authorities’ continued efforts toward improving the
quality of education, upgrading key infrastructure, and raising productivity. Directors also
underscored the importance of tackling legal uncertainties related to the labor reform.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Context: Chile’s fundamentals and policy framework remain strong. However, economic
prospects are being shaped by lower dynamism in key trading partners, permanently lower
copper prices, slower trend growth, and mounting social demands for inclusive growth.
Important reforms are underway to lift growth and reduce inequality, but they inevitably
generate transition costs. Against this background, staff’s recommendations aim to balance
trade-offs between growth, stability, and social objectives, while assessing the macroeconomic
policy mix during this challenging transition.
Key findings and policy recommendations.
Conditions are in place for a modest recovery next year. Stronger external demand is aiding
an export-led recovery, lifting growth from 1.7 percent to 2 percent next year. A faster recovery
is hampered by weak domestic demand and a slow improvement in confidence, dampened by
uncertainty related to the labor reform and costs associated with a new corporate income tax
perceived as complex.
Trend GDP growth has declined substantially to 2.8 percent (from 4.8 percent in 2011). The
scaling back of investment, flagging productivity, and slowing labor supply are the result of
infrastructure bottlenecks, low human capital, and demographics.
Fiscal consolidation should commence, but Chile can proceed slowly. The 2017 budget
appropriately shifts towards fiscal consolidation. A strong net public-asset position allows
Chile to proceed slowly in the near term while growth is weak and pro-growth and equality
reforms are implemented. As the economy recovers, stronger fiscal adjustment is needed. To
provide adequate old-age income, a planned pension reform should strengthen the private
and the public solidarity pillars, all the while mitigating growth costs.
Monetary policy is appropriately accommodative. The central bank should lower rates if
disinflation becomes broad based and more persistent, and if growth risks intensify.
Structural reforms are setting the stage for stronger growth. The reform agenda could
be strengthened by fast-tracking a new infrastructure fund geared to raise private
participation, improving programs to strengthen workers’ skills, and facilitating growth of
businesses.
Financial sector balance sheets are healthy, but risks to stability bear close
monitoring. Weaker-than-expected growth could strain solvency of highly leveraged
firms, less resilient SMEs, and indebted households. A subsequent tightening of credit
could get amplified via macro-financial linkages, thereby dampening growth. Corporate
stress tests show that banks’ balance sheets can withstand a significant rise in credit risks.
There is considerable scope to enhance the resilience of the financial sector. Key Basel
III regulations and risk-based supervision of insurers should be adopted swiftly. Enhanced
coordination and information sharing among financial sector supervisors would ensure
more effective oversight of financial conglomerates. Improved corporate governance could
be incentivized through the introduction of a voluntary stewardship code.

CHILE’S GROWTH AND INEQUALITY CHALLENGE
1.
New realities are shaping Chile’s economic prospects. Economic rebalancing in China, less
buoyant income growth in the U.S. and Europe, and structural problems in Latin America—
notwithstanding a better outlook for next year—are generating a less dynamic external environment
beyond the near-term. Domestically, population aging, infrastructure bottlenecks, and low human
capital are dampening trend growth. Meanwhile demand for adequate provision of public services
are mounting amidst still high income inequality and poverty, raising trade-offs between growth,
fiscal, and social objectives. Structural reforms aimed at addressing these challenges are forging new
avenues for growth, but are also generating adjustment costs. In particular, a new labor reform, while
upgrading labor relations, is creating uncertainty given legal ambiguities. The next general election is
slated for November 2017.

2.
Despite these challenges, Chile has grown faster than others in the region. This owes to
a credible and effective fiscal and monetary framework, a modern and stable financial system, and a
flexible exchange rate. Since 2014, growth averaged 2 percent, substantially below rates of 4 percent
a few years ago, but well above the Latin-American six largest countries average of 0.3 percent
during the last 3 years.

A. Recent Developments
3.
The growth slowdown is coming to an end (Figure 1, 2). GDP decelerated to 1.6 percent
(saar) in the first half of 2016, mainly in response to flagging external demand from the region, and a
second round of copper price declines in 2015. The contraction in mining contributed more than half
to the overall growth slowdown, while ex-mining activity remained sluggish owing to soft domestic
demand. Private consumption slowed to 1.8 percent y/y in 2Q2016 in line with decelerating wage
and employment growth (Figure 4). Business investment continues to be low owing to uncertain
external conditions,1 diminishing construction activity (payback from last year’s tax-policy induced
advancing of residential investment), and depressed sentiment. However, signs of a turnaround have

emerged. Mining exports and the trade balance improved over the summer, and an uptick in real
incomes from rapid disinflation is helping private consumption.
4.
Business confidence is improving.
Sentiment is still depressed, but has risen slightly
since July. A better regional outlook and moderately
stronger-than-expected activity since the summer
appear the main factors. Also, passage of large parts
of a controversial reform agenda have reduced
uncertainty, although legal ambiguities in the new
labor law and implementation costs associated with
a complex new business tax continue to weigh on
sentiment.

A supportive macro policy mix is set to turn less accommodative next year. Amidst weak
growth and steady disinflation, the central bank has kept the policy rate unchanged at 3½ percent
since the beginning of the year. Forward guidance has reduced interest rate expectations, and
financial conditions (text chart) have in parallel shifted from slightly tight to neutral (relative to the
historical 1996–2015 average). Fiscal policy delivered stimulus of ½ percent of potential GDP per
year during 2013–16 but starting 2017, the structural deficit is set to narrow at the yearly pace of
¼ percent.

B. Outlook, Macro-Financial Linkages, and Risks
6.
Conditions are in place for a modest recovery next year. GDP is forecast to grow
moderately faster at 2 percent in 2017, slightly up from 1.7 percent this year (Table 1). Faster external
demand growth in key trading partners—up by 0.3 ppts. to 3 percent in 2017—and more stable
copper prices are projected to lift exports. Spillovers to business investment are, however, slow to
materialize: business confidence will likely continue to improve only at a moderate pace as the
effects of new labor legislation—effective in April 2017—take time to be understood by social
partners. Private consumption will be held back by slow wage growth and rising unemployment
(expected to peak at almost 8 percent by mid-2017). Beyond the near-term, growth is expected to
accelerate as ongoing reforms remove growth bottlenecks.2
7.
Financial conditions are staying broadly neutral. External conditions are set to remain
favorable and capital inflows to emerging economies with strong fundamentals, such as Chile, are
expected to remain robust as expected gradual monetary policy normalization in the U.S.
commences. The slowdown in credit growth since June 2016 is set to extend into next year, reflecting
both sluggish domestic demand and some tightening of banks’ credit conditions. In particular,
moderately higher credit risks will dampen bank lending conditions for SMEs, consumer credit, and
mortgages under the baseline. Banks will also focus more on strengthening capital buffers in
anticipation of an expected phased-in adoption of Basel III minimum solvency requirements.
8.
Disinflation is set to continue into 2017
(Figure 3). Inflation has returned to the target band
after decelerating rapidly from 4 percent in July to
3.1 percent in September. Peso appreciation
(7½ percent against the dollar since January), slower
services inflation, and a soft labor market all
contributed. With the output gap widening next year,
inflation is projected to decline to 2.7 percent in 2017.

9.
Risks are tilted to the downside (Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM), text table, and Box 2). On
the downside, an unexpected slowdown in China or setbacks from pending adjustments in Brazil
could dampen exports and investment, and tighten financing conditions as investor risk aversion
increases. Sustained uncertainty about U.S. domestic policies, a shift towards protectionism, and
faster than expected tightening of monetary policy could dampen external demand while raising
inflation as the peso depreciates. Domestically, the recovery in confidence could be further delayed
by a drawn-out resolution of legal uncertainty embedded in the new labor bill. Also, implementation
costs of a complex new corporate tax code could be larger than expected. Moreover, should the
pension reform be approved, an increase in contribution rates could dampen growth over the
medium-term relative to the baseline. Finally, a sharper-than-anticipated cooling in the laborintensive real estate market could create headwinds to consumption via higher unemployment. On

the other hand, linkages between the copper and
the domestic financial sector are limited, due to large-scale funding of mining via FDI.
11.
Against this background, a deterioration in external growth or financing conditions
could force firms to deleverage at an accelerated pace. Under the baseline of a moderate
recovery, staff does not expect firms’ investment plans and banks’ credit supply to be constrained by
high leverage, given long maturities of debt and low interest costs. However, under a risk scenario,
an associated rise in job losses and/or a rapid decline in real estate prices could, via macro-financial
linkages, lead to larger-than-expected defaults on mortgages and consumer credit—all resulting in
tightening credit and shrinking domestic demand. To illustrate the growth implications, an increase

in Chile’s EMBI spread by 100 basis points (equivalent to a one standard-deviation deterioration in
the Financial Condition Index) would cause growth to drop by roughly 0.3 percentage points within
less than one year (Annex I). Severe stress tests of corporate balance sheets, which substantially raise
default probabilities of externally exposed firms, show that credit losses would be substantial. Even
so, the banking sector would manage to absorb a rise in credit costs thanks to sufficient capital
buffers (Box 2).
Gross Liabilities and Cross Sectoral Linkages

Authorities’ Views
12.
The authorities’ broadly shared staff’s views on the outlook. They also saw growth
accelerating only mildly in 2017, with the recovery in domestic demand being dampened by a
loosening labor market but helped by a gradual improvement in private sentiment. On the positive
side, they felt that the continuation of favorable financial conditions, a depreciated peso (relative to
2013), and lower energy costs all provided strong incentives for investment in tradable sectors. Faster
regional growth alongside measures taken to facilitate service exports and competition in specific
sectors should help exports. They also underscored that the absence of macroeconomic imbalances
left Chile well placed to take advantage of improvements in the external environment. They viewed
China’s growth sustainability and economic transformation as the main concern. Owing to largely
anticipated U.S. monetary policy normalization, the authorities expected limited volatility and, on net,
they saw improved growth prospects leading to an increase in capital flows to the Chilean economy.
8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CHILE

13.
The authorities did not see significant risks originating in the corporate sector. They
noted that increases in foreign currency debt were mostly linked to past peso depreciation, but that
financial expenditures were low, and currency mismatches limited. Central bank stress tests found
corporate balance sheets were only mildly sensitive to exchange or interest rate shocks, and that a
very large shock to GDP was needed for substantial stresses to emerge. The authorities also noted
that NPLs were low despite several years of slow growth, although the real estate sector and SMEs
posed pockets of vulnerabilities. With the external environment getting stronger, especially in the
region, they saw the overall outlook for the corporate sector improving.

C. Medium-Term Challenges
14.
Demand for more inclusive growth is growing. Large skill disparities in the labor market
and duality between formal and informal sectors continue to sustain wage inequality. Job reallocation
is hampered by transportation bottlenecks and limited effective retraining programs. Old-age poverty
is high (18 percent of population compared to 12 percent for OECD average) and related to
inadequate pensions. Population aging will further raise social demands in the coming years.
15.
A secular decline in growth is difficult to reverse. GDP growth in Chile has more than
halved over the past three decades from 6.8 percent on average in the golden 1990–94 lustrum to
around 2 percent in recent years. The decline has been broad-based and affected all sectors of the
economy.
16.

Underlying reasons differ across sectors:3



Mining: disinvestment. The slowdown in the capital-intensive mining sector (10 percent of total
potential GDP) is explained by flagging productivity due to declining quality of ore grade, as well
as slower capital accumulation amidst low and uncertain copper prices in the long term.



Non-mining: a broader story. Potential growth—the maximum rate without creating excessive
inflation or labor market imbalances—has deteriorated from 5 percent in 2011 to 2½ percent in
2015–16 according to new IMF estimates. About half of the decline can be attributed to weaker
capital accumulation related to the persistence of the terms of trade shock. The other half comes
from lower labor and TFP growth (about 20 and 30 percent of the total slowdown, respectively).
Declining TFP growth is likely linked to the investment drought but also to infrastructure
bottlenecks4 and low average skill levels. Population aging and a tapering off of past gains in
female labor force participation are constraining labor supply growth.

3

Blagrave and Santoro, 2016, “Estimating Potential Output in Chile: A Multivariate Filter for Mining and Non-Mining
Sectors, IMF Working Paper No. 16/201.
Chile’s infrastructure gap relative to OECD countries is substantial (Calderon and Serven, 2004; Santoro, 2015) and
closing it would require a doubling of infrastructures investment to about 5 percent of GDP in the coming years

17.
Projected trend growth is insufficient to narrow the income gap with advanced
economies. Under the baseline, the cyclical pick-up in investment over the medium-term would lift
growth contributions from capital and productivity, although ebbing labor force growth is limiting
gains. Staff projects trend growth of 3¼ percent in 2021 in the non-mining sector (chart), and
2¾ percent for the economy as a whole. This trend growth rate—the rate when the economy is at
full employment—is comparable to estimates in emerging economies with similar per capita income
levels. However, at 2¾ percent it is not much higher than rates in advanced economy commodity
exporters (e.g., Australia, Canada) which substantially higher per capita income levels. Hence at
currently projected rates, Chile would catch up only very slowly to income levels of comparable
developed economies.
Authorities’ Views
18.
The authorities stressed the role of the reform agenda in tackling both inequality and
low growth, all the while being cognizant of short-run trade-offs. They also saw trend growth as
having declined but stressed that estimates were uncertain and, in particular, the recovery in
productivity growth could be stronger than projected by staff. They also noted that the reform
10

package was aimed at raising skills levels which should help with inequality, while old-age poverty
needed to be tackled by expanding the social safety net.

D. External Balance
19.
External adjustment has been facilitated by a flexible exchange rate (Figure 6). The
current account deficit narrowed from 3.7 percent of GDP in 2013 to 2 percent in 2015, helped by
significant peso depreciation (10 percent in real effective terms), marked contraction in investmentrelated capital imports, and strong imports

moderately undervalued in 2016 (between 5 and
10 percent). But the IMF’s EBA model estimates do not take into account the effects of unusually low
business sentiment related to the large-scale reform package, which has suppressed investment and
imports. By implication, adjusting model estimates for this effect, Chile’s external position is broadly
in line with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. Should confidence and investment
remain structurally weak, Chile’s external position would be stronger than warranted by macro
fundamentals.
Authorities’ Views
21.
The authorities noted that the external position was market determined and that the
peso appeared somewhat strong, given real fundamentals. The authorities explained that the
currency depreciation over 2013–15 explained the resilience in non-mining tradables investment, as
well as some of the expected pick-up in investment next year. However, they felt that economic
rebalancing was slow to materialize and indicated that the exchange rate, heavily influenced by
financial developments, appeared somewhat strong given weak external demand from the region
and the slow growth in non-copper exports. They reiterated their commitment to free-capitalmobility and a flexible-exchange-rate framework.

MACROECONOMIC POLICIES
A. Fiscal Policy
22.
For some time, the government has
made use of fiscal space. Chile’s strong net worth
position and credibility of the structural balance
rule have allowed fiscal policy to counter the sharp
growth slowdown.5 On average fiscal stimulus
reached around ½ percent of potential GDP since
2013. The headline deficit is expected to widen to
3.1 percent of GDP in 2016 as expenditure
increases related to the government’s reform
program (education, infrastructure) have exceeded
revenue gains from the 2014 enacted tax reform,
partly as a result of a weak economy.

23.
The 2017 budget has appropriately tilted the needle towards fiscal consolidation. The
budget proposal is in line with the consolidation path announced last year of about ¼ percent per
annum in structural terms although reaching fiscal balance has become more difficult given weaker
growth.6 It aims to largely maintain pro-growth spending plans, in particular education and health
care and to a lesser extent infrastructure, within a tight budget envelope. Permissible expenditure
growth under the fiscal rule has more than halved relative to 2015 (staff estimates), reflecting
downgraded long-term copper prices and trend growth (USD 2.56/lb and 3 percent, respectively,
down from USD 2.98/lb and 3.6 percent in the 2016 budget). To limit the scaling back of pro-growth
spending, a concerted effort should be made to identify and eliminate inefficiencies in public
spending.
24.
Fiscal consolidation needs to continue, but Chile can proceed slowly for now. Debt is
projected to increase rapidly and reach 25 percent of GDP next year and to 30 percent by 2021.
Government financial assets are sizeable at about 21 percent of GDP in 2016, of which more than
50 percent are highly liquid. The general government debt position is resilient to a series of macro
and fiscal shocks in the medium term (see Annex IV). A gradual adjustment path over 2017—18 can
be justified by the government’s positive net worth position; low financing costs; and the focus of the
5

The fiscal rule adjusts the structural balance regularly for changes in estimated trend growth and long-run copper
prices. The uncertainty surrounding those estimates implies that it takes time for them to feed through. As a result,
fiscal policy was accommodative during the adjustment period to lower copper prices and trend growth post 2011. As
of 2016, structural revenues and balances are estimated respectively 2 percent and 1½ percent of GDP lower than
estimated using 2011 trend growth and long-run copper price.
The government’s adjustment path of ¼ percent of GDP per year has been unchanged but is starting in 2017 from a
lower headline fiscal balance than originally estimated in 2015. Together with lower medium-term revenue
projections this implies that a larger expenditure adjustment is needed to achieve the same consolidation effort as
envisioned last year.

budget on building human capital and infrastructure. However, as growth recovers, and spending
needs are addressed, a more ambitious fiscal consolidation path should be adopted. In the
meanwhile, any new spending commitments should be part of a budget balance-neutral package.
Expenditure programs should be evaluated for effectiveness and targeting improved including by
linking free access to tertiary education to means-testing. To buttress fiscal credibility, the Advisory
Fiscal Council could be given financial independence and its mandate broadened to assessing annual
and medium-term fiscal targets.
Authorities’ Views
25.
The authorities broadly concurred with staff. The authorities agreed that maintaining
fiscal credibility was a priority and that addressing skill and infrastructure gaps requires a careful
balancing act. With regard to the near-term, they reiterated their commitment to fiscal adjustment as
a means to safeguard the credibility of the fiscal framework, while using fiscal space. For the
medium-term, they saw merit in a comprehensive expenditure review, going beyond the regular
program evaluation conducted under the 2017 budget. They also reinstated their intention to
strengthen the independence and mandate of the Advisory Fiscal Council, though the legislative
agenda is deemed crowded.

B. Pension Reform
26.
Chile’s pension system is rooted in sound principles. Created in 1981, Chile’s pension
system is based on individual savings accounts administered by privately-owned corporations
(Administradoras de Fondos de Pensiones) and was complemented in 2008 by a publicly-funded
solidarity pillar which provides minimum pensions. Over the last 30 years, the fully-funded definedcontribution system has raised national savings, helped develop capital markets, and reduced fiscal
risks. The governance of the system is sound, pension investments are well protected, and
supervision is effective.
27.
The system is, however, not delivering adequate benefits for a large share of retirees.
Chile’s average pension is below the minimum wage and estimated replacements rates are very low
relative to the OECD average of 63 percent (text table), particularly for women. Low mandatory
contribution rates of 10 percent and short contribution periods—largely reflecting discontinuous
career paths—are the main reasons. In

minimum pensions.
28.
The government outlined the broad contours of a pension reform. Drawing on
recommendations of a 2015 commission report (Comisión Bravo), the government has announced
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

CHILE

plans to gradually increase contribution rates by 5 percentage points over 10 years; allocate the
additional revenue in yet-to-be-determined shares to individual accounts and for solidarity related
payments (improving pensions of current retirees); and reduce costs of the pension fund
administration.
29.
The reform should preserve the current system, but strengthen its delivery (Annex III).
Adequate pensions can be achieved through a variety of policies including increases in contribution
rates, retirement ages, expansion of mandatory coverage, and an augmented solidarity pillar. A
reform package should give consideration to the following measures:


For future retirees, contribution rates for individual accounts should be raised alongside other
measures. An increase of contribution rates to 15 percent would raise replacement rates close to
OECD country averages. A gradual increase in the retirement age (currently at 65 years for men
and 60 for women) would also similarly increase replacement rates, but given the projected rise
in life expectancy by 5 years in 2050 are likely necessary regardless. Importantly, for women a
gradual increase of the retirement age to 65 years should be strongly considered given
discontinuous lifetime-employment and contributions. Contributions of self-employed should be
made mandatory to cover a larger share of workers under the individual accounts.



For current retirees, pension and solidarity pillar benefits should be increased. Given fiscal
constraints, any increases in benefits need to take future aging-related commitments into
account. Specifically, growth and equity implications of different financing modalities should be
studied carefully. For instance, IMF simulations suggest that a pension reform package funded by
a mix of higher contributions and indirect taxes would carry lower growth costs than one funded
exclusively by increased contribution rates (Annex III).

Overall, such a pension reform would lead to more stable life-time incomes for broader segments of
the population and likely raise Chile’s savings. Over the near to medium-term, however, higher tax or
contribution rates could generate growth costs. For these reasons, the economic effects of any
reform need to be assessed carefully alongside its impact on current and future pensions.
Authorities’ Views
30.
The authorities agreed with the key principles of staff’s recommendations, though
noted that any reform needs to support the retired middle class in the short run. Both the
authorities and staff agreed that any reform proposal needed to be carefully evaluated for its
implications on current and future economic growth, for its long-term fiscal costs and risks, and for
the implications on inter and intra-generational fairness. In doing so, any final proposal should then
carefully weigh the tradeoffs between efficiency, incentives, inequality, and fiscal considerations.

C. Monetary Policy
31.
Central bank policy has become more accommodative this year. After remaining above the
2−4 percent target band for over two years, inflation has slowed since the beginning of this year. In
parallel, the policy rate has remained unchanged at 3½ percent and the central bank has softened its
14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CHILE

policy guidance in successive policy meetings, dropping its tightening bias in August.7 In recent months,
inflation has decelerated more rapidly than expected, from 4 percent in July to 3.1 percent in September.
Although largely the result of a stronger peso since earlier this year,8 the risk of disinflation spreading to
the non-tradable sector has risen given weak economic activity.
32.
The central bank should cut rates if disinflation pressures become broad based and
persistent, and if the growth slowdown intensifies in coming months. The expected widening of
the output gap and slowing wage growth have

Authorities’ Views
33.
The central bank shared staff’s assessment. The authorities stressed that monetary policy
had become more accommodative this year in response to the slowdown in activity and a more
subdued inflation outlook. They saw the recent disinflation as broadly in line with the central bank’s
baseline forecast, but noted that the pace has been somewhat faster than expected. Going forward,
the authorities concurred that policy should remain data dependent.

D. Macro Policy Mix
34.
The current policy mix is broadly adequate. Permanently lower copper revenue and trend
growth suggest that fiscal policy needs to adjust, albeit moderately. Given dampened potential
growth, fiscal policy needs to remain geared toward growth-enhancing education and infrastructure
spending. Although inflation expectations are stable, monetary authorities should be prepared to
ease. Enhanced financial sector supervision and broadly unchanged macro-prudential stance can
contain feedback effects from rising credit costs and financial tightening, all the while mitigating procyclicality.
35.
In a downside scenario, monetary policy should be the first line of defense. If external
conditions weaken, more accommodation is warranted as disinflationary pressures are likely to
accelerate because of a further widening output gap and continued fiscal consolidation. However,
given long transmission lags, the impulse on demand may be small. Hence, in case of a severe

slowdown, fiscal tightening should be paused and the attainment of a structural balanced budget
goal further delayed, while tilting spending to pro-growth infrastructure and education programs.
36.
The authorities broadly agreed with this assessment. The central bank noted that its
reaction to downside risks would be guided by the type of the risk materializing and its impact on
the inflation forecast.

UPGRADING GROWTH AND SECURING STABILITY
37.
Subdued trend growth, high inequality, and risks to stability are intersecting policy
challenges. Infrastructure bottlenecks and demographic trends are slowing investment, productivity
growth, and labor force participation. Income inequality is high—the post-tax-and-transfers Gini
index is 15 percentage points above the OECD average— as a result of large wealth inequality and a
substantial skill divide. Finally, the financial sector has been stable, but high corporate leverage,
substantial foreign currency debt and exposure to the region, and a slowdown in the real estate
sector are vulnerabilities.

A. Growth Reforms
38.
Structural reforms adopted since 2014 are setting the stage for stronger growth.

education are declining, and 50,000 additional childcare facilities have been created. Staff assesses

There is scope to strengthen the effectiveness of the reform agenda:
The creation of a new Infrastructure Fund (IF)—geared to attract private capital—should
be fast-tracked. Chile has a successful record of collaborating with the private sector in
developing and managing transportation projects via Private-Public-Partnerships (PPPs). The
scope of the IF should be narrowed to infrastructure projects suitable for PPPs and additional
safeguards should be adopted to strengthen proposed governance provisions and to limit fiscal
risks from contingent liabilities.

The ability of productive firms to grow should be strengthened further. New competition
and productivity laws are easing the financing of productive investments, supporting service
exports, and cutting red tape. Further efforts are needed to help SMEs grow. Programs to
improve business management skills and record keeping should be expanded. At 0.4 percent of
GDP, Chile has also one of the lowest R&D spending rates in the OECD (2 percent of GDP on

Legal uncertainties related to the new labor bill need to be addressed. A new labor law
coming into force next year is redefining collective bargaining. It mandates full disclosure of firms’
balance sheets ahead of wage negotiations and defines conditions for exercising the right to strike,
which taken together lay the basis for well-structured discussions between workers and employers
around the bargaining table. However, legal ambiguities about key elements, including the definition
of minimum services that need to be provided during strikes, the possibility to extend benefits to
those workers not participating in the negotiations, and the status of the negotiating groups
following a Constitutional Court ruling have created broad-based uncertainties. To avoid multi-year
judicial processes to settle disputes and limit implementation costs, not least given the visible
deterioration of the labor market, ambiguities need to be removed swiftly in an effort to balance
efficiency with equity considerations.

Authorities‘ Views
41.
The authorities considered continued progress on structural reforms to be of high
importance. They noted that the reforms were already lifting bottlenecks in the electricity sector. But
given the economic environment they needed to proceed gradually, remain flexible to address
emerging needs, while devising eclectic solutions to reach consensus amongst stakeholders, with the
pensions reform being cited as an example. They recognized that the new labor bill had not lived up
to expectations, but thought that uncertainties would largely resolve upon implementation. In their
view, the new framework puts a premium on improved social dialogue and the ability of social
partners to overcome the challenge. The authorities shared the staff’s diagnosis that trend potential
growth has declined, and that firms’ ability to grow needed to be strengthened. They emphasized
the importance of productivity-enhancing measures, with the Agenda on Productivity, Innovation
and Growth launched in 2014 being followed by the 2016 package. They remain committed to
complete the education reform.

B. Financial and Corporate Sector Stability
42.
Financial sector balance sheets are healthy, but risks to financial stability bear close
monitoring (Figure 7). Banks’ earnings slowed in 2016 as a result of low economic activity. However,
non-performing loans remained low at about 2 percent of total loans and capital buffers are well
above the current regulatory requirements built on Basel I principles (text chart). Life insurance
companies and pension funds—with assets exceeding 90 percent of GDP in 2015—continue to be
pressured by the low-yield environment and have kept on shifting their portfolios towards higher
yield but potentially riskier or less liquid assets. Weaker-than-expected growth could strain the
solvency of highly leveraged firms and less resilient SMEs, with potential for amplification via strong
inter-sectoral balance sheet linkages. Recent stress tests conducted by the central bank find that the
average banks’ CAR would decline by 2 percentage points from a 13 percent of risk-weighted assets
at end 2015.9 Staff’s stress test based on accelerated corporate defaults find a similar decline (Annex
II.B). These vulnerabilities call for a continued strengthening of financial sector regulation and
supervision.
43.
Prudential policies appropriately aim at credit risk. Provisioning for commercial loans
appears adequate. For mortgages, provisions were recently raised for delinquent loans and loans
with high LTV ratios. Given the slowing credit growth and neutral financial conditions, no further
tightening of macro-prudential policies is currently warranted.

The BCCh’s stress tests assume a decline in GDP growth to -5 percent in the trough quarter, recovering to
1.3 percent in 2017. Under the stress scenario, all banks would meet the current minimum capital adequacy ratio of
8 percent.

Financial Markets Commission (FMC), which includes for now the insurance and capital markets
supervisor (SVS). In time, the FMC is expected to incorporate the SBIF and the SP.
45.
The creation of the Financial Markets Commission (FMC) is an opportunity to upgrade
the governance of financial supervisors. Guaranteeing the operational independence of such a
body should be a priority. Governance reform should also ensure a selection and appointment
process in line with Basel Core Principles of Effective Banking Supervision and international best
practices. Similarly, rules on post-employment restrictions and legal protection for staff involved in
sanction processes should follow international best practices.
46.
Proposed amendments to the GBL would bolster resilience but its adoption is at risk of
falling behind schedule. The revised GBL would greatly contribute to enhance the credibility of
Chile’s financial sector, to strengthen its resilience against domestic and external shocks, and to more
efficient supervision. Adjusting to the new capital requirements appears manageable for the system
as a whole. In the case of Banco Estado, the government-owned bank and main provider of loans to
SME, staff recommends a capital injection to address an estimated capital shortfall of $US1.4 billion,
as well as an upgrade of its corporate governance, a review of operational risks, and measures to
increase efficiency. A delay in the adoption of the new GBL implies that Chile would fall behind in the
adoption of international standards and best practices—which could create uncertainty.
47.
Better coordination and information sharing among financial sector supervisors and
the central bank is key. The proposed creation of the FMC is an important step towards an
integrated view of financial sector supervision that may allow a more effective oversight of financial
conglomerates (including monitoring conglomerates’ compliance with limits on risk exposure and
designing a tailored crisis management framework). Chile’s conglomerates are a potential source of
financial fragility as they are large (consolidated assets likely exceeding 125 percent of GDP),
complex, and relatively opaque. However, the implementation of the FMC should not delay the
adoption of other longstanding, important reforms (that is, Basel III and risk-based supervision of
insurers)11 and should be used as an opportunity to broaden the scope of supervision to shadow
banking activities (for instance, factoring companies and cajas de compensación).
48.
There is scope to improve corporate governance and investor protection (Box 4). Chilean
companies are, on average, relatively opaque, ownership of large conglomerates is concentrated,
and levels of compliance with best practices in corporate governance are low. Given their important
role in Chile’s financial system, institutional investors, such as pension fund administrators, can
encourage Chilean businesses to improve corporate governance (Brandao-Marques 2016). For
instance, institutional investors could give preference to investments in companies with high
governance standards and protection of minority shareholder interests. These standards could be

FMC as an important step towards a more
integrated approach to financial sector supervision and to more coordination among supervisors. In
addition, the FMC constitutes an opportunity to improve the regulation and supervision of certain
parts of the shadow banking sector and to strengthen the supervision of financial conglomerates.
However, the authorities noted there were risks that a lengthy discussion in Congress of the GBL
could further postpone the adoption of Basel III solvency requirements for banks. They noted,
however, that banks were already meeting liquidity requirements and that capital buffers were strong
and would not require substantial upgrading to meet the new standards.

STAFF APPRAISAL
50.
Chile is facing a challenging macroeconomic outlook. Growth prospects are dampened by
waning tailwinds from slower growth in trading partners and a decline in trend growth. High income
inequality amid ageing population are raising the urgency to address social needs, especially from
low old-age pensions. An ambitious reform package aims to address these challenges, but it will take
time for results to become tangible.
51.
Despite these challenges, Chile has grown faster than others in the region. Since 2014,
growth averaged 2 percent, substantially below rates of 4 percent a few years ago, but well above
the Latin-American six largest countries average. This owes to a credible and effective fiscal and
monetary framework, a modern and stable financial system, and a flexible exchange rate.
52.
The policy mix remains moderately supportive of activity. The freely floating exchange
rate is helping with economic rebalancing following the large terms-of-trade shock. Monetary policy
is appropriately accommodative. If disinflationary pressures broaden and become more persistent,
interest rates should be lowered. Fiscal policy is appropriately shifting towards consolidation given
the sizable structural deficit. Chile can, however, proceed slowly with consolidation in the near term
given its strong public net-asset position. The role of the Advisory Fiscal Council could be
strengthened to buttress policy credibility.
53.
Chile’s pension system is rooted in sound principles, but low coverage, insufficient lifetime savings, and low minimum pension need to be addressed. Any pension reform should
preserve the current system, but strengthen its delivery for current and future generations by

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

expanding the public solidarity pillar and raising contribution rates for the contributory pillar. The
mandatory retirement age should be adjusted in line with rising life-expectancy.
54.
Structural reforms adopted since 2014 are setting the stage for stronger growth. The
closing of Chile’s infrastructure gap could be facilitated by the creation of a new Infrastructure Fund
geared at attracting private capital. Workers’ skills should be enhanced further through improved
and more specialized education and training programs. Legal uncertainties related to the new labor
bill should be tackled. Cutting red tape and improved access to capital by small- and medium-sized
companies could help dynamic firms to grow faster and enhance productivity.
55.
The financial sector is healthy, but risks to financial stability bear close monitoring and
regulatory reforms should be adopted swiftly. Credit risks have risen as a result of slow growth,
but non-performing loans have so far remained low. Financial sector supervision is sound, but the
regulatory framework risks falling behind international standards. Adoption of Basel III capital
requirements and risk-based supervision of the insurance sector should be a priority. Improving
coordination and information sharing among financial sector supervisors and the central bank
remains important. Finally, there is scope to strengthen corporate governance and investor
protection.

Box 2. The Impact of Financial Shocks on Economic Activity
In Chile, tighter financial conditions have a sizable impact on real economic activity. Using a newly
developed Financial Conditions Index (FCI) for Chile, a VAR analysis finds that a 1 standard deviation
tightening of financial conditions lowers GDP growth by about 0.3 percentage points within one year.
Estimates are robust to different specifications and estimates and exclude the effects of monetary policy and
exchange rate changes which are controlled for separately (Annex I). 1
The growth impact of financial shocks in Chile varies with global financial conditions. In 2010, a period
of relatively adverse external conditions, the effect of financial tightening on economic activity was three
times as high as in 2016. An important channel of transmission is the deterioration of the balance sheets of
non-financial corporations. Empirical analysis shows that an adverse shock to the FCI is associated with a
more than doubling of expected default rates of moderately risky firms within one year.

Box 4. Policies to Enhance Corporate Governance
Chile has high-quality institutions, but compares less favorably in terms of corporate governance and
corporate transparency. Chile has the highest quality of the rule of law among emerging markets.
However, its largest corporations, on average, display low corporate governance scores, especially in terms
of transparency and executive compensation practices (Figure 4.1). The discrepancy between the high quality
of institutions and the level of corporate governance and transparency can be explained, in part, by the
highly concentrated ownership of its firms and the prevalence of conglomerates (OECD, 2015a and 2015b).

International experience shows that equity ownership by institutional investors, such as mutual
funds, insurance companies, and pension funds is typically associated with better firm governance.
Studies using data from U.S. companies have found that higher institutional ownership tend to improve firm
governance (Crane, Michenaud, and Weston, 2016). In addition, the engagement of institutional investors
with firm governance seems stronger when they are large blockholders with a long investment horizon
(MCahery, Sautner, and Starks, 2016 forthcoming).

Box 4. Policies to Enhance Corporate Governance (concluded)
In Chile, where institutional investors are important minority shareholders, the introduction of a
voluntary stewardship codes could be a powerful tool to promote good corporate governance among
investee companies. The goal of such codes is to ensure that institutional investors are effectively engaged
in the promotion of long-term success of the companies they own. Stewardship codes typically are voluntary
and use a “principle-based” approach to increase disclosure and encourage monitoring by institutional
investors, including asset managers, insurance companies, and pension funds. The first country to adopt a
stewardship was the United Kingdom, in 2010. In Japan, a similar Code was adopted in 2014 and led to a
broad-based uptake among institutional investors, investment managers, and pension and insurance funds.
Incentivized governance codes could also be used to enhance transparency in Chile’s non-financial
sector. Governance codes for listed non-financial corporates have been a successful in strengthening
corporate transparency and accountability in the UK. As of 2014, over 90 percent of firms in the FTSE 350
index are compliant with the governance code. Adoption in Chile could be incentivized by linking its
subscription to the inclusion of a listed company in key equity market indices.

Annex I. Characterizing Chilean Financial Cycles:
A Financial Conditions Index for Chile
Financial conditions are broadly defined as the ease of access to funding. They refer to
conditions emanating from within the financial sector and are separate from the effects of monetary
policy and exchange rate movements which also affect financing conditions for businesses and
households, but originate outside the financial sector. Financial conditions can affect economic
conditions through three channels, credit, leverage, and risk. When households and corporations
cannot easily obtain credit or equity financing, consumption and investment may be negatively
affected. Changes in financial conditions exacerbate business cycle fluctuations through the balance
sheets of borrowers (Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist, 1999). In addition, changes in the quality of the
balance sheets and risk-taking incentives of financial firms (lenders) also affect economic activity
through their effect on the effective supply of funds (Gilchrist and Zakrajsek, 2012 and October 2016
GFSR, Chapter 2).
Measurement of financial conditions. It is widely acknowledged that no single variable fully
captures financial conditions, interactions are likely and guidance from economic theory is limited. To
capture a broad range of relevant conditions, the financial conditions index (FCI) represents a
common element of a broad set of financial indicators. For Chile, the FCI is based on information
from 42 variables that capture credit conditions, leverage levels, quality of collateral, and intensity of
perceived risks (Table A.I.1). The sample used for the estimation of the FCI starts in January 1996 and
ends in June 2016.
Methodology. To characterize the financial developments in Chile we combine information from 42
financial variables into a single indicator, a Financial Conditions Index (FCI). The method used to
estimate the FCI is based on Koop and Korobilis (2014).1 It combines the estimation of Primiceri’s
(2005) time-varying parameter vector-autoregression (TVP-VAR) with recent developments in factor
analysis for large data sets (Doz, Giannone, and Reichlin, 2011). The empirical model is given by

   B1,t 

 ft 
 ft 1 
 ft 2 
in which X is a vector of financial variables, Y is a vector of macroeconomic variables (inflation,
IMACEC growth, the real effective exchange rate, and the monetary policy rate), f is an unobservable
factor,2 and  and u are uncorrelated (but heteroskedastic) error terms. In this setting, the factor f is
the financial conditions index (FCI) and the coefficients y and f are the factor loadings which track
the effect of both macroeconomic and financial conditions on each financial variable.

1

The FCI is estimated using Koop and Korobilis’ 2014 code, which was downloaded from Dimitris Korobilis’ webpage
(https://sites.google.com/site/dimitriskorobilis/matlab).
2

The model can accommodate multiple factors, although doing so complicates the interpretation of the first factor as
the FCI. The Bai and Ng’s (2002) statistic suggests the model’s fit can be improved with more factors.

General and special cases. The model given by (A.1.1), in addition to the TVP-VAR FCI, has two
other useful special cases in which the VAR parameters are not time-varying: (1) the principal
components-based factor-augmented VAR (PCA-FAVAR) by Stock and Watson (2002) and Bernanke,
Boivin, and Eliasz (2005); and (2) the Kalman-filter based factor-augmented VAR (KF-FAVAR) by Doz,
Giannone, and Reichlin (2011). Because of the close tracking of the three models, the more
sophisticated methods (TVP-FAVAR) can be approximated by simpler alternatives (PCA-FAVAR).
However, a time-varying parameter framework as implementable through the TVP-FAVAR FCI is still
useful because it allows the measured effect of financial conditions on economic activity to change
over time (see Box 2).
Interpreting the FCI. The FCI is normalized around 0 over the observation period (1996–2006) and
values above zero indicate “loose” and below zero “tight” conditions. The methodology estimates
financial conditions adjusted for the business cycle and monetary policy: the constructed FCI is
purged of cyclical influence by controlling for the contemporaneous and lagged correlation with
GDP; and the policy interest rate is included as a separate variable in the VAR framework, such that
fluctuations in the FCI do not capture the direct effect of monetary policy decisions. Variables
included in the FCI cover three main dimensions: risk (several interest rate spreads and asset price
volatilities), collateral values and leverage (measures of gross external debt, bank leverage, housing
and stock prices, short-term versus long-term mutual fund assets, and pension fund assets), and
credit (commercial, consumption, and mortgage loans and various measures of credit quality).
Widening spreads, declining collateral/credit volumes, and decreasing leverage all denote a
tightening in financial conditions.

than average.3 Financial conditions were
relatively easy between 2004 and the GFC
(2008–09), and also proved sensitive to the European sovereign debt crisis (2011–12). Although the
FCI demonstrates that the financial system has healed significantly since the GFC, financial conditions
have tightened since the end of the commodity super-cycle: an increase in Chile’s EMBIG spread,
higher exchange rate volatility, and a rise in the likelihood of nonfinancial corporate defaults have all
contributed to a declining trend in financial conditions. Lower than average consumer and
commercial credit by Chilean banks have also contributed.

rate = exchange rate measured as dollars per one thousand Chilean Pesos.

In 2016, financial conditions shifted from loose to neutral. The contribution of each factor to the
TVP-FAVAR FCI—credit, leverage, and risk—has changed over time. In 2013–14, credit variables
tended to improve financial conditions, whereas risk and leverage had the opposite effect (Figure
A.I.2). Since 2015, however, credit, leverage, and risk have moved together: overall widening spreads,
declining collateral/credit volumes, and decreasing leverage led to some tightening in financial
conditions, and vice-versa in 2016.4

3

During the Asian crisis, Chile’s monetary policy rate (not included in the FCI since it describes the monetary policy
stance) spiked but the exchange rate and credit spreads were relatively stable. This explains why the FCI does not
show very tight financial conditions during that episode.
4

In every year since 2013, except in the first six months of 2016, the change in financial conditions was lower than
what warranted by cyclical macroeconomic conditions. The difference between the measured change in the FCI
(purple diamond) and the total contribution of credit, leverage, and risk (blue x-mark in Figure A.I.2) reflects the
change in the FCI that is associated with the change in financial variables, excluding the change in the
macroeconomic variables (Y).

Corporate sector debt is elevated relative to peers. The sector’s debt/GDP ratio has increased
markedly over the past 5 years, and now stands at around 150 percent of GDP as of 2016Q1
(calculations exclude ‘other accounts payable’). This rise partly reflects valuation effects associated
with the sharp (50 percent) depreciation of the peso since its peak in 2011. Moreover, between 2013
and 2015, among large listed nonfinancial

coming years; the vast majority of debt is issued long-term at fixed interest rates; and finally Chilean
firms’ interest-coverage ratios compare favorably to those in other economies (particularly EMs).
Foreign-currency debt of NFCs is largely issued in foreign markets, with only 17 percent issued
locally. Of the foreign-currency debt issued externally, nearly 50 percent is FDI, 30 percent is bonds,
and about 20 percent is loans. In addition,

around 4 percentage points since 2012Q1).

Banks in Chile exhibit a relatively high loan-to-deposit ratio. Compared to most emerging
market economies, this important measure of funding stability appears elevated, standing at around
110 percent—the ratio is even elevated when considered relative to many advanced economies (see
chart). Previous work on this subject (Staff Report, 2014) indicated that although there is
considerable heterogeneity across individual banks, Chilean banks as a whole rely heavily on
institutional deposits (with mutual funds being the biggest institutional depositor), which raises
concerns given that these

shocks. Non-bank financial
corporations (pension funds and insurers) have stable debt-to-asset ratios (around 1.2).
Government debt is very low by international standards, but has risen significantly since the
end of the copper-price boom. At about 20 percent of GDP, debt is low and well-structured
(predominantly long-term). However, this ratio has doubled since late 2010 as spending has
increased and tax revenues have not kept pace, in the wake of a marked economic downturn.

B. Corporate Stress Tests
This section estimates the solvency risk of Chilean nonfinancial corporates under an adverse
macroeconomic scenario. To this aim, staff uses a new corporate default database and a Bottom-up
Default Analysis (BuDA) tool developed by Duan, Sun, and Wang (2015). BuDA forecasts the
empirical distribution of the probability of default (PD) of financial and nonfinancial firms as a
function of macroeconomic conditions, firm-specific balance sheet information, and market-based
factors.1 The model is first calibrated using default and other exit data and firm-level financial
information, for a large sample of firms from emerging market economies. It then estimates firm
balance sheet variables as a function of macroeconomic and financial market variables such as real
GDP and interest rates. Finally, it forecasts firm-level probabilities of default (PDs) based on firms’
balance sheets. The projected PDs can then be used to estimate the impact on banks’ balance sheets.

BuDA uses market and balance sheet data and could provide input for bank stress testing exercises. However, it only
measures the credit risk of listed firms and may be sensitive to structural changes.

of the PDs requires a doubling of total loan loss provisions for commercial credit by banks, the
required increase in provisions would amount to 1 percent of assets, or 80 percent of annual profits.

C. Inter-Sectoral Balance-Sheet Linkages
Data on balance sheet linkages across sectors highlight several possible channels of contagion.
Non-financial corporates have a large net liability position vis-à-vis the rest of the world (about
40 percent of GDP) (see table), highlighting a possible vulnerability to changes in external funding
conditions. Domestic banks have significant net asset claims on households (predominantly
mortgages) and NFCs (business loans, of which about 75 percent are in pesos), suggesting that an
adverse shock to balance sheets in these sectors could threaten bank capital. Finally, households
hold a large amount of assets in pension and insurance companies (‘other financial corporates’)
signaling the possibility of major contagion in the event of large negative shocks to that sector.

Relative to other countries in Latin America, cross-sector exposures appear elevated and are
complex. NFC external debt is high relative to peers—similar inter-sectoral balance sheet exercises
conducted for Mexico and Brazil indicate smaller net liability positions of NFCs in those countries,
vis-à-vis the rest of the world (about 22 and 32 of GDP, respectively). In addition, linkages between
other financial corporates (pension funds and insurance companies) and banks are significant in
Chile, implying an important possible contagion channel in the event of an adverse shock to the
banking sector. Given households’ large net claims on these other financial corporates (about 81
percent of GDP), any substantial default by the banking sector on its liabilities could ultimately feed
through to household balance sheets.
Although cross-sector balance sheet exposures are somewhat elevated, analysis suggests that
contagion risks are modest, even for fairly large shocks.2 Using a network analysis (based on
Espinosa-Vega and Sole, 2010) we consider the cross-sector implications of a 10 percent default on
liabilities of a given sector. Results suggest that

Given sectoral interconnectedness, larger shocks to the non-financial private sector can lead
to cascading failures. For example, a 25 default by both households and NFCs would leave
banks—and subsequently OFCs—insolvent (see figure).
Scenario: Cascading Failures Following from
25 Percent Default by NFC and Households

2

Throughout this contagion analysis, we make the non-trivial assumption that the rest of world, central bank, and
public sectors are sufficiently well capitalized that they can withstand any shock to Chile’s private sector—as such,
their capital loss following a shock to other sectors is not considered in the scenario analysis. We do not think this is
contentious for the rest of world or central bank. For the public sector, the strength of its balance sheet also makes
this a reasonable assumption.
3

Approximate shock thresholds which lead to insolvency in a particular sector were also calculated. Analysis suggests
that a combined 15 percent default by households and NFC would leave the banking sector insolvent; as would a
20 percent default by NFCs, or a 30 percent default by households.

Annex III. Financing Options of the Proposed Pension Reform
Context. The Chilean authorities are debating options for a pension reform to raise future pension
benefits, bring pensions in line with higher life expectancy, and to increase the support for and
coverage of minimum solidarity pensions. Simulations using a general equilibrium model assess
growth implications while exploring different financing options. In general, simulations show that the
proposed reforms improve low-income pensions with some mild impact on GDP growth.
The current system. Chile’s pension system is based mainly on a contributory scheme with
individual savings accounts, administrated by privately-owned corporations (Administradoras de
Fondos de Pensiones AFPs). The system was created in 1981 and sought to establish an
intergenerationally fair system while reducing the role of the state in social security. It also aimed to
raise domestic savings and to provide workers with better pensions. Contribution to the system were
set at 10 percent of annual income. For old-age pensions, the minimum retirement age is set at 60
for women and 65 for men. Pensioners with low life time-savings and individuals not covered by the
contributory system fall under a publicly-funded solidarity pillar, which currently covers 60 percent of
the poor at a fiscal cost of 0.7 percent of GDP per year.1
Main issues. A 2015 commission (Comisión Bravo) comprising international experts identified several
shortcoming of the current system: replacement rates are very low, benefits and eligibility vary
significantly by gender, and

pillar would need to increase by
an additional 0.2 percent of GDP per year in the course of the next decade in order to maintain
current benefits. The commission also proposes an increase of individual contributions to raise the
adequacy of future pensions.
Reform. Drawing on the recommendations of the 2015 commission report, the government
announced in August plans to: 1) gradually increase contribution rates by 5 percentage points over a
10-year time span; 2) allocate the additional revenue in yet-to-be-determined shares to individual
accounts and for solidarity or pay-as-you-go (PAYG) related payments (which improve pensions of
current retirees), and 3) reduce costs of the pension fund administration (although, it is still not

Fiscal costs related to pensions exceed expenditures under the solidarity pillar, since the government continues to
carry the transition cost between the fully contributory system and the pre-1980 defined benefit system. This cost is
projected to decrease from 1.4 percent of GDP currently to below 1 percent in 10 years
1

2

High administrative costs were highlighted in a comparative study by the OECD, which emphasized how hidden
costs are the main reason for such a finding (Tapia W., J. Yermo, 2008, Fees in Individual Account Pension Systems,
OECD Working Papers on Insurance and Private Pensions No. 27).

clearly defined what measures will be adopted). The government is not planning to change the
retirement age, at the moment.
Analysis. The choice between allocating the revenue from higher contributions between individual
accounts and higher current pensions has non-trivial implications on consumption and on whether
individuals regard the contributions as a pure tax or forced savings. Because of the different reform
objectives—to increase capital accumulation in individual pension accounts and to support lowincome old households though a solidarity pillar—a differentiation in funding may be desirable. To
gauge the economic effect of alternative funding approaches, we ran model simulations. Our goal is
to conduct a positive analysis of the impact of the reform on macro variables over the near to
medium run.
The model. We use the IMF Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal (GIMF) model to simulate the
reform and assess its macroeconomic impact. The model features three-region open-economy
framework, with Chile, Asia and the rest of the world. Given the importance of analyzing the reform
in light of its impact on the labor market, an open-economy framework seems the most appropriate
for an economy like Chile. GIMF features agents who behave according to a life-cycle framework
(overlapping generations (OLG) agents a la Blanchard Yaari, 1985) and liquidity-constrained
households, who have no access to financial markets. Since OLG agents are born and die as workers,
we will treat the liquidity-constrained as retirees. This is because, similar to retirees, those agents
have a high consumption rate and do not optimize over their life-cycle. For instance, they cannot
fully re-optimize their life-time consumption plans after any reform announcement (actual retirees
have only limited ways to do that).3
Reform simulations. The reform scenarios are nested on a baseline projection that envisages an
increase in old-age workers and a pressure towards an increase in fiscal funding for the solidarity
pension. Under a baseline with no-policy action an increasing share of lower-income class elderlies
will not be covered by the solidarity pensions. The reform’s simulations are as follows:
1) The increase in (employer-side) contributions is modeled as a gradual increase in labor tax by
5 percentage points, over 10 years.
2) A fraction of the additional resources from higher contributions (assume 50 percent) will be
rebated back to the retirees through solidarity pensions.
3) The remaining fraction (the other 50 percent) will be allocated to an asset (or reduction of debt
for the government) and be used for gradually rising transfers in the future (mimicking better
future pensions), after 10 model-years (we name this benchmark reform as “mixed-option”).
Mixed-option 1 funded by higher contribution rates. Figure 1 displays the impact of the reform
on the main macroeconomic variables. The charts plot the percentage differences of all variables
3

In this version of GIMF, to make liquidity-constrained look more similar to retirees we have turned off their labor
supply decisions. In this fashion. their labor income could be seen just as a transfer. Anything that reduced aggregate
labor supply and income can be seen as retirees receiving lower solidarity pensions as tax revenue falls. Given that our
goal is not a welfare but a macro assessment of alternative reforms, this feature will be relevant.

from baseline. Real GDP declines by slightly more than 0.5 percent by 2021 (0.1 percentage points
less growth per year in the first 5–6 years), relative to a no-policy-action baseline, because the
pension reform implies higher taxes on labor, lower employment, lower aggregate consumption (due
to a fall of OLG/highly contributing agents’ consumption) and investment. However, liquidityconstrained agents are better-off than in the baseline as targeted transfers (pensions) raise their
consumption. Exports are also lower in the reform scenario as higher labor cost dampens
competitiveness, leading to an appreciation of the real effective exchange rate (REER).4
Mixed option 2 with alternative funding mix. In an alternative reform scenario, we assume that
the government finances the solidarity pillar with a consumption tax, under the rationale that the
additional budget spending via the solidarity pillar should be funded from a global base. Figure 2
shows the results when we simulate the reform using a consumption tax (red dashed line) instead of
a labor tax as in authorities’ proposed reform (blue solid line) to provide the same funding to the
solidarity pillar. We find that the impact of the reform on GDP is more muted relative to the reform
proposed by authorities. GDP is only about 0.2 percent lower than the baseline by 2021. Raising part
of the total funds of the reform using a less distortionary tax reduces the labor cost wedge so that
labor supply and investment are less penalized. Funding via a consumption tax also implies less
impairments of competitiveness so that exports decline less than in case of the authorities’ reform.
Consumption of the liquidity-constrained is similar to the case of authorities’ reform proposal, since
it is still supported by transfers (pensions).5
Full option with higher contributions channeled to individual accounts. We analyze the case
that the revenue from higher contributions will be used only to finance better pensions in the future,
through the existing defined-contributions system. Figure 3 shows the results when funds only go to
individual accounts (red dashed line) as opposed to using a part to also finance the solidarity/PAYG
pillar as in the mixed option (blue solid line, as in Figure 1). In this case, aggregate consumption is
lower over the near to medium run relative to case of the mixed option, given that now higher taxes
and less labor income is not compensated by higher pensions for the current retirees. Aggregate
savings and interest rates are higher, further discouraging domestic investment.6 Lower domestic
inflation in the short run relative to the case of the mixed option (because of lower domestic
demand) leads to an improved REER position and exports are stronger. GDP is 0.7 percent lower than
the baseline by 2021, equivalent to about 0.2 percentage points lower growth in the next 5 years.

4

Given the importance of labor supply response to increase in labor tax, we perform a sensitivity analysis by varying
the degree of labor supply elasticity (Frisch). The worst results are under the assumption that the elasticity is double
the one in the benchmark calibration. GDP is about 0.8 percent lower than in the baseline by 2021, implying about
0.2 percentage points lower annual growth in the next 5 years.
5

As a caveat, since the model has no retirees and we have considered the uncovered retirees as the liquidityconstrained households in the model, the alternative scenario implies somewhat higher consumption than under
authorities’ proposed reform. This is because the liquidity-constrained also received higher labor income under the
alternative financing scenario and this effect makes a scenario with less labor tax distortions looking better. In reality,
this channel would be weaker, as better labor conditions may imply higher transfers to retirees but the impact is only
a second round effect.
6

The model features a financial accelerator a la Bernanke, Gertler and Gilchrist (1999).

and liability
position

Overall Assessment

Background. Chile’s net international investment position (NIIP) is expected to remain stable at around –20 percent of GDP in 2016,
and is stronger than other countries in the region. Chile has a net negative FDI position reflecting large inflows in the mining sector,
and a net positive equity position, with the financial sector (pension funds, mutual funds, and insurance companies) being the main
holders of foreign assets. The NIIP is projected to increase by about 10 percentage points in the next few years amid moderate
current account deficits (abstracting from valuation effects).

The external position and
the exchange rate are
broadly consistent with
medium-term
fundamentals and
desirable policy settings.
The increase in FX
private debt warrants
close monitoring.

Assessment. Gross external debt is projected at 65 percent of GDP in 2016, unchanged from this year. External debt remains
sustainable under a range of adverse scenarios including to interest rates, growth, and the exchange rate (Figure 1 and Table 1).
Current account

Background. Chile’s 2016 current account (CA) is projected at -2.2 percent of GDP, significantly improved from 3.7 percent in 2013,
reflecting significant peso depreciation (14 percent in real effective terms), marked contraction in investment-related capital imports,
and strong imports substitution for intermediate inputs. In terms of savings-investment balance, the national savings ratio would
have declined mildly by about 1 percentage point since 2013, against 3 ½ percentage points drop in the investment ratio reflecting
lower copper prices, weak global demand, and a fall in business confidence.
Assessment. At -0.6 percent of GDP in 2016, the cyclically adjusted CA deficit is above the EBA norm of -3.1 percent (40 percent of
the distance owes to policy gaps and the remaining 60 percent remains unexplained by the EBA regression, after correcting for the
commodity and output cycles). However, model estimates do not take into account the effects of low business sentiment related to
the large-scale reform package, which has suppressed investment and imports. Once sentiment improves, the deficit should widen
and approach the norm.

Real exchange
rate and
competitiveness

Background. The Chilean peso has appreciated throughout 2016 both bilaterally and multilaterally (8 percent against the dollar,
6 percent in real effective terms), heavily influenced by financial developments. The stronger peso reflects common market trends
favoring emerging currencies (recovery in commodities and search-for-yield behavior on diminished uncertainty about
developments in China) alongside country-specific factors (sound macroeconomic fundamentals and policy track record). The peso
appreciation has been paralleled by a significant surge in interest rate arbitrage transactions (carry trade) and a recovery in the local
stock exchange.
Assessment. EBA estimates point to a moderate undervaluation of the peso in 2016 (between 5 and 10 percent). However, model
estimates do not take into account the effects of low business sentiment related to the large-scale reform package, which have
dampened investment and imports. Adjusting for this effect, the Chilean peso is assessed to be broadly in line with medium-term
fundamentals and desirable policies.
Background. The CA deficit is mostly financed from a relatively stable source of FDI net inflows related to mining activities. Chile has
been remarkably resilient to the taper tantrum episode, experiencing less capital flow volatility than other EMs. Throughout, the
corporate sector has maintained access to external funding.
Assessment. Chile has a fully open capital account. Vulnerabilities are overall limited by a credible commitment to a floating
exchange rate and a strong fiscal position.

FX intervention
and reserves
level

Background. Chile has a free floating exchange rate regime. The central bank generally does not intervene in the foreign exchange
market. Nonetheless, Chile had two recent intervention programs in 2008 and 2011, both aimed at weakening the peso and both
based on purchases of USD. The Bank of Chile has 6 months of reserves, which is estimated as adequate according to standard
reserve adequacy metrics.
Assessment. A flexible exchange rate is the first line of defense in a small economy exporting commodities like Chile, with a large
exposure to international shocks.

growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising
inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium-and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels

Monetary Policy
Continued monetary accomodation.
Fiscal Policy
Starting a process of fiscal consolidation in 2016.

Structural Reforms
To minimize the potential for short-term negative effects on growth:
Ensure that the reform of the labor market improves its efficiency.

Pursue the education reform with a view to raising the quality of Chile's human capital

Clarify procedures of the constitutional reform

Strengthen public and private sectors' governance and institutions
Improve corporate governance, investor protection, and market transparency
Mobilize private resources to fill Chile's infrastructure gap, for instance, by an improved PPP
framework
Financial Sector Recommendations
Adopt additional prudential measures if corporate leverage accelerates

Policy Actions

Amidst disinflationary pressures and weakening activity, the Central Bank has left the policy rate unchanged at 3 ½ percent
since the beginning of the year, and softened its policy guidance in successive policy meetings.
Fiscal policy was expansionary in 2016, but the stance was appropriate given the larger than expected growth slowdown. The
2017 budget has appropriately shifted towards fiscal consolidation.

Law 20.940 (promulgation August 29, 2016, entry into force April 2017) provides for more balanced industrial relations.
However, it also presents legal ambiguities on collective barganing arrangements, possibly giving rise to multi-year judicial
processes to settle disputes and elevated implementation costs.
Implementation of education reforms has proceeded. Legislative proposals (approved or in train) to reduce seggregation in
Chile's primary and secondary school system include law 20.845 on school inclusion; law 20.903 on national teaching policy;
law 20.911 on a citizenship training plan; and a draft bill on a new public education system. For tertiary education, law
20.890 grants universal tertiary education (conditional on the availability of public resources), while a draft bill for the reform
of tertiary education is currently in Congress.
A process for moving forward with the constitutional reform has been laid out and a drawn-out consultation process
initiated to involve the public in the discourse.

Pending. This could be achieved, for instance, through the introduction of voluntary stewardship codes.
A draft bill for the creation of a new Infrastructure Fund is currently in Congress.

Corporate leverage has remained broadly unchanged. The macro-prudential stance has been unchanged since last year, but
credit growth has slowed further reducing the need for a tightening.

Pass the General Banking Law (GBL) (Basel III capital standards)

Not passed. Discussions about the adoption of Basel III have been underway since 2013. Proposed amendments to the GBL
would bolster the sector’s resilience but its adoption could slip into the next administration.

Pass the bill that implements risk-based supervision and new solvency requirements for
insurance companies
Strengthen the supervision of financial conglomerates

No passed. The draft law introducing risk-based supervision for the insurance sector is awaiting approval from the Senate
since 2013.

Source: IMF Staff.

The proposed creation of the Financial Markets Commission (FMC) would be an important step towards an integrated view
of financial sector supervision that may allow a more effective oversight of financial conglomerates.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of July 1, 2015)
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance. The National Institute of Statistics (INE)
regularly publishes a full range of economic and financial data. The Central Bank of Chile (CBC)
also publishes comprehensive macroeconomic and financial data. The Ministry of Finance
publishes fiscal data.
Key publicly accessible websites for macroeconomic data and analysis are:
National Institute of Statistics: http://www.ine.cl/
Central Bank of Chile: http://www.bcentral.cl/
Ministry of Finance: http://www.minhda.cl/
Recent Developments: The Central Bank started to publish housing real estate price data in
2014, and a new series on external debt at market values in 2015 which allows better monitoring
and identification of risks. The National Institute of Statistics (INE) has revised the basket and
methodology of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) including to address some limitations in the
clothing sub-index.
Data Standards and Quality
Subscriber to the Fund’s Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since May 17,
1996. In coordination with STA, Chile is in the
process to gain adherence to SDSS plus.

A data ROSC was published September 17,
2007.

Reporting to STA (Optional)
The CBC uses the standardized report forms (SRFs) to report monthly data for the central bank,
other depository corporations (ODCs), other financial corporations (OFCs), and monetary
aggregates. However, data for the ODCs exclude savings and credit cooperatives and OFCs exclude
investment funds, general funds, housing funds, foreign capital investment funds, factoring
societies, leasing companies, and financial auxiliaries.
The CBC reports all core and 7 of 28 encouraged financial soundness indicators on a monthly basis.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Chile
December 7, 2016
1.
This statement reports on information that has become available since the staff report
was issued. It does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Activity remained soft in October due to a contraction in mining. Chile´s leading
economic index IMACEC decreased 0.4 percent year-on-year in October of 2016, following
a 1.5 percent rise in September. The mining component declined 7.1 percent while the nonmining index increased 0.3 percent. The latter reflected an increase in services, partly offset
by the fall in manufacturing industry.
3.
Markets expect monetary policy to ease. The November survey of economic
expectations showed a shift in expectations. Compared to September, analysts now expect
two policy rate cuts in 2017. Inflation expectations for year-end fell by three tenths to 3
percent in November, while remaining stable at 3 percent at both a one- and two-year horizon
(BCCh Economic expectations survey).

Statement by Mr. Estrella, Executive Director for Chile, and
Mr. Vicuna, Advisor to the Executive Director
December 7, 2016
On behalf of the Chilean authorities, we would like to thank the staff for the Report on the
occasion of the 2016 Article IV Consultation. The authorities appreciate the constructive
discussions and thoughtful analysis conducted during the consultation process, following the
tradition of an open and candid dialogue between the authorities and Fund staff.
Chile’s macroeconomic policy framework is based on four long-standing pillars. As a first pillar,
the framework includes a structural fiscal rule that takes into account the long-term price of
copper and the business cycle. Second, price stability under inflation targeting and a flexible
exchange-rate regime implemented by an independent central bank. A third pillar corresponds to
a financial system that is well capitalized and adequately regulated and supervised; and the
fourth, open trade and financial integration with international markets. Supported by these
pillars, the authorities remain committed to sound macroeconomic policies and assign a high
priority to continued progress on reforms aimed to achieve higher and more inclusive growth. In
pursuing these objectives, they are fully cognizant of the need to carefully weigh the short-run
trade-offs involved.
Background and Economic Outlook
In recent years, the Chilean economy has continued to grow, albeit moderately, below its
potential. The economic slowdown has been more intense and prolonged than expected,
influenced by the end of the commodity super cycle and subdued global growth. The significant
fall in copper prices, Chile’s main export, from US$ 4.0 in 2011 to US$ 2.5 in 2015, and around
US$ 2.15 in 2016, has had a significant negative impact on mining investment, national income,
and domestic expenditure. Weak domestic confidence indicators have also delayed a stronger
recovery in private expenditure, in particular, non-mining investment.
Medium-term growth estimates have also declined, partly due to the deceleration of aggregate
productivity. Additional factors include the lower expansion of the labor force due to
demographic trends, and importantly, the weakening of investment in recent years. In this regard,
the Chilean economy faces the twofold challenge of transiting through a cyclical adjustment and
increasing its capacity for medium-term growth.
The policy mix has played an important role in facilitating the cyclical adjustment, including an
accommodative monetary policy by the central bank and fiscal deficits, in line with the fiscal
rule and the operation of automatic stabilizers. In turn, a freely floating exchange allowed an

2
early improvement of the current account deficit, which in 2016 is expected to reach around 1.6
percent of GDP (3.7 percent in 2013).
The ongoing real adjustment implies a resource reallocation from those sectors that benefited
from previous high commodity prices, toward those that have become more attractive as result of
real exchange rate depreciation. Evidence on relative employment growth in non-mining versus
mining zones, higher dynamism in certain agricultural and industry exports and the gradual
recovery in non-mining investment confirms that the reallocation of resources is taking place.
The economic rebalancing takes time to fully materialize, however, and must be supported by an
appropriate policy mix.
The central bank forecasts GDP growth in 2016 within a range between 1.5 percent and 2.0
percent and between 1.75 and 2.75 percent in 2017. Domestic demand is expected to be
dampened by a loosening labor market but helped by a gradual improvement in private sentiment
and the recovery of investment, while exports are expected to pick-up. A main risk to the outlook
stems from China’s growth sustainability and its implications for commodity prices and financial
markets. Protectionism represents an additional risk for an open economy as Chile. On the
positive side, the economy is well placed to take advantage of a global economic upside,
considering the absence of macroeconomic imbalances and sound fundamentals.
The authorities coincide with the staff that trend growth has declined in recent years, yet caution
that estimates are uncertain and subject to revisions as new data is included. In particular, the
recovery in productivity growth could be stronger than projected by staff and closer to long-term
averages. The authorities broadly agree on the factors behind declining potential growth and take
positive note of the staff’s productivity enhancing recommendations.
Monetary Policy
The Central Bank of Chile sets its monetary policy based on a long-standing inflation-targeting
framework and a flexible exchange rate regime. The framework has afforded monetary policy
the necessary flexibility to respond to economic fluctuations, while preserving inflationary
expectations anchored at the 3 percent target within a two-year horizon.
Last July, annual inflation returned to the upper limit of the target band (3 plus/minus 1 percent)
and has decreased rapidly thereafter, reaching 2.8 percent in October. The previous period of
inflation above the target band was driven by a significant peso depreciation, which has receded
during 2016. The transitory nature of an exchange rate shock, the absence of second-round
effects from devaluation and well anchored medium-term inflationary expectations have allowed
the central bank to pursue an accommodative monetary policy during this cycle. This
expansionary policy has been reflected in the low interest rates on central bank bonds and
lending rates in the financial system.

3
In the last monetary policy meeting, the central bank board noted that at short terms, inflation
expectations have dropped, but are still well anchored at 3 percent by the end of the projection
horizon. In addition, the monetary authorities reiterated their commitment to conduct monetary
policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3 percent over the policy horizon. Any
future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and
external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook.
Fiscal Policy
The fiscal authorities are implementing a gradual fiscal consolidation in order to reach a
structural balanced budget position over the medium term, while allowing automatic stabilizers
to operate. Accordingly, they are gradually reducing the structural deficit by approximately 0.25
percentage points per year, which in 2016 is estimated to reach 1.7 percent of GDP.
In January this year, the authorities summoned an extraordinary meeting of the committee of
experts that define the long-term price of copper used to calculate the structural budget. As a
result, the long-term price of copper was reduced by almost 14 percent, increasing the estimated
structural deficit for 2016 above the pre-announced objective. In response to lower structural
revenues and reaffirming their commitment towards sound public finances, the authorities
implemented an extraordinary expenditure reduction, equivalent to 0.25 percent of GDP, mostly
on current expenditures.
Congress recently approved the 2017 fiscal budget, with an extended support from all political
parties, consistent with the announced fiscal consolidation plan. It considers a prudent expansion
of expenditures, equivalent to 2.7 percent, lightly expansionary when compared to the expected
GDP growth. Education, healthcare, and citizen security are main spending priorities, while progrowth public investment remains at historically high levels, around 4 percent of GDP.
Fiscal solvency has allowed the country’s risk premium to be among the lowest in emerging
markets, with positive effects on financing costs for companies and households. The fiscal
authorities agree that maintaining fiscal credibility should be a priority and remain vigilant of the
medium-term trajectory of public debt which remains low, although it has increased rapidly in
recent years. The authorities also see merit in strengthening the independence and mandate of the
Advisory Fiscal Council, but do not see it as an immediate priority in the context of a crowded
legislative agenda and already high fiscal credibility.
Financial Sector
The staff finds that financial sector balance sheets are healthy but identifies vulnerabilities from
high corporate leverage, household indebtedness, and strong inter-sectoral financial linkages.
The authorities do not see significant risks to financial stability originating in the corporate
sector, although they note that the real estate sector and SMEs pose pockets of vulnerabilities.

4
Central bank stress tests find corporate balance sheets to be only mildly sensitive to exchange or
interest rate shocks, and that a very large shock to GDP is needed for substantial stresses to
emerge. In turn, aggregate household debt ratios continue rising, albeit moderately, in a context
of less dynamic output and employment. Although banks’ non-performing indicators remain
low, a stronger deterioration of the labor market may hinder households’ repayment capacity.
Any developments on this front are being closely monitored by the authorities.
Bank lending is evolving in line with the business cycle, and non-performing loans remain
stable, although with a mild deterioration in the commercial loans portfolio. According to the
central bank, the current levels of bank capitalization are sufficient to absorb a severe stress
scenario. However, financial buffers have tightened; under a severe stress scenario, all banks
remain with a Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) above the 8 percent regulatory minimum, but the
fraction of banks showing a CAR above 10 percent has declined in recent years.
The authorities coincide with staff on the need to move ahead with the financial sector legislative
agenda. In this regard, a new legislation improving the regulatory and supervisory framework for
securities and insurance sectors, including the creation of a new Financial Market Commission
(FMC), is at the final stage in Congress. As a next step, the authorities intend to initiate the
legislative process of the new general banking law (GBL), aligned with Basel III solvency
requirements and the objective of a more integrated approach to financial sector supervision.
Reform Agenda
As presented in the Staff Report, structural reforms adopted since 2014 are setting the stage for
stronger growth. The authorities remain committed to the educational reform oriented to increase
human capital, by improving the quality and access in all levels of the educational system.
Reforms to strengthen primary and secondary public education and teachers’ careers have
already been approved and continue to be implemented gradually, while a new legislation for
improving post-secondary education is currently under discussion in Parliament.
An ambitious productivity agenda oriented to enhance the growth capacity and inclusiveness of
the economy is also underway. The agenda covers a wide range of legal and administrative
initiatives, such as improving workers’ skills, expanding firms’ access to financing, innovation,
productive diversification, energy, infrastructure, state efficiency and competition laws.
Measures recently approved by Congress include simplifying procedures for companies,
facilitating export services, and broadening financing options for financial companies —among
them, insurance and pension fund companies— in non-traditional assets, including infrastructure
projects. Also, a new Antitrust law was approved in July. Regarding the energy sector,
investment bottlenecks have been lessened and lower energy prices have been secured by
successful electricity tenders, with associated cost reductions for the productive sector. In turn,
new labor legislation to modernize labor relations within companies was approved in August and
will start to be implemented in April 2017. The authorities are currently monitoring and

5
outreaching companies ahead of scheduled collective bargaining processes to facilitate the
implementation process.
Finally, regarding a future pension reform, the authorities agree with the key principles of staff’s
recommendations and underscore that they are working toward building the maximum consensus
amongst stakeholders. They also note that any reform proposal must be carefully evaluated for
its implications on growth, though it also needs to generate alleviation for the retired middle
class.
