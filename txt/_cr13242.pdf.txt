STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 9, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context: The export-led recovery in 2010–11 subsided as euro area import demand
slowed. Combined with weak domestic demand, growth has noticeably underperformed
trade partners and peers since the middle of 2011. Economic activity is expected to be
weak in 2013 and recover gradually thereafter. Risks are to the downside due to the
prolonged euro area recession.
Policies: Short-term macroeconomic policies should avoid creating additional drag with
a neutral fiscal stance and monetary policy addressing deflationary pressures at the zero
lower bound. In the medium- to long-term, it is important to strengthen
competitiveness, in particular, by enhancing investment both in physical and human
capital.


Further pro-cyclical fiscal policy should be avoided and a neutral stance would be
appropriate until the economic recovery gains strength. In a severe adverse scenario,
fiscal policy should play an active role through temporary and targeted measures. A
simple and easy-to-monitor structural fiscal balance rule should be adopted in order
to provide a medium term fiscal anchor.



The accommodative monetary stance should be maintained for an extended period
of time. If a persistent and large undershooting of the inflation target is in prospect,
with monetary policy constrained by the zero lower bound and fiscal policy playing
an active role, foreign exchange interventions could be employed to help guide
inflation expectations toward the target.



The financial system is strong and the main risk is a protracted or deeper recession
that would harm asset quality. Proactive bank supervision should be employed to
ensure continued adequate capital and liquidity buffers to preserve financial stability.



Investment in both physical and human capital is critical to enhance future growth
potential, and the business environment should be improved to attract private
investment. Higher labor participation, labor market flexibility, and active labor
policies are important to increase potential growth and avoid long-term negative
impact of unemployment.

the Czech economy.

PRT

1.
The Czech economy has avoided financial volatility but remains in recession. The
economy has avoided serious imbalances in the recent volatile economic environment, benefitting
from strong policy frameworks and sound fundamentals. However the export-led recovery observed
in 2010–11 subsided as euro area import demand slowed, and growth has noticeably
underperformed trade partners and peers since the middle of 2011 mainly because of weaker
domestic consumption and investment. Real GDP contracted for four quarters in a row in 2012 and
recorded a 1.2 percent decline for the year with only net exports contributing positively to growth.

3.
Headline inflation was pushed above the two percent target by the effects of indirect
taxes and food and energy prices in 2012. Inflation averaged 3.3 percent in 2012 mainly due to
increases in the VAT rates and positive contributions from foods and fuel. Both of these effects
subsided and inflation fell below the target in January 2013 and averaged 1.8 percent in the first
quarter of this year. Demand side inflationary pressures have been largely absent and inflation
expectations have been well-anchored. The Koruna has depreciated by about 3 percent since
September 2012 and is likely to become a key inflationary factor.
4.
Weak domestic demand has also narrowed the current account deficit despite slowing
export demand. The external current account deficit declined to 2.4 percent of GDP in 2012 from
2.8 percent, mainly on account of an improvement of the trade balance. Income deficit, in contrast,
widened due to higher accrued profits of foreign-owned firms. Non-FDI capital flows turned into a
moderate outflow in 2012 after strong inflows in 2009-11. The financial account surplus in 2012 was
driven by a net inflow of direct investment owing to reinvested earnings as well as a surplus on
portfolio investment. These net inflows were largely offset by a net outflow of other investment,
primarily due to a rise in short-term assets of monetary financial institutions abroad.
5.
Pro-cyclical fiscal consolidation continued in 2012 resulting in a stronger structural
fiscal position than before the crisis. The overall deficit without one-offs in 2012 was 2.5 percent
of GDP, down from 3.2 percent of GDP in 2011. The structural balance improved by 1.5 percent of
GDP on account of a combination of revenue measures, in particular an increase of the reduced VAT
rate by 4 percentage points, and expenditure measures. Fiscal over-performance relative to the
budget was largely due to under-execution of capital spending, down by 0.6 percent of GDP
compared to 2011, to 3.1 percent of GDP. This fiscal consolidation, however, became a drag on
economic activity at a time when the output gap widened by about 2 percentage points.
6.
The central bank’s policy rate has been reduced to almost zero, but credit growth
remains subdued. The Czech National Bank (CNB) continued to take a lead role in countering
economic weaknesses and cut the policy rate by 70 basis points in three steps in June, October and
November to 0.05 percent, and committed itself to continued low rates. Long-term money market
rates also moved lower in the face of weak growth and inflation expectations. This, together with
declining risk premium, made government bond yields decline to record lows. The yield on the
10-year bond stabilized around 2 percent before a moderate rise in June this year, significantly less
than peers. The falling rates, however, did not translate into faster credit growth. Credit to the
corporate sector and households grew only by 2.6 percent at end-2012 compared to 6.3 percent of
the previous year. Increased cautiousness about economic prospects played a role in limiting both
credit demand and, to a lesser extent, supply.

B. Outlook and Risks
7.
Economic activity is expected to be weak in 2013 and recover gradually thereafter. This
pattern is similar to that projected for euro area trade partners, on whom the outlook of the Czech
economy is heavily dependent. An improvement in the euro area economy will encourage Czech
exports, but only starting in late 2013, and gradually improving confidence is expected to foster
moderate domestic demand recovery thereafter. Prospects are for a prolonged period of modest
growth with the output gap closing only gradually. Inflation is forecast to hover below the 2 percent
target in 2013 and risks are to the downside. The current account deficit will remain smaller than the
historical average.
8.
Risks are mainly to the downside and the main risk is further deterioration of euro
area growth. If growth prospects for the euro area worsen, it would discourage sentiment and
delay the recovery of the already policy-constrained Czech economy (See Annex I, Risk Assessment
Matrix). Lower export demand from the euro area, the market for two-thirds of Czech exports, would
have a significant impact on the growth prospects. The recent disappointing export performance
indicates that the economy is at the risk of being dragged deeper into recession, and the current
poor growth performance, if protracted, runs the risk of translating itself into a long-term decline in
potential growth due to lower investment.
9.
The Czech financial system appears well positioned to withstand spillover risks. A
reemergence of financial stress in the euro area, possibly due to stalled or incomplete delivery of
euro area policy commitments as discussed in the Risk Assessment Matrix (Annex I), entails a risk of
deleveraging by European parent banks, which would adversely affect Czech domestic credit
conditions through parent-subsidiary relationship. However, the effect of such deleveraging would
be limited since Czech banks are self-reliant in their funding. This soundness of the financial sector
as well as good standing of balance sheets of households and the corporate sector limits the
vulnerability to the euro area financial spillovers. If risks to European financial stability were to
increase to extreme levels, spillovers could also take the form of confidence loss and become
damaging to Czech financial stability.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Against the background of the ongoing prolonged recession due to the euro area slump
and weak domestic demand, discussions focused on appropriate policy measures to
support the economy in the short term and enhance growth potential in the medium- to
long-term while mitigating long term negative impacts of the recession. Short-term
macroeconomic policies, therefore, should avoid creating additional drag with a neutral
fiscal stance and monetary policy addressing deflationary pressures at the zero lower
bound. If deflationary pressures intensify due to global or domestic risks, fiscal policy
should play an active role. In the medium- to long-term, it is important to be vigilant
against risks to potential growth and strengthen competitiveness, in particular, by
enhancing investment both in physical and human capital.

Box 1. The Authorities’ Policies and Past IMF Policy Recommendations
The policies implemented in 2012 were broadly consistent with previous IMF advice with fiscal stance being
a notable exception.
Key recommendations

Implementation

In the short-run, let automatic stabilizers work to
avoid an overly contractionary fiscal stance

Additional pro-cyclical fiscal measures were
introduced in response to a weaker growth outlook
in early 2012
The latest proposal incorporates a structural balance
rule with debt brake and a fiscal council.

Introduce a fiscal rule; preferably targeting
structural balance, covering all levels of
government, and incorporating a debt brake and
an independent fiscal council
Adopt an easing bias in monetary policy

The CNB cut its policy rate by 70 bps in three moves.

Start considering policy options for the zero
bound for interest rates. FX intervention is a good
candidate.

The CNB analyzed potential unconventional policy
tools, and announced FX interventions as the next
step.

Strengthen the financial sector framework along
the lines of FSAP recommendations

The authorities took action in many of the areas
highlighted by the FSAP. See Annex 2.

A. Fiscal Policy
10.
With a budget deficit projected below 3 percent of GDP in 2013, the Czech Republic
should be able to exit the Excessive Deficit Procedure and complete the consolidation effort
started in 2010. The total structural fiscal consolidation since 2010 has amounted to about
4.2 percent of GDP resulting in a structural deficit of 1.7 percent of GDP in 2013 (from 6 percent of
GDP in 2009). Fiscal performance this year is, so far, consistent with the budget even under a
moderately weaker macroeconomic environment than expected.

11.
The new medium-term fiscal framework modifies previous consolidation plans and
projects a relaxation in the outer years. The authorities plan to take a supportive neutral stance
in 2014 and anticipate a moderately positive fiscal stance in 2015–16 in order to support growth.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CZECH REPUBLIC

This medium-term stance, based mainly on revenue measures and with expenditures largely
consistent with the previous plans, will be anchored in a fiscal deficit around 3 percent of GDP and
will result in a structural relaxation of around 0.7 percent of GDP by 2016.
12.
A structural fiscal rule has been proposed by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to
complement the Constitutional Law on Fiscal Responsibility. It consists of a structural balance
rule with a balanced target to be achieved by 2021. This target is tighter than the medium-term
objective agreed with the European Commission (-1 percent of GDP) and would imply a structural
primary surplus of around 1.5 percent of GDP. The new framework, if approved by Parliament, will
introduce, among other things, a medium-term structural anchor, a debt brake, and a fiscal council
(Box 2). Given that current debt levels are close to the initial thresholds under the debt brake,
transitional arrangements will have to ensure that the debt brake does not become the de facto
binding fiscal rule with a pro-cyclical nature.
13.
Staff considered that a neutral fiscal stance over the next few years until the economic
recovery would gain strength was appropriate. This neutral stance would require avoiding future
fiscal over-performance and could be followed by a moderate and gradual consolidation after 2015
with the aim of achieving a structural
balance by 2021. In a severe adverse

the absorption capacity of EU funds.
14.
The authorities agreed that a neutral fiscal stance in 2014 was appropriate but saw
scope to use fiscal policy to support growth over the medium term. The authorities’ latest
update of the Convergence Program targets a headline deficit of just below 3 percent of GDP
for 2014–16, which given the cycle provides fiscal space to implement discretionary measures in
support of the economy. They argued that the budget was relatively robust to external shocks that

1

The characteristics of the Czech Republic, a small open economy with a flexible exchange rate, suggest that fiscal
multipliers are relatively small. This has been confirmed by empirical estimates that, for the output elasticity of the
budget balance, range from 0.3 to 0.5. However, the effects of fiscal policy shocks on economic activity are likely
nonlinear, and multipliers are larger in downturns than in expansions. The relationship between fiscal stance and
growth using different multipliers is depicted in the text chart. See Selected Issues Paper, Fiscal Strength of the Czech
Republic.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CZECH REPUBLIC

would, therefore, be manageable. They also thought that the risk of a severe adverse scenario had
decreased.
15.
The further fiscal reforms in progress to increase the efficiency of the public sector are
welcome. These include an introduction of the single collection point in 2014–15 consolidating
different revenue collection agencies (including revenue, customs and social security agencies), and
harmonizing the revenue bases used for the personal income tax and social security contributions.
At the same time, a new treasury system, introduced in 2013 in order to increase the coverage of the
treasury single account, would result in more comprehensive and timely expenditure reporting.
Box 2. New Fiscal Framework
The current framework, introduced in 2004, has weaknesses that lead to a pro-cyclical bias. It consists of a
three-year rolling budgetary framework that converts general government balance targets into expenditure
ceilings, the only binding numerical fiscal constraint for the state budget and six state funds. Weaknesses
include:


Lack of a clear medium-term anchor and a long-term sustainability objective



Limited coverage to less than 60 percent of general government spending



Lack of proper enforcement mechanism or corrective actions

The proposed new framework addresses most of these. The framework consists of a structural balance rule
with a balanced target and a debt brake supplemented with a borrowing constraint on local governments
and a deficit constraint on social security funds. The rule derives general government expenditure by
adjusting revenues for cyclical factors, revenue and expenditure one-offs, and a three-year correction factor.
The debt brake starts to apply when public debt, adjusted for MOF’s liquid reserves, exceeds 45 percent of
GDP and has increasingly demanding requirements if it exceeds 50, 55, and 58 percent of GDP, with a ceiling
at 60 percent of GDP. Both the debt brake and the fiscal rule incorporate some escape clauses.
The new framework consists of a Constitutional Law and an Act on Rules of Fiscal Responsibility. The former
incorporates the debt brake, Fiscal Council, and local governments’ debt rule and requires a super majority
in both chambers of Parliament to be modified. The latter specifies the practical implementation of the
Constitutional Law including the structural balance rule and requires a simple majority in both chambers of
Parliament to be modified.
Transparency and accountability would be enhanced with the introduction of an independent Fiscal Council
and a Committee for Budgetary Forecasts. The Committee would assess government forecasts requiring its
reformulation if deemed optimistic. At the same time, more demanding and regular reporting criteria would
be introduced as well as the requirement to prepare annual reports including on tax expenditures and
contingent liabilities.

B. Monetary Policy
16.
Inflation risks are to the downside while the policy rate is technically at the zero lower
bound. The CNB’s aggressive rate cuts in 2012 brought the policy rate to the zero lower bound and
it was announced that this accommodative stance would be kept for an extended period. Inflation
declined below the 2 percent target level starting from January 2013. Inflation is projected to remain
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

CZECH REPUBLIC

at around 1¾ percent through 2014 as the large output gap continue to suppress demand-side
inflation and the inflationary impact of VAT increases and energy prices moderate. Risks to inflation
forecasts are to the downside in line with the risks to the external demand and commodity prices.
17.
The CNB has identified FX interventions as the next step for monetary easing. While
details of such operations have not been specified, this is a welcome step clarifying that the CNB has
access to effective tools at the zero lower bound and helping keep control of inflation expectations.
While CNB Board members so far see the appropriate trigger for interventions slightly differently
because of different views as to the downside risks and the entry and exit costs of the operations,
there is a consensus that FX interventions would be an integral part of the inflation targeting regime.
18.
Staff agreed that, if a persistent and large undershooting of the inflation target is in
prospect, FX interventions should be employed. As the Czech Republic is a small open economy
and pass through is relatively high, FX interventions is expected to quickly help guide inflation
expectations toward the target. In contrast, purely quantitative easing through purchases of
domestic financial assets is less promising given the systemic liquidity surplus in the banking system,
scarcity of private financial assets to purchase, and the very low long-term interest rates for the
government bonds.
19.
The operational aspects of possible interventions should pay due regard to
transparency. For example, the use of pre-announced interventions of fixed sizes per period would
be a good candidate in terms of market communication and ease of exit, while allowing sufficient
flexibility to adjust as needed. The authorities agreed with the considerations of transparency and
ease of exit and reiterated the commitment to the inflation targeting regime, while they remained
noncommittal on any modality stressing the importance and advantages of flexibility.
20.
Importantly, FX interventions should potentially be used solely as a tool of inflation
targeting, not aiming at a certain exchange rate level. Staff and the authorities agreed that the
exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals. The Fund’s new EBA methodology supports this
assessment when using the current account based indicators, but diverges when using a real
exchange rate based model (Box 3). Staff’s assessment is based on the observations that the real
exchange rate derived from manufacturing ULC is below the 10-year average; Czech exports have
largely maintained their world market share despite the weakness in the core markets; the trade
balance has been positive and improving; and the country’s relative price level is consistent with its
income level.

 The koruna’s long-term appreciation trend
appears to have moderated. The Czech economy
has gone through substantial structural change in
the ‘00s integrating itself into German supply
chain and benefitting from rapid productivity
growth. These gains were the main drivers of real
exchange rate appreciation without losing
competitiveness. More recently, favorable wage
productivity dynamics in the manufacturing sector
have continued, while both nominal and real
appreciation has slowed.

 Current account deficit is stable at levels
consistent with fundamentals. The Czech
Republic has run current account deficits averaging
-2.8 percent of GDP between 2008 and 2012. These
deficits are mainly due to large foreign earnings
associated with the stock of inward direct
investment that more than outweighs the trade surplus.

source of financing. The accumulated external
deficits over the years have led to a moderate
negative net international investment position (NIIP) of about 50 percent of GDP, but reflecting the
prevalence of FDI financing, NIIP excluding the FDI position is positive. Reserve coverage is comfortably
above standard benchmarks, and reaches 147 percent of short-term debt at end-2012.
 The new EBA methodology confirms that the external balance is overall sound, but finds some
overvaluation of the koruna. The panel-based current account regression has a fitted value of
1.1 percent deficit, which is moderately narrower than the 2012 cyclically-adjusted deficit of 1.9 percent.
Benchmarked against the current account deficit level that would stabilize the net foreign asset position
of the country, 2.2 percent, the 2012 outturn of 2.4 percent and the 2.1 percent projection by staff
in 2013 suggests that there are no major imbalances. Based on a multilateral real exchange rate model,
the EBA exercise shows an overvaluation of 20 percent of the koruna but this estimate needs to be
treated with caution as it may not capture factors such as initial undervaluation and rapid quality and
productivity improvements.

C. Financial Sector
21.
Imminent risks to financial stability appear to be contained. Czech banks, largely owned
by euro area banking groups, are highly profitable and self-financed with a low system-wide loan to
deposit ratio and strong capital and liquidity buffers. The banking system had a year of record
profits in 2012, helping further strengthen the capitalization. However demand for credit remains
weak and there are signs of increasing competition for market share especially in well-performing
segments such as mortgages and large corporations. Therefore, profitability is likely to moderate as
volume growth slows and margins become compressed.
22.
The Czech financial system has proved resilient to the effects of the global crisis and
weak domestic economy. The most recent stress test indicated that the capitalization of the sector
as a whole would remain around 11 percent, significantly better than the regulatory minimum of
8 percent, even in a severe stress scenario with a large drop in GDP and protracted stagnation—a
cumulative contraction of about 7 percentage points over a three-year horizon—and with partial
impairment of the sector’s exposure to European countries whose government debt exceeds
60 percent of GDP. Given the strong capital and funding positions, the banks would comfortably
abide by the upcoming Basel III and CRD IV standards.
23.
The main risk for the Czech banking system is a protracted or deeper recession that
would harm asset quality. Although existing capital and liquidity buffers are expected to keep the
system resilient, supervisory activities should proactively ensure that provisions are adequate and
buffers remain strong in the face of potential further economic weakening. Another property price
decline due to a protracted or deeper recession would pose a risk to the financial system that has
relatively high exposure to the real estate market (see Annex I, Risk Assessment Matrix). This,
however, should be tempered by the limited run-up in prices in the boom period and prudent loan
to value ratios. The authorities agreed with these risk assessments, but noted that the risks are twosided for the real estate market given the historically low interest rates. Staff and the authorities
agreed that the credit union sector comprise a non-systemic risk that nonetheless needs to be
addressed. To this end, the CNB has prepared a proposal, which incorporates FSAP advice and
introduces a size limit for credit unions.
24.
Improvements of the financial stability framework would help safeguard the Czech
financial system against a wider range of risks. The authorities have made welcome efforts to
implement the recommendations made by the Fund’s FSAP Update in December 2011, including
lowering regulatory limits on exposures to parent banks, strengthening cooperation between the
Ministry of Finance and the CNB, and raising the role and profile of the CNB’s macroprudential
policies. It is important to adopt the draft proposal on the regulation of credit unions, which is a
small segment in the financial system but with higher-than-average risks. Other FSAP suggestions
for improvement were in the areas of bank resolution and deposit insurance, where recent
European-wide initiatives to harmonize tools and policies have taken precedence and would need to
be implemented once finalized as EU Directives. In this regard, the authorities recognize the
importance of the Single Supervisory Mechanism, but do not opt to enter at this stage. Staff noted it

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CZECH REPUBLIC

would still be important to strengthen the cooperation with home supervisors, which would become
the ECB in most cases, and make preparations for a more integrated European financial policy
framework.

D. Structural Issues
25.
Moving up the value added chain
is important for the Czech economy to
stay competitive. Convergence of Czech
per capita output to other advanced
European economies has stalled in recent
years. At the same time, the increasing
degree of openness to trade in tandem
with evolving regional trade supply chains
has played an important role for the growth
of the Czech economy. As the study on “the
German-Central European Supply Chain”
suggests, the future prospect of the economy, therefore, hinges on how the export sector maintains
and strengthens its competitiveness and broadens domestic value added. A key factor is to raise the
share of knowledge intensive industries in exports by shifting to more technologically sophisticated
products. In this regard, policies that enhance investment in research and development are
important.
26.
Investment in both physical and human capital is critical to enhance future growth
potential. Enhancing private investment especially FDI is critical for future growth. In this regard,
reducing uncertainty by improving the legal framework for formation, restructuring and liquidation
of firms and minimizing administrative costs could significantly contribute to a better business
environment. At the same time, developing and maintaining a highly capable and skilled workforce
is essential for attracting more knowledge intensive industries as well as increasing labor
productivity. Improving education especially at the tertiary level and vocational training has vital
importance.
27.
Higher labor participation, labor market flexibility, and active labor policies are
important to increase potential growth and avoid long-term negative impact of
unemployment. While employment is expected to be stable, with a declining share of productive
age population, the economy requires wider sources of labor supply. Policies to enable labor market
flexibility such as definite-term employment have been implemented. For some segments of the
workforce where labor market participation is low such as woman with young children, targeted
policies such as public support for childcare could be effective. In order to avoid long-term negative
impact of unemployment, active labor market policies providing information, counseling and
retraining are important.

The government places great importance on the
work-life balance especially of women with young
children, and is taking such initiatives as to give tax
incentives for employers who provide childcare for
their employees as well as to give tax discounts for
childcare expenses to parents. The government also
intends to expand the availability of childcare to
children as early as at the age of 6 month to provide
greater opportunities for women to participate in the
labor force.

STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
The Czech economy, despite its strong fundamentals, is in the midst of a prolonged
recession because of the euro area slump and weak domestic demand. A further slowdown in
the euro area would exacerbate the situation, creating the risk of lower growth in the long run.
Short-term macroeconomic policies should therefore be geared toward supporting the economy
and not creating additional drag. Boosting potential growth in the medium- to long-term will
require implementation of additional structural reforms.
29.
Given the large fiscal consolidation achieved so far, further consolidation efforts
should be avoided until the economic recovery gains strength. Thus, fiscal over-performance,
particularly at the expense of capital spending, should be avoided as well as further pro-cyclical
fiscal tightening in the event of weaker than expected economy activity. A neutral fiscal stance
would be appropriate over the next few years until the economic recovery gains strength.
30.
The structural balance rule and debt brake being considered for the new fiscal
framework would enhance the transparency and predictability of fiscal policy and reduce procyclicality. The framework’s effectiveness and credibility would be enhanced by its design and
adoption being rooted in broad consensus and incorporating an independent fiscal council. The
structural target adopted should strike the right balance between short- and medium-term demand
stabilization concerns with the long-term sustainability considerations, including the need to
stabilize debt in the near future.
31.
If a persistent and large undershooting of the inflation target is in prospect, additional
tools should be employed. FX interventions would be an effective and appropriate tool to address

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CZECH REPUBLIC

deflationary risks in the context of inflation targeting framework. This is expected to quickly increase
the price level and help increase inflation expectations toward the target. The operational aspects of
possible FX interventions should pay due regard to transparency. This would allow the market to
form expectations in accordance with the CNB’s inflation target.
32.
Banking supervision should proactively ensure that provisions are adequate and
buffers remain strong. The main risk is a protracted or deeper recession that would harm asset
quality of the Czech banking sector. While existing capital and liquidity buffers are expected to keep
the system resilient, proactive supervision would add to the strength in the face of potential further
economic weakening.
33.
Improvements of the financial stability framework would help safeguard the Czech
financial system against a wide range of risks. The authorities’ efforts to implement the
recommendations by the Fund’s FSAP Update in December 2011 are welcome. It is important to
adopt the draft proposal on the regulation of credit unions. Improvements in the areas of bank
resolution and deposit insurance need to be implemented. It would be important to strengthen the
cooperation between home and host supervisors and make preparations for a more integrated
European financial policy framework.
34.
Enhancing investment in both physical and human capital especially FDI is critical for
future growth and moving up the value added chain. Reducing uncertainty by improving the
legal framework and minimizing administrative costs for formation, restructuring, and liquidation of
firms could significantly contribute to a better business environment. A highly capable and skilled
workforce is essential to attract more knowledge intensive industries placed higher in the value
added chain. Higher labor participation would enhance potential growth while active labor market
policies providing information, counseling, and retraining would help avoid long-term negative
impact of unemployment. For some segments of the workforce such as women with young children
where labor market participation is low, targeted policies such as public support for childcare could
be effective.
35.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with the Czech Republic be
held on the usual 12-month cycle. The Czech Republic is an Article VIII country, and its data
provision is adequate for surveillance (Information Annex).

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most
likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective
assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline. The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall
level of concern as of the time of discussions with authorities.

Annex III. Debt Sustainability Analysis
1.
The Czech Republic’s fiscal position is strong and is expected to remain so under the
baseline scenario. Under this scenario, long-term debt dynamics are sustainable but with increasing
debt over the medium term that reaches 51 percent of GDP in 2018 (see table 1a). The baseline
assumes relatively stable revenues in percent of GDP (which, given the closing output gap, is
consistent with some moderate structural reduction of the tax burden) as well as declining
expenditures reflecting both efficiency gains on the expenditure side as well as cyclical improvement
that puts less pressure on spending. In any case, expenditures in 2018 are projected to be similar to
pre-crisis levels.
2.
Under standard alternative scenarios public debt trajectory worsens and reaches 5367 percent of GDP by 2018 (see figure 1a). These include a permanent ½ standard-deviation shock
to growth, interest rate and primary balance independently and a ¼ standard-deviation shock to the
three combined, a one-time 30 percent depreciation of the REER, and a one-time 10 percent of GDP
shock to contingent liabilities. Under most alternative scenarios, debt trajectory ceases to be
declining and increases moderately except for the growth shock where the upwards trend is
substantial. On the other hand, under interest rate and depreciation shocks debt stabilizes at a
somewhat higher level compared to the baseline scenario.
3.
Other factors that may potentially affect the strength of fiscal policy and long-term
sustainability appear to be moderate. The financial system in the Czech Republic is relatively small
(assets, credit and deposits at 130, 60, and 90 percent of GDP respectively) and has a conservative
balance sheet structure with a high share of loans denominated in local currency, high capital and
large liquidity. As a consequence, fiscal risks associated with the financial system appear
manageable. Similarly, the absence of significant (external or internal) imbalances, manifested in
moderate external and public financing requirements, and small current account deficit also point to
low risk of a fiscal crisis or long-term sustainability concerns.
4.
However, ageing dynamics create large medium- and long-term fiscal challenges for
the Czech Republic that, if unchecked, will require significant fiscal consolidation over the
medium-term. The European Commission estimates in its latest report on fiscal sustainability that
age-related public spending in the Czech Republic will increase by 5.2 percentage points of GDP
over the next 50 years versus the European average of 3.6 percentage points. This is distributed in
pension related spending, 2.7 percentage points of GDP increase against the EU average of
1.4 percent of GDP, and health related spending, 1.7 percentage points of GDP against the EU
average of 1.1 percent of GDP.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
The currency of the Czech Republic is the Czech koruna, created on February 8, 1993 upon the
dissolution of the currency union with the Slovak Republic, which had used the Czechoslovak koruna
as its currency. From May 3, 1993 to May 27, 1997, the exchange rate was pegged to a basket of two
currencies: the deutsche mark (65 percent) and the U.S. dollar (35 percent). On February 28, 1996,
the Czech National Bank widened the exchange rate band from ±0.5 percent to ±7.5 percent around
the central rate. On May 27, 1997, managed floating was introduced. In the Annual Report on
Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions, the de facto exchange rate regime of the Czech
Republic is classified as a free float. Since 2002, the CNB has not engaged in direct interventions in
the foreign exchange market. International reserves have been affected by the off-market purchases
of large privatization receipts and EU transfers and the sales of the accumulated interest. On May 31
2013, the exchange rate of the Czech koruna stood at CZK 18.769 per U.S. dollar.
The Czech Republic has accepted the obligations of Article VIII and maintains an exchange system
that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions. The Czech Republic maintains exchange restrictions for security reasons, based on UN
Security Council Resolutions and Council of the European Union Regulations that have been notified
to the Fund for approval under the procedures set forth in Executive Board Decision No. 144(52/51).
Last Article IV Consultation:
The last Article IV consultation with the Czech Republic was concluded on May 4, 2012. The staff
report and PIN were published on May 18, 2012.
FSAP Participation and ROSCs:
An FSAP was carried out in late 2000/ early 2001. The Financial System Stability Assessment was
considered by the Executive Board on July 16, 2001, concurrently with the staff report for the 2001
Article IV Consultation. An FSAP update was carried out in 2011. ROSCs on: banking supervision;
data dissemination; fiscal transparency; securities market; and transparency of monetary and
financial policies were published on the Fund’s external website on July 1, 2000.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data provision is adequate for surveillance. The Czech Republic subscribed to the Special
Data Dissemination Standard in April 1998, and metadata and annual observance reports for
2006–09 are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board.
2.
Data on core surveillance variables are available to the Fund regularly and with
minimal lags (reporting to STA is less current, especially for foreign trade and the national
accounts). Exchange rates, and interest rates set by the Czech National Bank (CNB), are
reported daily with no lag. Gross and net international reserves are reported on a monthly basis
with a one week lag, as well as on a 10-day basis (with the CNB’s balance sheet) with a one-week
lag. Consumer prices, reserve money, broad money, borrowing and lending interest rates, central
government fiscal accounts, and foreign trade are reported monthly with a lag of between one and
four weeks. Final monetary survey data are available with a lag of about one month. GDP and
balance of payments data are made available on a quarterly basis with a lag of two to three months.
Since 2003, the main components of the balance of payments are also available monthly. Annual
data published in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook cover all operations of the general
government, including the extrabudgetary funds excluded from the monthly data. These annual
data are available on a timely basis. Monthly fiscal data published in International Financial Statistics
(IFS) cover state budget accounts and are available with a two- to three-month lag.
3.
While data quality is generally high, some deficiencies remain in certain areas, and the
authorities are taking measures to improve data accuracy.


National accounts data are subject to certain weaknesses. Value added in the small scale private
sector is likely to be underestimated, as the mechanisms for data collection on this sector are
not yet fully developed and a significant proportion of unrecorded activity stems from tax
evasion. Discrepancies between GDP estimates based on the production method and the
expenditure method are large and are subsumed under change in stocks. Quarterly estimates of
national accounts are derived from quarterly reports of enterprises and surveys. The estimates
are subject to bias because of nonresponse (while annual reporting of bookkeeping accounts is
mandatory for enterprises, quarterly reporting is not) and lumping of several expenditure
categories in particular quarters by respondents. Large swings in individual components of
spending and the overall GDP from quarter to quarter bring into question the reliability of the
quarterly data and hamper business cycle analysis.



Recently, revisions to procedures for processing export data have brought external trade
statistics close to the practice in the EU. However, a continued weakness of foreign trade
statistics is the unavailability of fixed base price indices for exports and imports; these indices are
currently presented on the basis of the same month of the previous year.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

CZECH REPUBLIC



Monetary survey data provided to the European Department are generally adequate for policy
purposes. However, large variations in the interbank clearing account float, especially at the end
of the year, require caution in interpreting monetary developments. The CNB has made a major
effort to identify the causes of these variations and adjust the data. In 2002, to meet EU
statistical conventions, the CNB implemented the European Central Bank’s (ECB) framework for
collecting, compiling, and reporting monetary data. The data published in IFS are based on
monetary accounts derived from the ECB’s framework. The same set of accounts also forms the
basis for monetary statistics published in the CNB’s bulletins and on the website, which are
thereby effectively harmonized with the monetary statistics published in IFS, although the
presentation in IFS differs somewhat from the CNB’s.



Annual and quarterly fiscal data are compiled on ESA-95 basis by the Czech Statistical Office,
including non-financial accounts, financial accounts, and financial balance sheets. The Ministry of
Finance uses the ESA-95 methodology for the Convergence Program targets. Some adjustments
are to be done when converting data from the national (fiscal targeting) methodology to the
ESA-95 based fiscal accounts. The differences relate mainly to the coverage of the institutions
classified in the general government sector (for example, the Czech Consolidation Agency is
included in the central government under ESA definition), exclusion of financial transactions,
different classification of some specific government transactions (for example, called
guarantees) and the time of recording of government transactions (ESA-95 records transactions
on accrual basis).

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with the Czech Republic
On July 24, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Czech Republic 1 and considered and endorsed the staff appraisal
without a meeting on a lapse-of-time basis. 2
The economy has avoided serious imbalances in the recent volatile economic environment,
benefitting from strong policy frameworks and sound fundamentals. However the export-led
recovery observed in 2010–11 subsided as euro area import demand slowed. Growth has
noticeably underperformed trade partners and peers since the middle of 2011 mainly because of
weaker domestic consumption and investment. Real GDP contracted for four quarters in a row
in 2012 and recorded a 1.2 percent decline for the year with only net exports contributing
positively to growth. Private consumption declined by 2.7 percent in 2012. Weak demand
conditions helped suppress inflation and the external current account deficit. Inflation averaged
3.3 percent in 2012 mainly due to increases in the VAT rates and positive contributions from
foods and fuel. Both of these effects subsided and inflation fell below the target in January 2013
and averaged 1.8 percent in the first quarter of this year. The current account deficit declined to
2.4 percent of GDP in 2012 from 2.8 percent, mainly due to an improvement of the trade
balance.
Pro-cyclical fiscal consolidation continued in 2012 resulting in a stronger structural fiscal
position than before the crisis. The overall deficit without one-offs in 2012 was 2.5 percent of
GDP, down from 3.2 percent of GDP in 2011. The structural balance improved by 1.5 percent of
GDP on account of a combination of revenue measures, in particular an increase of the reduced
VAT rate by 4 percentage points, and expenditure measures. Fiscal over-performance relative to
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2

The Executive Board takes decisions under its lapse-of-time procedure when the Board agrees that a proposal can
be considered without convening formal discussions.

2

the budget was largely due to under-execution of capital spending, down by 0.6 percent of GDP
compared to 2011, to 3.1 percent of GDP.
The Czech National Bank (CNB) continued to take a leading role in countering economic
weaknesses. It cut the policy rate by 70 basis points in three steps in June, October and
November to 0.05 percent, and committed itself to continued low rates. Long-term money
market rates also moved lower in the face of weak growth and inflation expectations. The falling
rates, however, did not translate into faster credit growth. Credit to the corporate sector and
households grew only by 2.6 percent at end-2012 compared to 6.3 percent of the previous year.
Increased cautiousness about economic prospects played a role in limiting both credit demand
and, to a lesser extent, supply.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2013 Article IV consultations with the Czech Republic, Executive Directors
endorsed staff’s appraisal, as follows:
The Czech economy, despite its strong fundamentals, is in the midst of a prolonged recession
because of the euro area slump and weak domestic demand. A further slowdown in the euro area
would exacerbate the situation, creating the risk of lower growth in the long run. Short-term
macroeconomic policies should therefore be geared toward supporting the economy and not
creating additional drag. Boosting potential growth in the medium- to long-term will require
implementation of additional structural reforms.
Given the large fiscal consolidation achieved so far, further consolidation efforts should be
avoided until the economic recovery gains strength. Thus, fiscal over-performance, particularly
at the expense of capital spending, should be avoided as well as further pro-cyclical fiscal
tightening in the event of weaker than expected economy activity. A neutral fiscal stance would
be appropriate over the next few years until the economic recovery gains strength.
The structural balance rule and debt brake being considered for the new fiscal framework would
enhance the transparency and predictability of fiscal policy and reduce pro-cyclicality. The
framework’s effectiveness and credibility would be enhanced by its design and adoption being
rooted in broad consensus and incorporating an independent fiscal council. The structural target
adopted should strike the right balance between short- and medium-term demand stabilization
concerns with the long-term sustainability considerations, including the need to stabilize debt in
the near future.
If a persistent and large undershooting of the inflation target is in prospect, additional tools
should be employed. Foreign exchange (FX) interventions would be an effective and appropriate
tool to address deflationary risks in the context of inflation targeting framework. This is expected
to quickly increase the price level and help increase inflation expectations toward the target. The

3

operational aspects of possible FX interventions should pay due regard to transparency. This
would allow the market to form expectations in accordance with the CNB’s inflation target.
Banking supervision should proactively ensure that provisions are adequate and buffers remain
strong. The main risk is a protracted or deeper recession that would harm asset quality of the
Czech banking sector. While existing capital and liquidity buffers are expected to keep the
system resilient, proactive supervision would add to the strength in the face of potential further
economic weakening.
Improvements of the financial stability framework would help safeguard the Czech financial
system against a wide range of risks. The authorities’ efforts to implement the recommendations
by the Fund’s FSAP Update in December 2011 are welcome. It is important to adopt the draft
proposal on the regulation of credit unions. Improvements in the areas of bank resolution and
deposit insurance need to be implemented. It would be important to strengthen the cooperation
between home and host supervisors and make preparations for a more integrated European
financial policy framework.
Enhancing investment in both physical and human capital especially FDI is critical for future
growth and moving up the value added chain. Reducing uncertainty by improving the legal
framework and minimizing administrative costs for formation, restructuring, and liquidation of
firms could significantly contribute to a better business environment. A highly capable and
skilled workforce is essential to attract more knowledge intensive industries placed higher in the
value added chain. Higher labor participation would enhance potential growth while active labor
market policies providing information, counseling, and retraining would help avoid long-term
negative impact of unemployment. For some segments of the workforce such as women with
young children where labor market participation is low, targeted policies such as public support
for childcare could be effective.
