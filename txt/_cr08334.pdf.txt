EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
Macroeconomic performance has been remarkably resilient in a year of multiple natural
disasters and elevated international food and fuel prices. Growth picked up strongly from a
slow start to the year with rebounds in agriculture and garment exports playing a leading role.
Strong growth of remittances and increased external assistance helped support the balance of
payments in the face of rising import costs.
Nevertheless, life has become more difficult for large segments of the population. The natural
disasters and subsequent rapid food price increases of early 2008 put severe pressure on incomes,
reversing some of the recent reductions in poverty.
Inflation remains uncomfortably high despite delays in passing through fuel price increases.
Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation averaged 10 percent during FY08 and is expected to
increase further with the 40 percent increase in administered fuel prices announced in July.
The fiscal position was supported by a significant improvement in revenue collections, which
helped offset increased subsidies and outlays on safety nets.
Growth in monetary aggregates moderated early in the year but has rebounded quickly.
Private sector credit growth reached 25 percent at end–June.
Key Policy Issues
The authorities have made significant efforts to maintain a stable macroeconomic situation.
An impressive increase in government revenues, bringing state-owned enterprise (SOE) losses
onto the budget and the recent substantial increase in administered prices were significant
achievements. Staff and the authorities agreed on the policy framework required to achieve the
projected increase in economic growth over the medium term.
Staff recommended adjustments in monetary policy to rein in inflationary pressures. The
authorities, however, were more optimistic that inflationary pressures could be contained without
monetary policy adjustments.
Staff urged the authorities to remain within the macroeconomic targets of the FY09 budget
to prevent putting further pressure on inflation. The authorities were confident that
expenditure reprioritization would enable them to remain within the budget framework.
A complete modernization of the tax system is needed to underpin much-needed increases in
revenue. Recent improvements in administration are welcome but need to be accompanied by
accelerated efforts to modernize the legal framework.
Further financial sector development is needed to allow Bangladesh to achieve its growth
potential. Key priorities include strengthening the foreign exchange and government debt
markets, and improving the financial position of the state-owned banks.

4

I. BACKGROUND
1.
The political environment is uncertain ahead of December’s national elections. The
military-backed caretaker government (CTG) that assumed control in January 2007 remains in
power. Following a massive voter registration campaign, national elections have been announced
for December 2008, and some elements of the state of emergency have been lifted to allow
restricted political activity. The leaders of the two main political parties are both on trial for
corruption with their parties threatening to boycott the elections unless they are released from jail.
Although the trials continue, one leader has been freed to seek medical treatment abroad and
discussions with both parties continue with the aim of ensuring participation of all major parties in
the elections. The calm atmosphere surrounding the municipal elections in early August suggests
there are reasons to be optimistic about the likelihood of orderly national elections.
2.
Despite impressive gains in recent years, Bangladesh remains very poor.
Sustained growth, averaging 5½ percent a year since

the mid–1990s, enabled poverty rates to be reduced to

Significant progress has been made toward meeting the 55

with respect to education, child mortality, and gender

only about $550 and the country is vulnerable to

natural disasters and climate change. This was
25
demonstrated by the devastating twin floods and
cyclone in late 2007 that destroyed crops and homes in 20

rural areas, left at least 4,400 dead, and displaced
millions. These disasters and the simultaneous increase
in food prices have pushed some groups back over the poverty line. Preliminary estimates by the
World Bank suggest that, owing to significant growth in incomes during 2006–08, poverty rates
are still somewhat lower than the 2005 estimates despite these setbacks.

5

II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.
Macroeconomic performance has been remarkably resilient in a year of multiple
natural disasters and elevated food and fuel prices (Figures 1 and 2). Since the 2007 Article
IV consultation, growth momentum has been maintained, exports and remittances continued to
grow strongly, and revenue collections improved.
•

Growth in FY08 remained strong at above 6 percent. Early in the year, private sector
activity was suppressed by political uncertainty, and fear about an outbreak of avian flu.
This was compounded by the natural disasters that heavily damaged the November rice
crop and also affected shrimp harvests. However, bumper harvests of wheat, potatoes and
the main rice crop in late April, a rapid pickup in garments exports, and some resurgence
of industrial activity compensated in the second half of the year.

•

Inflation remains uncomfortably high despite delays in passing through fuel price
increases. CPI inflation averaged almost 10 percent during FY08, driven mainly by high
international food prices and the April 2007 fuel price increase. With the effects of that
increase receding, year-on-year inflation dropped to 7½ percent in April–May 2008, but
increased again to 10 percent in June 2008 and is expected to remain at double-digit levels
with the increase in administered fuel prices implemented on July 1, which averaged
around 40 percent.

•

Government revenue collection improved impressively in FY08. Improved taxpayer
compliance, particularly on income tax, and collection of arrears contributed to a
27 percent increase in revenues. This allowed budget targets to be exceeded (by ½ percent
of GDP) for the first time in recent history.

•

The overall fiscal deficit for FY08 is estimated to be below the budget target. Despite
increased social spending arising from disaster relief operations and better coverage of
SOE losses related to administered fuel and fertilizer prices, the deficit is expected to be
less than 3½ percent of GDP (excluding a 1.4 percent of GDP debt operation to cover
earlier losses of the state-owned petroleum company). The deficit was contained by the
higher revenue and a reprioritization of spending, while increased external assistance
allowed domestic financing to remain around 2½ percent of GDP.

•

Growth in money aggregates moderated last year, but has started to increase. Money
growth fell in the first half of FY08, but picked up rapidly in the last part of the period.
Broad and reserve money growth stood at 17½ percent and 20½ percent respectively at
end–June. Private sector credit growth accelerated even faster, in part due to the need to
finance increased food imports, and reached 25 percent in June.

•

The nominal exchange rate remained stable in dollar terms in FY08, but depreciated by
6½ percent in effective terms as the dollar’s value decreased in international markets.
Intervention by Bangladesh Bank (BB) was moderate.

6

•

International reserves grew moderately. Extremely strong remittance growth, a pickup in
garments exports, and external assistance, including from the Fund’s ENDA, moderated
the effect on reserves of increased import demand and high international commodity
prices. Gross reserves increased to US$6.1 billion (2¾ months of prospective imports).

5.
Progress has been made on structural policies, including in the governance area, but
the pace of reform has been constrained by the domestic political environment.
•

The CTG initially made encouraging progress, making much-needed adjustments to
domestic fuel prices in April 2007, and corporatizing state-owned commercial banks
(SCBs). Public financial management and revenue administration reforms were given
renewed impetus and progress was made in setting up a primary dealer system for
government securities. The CTG also proceeded with governance reforms, including by
reconstituting the Anti-Corruption Commission and strengthening the Election
Commission. A truth and accountability commission, tasked to look into past corruption,
began operation in early August.

•

However, the pace of reform subsequently slowed as the sensitivity of the government to
public opinion grew, and addressing natural disasters and food shortages took center stage.
The divestment of state-owned Rupali bank, which was a centerpiece of the financial
sector reform program, failed when the buyer pulled out of the deal. Administered prices
were unchanged throughout FY08 despite the rapid increase in purchase prices.

•

Recent months saw the CTG belatedly responding to international price increases as losses
in SOEs became untenable. In addition to the July fuel price increase of around 40 percent,
retail prices for compressed natural gas for transport (a marginal portion of overall sales)
and fertilizer prices were doubled. Proposed increases of around 50 percent in electricity
and other natural gas prices are currently under regulatory review.

indicate stronger underlying growth potential than assumed in staff’s baseline projections.
Continued improvements in agriculture and expansion in domestic services and construction as

7

Bangladesh capitalizes on high regional momentum will be key drivers of this growth. The
external current account should remain broadly in balance, with export and remittance growth
offsetting growth in imports arising from price rises and investment. External assistance and
gradually increasing capital inflows would underpin a steady increase in international reserves.
7.

There are, however, significant risks.

•

The external environment is particularly uncertain at present—a sustained further increase
in oil prices is not assumed in staff’s baseline projections, but is certainly possible. Such an
increase would put the balance of payments and fiscal position under significant stress and
further reduce near-term growth prospects.

•

The slowdown in early FY08 demonstrated the damaging effects that political uncertainty
can have on economic growth. A further period of major upheaval leading up to the
national elections could undermine short-term growth prospects, and distract the
authorities from taking needed policy measures.

•

The external sector depends mainly on garments and remittances for inflows.1 Although
the outlook appears optimistic, both are vulnerable to shocks: garments from external
demand, domestic labor unrest, and changes in market access; and remittances from
changes in labor regulations in the Middle East. A deterioration in the outlook for both
could cause significant external pressure, particularly as official capital and FDI remain
relatively low compared to peers in Asia.

•

External debt is sustainable with low risk of distress. However, taking into account
domestic debt, the risk of distress would be moderate particularly because of the
vulnerability of the debt ratios to slower growth. Contingent liabilities arising from SOEs
and low revenue collections are additional sources of risk.2

•

Climate change poses a significant risk to longer-term growth. As recent events
demonstrate, Bangladesh’s economic base is vulnerable to potential changes in sea levels
and local climactic conditions.
IV. MACROECONOMIC POLICY DISCUSSIONS

8.
The CTG is committed to leaving a sustainable macroeconomic position to the next
administration. The authorities emphasized the recent increases in administered prices as
evidence of their commitment. These price rises were politically difficult, particularly in the light
of the surge in food prices in early 2008, but essential to leave a workable fiscal position to the

next government. The authorities also stressed the importance of leaving adequate public food
stocks at the end of their tenure.
9.
Discussions focused on the policies required to maintain near-term macroeconomic
stability and underpin sustained poverty reduction. The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s
medium-term scenario, but were more optimistic about near-term growth prospects and the
likelihood of inflation returning to single digits without significant policy adjustments as supply
shocks dissipate. Staff welcomed the authorities’ commitment to maintaining a sound economic
position, noting in particular the improvements in fiscal management. However, staff stressed that
further economic policy actions would likely be required in the coming months to deal with
emerging inflationary pressures and to renew momentum on the structural reform agenda.
A. Containing Inflation
10.
Staff viewed inflation as the main near-term macroeconomic policy issue. Recent fuel
price increases will intensify underlying
30

inflationary pressures. Staff stressed that policy

BB’s recent monetary policy statement foresees a continuation of the policy stance
adopted in FY08. Policy rates have been
constant over the last 18 months with the central
Interest Rates (percent)
bank reverse repo rate remaining at 6½ percent
and rates on short term government securities
increasing by only a few basis points to
7½ percent. BB’s six-monthly monetary policy
statement was released immediately following
the Article IV discussions. It did leave the door
open for monetary policy actions to counter
inflationary pressures, but maintained a bias
toward accommodating credit demand,
particularly to key growth-driving sectors. This

stance reflects the authorities’ assessment that inflation is driven mainly by external supply-side
factors, which cannot be addressed by monetary policy actions.
12.
Staff emphasized that a shift in policy is needed to prevent inflation becoming
entrenched. With a decline in economic activity in the first half of FY08 and money growth
slowing, BB’s neutral position (keeping interest rates and market liquidity steady) was
appropriate. With circumstances now different, and policy rates well below projected inflation,
staff urged BB to act quickly to send a signal of its intention to fight inflation through a small
preemptive increase in interest rates. Staff acknowledged BB’s concern to avoid putting the brakes
on private sector growth, but stressed that the authorities’ selectively accommodative monetary
policy focusing on key sectors would not be effective in addressing a macroeconomic inflation
problem. Staff also emphasized that inflation hits the poor hardest, and that actions in the short
term to contain expectations would be less harmful to growth than more aggressive later actions to
reverse entrenched inflation. The authorities indicated that they would monitor conditions closely
and take monetary policy action if needed, but overall were much more sanguine about inflation
risks than staff.
B. Improving Exchange Rate Management
13.
BB has kept the dollar exchange rate stable to guard against intensifying imported
inflation pressures. Staff noted that this

external competitiveness, largely due to the

that these circumstances cannot be expected

to continue, and going forward larger
movements in the dollar-taka rate are likely

14.
The real exchange rate remained in
line with its equilibrium level on a broad range of measures (Box 1). The real effective rate
appreciated somewhat in FY08 as a result of domestic inflation without unduly constraining
external competitiveness.4

Given the stability in the nominal rate during 2007/08, the de facto classification of Bangladesh’s exchange rate
regime in the IMF’s Annual Report on Exchange Regimes and Restrictions will be changed to a conventional peg,
while the de jure regime remains a managed float.

Box 1. Bangladesh: Equilibrium Exchange Rate Assessment and External Stability
Staff assessed the equilibrium exchange rate using a number of single-country
econometric techniques. More advanced multi-country and dynamic assessments are
hampered by the lack of a long-time series of data and the lack of availability of suitable panel
data. Analysis therefore focused on a relatively short sample period under three different single
country approaches (Chapter I of the Selected Issues paper provides details of the analysis).
All assessment techniques found that the real exchange rate and the external current
account balance were in line with their estimated equilibrium values. The macro balance
approach finds that the underlying equilibrium current account balance is in line with its
equilibrium value and is expected to remain so going forward. Projected current account
balances are well within levels needed to maintain external sustainability. Direct estimates of
the equilibrium real exchange rate also suggest that the taka is close to its equilibrium level.

Macroeconomic policies are in line with external stability. The current account has
remained broadly in balance for a number of years. Continued strong export and remittance
growth are expected to underpin this into the medium term. Public external debt is sustainable
with low risk of distress—although domestic contingent liabilities increase the risk of distress
to public debt. Capital account flows are mainly long term and are not subject to significant
liquidity risks.

15.
Greater exchange rate movement would provide more flexibility in macroeconomic
policy making and would help develop the interbank market. Staff noted that a somewhat
tighter monetary stance would support BB’s preference to use the exchange rate to counter
imported inflation while moderating the need to sell international reserves to influence the
exchange rate. The authorities agreed that more flexibility in the exchange rate would be desirable,
but did not see the need for significant exchange rate movements in the near term. Staff urged the
removal of the remaining exchange restriction—on the transferability of funds in nonresident taka
accounts. The authorities, however, still saw a risk that removing it could precipitate capital
outflows and, given the still low reserve position, were not prepared to commit to a timetable for
its removal.

11

C. Deepening the Financial Sector
16.
Successful financial sector development is a keystone to securing future growth
potential. A deep and liquid financial sector

provides resources to support private sector

growth and improves the environment for
2,500

private banks are growing rapidly as they

growing in importance and now accounts for around 20 percent of financial sector assets.

market are essential foundations
for financial sector development. However, the remaining agenda are large and there now needs to
be a comprehensive vision for the financial sector and stronger support for market development,
with BB taking a prominent leadership role. Staff stressed that as part of that effort, and to protect
itself from potential vulnerabilities, BB needs to build on the reforms it has already made in its
internal operations to ensure that they are in line with best international practice. The authorities
concurred and stressed that they intended to reinvigorate their efforts to improve their surveillance
of the financial sector, particularly as rapid increases in lending have the potential to undermine
credit quality. In this regard, they requested technical assistance (TA) from the Fund to help them
improve their stress testing, but did not want to request an Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP) update at this time pending further work on their own self-assessment.
18.
The SCBs still undermine the efficiency of the financial system. While their market
share is declining, they still account for over 30 percent of total banking sector assets and remain
mainly moribund, with negative capital and high (30 percent) NPL ratios. Divestment plans appear
to be at a standstill following the failure of the Rupali Bank sale. Staff stressed that accelerating
progress on strengthening all the SCBs’ financial positions was important to foster financial sector
development and reduce the government’s contingent liabilities. Formulating a renewed plan for
divestment should be a high priority. The authorities planned to strengthen monitoring of the

12

performance indicators for the chief executives of the SCBs and pointed to the forthcoming
Annual General Meetings as a chance to strengthen their Boards.
19.
Financial sector deepening requires the development of an active secondary market
in government paper, which will also assist in monetary policy implementation. However, the
operation of the primary dealer system for government securities needs to be improved before an
active secondary market can develop. The key constraining factor is the authorities’ inflexibility
on interest rates that undermines the auction process and results in substantial devolvement of
securities onto the primary dealers. Staff urged the authorities to yield more to current market
pressures for upward movement in rates, which would have beneficial impacts for financial sector
deepening and would be consistent with shorter-term monetary policy requirements. BB stressed
that it was moving gradually in this direction, but was conscious of the impacts on government
debt service and on the growth of credit to the private sector. Staff welcomed BB’s efforts to
improve the regulatory framework, including issuing new mark-to-market and liquid reserves
regulations and revising the commission system for primary dealers, and encouraged continued
dialogue with the banks to iron out remaining regulatory issues.
20.
Reinvigorating the foreign exchange market would complement reforms in the
government debt market. However, a vibrant foreign exchange market will not develop in the
absence of greater movements in the exchange rate. In line with its advice on exchange rate policy,
staff encouraged BB to put in place measures to encourage trading, including stricter enforcement
of open position limits, and allowing banks to engage in uncovered forward trades and two-way
quotes on a more consistent basis.5

(ADP) allocation was set at a lower-than-normal level to take account of systematic underimplementation.
Box 2. Bangladesh: Subsidies and State-Owned Enterprises
SOE losses, arising mainly from administered prices that do not cover input costs, reached
around 3 percent of GDP in FY08. Losses were concentrated in four main enterprises: the
petroleum company (BPC), fertilizer company (BCIC),
Key State-Owned Enterprises:
power company (PDB), and Biman Bangladesh Airlines.

losses, a substantial improvement on recent years, with the

Slow-moving fuel and fertilizer price adjustments in the
face of rapidly rising input costs are a challenge to fiscal
sustainability. Fertilizer prices were adjusted in
June 2008 for the first time in 12 years. Fuel price
increases in 2007 and 2008 were large, but still failed to
keep pace with international price movements. At the
beginning of FY09 both are well below the levels needed
to cover import costs.

•

•

Without further price increases and with
current international oil and fertilizer prices,
SOE losses could reach 3¼ percent of GDP
in FY09, slightly higher than the FY08 level.
The FY09 budget assumes transfers of
around 2½ percent of GDP, leaving a gap of
around ¾ percent of GDP (taka 40 billion) to
be covered by expenditure prioritization.
Each additional $10 on the international oil
price would add Tk 20 billion to the overall
subsidy or would require about a 10 percent
increase in domestic fuel prices.

Reforms in the operations of SOEs would also improve the fiscal position. Although pricing
mechanisms contribute significantly to the poor financial state of many SOEs, losses also stem from
inefficiency and lack of investment. Continuing with reforms to improve operations and divesting
attractive SOEs are important elements of the fiscal reform process.

22.
Staff emphasized that keeping to the macroeconomic targets of the FY09 budget will
be important to prevent putting further pressure on inflation. In normal circumstances, it
would have been preferable to have a less expansionary budget. However, given the need to
strengthen social safety nets while further improving coverage of SOE losses, the budget’s targets
are appropriate, particularly given the authorities’ prudent recent record on fiscal management.
The gains in tax compliance and the improvement in the base achieved in FY08 should allow the
budget target for revenue to be met and perhaps even exceeded. Staff stressed that given

14

inflationary pressures any excess revenue should be used to reduce the overall deficit and domestic
financing. Ensuring safety net programs, particularly the new 100 days employment generation
program, are well targeted and minimize leakages will be important to safeguard the quality of the
expenditure expansion.
23.
The substantial hike in fuel and fertilizer prices may not be sufficient to keep within
the budget’s subsidy provisions. The authorities confirmed that they intend, as far as possible, to
cover SOE losses arising from administered prices through budgetary transfers. Volatility in
international commodity markets, however, makes it unusually difficult to forecast the fiscal
burden of administered prices. Staff’s baseline projection suggests potential overruns of around
Tk 40 billion (Box 2). In these circumstances staff supported the authorities’ plans to cover them
from within the expenditure envelope.6 Staff stressed that any additional SOE losses arising from
international price rises should be met by domestic price increases so that priority spending on key
social and development programs are not further compromised. The authorities agreed in
principle, but noted the political difficulty in further increasing prices. In this context, the
authorities stressed that staff’s preference for a framework that will allow prices to automatically
adjust to full cost coverage could only be considered in the medium term.
24.
Staff and the authorities agreed that in the medium-term fiscal policy should return
to a path of lower deficits. The FY09 budget is intended to be a temporary deviation from the
restrained fiscal position—an overall deficit below 4 percent of GDP and domestic financing
below 2 percent of GDP—that has served Bangladesh well in the recent past. In this context, staff
welcomed that the draft Public Resource and Budget Management Ordinance was close to
approval. The Ordinance will set fiscal policy within a clear institutional framework—that restricts
domestic financing to be below 3 percent of GDP and total public debt below 60 percent of
GDP—and will improve fiscal transparency and accountability, especially for future governments.
Staff stressed that the Ordinance’s quantitative framework should not be seen as targets and that,
in normal circumstances, fiscal policy should aim to operate well below the Ordinance’s ceilings.
This is particularly important given the moderate risks of debt distress arising in part from the
significant contingent liabilities in the SOE sector. The establishment of a macro-fiscal unit within
the Ministry of Finance (MOF) that is being supported by Fund TA was particularly welcome in
this regard.

Expenditure reallocations are expected to be possible from block allocations, potential overlaps between safety net
allocations, and the fact that ADP continues to suffer from implementation constraints.

deliver the gains in revenue needed to
underpin the medium term macroeconomic framework. Staff urged that work on redrafting income
tax and VAT legislation be taken forward quickly. The authorities agreed that legislation needed
updating, but preferred a more gradual approach, particularly for income tax where they prefer to
progressively amend the existing legislation rather than adopt a new act in its entirety. The
authorities acknowledged that updating the VAT legislation is key to improving the efficiency of
the tax system and plan to begin drafting a new law soon.
26.
The fiscal space provided by improved revenue needs to be used to increase the level
and quality of public expenditure.
•

Generalized subsidies that primarily benefit the better off, reaching 3 percent of GDP in
FY08 and FY09, represent a significant constraint on the ability to increase spending on
social services and infrastructure that are necessary to sustain poverty reduction and
achieve the MDGs.

•

The Medium-Term Budget Framework (MTBF) provides a good basis for reorienting
revenue gains and savings from reducing subsidies. The authorities intend to refine it by
reviewing the success of line ministries in achieving their own MTBF performance
indicators. Staff welcomed this initiative and encouraged the MOF to roll out the initiative
to all spending ministries within two to three years.

7

The 2007 Article IV consultation explored this issue in detail (IMF Country Report No. 07/234). Chapter III of this
year’s Selected Issues paper discusses the potential benefits of different models of tax reform.

8

Tax holidays were renewed and extended to eight additional sectors. However, provisions to strictly limit the time
period for each tax holiday and introduction of a sliding scale of tax incentives within the timeframe were included.

16

Box 3. Bangladesh: Revenue Administration Reforms
Revenue administration reform picked up in FY08. The institutional framework for
separating tax policy from administration has been established and a new unit will begin work
by the end of the year. The two Large Taxpayer Units (LTUs) have been placed under the
control of a single member at the National Board of Revenue, which should further improve
enforcement. Revenue gains in FY08 reflect improvements in taxpayer compliance arising in
part from the authorities’ new universal self-assessment scheme, efforts to increase
registration, and enhance taxpayer education.
Staff and the authorities agreed on a wide-ranging agenda of actions that will further
improve administration and enforcement. In the VAT area, actions focus on improving case
selection and efficiency of audit and simplifying registration procedures. In customs, the
authorities intend to continue reducing the number of zero-rated commodities and
incorporating duty exemptions into the customs law. Further reform of the unified LTUs,
which are the backbone of revenue collections, focuses on streamlining audits and expanding
the coverage beyond Dhaka. Spreading the unified taxpayer identification number beyond large
taxpayers is a crucial measure to improve enforcement as is improving the functioning of the
disputes and appeals procedure and more rigorously applying penalties for non payment.

•

Staff urged the authorities to take concrete steps to increase the implementation rate of the
ADP, noting that public investment remains too low to address development needs. These
include the reconstruction of infrastructure and housing destroyed in FY08’s natural
disasters, which have only small allocations in the FY09 ADP. The authorities agreed that
increasing the ADP was a key priority. They noted, however, that the recent slowing in the
pace of ADP spending reflected their efforts to stamp out corruption in implementation and
have consequently led to an improvement in the quality of ADP spending. They also noted
that a more comprehensive rehabilitation program in response to last November’s cyclone
is still under discussion with key donors. Staff welcomed any improvement in the quality
of development spending and encouraged further efforts to address administrative and
capacity constraints, including through better coordination with donors.

•

Staff noted that maintaining control over public sector wage increases, particularly in the
context of the 2009 Public Wage Commission, will also be important in maintaining fiscal
space and moderating the benchmark these increases could set for the private sector. As
was done after the 2005 Pay Commission, increases in pay and allowances will need to be
phased in over several fiscal years to make the fiscal burden manageable.
V. OTHER ISSUES

27.
The macroeconomic framework of the draft Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP) is broadly in line with staff’s projections and the medium-term budget framework.
Staff noted the substantial work that has gone into producing the comprehensive strategy in such a

17

short period of time and emphasized that the transitional nature of the current administration
heightens the importance of broad consultation. However, the accelerated timetable has thus far
meant that consultation with civil society and the donor community has been limited.
28.
Improving the quality and timeliness of economic statistics would improve policy
making. Some improvements have been made, notably in streamlining public sector coverage in
the fiscal accounts and on-going work on a new CPI consumption basket. Key priorities going
forward are strengthening balance of payment statistics through improving the consistency of trade
data and developing international investment statistics, improving the source data for national
accounts statistics and introducing more frequent and timely dissemination practices, and moving
toward GFSM2001 standards for fiscal statistics.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
29.
Macroeconomic performance has been remarkably resilient in a year of multiple
natural disasters and elevated food and fuel prices. Growth picked up strongly from a slow
start to the year with rebounds in agriculture and garment exports playing a leading role. Increases
in remittances and external assistance helped support the balance of payments in the face of rising
import costs. The fiscal position was supported by a significant improvement in revenue
collections, which helped offset increasing energy and fertilizer subsidies and larger outlays on
safety nets. Nevertheless, life has become more difficult for large segments of the population. The
natural disasters and subsequent rapid food price increases of early 2008 put severe pressure on
incomes, particularly of the urban and landless rural poor, reversing some of the recent reductions
in poverty.
30.
The authorities have made significant efforts to maintain a stable macroeconomic
situation. This is particularly evident in the fiscal sector, where there has been significant
strengthening of the revenue position and most SOE losses have been brought onto the budget.
The recent increase in administered prices was a bold step and prevented a deterioration in SOE
finances, but more still needs to be done to improve their position.
31.
Preventing an increase in inflation is the immediate policy concern. With fiscal policy
focusing on sustaining revenue collections and strengthening safety nets to address the social
impact of higher commodity prices, monetary policy needs to adjust to contain inflationary
pressures. A preemptive movement in interest rates would rein in increasing inflation expectations
and help prevent high inflation from becoming entrenched. Higher inflation directly hurts the poor
and vulnerable; delaying action could be more harmful to growth prospects as it would require
larger and more aggressive policy responses in the future.
32.
Greater flexibility in the exchange rate would support monetary policy objectives
without placing undue pressure on the international reserve position. While staff judges the
current level of the exchange rate to be in line with medium-term fundamentals, more day-to-day
movement in the rate would provide greater flexibility in macroeconomic policy making and
deepen the foreign exchange market. As there is no timetable for the removal of the one remaining

18

exchange restriction on the transferability of funds in nonresident taka accounts, staff does not
recommend its approval.
33.
Keeping to the macroeconomic targets of the FY09 budget will prevent putting
further pressure on inflation. Despite inflationary pressures, the budget’s expansionary stance is
defendable given recent fiscal prudence and the need to address the social impact of natural
disasters and higher food prices while further improving budget coverage of SOE losses. Given
the pressures, however, any revenue collections in excess of the budget should be used to reduce
domestic financing. If international oil prices rise further, additional SOE losses should be met by
further administered price increases so that priority spending is not compromised.
34.
Macroeconomic policies are consistent with external stability and the medium-term
outlook remains favorable. Near-term growth may slow slightly as inflation is brought under
control, but should increase to around 7 percent over the medium term as structural reforms feed
through and Bangladesh capitalizes on high regional growth. Macroeconomic policies are
consistent with external stability. The external current account is expected to stay broadly in
balance as continued growth in exports and remittances is expected to offset higher imports.
Capital flows are mainly long term and not subject to significant liquidity risk and public debt is
sustainable.
35.
There are, however, significant risks. In particular, a sustained further increase in oil
prices would put the balance of payments and fiscal position under significant stress and further
reduce near-term growth prospects. Poor governance and inadequate infrastructure, particularly in
the power sector, remain the main constraints to investor confidence and need to be addressed to
avoid a sustained slowdown in growth that could put the sustainability of debt ratios in jeopardy.
There are also moderate risks of domestic debt distress stemming from large contingent liabilities
in the SOE sector. Climate change is a major long-term challenge and will require careful
coordination with donors in planning adaptive measures.
36.
Further financial sector development is needed to allow Bangladesh to achieve its
growth potential. Despite some recent progress, the overall development of the sector is behind
comparator countries. Strengthening the SCBs’ financial position with a view to eventual
divestment is crucial to improve banking sector efficiency. Allowing interest rates in the primary
auction for government securities to be market determined will give impetus to an active
secondary market, which is vital for financial sector deepening.
37.
In the medium term, increased revenue is crucial to allow fiscal policy to return to a
lower deficit path. The FY09 budget should be a temporary deviation from the restrained fiscal
position that has served Bangladesh well in the recent past. Achieving the revenue gains needed to
allow increased public expenditure will require moving quickly forward with revisions that
modernize income tax and value-added tax legislation together with sustained improvements in
administration and enforcement. Reducing open-ended price subsidies and replacing them with
more affordable and better-targeted social safety nets will also provide fiscal space for increases in
public investment and provision of social services.

19

38.
Continued improvement in the quality and timeliness of economic statistics would
improve policy making. Priorities in the near term include improving the compilation and
dissemination of national accounts statistics, and strengthening balance of payments statistics.
39.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Bangladesh take place
within the standard 12–month cycle.

Safeguards Assessment

Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, Bangladesh Bank (BB) is subject to an
assessment with respect to the PRGF arrangement, which was approved on June 20, 2003.
A safeguards assessment of the BB was completed on January 24, 2005. The assessment
concluded that substantial risks exist in the legal structure, financial reporting, internal audit,
and internal control systems. Implementation of the measures by the BB is monitored by staff.
VIII.

Exchange Arrangement

Exchange regime. The exchange rate regime is a managed float. The de facto classification
will be changed to a conventional peg given recent stability in the dollar rate. Until end–
May 2003, the taka was fixed to the U.S. dollar, but was periodically adjusted. It was devalued
on three occasions during 2000–02, when the trading band for BB’s transactions was
correspondingly widened or raised. From January 2002 until end–May 2003, the official band
for the taka remained unchanged at Tk 57.4–58.4 per U.S. dollar. Authorized dealer (AD) banks
set their own buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar and other currencies generally within
the band until October 2002. From November 2002, however, AD banks have set rates outside
the band. Effective end–May 2003, BB no longer announced a trading band for its foreign
exchange transactions.
At the last Article IV consultation (June 2007), the Executive Board urged the authorities to
remove the restriction on the convertibility and transferability of proceeds of current
international transactions in nonresident taka accounts.
IX.

Article IV Consultation

The previous Article IV consultation was concluded on June 22, 2007 (IMF Country Report
No. 07/234).

Resident Representative

The resident representative office was established in 1972. The current Resident Representative,
Mr. Jonathan Dunn, took up the post in August 2004.

ANNEX II. Bangladesh: Fund and World Bank Work Priorities
Issues affecting economic growth
The following issues have been found to foster or constraint economic growth in Bangladesh
according to the PRSP and a number of analytical studies. Macroeconomic stability correlates
with growth in Bangladesh and is a centerpiece of the PRSP. Given the country’s exceptionally
low tax receipts, revenue mobilization and expenditure rationalization are key to this stability.
Outward orientation and trade liberalization hold great promise, given low wage costs, the
success of the export-oriented RMG sector, and a still relatively closed economy. However,
poor governance, a weak banking sector, and unreliable power supply are major drags on
growth. Notwithstanding the recent progress, Bangladesh ranks near the bottom of
Transparency International’s corruption perceptions index; interest rate spreads exceed regional
averages; and the World Bank estimates that power outages significantly reduce total factor
productivity growth in manufacturing. Sectoral policies are the main vehicle for ensuring
equitable and pro-poor growth according to the PRSP.
The Bank and Fund staffs (and other relevant donors) continue to work closely together to
support this agenda of enhancing economic growth, as defined in the following matrix.

ANNEX III. BANGLADESH: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK1
Lending and technical assistance operations
Bangladesh joined the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) in 1973 and, as of 31 December
2007, cumulative public sector lending amounted to about $9.27 billion for 186 loans, with
$178.6 million for technical assistance (TA) grants for 324 projects. The country is one of the
largest borrowers of concessionary Asian Development Fund resources. The loans and TAs
have supported all key sectors including energy, transport, social infrastructure, agriculture,
and natural resources. AsDB has also supported eight private sector projects worth
$242.18 million, including the Meghnaghat Power Project—the first build-own-operate
power project in the country—and GrameenPhone, which substantially expanded rural access
to mobile phone services.
In 2007, AsDB approved a total amount of $965.7 million in loans covering the Railway
Sector Investment Program, Sustainable Power Sector Development Program, the Good
Governance Program, the Padma Multipurpose Bridge Design Project (TA Loan), the Dhaka
Water Supply Sector Development Program (Project Loan), and the South Asia Subregional
Economic Cooperation Information Highway Project. The projects focused on helping
remove critical constraints to growth by improving power generation and transmission;
transport and communication network; management and operations of urban water supply
and sewerage; anticorruption and judicial reforms; governance in the energy, transport,
education, and integrated urban infrastructure sectors. Energy reforms aimed to help the
Government restructure the power sector to ensure adequate and reliable power supply at
competitive prices through increased private sector participation and more effective
management and operations. In the railways, the focus was on improving sector efficiency by
restructuring Bangladesh Railway to make it a market-oriented business organization with
better financial governance, human resources, and operational systems. Successful
implementation of the Second Primary Education Development Program, which will improve
the quality of primary education and its accessibility to children from poor households, is
currently underway with AsDB as the lead agency, together with 10 other development
partners.
Country Partnership Strategy
The current results-based country partnership strategy (CPS), covering the period 2006–10, is
part of a joint strategy prepared with the UK’s Department for International Development,
Government of Japan, and World Bank. Under this CPS, AsDB is playing a major role in the
energy, transport, education, urban health, and urban water supply and sanitation sectors. In
other areas, such as agriculture (i.e., agribusiness), water resources management, the
1

financial sector and small- and medium-sized enterprise development, AsDB is supporting
initiatives led by other development partners. Disaster mitigation, regional cooperation,
gender, and environment continue to be addressed as key crosscutting issues. The CPS
emphasizes designing projects that are better prepared for implementation. This means
projects that are simpler; take into consideration capacity constraints; and include covenants
that are realistic, focused, and properly sequenced.
AsDB’s 2008 public sector lending program comprises five firm projects totaling about
$592 million (including two Emergency Assistance Projects - Emergency Disaster Damage
Rehabilitation Project of $120 million and Emergency Assistance for Food Security of
$170 million. The first project was included in the pipeline considering the devastating
cyclone and flood that affected Bangladesh in 2007 and the second project, to address the
adverse impact of rising international commodity prices on domestic food security). The TA
program for 2008 consists of 9 projects with an allocation of $5,740 in grant funding
(including two piggy-backed loan for the two Emergency Assistance Projects).
The proposed (to be approved in August 2008) country operations business plan (COBP) for
Bangladesh for 2009–11 consists of 25 firm projects totaling about $2.9 billion (including an
amount of $350 million for Padma Multipurpose Bridge in 2010). The TA program for
2009-11 comprises 25 projects with an annual allocation of about $6.4 million in grant
funding.
Cofinancing operations enable AsDB’s financing partners—government or their agencies,
multilateral financing institutions, and commercial organizations—to participate in financing
of AsDB projects. The additional funds are provided in the form of grants, official loans, or
credit enhancement products. As of year–end 2007, cumulative direct value-added
cofinancing for Bangladesh amounted to $1.1 billion for 24 investment projects and
$58. million for 68 TA projects.
The CPS is aligned with the vision and priorities of the Bangladesh’s national poverty
reduction strategy, which aims to achieve the MDGs, including halving the number of poor
people in the country by 2015 and delivering substantial improvement in almost all aspects of
human development. The four partners’ joint strategy is built on: (i) improving the
investment climate for private sector-led growth and employment; (ii) advancing the social
development agenda to empower the poor so that all benefit from growth; and (iii) addressing
key governance issues to enable growth and social development.
Economic and sector work program
AsDB publishes its Asian Development Outlook and its update every year, in which it
assesses macroeconomic performance. AsDB’s Bangladesh Resident Mission also publishes
the Bangladesh Quarterly Economic Update. A new bimonthly Economic Indicators Update
has been launched. In support of AsDB’s Country Partnership Strategy exercise, several new

9
thematic assessments and sector studies have been completed. These include: thematic
assessments for poverty, growth, and poverty reduction, private sector development,
governance, environment, and gender, and sector studies for transport, information and
communications technology, water resource development, agriculture and rural development,
fisheries, regional cooperation, finance, industry and trade sectors, Dhaka-Chittagong
economic corridor development, and public sector borrowing capacity study. Several new
studies were completed in 2007–08, including Trade Integration of Bangladesh in South
Asia: Prospects and Challenges; Improving Institutional Arrangements for Enhancing
Manpower Export and Remittance Inflow; Improving the Monitoring System of State-Owned
Enterprises; Macroeconomic Framework for Finance Division; Macroeconomic Assessment
of the 2007 Flood and Cyclone; and Food Security Assessment. Several new studies will be
undertaken in 2008–09 on trade and export competitiveness, regional cooperation, foreign
investments and private sector development, and other sectoral issues.

10
ANNEX IV. BANGLADESH: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Macroeconomic data provided to the Fund have some shortcomings, but are broadly adequate
for surveillance. Bangladesh participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS).
A multi-sector technical assistance mission covering national accounts, balance of
payments, government finance , and monetary and financial statistics, took place during
January 21–February 4, 2008. It found that the authorities have implemented a number of the
recommendations of the 2005 data ROSC mission. The ROSC report is available on the IMF
website and includes the following recommendations that cut across sectors:
•

Legislation should be enacted to define the role of the Bangladesh Bureau of
Statistics (BBS) and to provide it with sufficient powers to fulfill its mandate.

•

Inter-agency cooperation should be improved, particularly for generating consistent
data on bank financing of the government and debt.

•

Advance calendars for the release of data should be established, disseminated, and
observed.

•

The BBS should also use its website to disseminate data and metadata to ensure
simultaneous data release to all users.

Some improvements have been made recently, notably in streamlining public sector coverage
in the fiscal accounts and on-going work on a new CPI consumption basket. Key priorities
going forward are strengthening BoP statistics through improving the consistency of trade
data and developing international investment statistics, improving the source data for national
accounts statistics and introducing more frequent and timely dissemination practices, and
moving toward adoption of the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM2001)
for fiscal statistics.
National accounts
The paucity of source data remains the principal impediment to improving national accounts
statistics and adversely affects the ability of the BBS to absorb technical assistance aimed at
improving compilation techniques. The BBS does not conduct an annual national accounts
survey of business enterprises, and source data are primarily from benchmark surveys, a
census of manufacturing establishments conducted every two years, and biannual household
expenditure surveys. Many of the benchmark surveys were conducted over five years ago
and are based on outdated sample frames. The 2005 data ROSC recommended that the BBS
establish and maintain a business register for all economic units as a basis for surveys, which
should be conducted annually. Taking into account cost implications of an annual survey
program, the BBS could start with a limited program covering key formal sector activities.
The deficiencies in the data also affect compilation practices. There is heavy reliance on the
use of fixed input-output ratios in estimating current value added. Thus, estimates do not

11
always reflect the rapid change in the structure of some industries. In addition, the use of
inappropriate deflators and deflation techniques may undermine the reliability of the constant
price estimates for some industries. A system of price indices for estimating national
accounts at constant prices needs to be developed.
Bangladesh lacks quarterly estimates of GDP, but the compilation of quarterly national
accounts, with technical assistance from the AsDB, is included in the authorities’ GDDS
plans for improvement. However, given resource constraints, improving the sources and
methodology for annual data should be a short-term priority. Improvement in data sources
should pave the way for the compilation of advance indicators of economic activity.
Prices, wages, and employment
Price statistics include a consumer price index (CPI), a producer price index (PPI), a
wholesale price index (WPI), and unit value indices for external trade. The CPI and WPI are
published with lags of two and three months, respectively, while unit value indices of exports
and imports are available on an annual basis. The CPI and PPI weights are outdated, and the
2005 ROSC mission reiterated that the CPI should be compiled using updated weights. A
household income and expenditure survey (HIES) was carried out in 2005, and it would be
appropriate to derive weights from this survey to update the CPI.
Data for wages are prepared monthly, but employment and unemployment data are only
available at irregular intervals.
Government finance and debt
The Ministry of Finance has, in the past two years, achieved significant progress in
improving the coverage, accuracy, and timeliness of fiscal statistics in line with the
recommendations of the 2005 ROSC. Suspense accounts were cleared, data on governmentguaranteed external debt compiled, and the timeliness of dissemination fiscal and debt data
improved. The 2008 multi-sector mission recommended additional actions to strengthen the
analytical usefulness of fiscal data, including to: improve the integration of debt stocks and
related financial flows; sensitize donors to the need to promptly provide complete data on
Direct Project Assistance; and establish an inter-agency committee to prepare a migration
plan to the GFSM2001.
Central government consolidated data according to the classification of the GFSM 2001 has
been published in the IMF’s Government Finance Statistics Yearbook for FY2004 and the
authorities plan to resume shortly submission of the data for FY2005–FY2007 to the IMF’s
Statistics Department.
Monetary accounts
Monthly accounts of the Bangladesh Bank (BB) and other depository corporations are
available with a lag of six weeks. In addition, the BB also produces a weekly publication
(shared with the Fund) that is available with a lag of about five to six weeks. In line with the

12
ROSC recommendations, the BB embarked on a project to improve monetary and financial
statistics (MFS). The concepts, definitions, institutional coverage, classification of financial
instruments, and sectorization of institutional units broadly conform to the methodology of
the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). The BB compiles monetary data
using the standardized report forms (SRFs) framework, and the SRFs are reported
electronically to the IMF on a regular basis, with the result that a consistent time series based
on SRF data is available from December 2001. These data are being published in the IFS
Supplement on Monetary and Financial Statistics.
Balance of payments
Balance of payments data are broadly on the basis of the Balance of Payments Manual, fifth
edition (BPM5). The foreign exchange settlements-based system provides broad coverage of
transactions, but there are emerging problems related to the activities of firms in Export
Processing Zones (EPZs). They are considered nonresidents under foreign exchange
regulations, and problems arise because only partial data are being collected on EPZ
activities. The 2008 multi-sector mission urged treating EPZs as residents, in conformity with
international statistical guidelines, and to integrate them fully into regular collections.
In the area of goods transactions, the data are collected from two completely different data
sources—exports are based on information from customs declarations processed by the
National Board of Revenue (NBR) and imports are based on foreign exchange settlements.
This recording also gives rise to an inconsistency with the national accounts, where customs
trade data are used in compiling net exports of goods and services.
Within the financial account, the 2008 multi-sector mission identified a range of issues
relating to the coverage, classification, and sectorization of financial flows and their
consistency with the stocks recorded in the international investment position, and made
recommendations for improvement to the flows and stocks. Among these issues, the
recording of trade credit assets appears to create the most distortion, contributing to an
overestimation in the accumulation of foreign assets.
An IIP statement is reported each year to the IMF’s Statistics Department for publication
purposes. However, these data have not yet been disseminated by BB. There is an important
initiative underway in BB to develop a database on private sector external debt, which will
help improve the coverage of external debt in the IIP. There is a need for additional staff
resources to advance the work on this project and related work on foreign direct investment.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND AND
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
BANGLADESH
Joint Fund-World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) 20081
Prepared by the Staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
the International Development Association
Approved by Kalpana Kochhar and Anthony Boote (IMF)
and Carlos Braga and Ernesto May (IDA)
September 2, 2008

Bangladesh’s risk of debt distress is low based on external debt indicators. Bangladesh’s
external debt burden indicators do not breach the relevant policy-dependent indicative
thresholds under the baseline scenario and exhibit only a marginal breach under the stress
tests.2 Debt burden indicators are significantly worse when domestic debt is included.
Accordingly, this analysis reveals a more elevated risk of debt distress on public debt
compared to results based solely on external debt. Staffs will monitor closely the evolution of
domestic debt and the government’s ability to mobilize domestic resources.
1.
The results of this DSA are similar to those of the previous DSA.3 The primary
difference between the two is that in the current DSA, one of the thresholds is marginally
breached in the most extreme stress test, namely the combination of one-half standard1

This DSA has been prepared jointly by World Bank and IMF staffs and in consultation with the Asian
Development Bank using the debt sustainability framework for low-income countries approved by the Boards
of both institutions. The DSA is based on macroeconomic data gathered in the context of IMF missions to
Dhaka in 2008. Estimated debt outstanding and disbursed as of end–FY2007 provides the basis for debt figures.

2

The low-income country debt sustainability framework (LIC DSF) recognizes that better policies and
institutions allow countries to manage higher levels of debt, and thus the threshold levels are policy-dependent.
Bangladesh’s policies and institutions, as measured by the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional
Assessment (CPIA), place it as a “medium performer.” The relevant indicative thresholds for this category are:
40 percent for the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio, 150 percent for the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio, 250 percent for
the NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio, 20 percent for the debt service-to-exports ratio, and 30 percent for the debt
service-to-revenue ratio. These thresholds are applicable to public and publicly guaranteed external debt.

deviation shocks to net transfers, export growth, GDP growth, and the GDP deflator. This
breach emerges largely because the relative magnitude of the shock is substantially higher
compared to the previous DSA. As a result of the significant volatility displayed in some of
Bangladesh’s historical macroeconomic series, the standard deviation of exports and net
transfers has increased; meanwhile, baseline projections for those variables were revised
upwards. Since the values of the key parameters under the shock are simulated to be the
historical average subtracted of half a standard deviation, this is now much lower vis-à-vis
the baseline compared to the analysis done in the previous DSA.4 The projections of debt to
GDP in the previous DSA were, by and large, accurate as the actual outturn deviated from
the projection by less than 1 percentage point. Moreover, the longer-term debt dynamics
under the baseline are similar, but slightly more favorable.
2.
Box 1 summarizes the medium-term macroeconomic framework underlying the
DSA. Most notably, it is based on projections for growth that are in line with but slightly
lower than those in the country’s own medium-term framework, and estimates of external
assistance that reflect both expected scaling up in the context of the millennium development
goals (MDGs), as well as the country’s ability to absorb additional external financing. Export
growth rates are slightly higher in the medium term than historical averages, but taper off to
the historical average in the out years. Export performance for 2006 and 20075 was
substantially better than projected in the previous DSA, and accordingly projections in the
current DSA were revised upward. On the other hand, import growth is also projected to be
significantly higher than the historical average throughout the projection period but
particularly in the medium term. Finally, due to a strong growth in remittances from
Bangladeshis in the United States, United Kingdom, and Gulf states, private net current
transfers are expected to continue their increasing trend.

4

For example, in the case of net transfers, the shock simulated in this year’s DSA is equivalent to a decline
(vs. the baseline scenario) of 6–7 percentage points of GDP, compared to a decline of 4 percentage points
simulated in the previous DSA.

5

All references are to the Bangladeshi fiscal year which runs from July 1 through June 30.

3

Box 1. Bangladesh: Macroeconomic Assumptions Underlying the DSA
The macroeconomic assumptions are as follows:

Real GDP growth in the medium term is, at 6.4 percent, above the recent historical average of
5.6 percent, and it picks up in the outer years to 7 percent. This is close to (but slightly lower than)
Bangladesh's own medium-term projections, and assumes continued progress in broad-based
structural reforms and increased openness of the economy that should allow Bangladesh to benefit
from dynamic growth elsewhere in the Asian region.
Inflation, as measured by the GDP deflator, increases in 2008 due to higher food and energy
prices, but then declines and stabilizes at around 4 percent.
The growth of exports and imports is strong in the medium term (14 percent and 17 percent
respectively); as the economy opens both will increase in terms of GDP with imports gaining the
most as increasing investment and intermediate goods are imported.
The current account (including grants) moves from a small surplus to a deficit, which peaks in
the outer years at about 2 percent of GDP, as a result primarily of continued strong growth of
capital and intermediate goods imports related to increasing investment projects. These effects are
offset to some extent by strong growth of remittances, which are projected to grow at an annual
average of about 13 percent over the medium and long term.
Net aid inflows reach 2 percent of GDP and stabilize in that range (consistent with Bangladesh’s
medium-term framework). The projections assume that the grant element of new borrowing
decreases over the 20-year period from 48 percent to 39 percent in the out years.
The overall fiscal deficit (excluding grants) is assumed to remain close to the historical average
(around 4 percent of GDP), while the primary deficit declines slightly over time. A modest rise is
assumed in the revenue-to-GDP ratio (excluding grants) in the initial years (from 11½ percent in
FY08 to 13 percent in FY13), supported by efforts to mobilize domestic revenues.
Real interest rates on domestic currency debt are assumed to stay more or less constant at about
3.5 percent.

I. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
3.
All external debt indicators remain well below the policy-dependent debt burden
thresholds under the baseline scenario, but one threshold is breached under the most
extreme standard stress test. The main results of the external DSA are as follows:
•

All debt indicators in the baseline scenario are expected to decline over the
20-year projection period (Table 1 and Figure 1). The NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio
decreases from about 17 percent in 2007 to 9 percent (compared to an indicative
threshold of 40 percent) during the projection period, while the NPV debt-to-exports
ratio decreases from 84 percent to 30 percent (compared to an indicative threshold of
150 percent), and the debt service ratio decreases from 5 percent to 3 percent
(compared to an indicative threshold of 20 percent).

4

•

The standard stress tests do not reveal any serious vulnerability although the
NPV of debt to revenues threshold is breached in the most extreme test, in which
GDP growth, exports, net current transfers, and FDI suffer a one-half standard
deviation shock (Table 2 and Figure 1). The breach is temporary, lasting for two
years. The dynamics lead to a sharp secular decline in the ratio thereafter. As
explained earlier, the debt dynamics are similar to the previous DSA, and the
increased magnitude of the shocks (which causes the breach of the threshold) reflects
the volatility in some of Bangladesh’s macroeconomic variables rather than newly
identified risks.

II. PUBLIC DEBT6 SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
4.
Domestic debt has been relatively stable over the past five years. Gross debt has
remained around 18–19 percent of GDP from end–June 2002 to end–June 2007 (Table 3).
The majority of the domestic debt is in the form of treasury bills and savings certificates held
by nonbanks, and just over a quarter is held by the central bank.
5.
The baseline scenario entails a gradual decline in the NPV of public debt-to-GDP
ratio, with both external and domestic debt declining relative to nominal GDP
(Table 3). The NPV of public debt-to-revenue ratio is also projected to decline while the debt
service-to-revenue ratio remains relatively low reflecting highly concessional terms on
external loans.
6.
Despite the manageable outlook in the baseline scenario, the alternative
scenarios and bound tests indicate that the projected paths of debt indicators are
sensitive to alternative assumptions and point to considerable risks (Table 4).
6

Public debt includes domestic central government debt and external public and publicly guaranteed debt.

5

•

The public debt position is vulnerable to a growth slowdown. The NPV of public
debt-to-GDP ratio ceases to decline under a low growth scenario, in which growth
slows down to baseline minus one half the standard deviation of the historical growth
rate, (about 6.6 percent per year—see scenario A3). In fact because the low growth
scenario also assumes that revenues adjust downward to lower growth whereas
expenditures do not, the debt-to-GDP ratio starts to rise modestly in the outer years
(2015 onwards). This highlights the need to manage expenditures prudently, while
protecting priority spending, in the event of a growth slowdown.

•

Public debt indicators are also vulnerable to one-off debt creating flows (scenario
B5). Underpricing of energy products by BPC and BPDB, and of fertilizer prices by
BCIC are creating contingent liabilities that may need to be borne by the government.
These contingent liabilities are presently growing by almost 1 percent of GDP per
annum, and in the absence of an effective strategy to address this problem, the risks
of large debt-creating flows in the future are elevated. Under the assumption of a oneoff debt creating flow of 10 percent of GDP—which could be conservative given that
contingent liabilities will increase further unless policies are changed—the debtservice to revenue ratio reaches 36 percent in 2010, compared with the baseline ratio
of 23 percent.
III. DEBT MANAGEMENT

7.
In response to a request from the authorities, a joint Bank/Fund mission visited
Bangladesh in January 2008 to provide technical assistance to help improve
Bangladesh’s medium-term debt strategy formulation. The mission focused on assisting
the authorities to create the capacity to formulate debt management strategies through
comprehensive sharing and analysis of external and domestic debt data and the identification,
measurement, and management of cost and risk in the context of DSA.
8.
The authorities have made significant progress in moving forward with the
recommendations of the mission. Among other actions: (i) a committee was created under
the chairmanship of the Resource and Debt Management Wing of the Finance Division of the
Ministry of Finance with members from all the divisions and departments that currently deal
with debt information; (ii) UNCTAD’s debt management system (DMFAS) was installed to
help to monitor and analyze existing debt; and (iii) Finance Division staff are working with
Fund and Bank staff to familiarize themselves with the preparation of DSAs.
IV. CONCLUSION
9.
It is the staffs’ view that Bangladesh should be considered at low risk of debt
distress based on external indicators, but the analysis reveals a more elevated risk of
debt distress on public debt. The baseline projections and the associated standard stress
tests show little risk related to external debt given that none of the indicators breaches or is

6

close to the indicative debt burden thresholds. A temporary and minor breach of one
threshold under a particularly severe stress test does not change this conclusion. Risks to
domestic debt accumulation, however, especially coming from the possible recognition of
contingent liabilities, raise concerns.
10.
The substantial increase in debt ratios when domestic debt is included, allied to
concerns about contingent liabilities, calls for careful management of the public debt.
While the NPV of public debt-to-revenue ratio would decline over the 20-year horizon (albeit
from a relatively high level) under baseline assumptions, the ratio would remain high in some
of the bound tests. The substantial jump in the key liquidity ratio (debt service to revenues)
under the shock that simulates the recognition of contingent liabilities is a particular cause for
concern, and highlights the risks that can materialize if economic policies are not managed
carefully and public enterprise losses are not contained.
11.
Efforts to mobilize domestic revenues, especially in the initial years, as well as
the appropriate management of contingent liabilities, and managing expenditures
prudently while protecting priority spending are the keys to ensure improvement in the
debt indicators. This exercise also underscores the importance of effective management of
the existing debt and new debt accumulation.
12.
The staff encourages the authorities to build on recent steps and move forward
as quickly as possible to strengthen debt management capacity. In this regard, it will be
important to develop a comprehensive external debt data base and to centralize the reporting
of all external aid flows.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Bangladesh
September 19, 2008

1.
This statement summarizes economic developments since the issuance of the staff
report to the Executive Board. These developments do not alter the thrust of the staff
appraisal.
2.
Money growth continued to be rapid with reserve and broad money growing at
19 percent in July and credit growth approaching 26 percent. Bangladesh Bank responded on
September 16 by raising their repo rate by 25 basis points to 8¾ percent. The CPI for July
still has not been released by the authorities.
3.
The taka remains stable against the dollar and net international reserves have declined
by around US$170 million thus far during FY09 mainly reflecting valuation changes.
4.
Government revenue performance in early FY09 was strong with collections through
August 19 percent higher than in FY08. Recent declines in international oil prices make it
more likely that budget provisions will be able to cover the losses of the state-owned
petroleum company but, unless prices decline further, losses will continue to accrue.
5.
Recent weeks have seen significant floods in the southern and central regions, but
water levels have begun to recede and, at present, there are no indications that the calamitous
flooding of 2007 will be repeated.
6.
The political situation has evolved since the staff report was issued. The leaders of
both main political parties have now been released on bail and are planning to participate in
their respective party's preparations for national elections. The Election Commission is
expected to announce very soon a late December date for national elections and to clarify its
position on holding additional local government elections prior to the national elections.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
Bangladesh
On September 19, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Bangladesh. 1
Background
Bangladesh’s macroeconomic performance has been remarkably resilient in a year of multiple
natural disasters. Real GDP growth in FY08 (July–June) remained strong at above 6 percent,
supported by a strong pickup in domestic economic activity in the second half of the year and
rapid growth in garments exports and remittances. However, inflation has picked up to average
10 percent over the year, mainly driven by escalating international food and fuel prices and
inflationary pressures are expected to remain high with the increase in administered fuel prices
implemented on July 1 and signs of emerging demand pressures.
The nominal exchange rate remained stable in dollar terms in FY08, but depreciated by
6½ percent in effective terms as the dollar’s value decreased in international markets. Strong
remittance growth, a pickup in garment exports and external assistance kept the current
account in surplus despite an increase in the trade deficit and allowed international reserves to
grow moderately (2¾ months of prospective imports) in a year of increased import demand and
high international commodity prices.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
The overall fiscal balance for FY08 is estimated to have been below the budget target.
Government revenue collection improved impressively and exceeded the budget target for the
first time in recent history. Revenue was mainly driven by improved taxpayer compliance and
collection of tax arrears. This allowed the overall fiscal deficit to be 3.3 percent of GDP
compared with the budget target of 4.5 percent of GDP (excluding historical losses of the
petroleum company), despite increased social spending arising from disaster relief operations
and better coverage of state-owned enterprise losses related to administered fuel and fertilizer
prices. Increased external assistance allowed domestic financing to remain below 2 percent of
GDP.
Revenue administration improved markedly in FY08. The institutional framework for separating
tax policy from administration has been established and a new unit will begin work by the end of
the year. The two Large Taxpayer Units have been placed under the control of a single member
at the National Board of Revenue, which should further improve enforcement. Revenue gains in
FY08 reflected improvement in taxpayer compliance arising in part from the authorities’ new
universal self-assessment.
Growth in monetary aggregates moderated in the first half of FY08 but picked up rapidly in the
last part of the year. Broad money growth stood at 17½ percent at end-June. Reflecting the
need to finance increased food imports and Bangladesh Bank’s (BB’s) selectively
accommodative monetary policy focusing on growth-driving sectors, private sector credit growth
picked up during the year and reached 25 percent in June.
Several actions have been taken to further develop the financial sector such as strengthening
the regulatory and prudential framework of BB, corporatizing and improving the management of
the state-owned commercial banks (SCBs), automating stock trading, and establishing a
government securities market. However, SCBs, which still account for over 30 percent of total
banking sector assets, remain moribund and undermine the efficiency of the financial system.
Inflexibility with regard to interest rates in the auction process of government securities has
limited the operation of the primary dealer system and the development of an active secondary
market.
Bangladesh’s medium-term economic outlook is favorable. Though growth could slow in the
near term while inflationary pressures and other current challenges are addressed, it is
projected to increase to around 7 percent over the medium term, mainly driven by
improvements in agriculture and expansion in domestic services and construction, supported by
strong regional growth momentum. The external current account is projected to remain broadly
in balance, with export and remittance growth offsetting growth in imports arising from higher
investment. External assistance and gradually increasing capital inflows are expected to
underpin a steady increase in international reserve coverage.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their efforts to maintain macroeconomic
stability in a year of multiple natural disasters and elevated food and fuel prices, which have put

3
severe pressure on incomes, particularly of the urban and landless rural poor. Despite the longterm challenge of climate change, the medium-term outlook is favorable. Economic growth is
expected to increase as key structural reforms take root and the country capitalizes on
accelerating growth across the region.
Directors considered that preventing an increase in inflation is the immediate priority, as the
poor and vulnerable are hit hardest by inflation. With fiscal policy focusing on addressing the
social impact of higher commodity prices, most Directors saw the need to tighten monetary
policy to keep inflation expectations in check, and welcomed the recent action by the central
bank in this regard.
Directors agreed that macroeconomic policies are consistent with external stability. The external
current account is expected to stay broadly in balance as continued growth in exports and
remittances offset growth in imports. The current exchange rate policy has allowed the real
exchange rate of the taka to remain in line with medium-term fundamentals. Directors broadly
agreed, however, that more flexibility in the rate would support monetary policy objectives and
encourage deepening of the foreign exchange market. They urged the authorities to adopt a
timetable to remove the remaining exchange restriction.
Directors congratulated the authorities on the recent progress in fiscal stability. A significant
improvement in revenue collections has helped offset increasing energy and fertilizer subsidies
and larger outlays on social safety nets. The July increase in administered prices was a bold
step, which has prevented a deterioration in state-owned enterprise finances. However, more
remains to be done to place state-owned enterprises on a secure footing and to increase
poverty-reducing spending.
Directors stressed that keeping to the macroeconomic targets of the FY09 budget will be
important in controlling inflation. Directors supported the budget’s mildly expansionary stance,
particularly in the light of recent fiscal prudence and the need to address the social impact of
higher food prices. Given current inflationary pressures, Directors encouraged the authorities to
use any excess revenue collections to reduce domestic financing.
Directors stressed that increasing revenue will be crucial to allow fiscal policy to return to a
lower deficit path in the medium term, while at the same time increasing essential public
expenditures. They encouraged the authorities to move forward to revise income tax and valueadded tax legislation, and to maintain recent progress in strengthening revenue administration
and enforcement. Replacing open-ended price subsidies with more affordable and bettertargeted social safety nets will help provide fiscal space for increases in public investment and
the provision of social services. Directors urged the authorities to address constraints in
implementing the Annual Development Program so that priority spending increases in line with
development needs.

Directors noted that further deepening of the financial sector will help Bangladesh to achieve its
growth potential. They encouraged the authorities to give priority to strengthening the financial
positions of the SCBs and to developing a secondary market for government securities.
Directors called on the authorities to accelerate the implementation of structural reforms and to
strengthen institutions, in order to attract investment and prevent a slowdown in growth that
could jeopardize debt sustainability. In the same vein, it will also be important to improve
infrastructure, particularly in the electric power sector.

Statement by Adarsh Kishore, Executive Director for Bangladesh
and Partha Ray, Advisor to Executive Director
September 19, 2008
1. The Bangladesh Authorities would like to take this opportunity to put on record their
appreciation of the IMF staff for an effective and fruitful Article IV Consultation. The
staff report on Article IV Consultation has presented a balanced view of the economy,
broadly reflecting the discussions held between the staff and the authorities. The
authorities are in broad consonance with the assessment and policy messages of the
Report.
Growth
2. Despite natural disasters and high global food and fuel prices, Bangladesh economy
has shown remarkable signs of resilience. The real GDP growth rate for the financial
year 2007-08 (i.e., July 2007 to June 2008) is estimated at 6.2 percent, which is
slightly lower than the 6.4 percent achieved in 2006-07. Growth has picked up during
the latter half of 2007-08, supported by a bumper agricultural harvest, escalating
garment exports and very strong remittances. Agricultural production rebounded with
a record 19 percent increase in Boro crop harvest. Industrial growth, however, slowed
down from 8.4 percent in 2006-07 to 6.9 percent in 2007-08 due to slower growth in
construction and manufacturing. It is expected that the effects of the natural
calamities prove transient and should not pose any serious threat to disrupt the
macroeconomic fundamentals of the economy.
3. The growth target of 6.5 percent for the financial year 2008-09 appears feasible,
especially due to brighter prospects of increasing agricultural and manufacturing
outputs, but would require concerted efforts to supplement the existing growth
supportive policies with additional policies to realize the potential. In fact, given the
growth trend in recent years and also considering the current macroeconomic scenario
and near-term projections, the authorities view the staff projection of growth for
2008-09 at 6 percent as somewhat conservative.
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)
4. Despite low per capita income there was a significant progress in Bangladesh in terms
of achieving MDGs particularly in human development areas, especially with respect
to education, child mortality and gender equality. Illustratively, adult literacy rate
went up from 37 percent in during 1990-95 to 54 percent during 2005-07, and underfive mortality rate (per 1,000) registered a significant fall from 151 during 1990-95 to
62 during 2005-07.
Inflation
5. Consequent on the elevated global food and energy prices as well as internal shocks,
Bangladesh witnessed a high inflationary trajectory in recent times. The 12-month
average CPI inflation, which was 7.2 percent in the financial years 2006-07, rose to a
high of 10.0 percent in March 2008 and then marginally declined to 9.9 percent in
June 2008. The current inflationary pressure in Bangladesh is driven mainly by
external supply side factors triggered by international price hike of food, fuel and

2
fertilizer. It is expected that with the easing of their price level in international market
and domestic food prices, the inflationary pressure would reduce and stay within a
single digit during the fiscal year.
6. The government raised administered price of compressed natural gas (CNG) in June
2008 and prices of fuel oil and urea fertilizer in July 2008. These adjustments pushed
up the point to point inflation to 10.0 percent in June 2008 from 7.4 percent in May
2008. However, with the expected positive supply response of the real sector to
policy measures of the Government and the Bangladesh Bank (BB, the Central Bank)
the impact of the rise may be avoided in due course. The authorities keep a constant
watch on the current inflationary trend and affirmative actions, if and when required,
would be taken if the inflationary scenario poses a threat to existing macroeconomic
stability.
Monetary Policy
7. The expansion in broad money (M2) at 17.6 percent during the financial year 2007-08
was marginally higher than that of 17.0 percent experienced during the financial year
2006-07. Domestic credit increased by 21.1 percent during the financial year 2007-08
compared with 14.9 percent in the previous year. Reserve money (RM) recorded an
increase of 19.6 percent during 2007-08 as compared with 17.7 percent during 200607.
8. The stance of the monetary policy in Bangladesh could be seen as not adequately
contractionary. However, it was felt that while monetary tightening can bring down
inflation, it has unacceptably high cost in terms of foregone output and employment
which an economy like Bangladesh can ill afford at present in view of its growth and
poverty reduction imperatives. This, however, does not negate the importance of
avoiding excessive monetary laxity which would harm macroeconomic stability and
hence growth and poverty reduction efforts. The monetary policy stance during the
first half of the financial year 2008-09 aims at ensuring reasonable price stability and
providing support to sustainable and high output growth as adopted in the macro
framework of the current fiscal year. For supporting growth promoting policies, the
policy stance would give priority to unhindered flow of private sector credit to the
economy’s productive sectors, with agriculture, SMEs, and the rural economy being
the prime targets. While the policy stance would be to lessen the pressure on inflation
through increasing supply of outputs and keeping demand pressure within control, the
target rate of average inflation has been taken at around 9.0 percent for the financial
year 2008-09.
Public Finance
9. The total revenue for the Budget for the financial year 2008-09 has been estimated at
11.3 percent of GDP. Out of this, the revenue from the National Board of Revenue
(NBR, the central authority for tax administration in Bangladesh) has been targeted at
8.9 percent of GDP. Non-tax and Non-NBR revenues have been estimated at 2.1
percent of GDP and 0.4 percent of GDP, respectively. In the face of escalating social
spending following cyclone and floods, and after absorbing huge losses of stateowned enterprises (SOEs) through budget transfer, the budget deficit of 2007-08
remained below 4 percent of GDP. Yet more, domestic financing (excluding

3
Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation’s non-cash assumption of debt) was less than 1
percent of GDP.
10. The fiscal position was supported by a significant improvement in revenue
collections, which helped offset increased subsidies and outlays on safety nets. High
revenue collection of the financial year 2007-08 was not a one-off shot. Instead, an
overall improvement in governance led to greater compliance in taxation resulting in
a historic 27 percent growth exceeding the budget estimate by 1½ percentage points
and even the scaled up revised revenue estimates by ½ percentage point. The
increased flow of revenue to the coffers helped in maintaining fiscal and macro
economic stability despite the domestic shocks and external shocks. Nevertheless, the
losses of the state-owned enterprises (SOEs) remains an area that has attracted the
interventions of the authorities; admittedly, reforms in the operations of the SOEs,
such as corporatization of the Bangladesh Airlines, cost-containments measures in the
Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation, private-public partnership in operating the
Bangladesh Jute Mills units would improve fiscal position.
11. In the wake of rapid rise of food prices and consequent erosion of purchasing power
of the poor, the Government have launched its largest ever cash-for-work safety net
programme titled 100 Days’ Employment Generation Programme to protect the poor
from sliding back to poverty. This programme would guarantee employment to any
person who would slip through other safety net programs in place and would
guarantee 100 days work for 2 million poor at a cost of Tk 20 billion. The 100 Days’
Employment Generation Programme is being implemented under policy guidelines
designed to be well targeted. This and other safety-net programmes would involve 3
percent of GDP.
12. The debt sustainability analysis of Bangladesh, based on external indicators, seems to
indicate that the economy’s risk of debt distress is low. Illustratively, the net present
value of debt-GDP ratio decreases from about 17 percent in 2007 to 9 percent during
the projection period of 2008-28. The standard stress tests too do not reveal any
serious vulnerability.
External Sector
13. As per recent trends in external trade, a robust growth in import during 2007-08 by
26.1 percent exceeded the exports growth of 15.9 percent and resulted in a widening
trade deficit of US $ 5,541 million. Despite the surge in trade deficit, higher external
aid flow and healthy growth in workers’ remittances provided a cushion to the
external balance, resulting in a surplus of US $ 672 million in current account balance
during 2007-08 . Overall, the balance of payments showed a surplus of US$ 604
million during 2007-08 against a surplus of US $ 1,493 million in the previous year.
14. The foreign exchange market remained mostly stable in 2007-08 although the high
inflow of remittances coupled with rising exports enabled Taka to appreciate slightly
against USD. The Bangladesh Bank, as a part of its pro-active monetary policy,
remained active in the foreign exchange market and made necessary interventions in
the interbank market to help dampen inflationary pressure partly by cutting import
costs of food items. The policy stance also enabled BB to maintain a comfortable
foreign exchange reserve throughout FY08.

15. Both nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) and real effective exchange rate
(REER) depreciated while nominal exchange rate appreciated slightly in May 2008
over June 2007. The real exchange rate remained in line with its equilibrium level on
a broad range of measures and macroeconomic policies and was in line with external
stability.
16. Our authorities concur with the broad thrust of the Staff report and are prepared to go
forward in implementing various facets of reform programme that would generate
further growth and have positive spillovers on poverty eradication. Bangladesh in
recent years has shown considerable resilience to the effects of natural calamities and
external shocks. Furthermore, it is the considered view of the authorities that the
upcoming political transition process in December 2008 is not likely to have any
negative impact on growth, as the thrust of growth in Bangladesh continues to be
private sector-led. Nevertheless, uncertainties in the external front as well as those
related to climate changes could have some ramification for medium-term growth
prospects.
