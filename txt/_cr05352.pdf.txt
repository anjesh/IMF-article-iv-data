BELIZE
Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2005 Consultation with Belize
Approved by Christopher Towe and G. Russell Kincaid
August 12, 2005

Discussions: A staff team comprising B. Fritz-Krockow (Head), G. El-Masry, M. Torres,
M. Nozaki (all WHD), G. Srour (INS), and W. McGrew and P. Brukoff (both PDR) visited
Belize during April 18-May 3 and during July 7–11. The authorities visited Washington on
June 13–14. The team met with the Prime Minister, the Economic Cabinet, senior government
officials, and representatives of trade unions and the private sector. C. O’Loghlin and P.
Charleton (Alternate EDs) joined the policy discussions.
Recent developments: Only belatedly have the authorities begun to tighten policies and
address the growing risk of a balance of payments crisis. Stiff public resistance forced the
government to rescind key budget measures in early 2005, but in late-May the authorities
introduced a package of fiscal and monetary policy measures aimed explicitly at sustaining the
pegged exchange rate.
Main policy recommendations: In view of the severe imbalances and delays in tightening
policies, there remains a significant risk of a balance of payments crisis a considerable and
sustained policy correction is still needed to lessen the risks.
Exchange arrangement: The Belize dollar has been pegged at BZ$2 per U.S. dollar since
1976.
Fund relations: Belize presently has no outstanding use of Fund credit. The authorities have
been increasingly receptive to Fund policy advice.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

Recent Developments. The economy grew at a relatively robust pace in 2004, supported
by strength in the tourism, agriculture, and fisheries sectors. However, the fiscal and
external current account deficits remained at unsustainable levels, public debt reached
100 percent of GDP, and the authorities failed to achieve the envisaged fiscal policy
adjustment.

•

The authorities began to tighten policies in 2005 in response to growing concern
regarding the risks of a balance of payments crisis. In May, the authorities announced
fiscal measures aimed at reducing the deficit to 3 percent of GDP and also tightened
monetary policy to contain credit expansion.

•

A stronger adjustment effort appears necessary. The magnitude of adjustment, delays
in policy implementation, and new spending commitments mean that the FY05/06 fiscal
target will not be achieved. Moreover, the substantial external financing gap that is likely
to emerge in 2006 means that additional and sustained fiscal measures will be required.

•

The authorities see only limited scope for additional fiscal measures. They argued
that there is only limited room for a stronger fiscal adjustment effort given the severity of
the measures already taken and the contractionary impact on the economy.

•

There is a need to deal expeditiously with the insolvent Development Finance
Corporation (DFC). The assets of the failed DFC continue to deteriorate and budget
support is necessary to sustain its operations. The authorities have taken steps to
restructure the DFC, but key policy elements are yet to be defined.

•

The authorities have announced their intention to seek debt-service relief from
external creditors. It is essential that this be carried out early and in a transparent and
orderly manner, and will most likely be successful if undertaken within a medium-term
framework aimed at restoring debt sustainability and a resilience to shocks.

I. ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL BACKGROUND
1.
Belize is a small, export-dependent country. Exports of goods and services are the
equivalent of 50 percent of GDP, and constitute mainly agricultural products (sugar, bananas,
and citrus) and marine products (shrimp and lobster), while tourism has become a major
industry only recently. Belize has maintained a fixed exchange rate peg (BZ$2 per U.S.
dollar) since 1976, and capital controls are prevalent. A widespread parallel foreign exchange
market exists.

Belize is highly vulnerable to external trade and weather-related shocks. Exports
are relatively undiversified in terms of products and markets (mainly the United States and
the European Union). During 2000–02, hurricanes and floods severely affected the tourism
and agriculture industries and required more than US$25 million (about 2½ percent of GDP)
in emergency reconstruction. In addition, a virus damaged the shrimp industry in 2001–02,
and sharp swings in prices affected the banana and citrus industries in 2003–04. More
recently, high world oil prices have weakened the terms of trade further.1

See the chapter on “Sources of Vulnerability” in the accompanying Selected Issues paper.

3.
Belize’s vulnerabilities have been exacerbated in recent years by substantial
fiscal imbalances and a rapid increase in external public debt. Fiscal deficits averaged
about 9 percent of GDP during 1999–2004, largely reflecting weak expenditure discipline.
However, the balance sheet of the state-owned Development Finance Corporation (DFC)
also expanded by the equivalent of 28 percent of GDP as a result of government policies to
promote the housing sector. As a result, public and publicly guaranteed debt—mainly
comprising loans from foreign banks and external bond placements—tripled during
1999-2003 to reach about US$1 billion or about 100 percent of GDP at end-2004.

4.
The public sector’s debt dynamics have become increasingly adverse. With the
rapid increase in indebtedness and a marked widening of spreads, interest expenses on
foreign loans increased from 1½ percent of GDP in FY00/01 to an estimated 7½ percent of
GDP in FY04/05 (fiscal year ending March). This offset almost entirely a significant
improvement in the primary deficit from 7½ percent of GDP in FY00/01 to ¼ percent of
GDP in FY04/05. Most of the adjustment was the result of a sharp contraction of capital
spending, even as the public sector wage bill rose sharply during 2003–05.
5.
Even in the face of an unsustainable fiscal and balance of payments position, it
has proven difficult to build the necessary political consensus for adjustment. The ruling
party maintains a solid majority in the National Assembly, for which elections are not due
until 2008. Nonetheless, disagreements among ministers on the direction of policies led to
cabinet reshuffles in August 2004 and December 2004. In January 2005, the government’s
budget for FY05/06 called for a fiscal effort of about 2½ percent of GDP but triggered
widespread strikes and work stoppages by civil servants and public utilities workers. As a

-6-

result, the government was forced in February to rescind fiscal measures equivalent to about
1 percent of GDP.2 In April 2005, allegations of government corruption and mismanagement
led to strikes and sporadic riots, disrupting telecommunications, transport, and public utilities
services.
6.
The authorities have only recently become receptive to Fund advice. Over the
past years, the Fund has expressed growing concern that fiscal and external imbalances
remained unsustainably large, and called for immediate and comprehensive fiscal correction,
supported by tight monetary policies. However, only in late-2004, after external market
access became impaired and the threat of a balance of payments crisis became imminent, did
the authorities invite a Fund staff team to assist in developing an adjustment strategy.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
7.
Notwithstanding its external and fiscal imbalances, Belize’s recent growth
performance has been relatively favorable. Real GDP growth surged to about 9 percent in
2003, mainly owing to strength in the tourism sector and a recovery in the agriculture and
fisheries sectors. The growth rate is estimated to have remained at 4½ percent in 2004,
reflecting continued government expenditure, and robust output growth in the sugar, banana,
shrimp, and citrus industries, even in the face of sharply lower international prices in some
sectors. In the tourism sector, stay-over volume increased by 5 percent, while cruise ship
arrivals rose by almost 50 percent.3
8.
The authorities failed to achieve the envisaged significant fiscal adjustment last
year. The overall fiscal deficit is estimated to have risen from 8¼ percent of GDP in FY03/04 to
8¾ percent of GDP in FY04/05, compared to the authorities’ 2¾ percent of GDP budget target.
Noninterest current expenditure exceeded budgeted levels by almost 3 percent of GDP, and
interest payments overshot by almost 4¾ percent of GDP, mainly as a result of the exceptional
fees and charges associated with three large external financing arrangements (Box 1). Excluding
these exceptional fees, the underlying fiscal deficit fell from 8¾ percent of GDP to 6 percent of
GDP.

2

In addition, the government agreed to appoint a union representative to the board of the Central Bank of Belize
and establish a commission of inquiry to investigate the operations of the DFC. The Senate also appointed a
Select Committee to investigate the management and financial operations of the Social Security Board.

3

Belize has recorded the fastest increase in cruise-ship tourism arrivals in the Caribbean in the last three years.

Box 1. The High Cost of Recent External Financing Arrangements
Despite the sharply curtailed access to international capital markets and deteriorating borrowing
conditions, Belize was successful in refinancing of a number of loans and fresh financing
amounting to US$291.3 million during late 2004 and early 2005. However, in the face of growing
concern regarding Belize’s credit worthiness, this was only achieved by incurring upfront closing
fees and charges of about US$28 million (about 2¾ percent of GDP):
• In October 2004, the government of Belize rolled over with the Royal Merchant Bank of
Trinidad and Tobago three payments totaling US$65.5 million that were falling due during
October 2004–January 2005. The largest of these payments was a loan of US$54 million
originally contracted by the DFC and assumed by the government. The new note amounted to
US$75.6 million, including closing fees and charges of US$12.7 million (1.2 percent of GDP),
of which US$9.8 million constituted an early prepayment penalty fee for the DFC loan. The
yield to maturity is about 13 percent and the note has a ten-year bullet maturity, with a put
option that is exercisable after three years.
• In November 2004, the government of Belize rolled over US$79 million from a total of
US$95 million that were falling due to the International Bank of Miami (IBOM). The new
loan was contracted with Capital Markets Financial Services (CMFS), a financial entity
linked to IBOM. The closing fees for the new CMFS loan amounted to US$2.7 million (or
0.3 percent of GDP). About US$44 million of the new loan were repaid in early-2005, with a
balance of US$35 million still outstanding. The yield to maturity is around 11 percent, the loan
has a maturity of seven years, and bond holders can exercise put options in November 2005.
In March 2005, the authorities placed two new bonds through Bear Stearns totaling about
US$136.7 million (about 13 percent of GDP) with maturities of 5 and 10 years and a yield to
maturity of around 13 percent. There were upfront charges and financing fees of US$4.6 million
and a prepayment of a 2-years insurance fee of US$8.1 million (together 1.2 percent of GDP). In
addition, about US$30 million were placed in blocked reserve and escrow accounts to service the
bonds in the future. Most of the net proceeds of US$93.6 million will be released for pre-agreed
debt service payments.

9.
The state-owned DFC continues to place a heavy burden on public finances.
After mounting losses from failed investments and questionable financing operations, the
government was forced to refinance and assume directly about US$210 million in external
loans of the DFC during 2002–05. A recent Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)
technical assistance report concluded that the DFC was critically undercapitalized due to
inadequate provisioning for its nonperforming loans, which exceed 47 percent of its portfolio
as of May 2005, and an overvaluation of its real estate assets. The report also highlighted
severe problems of corporate governance and weak management and recommended the
DFC’s closure to halt the continued deterioration of its financial position. The authorities
announced in late-2004 their intention to wind down the DFC and appointed a new
management and Board of Directors in July 2005, but other steps have yet to be undertaken.

10.
Belatedly, the authorities have taken steps to tighten monetary policy. The net
domestic assets of the Central Bank of Belize (CBB) increased by about 4 percent of GDP
during 2004, owing to a sharp increase in borrowing by the central government and the DFC,
and commercial lending rates fell below 14 percent.4 Nevertheless, private sector credit
growth from commercial banks and DFC eased from 12 percent in 2003 to 7½ percent in
2004. In an effort to further stem domestic demand growth, the CBB raised the cash reserve
requirement by 1 percentage point each in December 2004 and May 2005. A decision was
also taken to channel the receipts of the Belize Social Security Board (BSSB) to the CBB to
reduce banking system liquidity.5 As a result, the 12-month growth rate in credit to the
private sector slowed further to 6½ percent by end-May 2005.
11.
Steps have been taken to improve financial supervision and prudential
regulation. The authorities have begun to implement procedures under the Money
Laundering Prevention Act, and have adopted a risk-based approach to banking inspection.
The Banks and Financial Institutions Act and the International Banking Act are being revised
in line with the Basel Core Principles. Banking supervision has been expanded to include the
DFC effective January 2004, while supervision of credit unions is being strengthened.

4

The steep rise in central bank borrowing in the last quarter of 2004 was reversed in March 2005 with the
disbursement of international bonds.

5

This measure can have a substantial impact on liquidity, as about half of the deposit growth in the commercial
banking system in 2004 can be attributed to higher deposits by the BSSB.

-9-

12.
The balance of payments remains under severe pressure. The current account
deficit averaged about 22 percent of GDP during 2001–03, owing to rapid import growth.
Despite the continued deterioration of the terms of trade, the deficit narrowed somewhat to
about 18 percent of GDP in 2004, as exports of goods and services continued to expand and
capital goods imports fell. Current account deficits were financed mainly through increases
in public sector indebtedness, and external public debt reached 80 percent of GDP by end2004. Notwithstanding significant private capital inflows in 2004 related to major investment
projects, the capital account surplus narrowed as Belize’s access to capital markets became
impaired. As a result, net international reserves fell by about half during 2004 to
US$40 million (0.8 months of imports).6
13.
Belize’s borrowing costs have surged reflecting a sharply lower market
assessment of creditworthiness. The country’s credit rating has been downgraded and risk
spreads have increased sharply reflecting high debt levels and increased doubts about the
sustainability of the policy framework.7 Belize still managed to complete three new
refinancing operations since late 2004 totaling US$291 million (28 percent of GDP),
including the placement of new international bonds of about US$137 million in March 2005.
However, these operations carried high closing fees, upfront charges, and other security
payments amounting to 2.7 percent of GDP during FY04/05 (see Box 1).
14.
Despite these difficulties, the exchange rate has faced limited pressure in the
parallel foreign exchange market. Reflecting the improvement in the current account
balance and significant public sector borrowing abroad, the spread between the official and
parallel market rate remained below 10 percent during 2004 and the first half of 2005.
Nonetheless, and due mainly to the weakness of the U.S. currency, the Belize dollar has
depreciated significantly in nominal effective terms in recent years, leading to a similar
depreciation in real effective terms.

6

Usable gross reserves amounted to US$30 million at end-2004, as some CBB foreign assets were pledged,
e.g., in a sinking fund to repay a bond maturing in June 2005.

7

In the last of several ratings actions, S&P downgraded Belize to CCC- with a negative outlook on June 1,
2005, after the country had announced its intentions to seek a debt restructuring. S&P pointed out that there was
a the high probability that the restructuring would be concluded on terms that would constitute a default.
Moody’s followed a week later by downgrading Belize’s foreign-currency rating from B2 to B3 with negative
outlook.

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
15.
Discussions in April/May centered on the substantial risk of a crisis and the
importance of a quick and decisive policy response. The mission stressed that a sizable
balance of payments financing gap was likely to emerge in 2006, which meant that a strong
adjustment effort would be required if the authorities were to be able to sustain the pegged
exchange rate. Subsequently, in late May, the authorities announced a fiscal and monetary
package to address the risk of “financial crisis and ensure a sustainable fiscal and external
position,” and discussions were concluded in July.
16.
During the July mission, the team cautioned that further substantive and
sustained measures would be required to safeguard the pegged exchange rate. The team
welcomed the recent fiscal policy tightening based mainly on tax increases and a reduction in
capital expenditure, but noted that the measures appeared too modest, had been implemented
with significant delays, and were partly offset by new spending commitments. In particular,
the staff’s estimates suggested that the authorities’ adjustment program would be insufficient
to achieve the 3 percent of GDP fiscal deficit target for FY05/06, and would not achieve the
necessary contraction in demand before external reserves were depleted in 2006. Moreover,
the heightening of domestic political tensions and the weakening of international confidence
left Belize highly vulnerable to a rapid shift in market sentiment or to a new adverse external
shock.

- 11 -

17.
Although the authorities were unwilling to discuss amendments to the exchange
rate system, they saw little immediate scope for additional measures to support the peg.
This reflected concern that further adjustment would trigger an excessively large economic
contraction or a resurgence of social tensions. While the authorities remained committed to a
tight macroeconomic stance during 2005–06, they recognized the need to approach their
external creditors to seek their assistance in closing the financing gap, possibly through relief
of debt service in 2006.

18.
The authorities also reiterated their preference for an adjustment effort that did
not include a Fund-supported program. Instead, they expressed interest in regular Fund
assessments of their adjustment effort, which might be used to support new multilateral
financing or the authorities’ efforts to seek debt service relief from their commercial external
creditors. The mission informed the authorities of the policies and procedures related to
assessment letters.
A. The Short- and Medium-Term Outlooks
19.
The team presented short-term projections illustrating the need for significant
additional demand compression or financing. Even with the fiscal and other policy
adjustments that had been set in motion, growth was expected to slow only modestly—to
3 percent and 2¾ percent in 2005 and 2006, respectively—mainly owing to the strength of
the tourism and agricultural sectors. While the current account deficit would shrink
significantly, debt service payments and the virtual absence of public sector access to
international capital markets would mean that an external financing gap of 2½ percent of
GDP would emerge in 2006, with reserves likely to be exhausted by mid-year.

20.
The staff team acknowledged that further policy adjustments would cause
substantial short-term output losses. However, the experience of other crises suggested
that the consequences of a disorderly exit from the peg would be even more painful.8
Moreover, with the reestablishment of confidence and creditworthiness and in light of a
continued positive outlook for exports, growth could recover to around 5 percent over the
medium term.
21.
The mission emphasized that a tight policy stance would have to be sustained
over the medium term to reduce external debt and vulnerabilities.9 Without further
adjustment, large financing gaps were likely to remain over the medium term. Therefore,
sizeable primary fiscal surpluses would be required to assist in achieving a sustainable
balance of payments, to reduce the risk of an abrupt loss of the peg, and to increase the
resilience of the economy to exogenous shocks.
22.
Debt sustainability analysis also illustrated the need for a continued and
sustained fiscal adjustment.10 Maintaining the fiscal primary surplus envisaged for 2005—
3 percent of GDP—in subsequent years would reduce the public debt ratio from around
100 percent of GDP at end-2004 to around 75 percent of GDP by 2010. With an additional
fiscal effort to increase the primary fiscal surplus to around 4 percent of GDP in 2007–10,
public debt could decline to around 70 percent by end-2010. Both scenarios were nonetheless
predicated on the authorities’ ability to close the substantial and recurring financing gaps that
were likely to emerge over the medium term.
23.
The staff team emphasized that substantial risks would remain under the
medium-term scenario. Achieving and sustaining a primary surplus for such an extended
period would not be easy, particularly in light of the social and political pressures that had
emerged in the past year. Moreover, the country would continue to be highly vulnerable to
exogenous shocks. In particular, Belize’s banana, citrus, and shrimp exports faced significant
price or output volatility, while the sugar and banana industries will have to cope with the
erosion of EU preferences beginning in 2006. Moreover, regional trade agreements such as
CAFTA would also weaken Belize’s relative competitiveness in U.S. markets. This
underscored the importance of achieving and maintaining a sustainable macroeconomic
framework and lowering levels of debt in order to restore a level of resilience to exogenous
shocks.

A staff review of 10 episodes of disorderly exits from fixed pegs in 1980–2004 showed that economies tended
to contract by an average of 4 percent in the year following the exit from the peg.

See also the chapter “Sources of Vulnerability” in the accompanying Selected Issues paper.

10

The need for a prolonged primary surplus is illustrated by the debt sustainability analysis. In a worst case
scenario, primary deficits of its historical average plus one standard deviation (around 6 percent of GDP) during
2006–10 would lead to an unsustainable increase in public debt to around 130 percent of GDP in 2010.

- 14 -

B. Fiscal Policy
24.
The authorities expected to be able to reduce the FY05/06 fiscal deficit to around
3½ percent of GDP. They acknowledged that this was less ambitious than the 3 percent
target set in late May, but noted that the shortfall was due to difficulties and delays in
implementing measures and additional spending commitments of about 0.6 percent of GDP.
They estimated that the May package, coupled with the January budget measures, would
reduce the primary deficit sharply by about BZ$75 million (around 3½ percent of GDP) from
its FY04/05 level. They also pointed out that the new package of measures had been
implemented in an atmosphere of greater social consensus and understanding for the need for
adjustment. They emphasized that the adjustment was based on measures that were already
enacted and implemented:
•

Revenue measures: These included mainly (i) an increase in various sales tax rates;
(ii) increases in the excise taxes on beer, alcoholic beverages, soft drinks, and tobacco
products; and (iii) the closure of loopholes affecting the collection of real estate
transactions taxes. These were expected to yield about 2.1 percent of GDP during
FY05/06 and an additional 0.2 percent of GDP in FY06/07.

•

Cuts in current outlays: A reduction in central government employment by at least
1½ percent during FY05/06 and a one-year freeze on wage increments was expected to
hold expenditure on wages and salaries constant at around 10 percent of GDP,
notwithstanding the 8 percent general wage increase in April 2005. 11 Cuts in outlays for
goods and services were projected to yield a total of 0.2 percent of GDP, but these were
more than offset by additional spending commitments of 0.6 percent of GDP for telecom
services and legal fees. The staff agreed with the authorities’ emphasis on protecting
social outlays by minimizing cuts in the areas of education and the provision of health
services.

•

Cuts in capital expenditure: Through a combination of project completions, extensions,
and cancellations, domestically funded capital expenditure was being reduced from
2.2 percent of GDP in FY04/05 to 2.1 percent of GDP in FY05/06, while foreign-funded
public investment projects were being reduced from 3.5 percent of GDP in FY04/05 to
2.2 percent of GDP in FY05/06.12

11

Civil service employment was reduced by 1½ percent by end-July; additional cuts are expected but not
included in the fiscal projections. Wages in the public sector were increased by 5–8 percent per year during
2003–05 (April 1). In addition, automatic wage increments of 3–5 percent are awarded in lieu of merit increases
on each civil servant’s annual contract anniversary. This latter increment has been frozen for 12 months starting
July 1, 2005.

12

The staff noted that domestically funded capital expenditure still included substantial elements that would
more accurately be classified as recurrent expenditure, e.g., regular transfers to statutory bodies. The authorities
noted that most recurrent expenditure elements would be reclassified in the FY06/07 budget exercise.

- 15 -

25.
The mission emphasized the need for additional fiscal measures. Meeting the
3 percent deficit target for FY05/06—which was critical for restoring the credibility of the
authorities after past shortfalls—would require an additional 1 percent of GDP adjustment.
The authorities’ efforts could be further undermined if the planned privatization of the
telecom company failed or if the DFC or BSSB required additional support. The team
warned, however, that the 3 percent fiscal deficit target would still leave a sizable balance of
payments financing gap and underscored the importance of maximizing the fiscal effort to
increase the room for maneuver to explore other avenues for closing the external gap.
Besides further cuts in current and capital spending—the team pointed to opportunities to
limit tax concessions through the elimination of the Export Processing Zone legislation and
to expand the sales tax base through the inclusion of electricity consumption.
26.
The authorities saw only limited scope for additional tightening. They argued that
a margin for unforeseen expenditure had been incorporated into the projections. While they
saw some scope for corrective measures if these contingencies proved insufficient, they
argued that there was little room for further adjustment given the severity of the measures
already taken and their contractionary impact on the economy. Looking forward to the
FY06/07 fiscal performance, they were confident that additional savings would derive from
the full-year effect of the measures being implemented, the introduction of a value-addedtype consumption tax, and the administrative improvements of budget procedures and tax
compliance.
27.
The mission urged the authorities to monitor closely the budget execution and
address shortfalls at an early stage. This would be especially important given the
precariousness of the balance of payments position and past policy slippages. The authorities
agreed and requested a continuation of the intense dialogue with Fund staff to monitor
budget implementation in order to ensure that deviations were detected and addressed early.
28.
The staff recommended a comprehensive review of revenue and expenditures. In
particular, there was a need to broaden the base by withdrawing tax holidays and exemptions
(including under Export Processing Zone legislation) that had been provided to the faster
growing segments of the economy. The recently completed study on the tax structure (which
was prepared with support from the IDB) had called for the introduction of a broad-based
value-added tax, and the mission welcomed the authorities’ request for technical assistance
to assist in its swift introduction. The team also recommended moving from a variable fuel
taxation that absorbed a large part of the international oil price volatility to a specific tax to
stabilize tax revenue (Box 2). In addition, the mission welcomed the ongoing Public
Expenditure Review, which would need to reconsider public service staffing, remuneration
levels, and a system of merit-based pay increases, and urged the authorities to act
expeditiously in reviewing and implementing its recommendations.

- 16 -

Box 2. Fuel Taxation
Variable fuel taxation and rising international oil prices have eroded fiscal revenue. The retail
prices for petroleum products are fixed by the government and tax revenue is therefore variable.
Retail prices have not been raised enough to provide a full pass through of the higher landed costs
since 2003; e.g., while the landed costs for premium gasoline increased by more than 60 percent
between end-2003 and mid-2005, the retail price was raised by only 16½ percent. This resulted in
the variable component of fuel taxation (revenue replacement duty, RRD) falling from 4 percent of
GDP in FY03/04 to a projected 3 percent of

This masks a fast growing consumption of
untaxed fuel in the Export Processing Zones (EPZ) and a corresponding erosion of the tax base. By
contrast, the annual taxed domestic consumption of premium gasoline has remained broadly stable
at about 31–32 million gallons, despite buoyant economic activity.
29.
The team called for a swift closure of the DFC and an orderly disposal of its
assets in line with the recommendations presented in a recently completed IDB study.
The corporation continued to make losses and was in no position to service its debt to the
central government, implying a fiscal revenue shortfall of close to 2 percent of GDP in
FY05/06. At the same time, the value of its physical assets and loan portfolio continued to
deteriorate. It would be important to minimize the government’s losses through a wellmanaged and transparent disposal of the DFC’s portfolio. The staff expressed concern that no
supervisory audit of the DFC had been completed to date.
30.
The authorities noted that several steps had already been taken to restructure
the DFC, but key policy elements were yet to be defined. A fundamental unresolved issue
was whether the DFC should be closed or whether it could remain in operation in some
limited form as a development bank (e.g., as a second-tier institution), with a focus on the
export sector and education.

- 17 -

C. Monetary Policy
31.
The team underscored the importance of a more stringent monetary policy
stance, especially in the absence of an additional fiscal effort. There were tentative signs
that the recent hikes in the cash reserve requirement and the shift of BSSB deposits to the
CBB had begun to take hold, as evidenced by the lower growth rate in credit to the private
sector. However, thus far this had not seemed to have affected money growth or domestic
interest rates, and it would be essential to reassess the policy stance on a continuous basis to
ensure the necessary slowdown in credit growth. The mission also suggested establishing
quarterly monetary targets through 2006 consistent with the authorities’ fiscal target and an
accumulation of net international reserves.
32.
The authorities agreed on the need to contain credit growth and reduce
pressures on the foreign exchange market. The CBB noted that private sector credit
growth was slowing, but conditions could be tightened further if necessary. Although interest
rates tended to be sticky in Belize and were not expected to move significantly in response to
changes in liquidity conditions, the officials expressed confidence that changes in cash
reserve requirements and shifts in public sector deposits from the commercial banking
system to the CBB were effective instruments for containing credit growth.
33.
The team stressed the importance of guarding against balance sheet
vulnerabilities, especially given the potential for pressures on the peg. Although
commercial banks’ balance sheets appeared relatively robust—given their limited foreign
currency positions and their limited exposure to public sector entities—credit risks could be
exacerbated as fiscal and monetary policies were tightened.13 For this reason, the team
encouraged the CBB to ensure that banks and other financial institutions adequately
accounted for their borrowers’ credit and exchange risks.
D. External Debt and Debt Service
34.
The staff noted that external debt had reached critical levels. With the external
debt/GDP ratio now at 80 percent, the costs of debt service was severely limiting budget
flexibility and was placing Belize’s foreign exchange reserves in jeopardy. The recent
refinancing operations had still left a sizable financing gap in 2006, and there was now also a
severe bunching of amortizations in the medium term.14 This suggested that, besides the
nearer term critical need for aggressive fiscal and monetary policy tightening, further efforts
would be required to improve debt management.

Issues paper.

- 18 -

35.
The authorities have announced their intention to seek debt service relief from
external creditors. In light of the residual financing gap in 2006, the authorities noted that
they would seek relief from debt servicing pressures after major adjustment measures were
firmly in place. They pointed out that they would not take unilateral action and emphasis
would be placed on seeking the voluntary consent and agreement of creditors, and that they
would be intent on a transparent process and equitable treatment of creditors. For this
purpose, they were in the process of engaging a reputable international financial advisor.
36.
The mission stressed the importance of a market-friendly approach. It would be
essential that creditors be approached in a coordinated manner to ensure the closing of the
financing gaps for the next several years. This would require developing a medium-term debt
strategy, strengthening of the existing debt database, and engaging of creditors quickly and
through appropriate channels.
E. Exchange System
37.
The authorities stressed their commitment to maintaining the exchange rate peg.
In their view, the peg had served as an effective anchor for confidence and inflation
expectations, while the strength of foreign direct investment and exports suggested that
Belize remained competitive (Box 3). Moreover, wage pressures in the private sector were
moderate as a result of labor migration from neighboring countries, and the business
community strongly favored the certainty provided by the peg.15 In the authorities’ view, the
fiscal and monetary policies that had recently been put in place, coupled with a cooperative
effort to reprofile external debt service, would be sufficient to sustain the peg.
38.
The mission agreed that the exchange rate peg had served the country well in the
past, and that devaluation would impose significant costs. Although balance sheet risks in
the banking sector appeared manageable due to the low level of foreign currency exposure,
devaluation would entail substantial costs due to large stock of dollar-denominated, external
public debt and the loss of the nominal anchor.16 However, the team strongly cautioned that
policies still did not seem to be in place to assure the peg’s sustainability.

paper.

Selected Issues paper.

- 19 -

Box 3. Competitiveness Issues
External competitiveness has not been a significant concern for Belize’s export and
tourism sectors. This reflects several factors:
•

Export volumes of the main commodities have increased by a weighted average of
58 percent during 1999–2004, particularly in the area of shrimp farming and citrus
production.

•

Growth in tourist arrivals has exceeded the average for the Caribbean region,
particularly in the area of cruise ship arrivals.

•

The real effective exchange rate has depreciated slightly over the last 10 years,
while neighboring countries have not gained competitiveness.

•

Real wages in the private sector have grown only moderately and have remained
about constant relative to the U.S. manufacturing sector over the last 10 years.

However, some industries have been adversely affected by declining terms of
trade. The export unit prices of the main export commodities (shrimp, bananas, citrus)
have fallen, in some cases sharply. In addition, the exchange rates of some important
competitor countries (especially for citrus and shrimp) depreciated in real terms vis-àvis the U.S. dollar during the last five years. Finally, the loss of preferential market
access for sugar in the EU is projected to reduce Belize’s export revenue by about
1 percent of GDP by 2010.

39.
The mission welcomed the authorities’ decision to close the cambios in July 2005.
As the team had stressed in last year’s consultation, the foreign exchange houses (cambios)
appeared to be engaged in unrecorded foreign exchange transactions and were poorly
controlled and supervised. Moreover, the fact that the cambios could trade at rates that
differed by more than 2 percent from the official rate, coupled with the rationing of foreign
exchange by the central bank gave rise to a multiple currency practice and to an exchange
restriction. The central bank reported that it had not engaged in selective sales or rationing of
foreign exchange to the private sector since late-2004, that there was no unsatisfied demand
for foreign exchange from commercial banks, and that the parallel foreign exchange market
was neither legal nor tolerated.
F. Structural Policies
40.
The authorities agreed that there was a need for sustained improvements in
competitiveness, as well as efforts to attract foreign direct investment and diversify the
export base. In this context, they noted donor-funded projects in the banana sector and
improvements in the operations and marketing in the sugar industry, and were of the view
that these efforts had left the sectors well positioned to cope with the loss of preferential

- 20 -

access, compared with other ACP countries. They also pointed to the ongoing projects aimed
at reducing the country’s dependency on electricity imports through the construction of the
Chalillo hydroelectric and the bagasse co-generation power plants. Finally, they highlighted
the efforts to improve the attractiveness of Belize as a tourism destination through the
construction of a new cruise-ship terminal in Belize City and improvements in the city’s
transport infrastructure.
41.
The team cautioned that Belize’s trade regime remains somewhat restrictive and
nontariff barriers are pervasive. Belize has implemented the CARICOM tariff schedule
and has an average tariff of around 11 percent, but nontariff barriers such as nonautomatic
licensing requirements cover 30 groups of mainly agricultural goods. Recent policy actions
had increased the goods subjected to protectionist nonautomatic licensing, such as soft
drinks, or minimum pricing, such as beer. However, the authorities did not agree with the
staff’s assessment that import restrictions should be phased out in favor of tariffs with a view
to improving resource allocation and widening the tax base, citing food security concerns,
smuggling, and the possibility of severe price volatility.
42.
The team noted that questions about governance and transparency had
undermined the authorities’ ability to build social consensus on the need for
adjustment. The concerns centered on the widespread use of discretionary and unpublished
tax concessions, allegations of financial misconduct surrounding various financial
institutions and telecom companies, and limited transparency in the management of foreign
debt or the privatization and management of public enterprises.
43.
The authorities acknowledged these concerns and stressed that steps had been
taken to address them. The government drafted the Finance and Audit Act (FAA), which
was adopted by the National Assembly in early 2005 and was requiring a substantially larger
degree of transparency in government financial transactions and parliamentary scrutiny. In
addition, the government and the Senate had instituted two inquiry commissions to review
the propriety of the operations of the DFC and the BSSB, in particular their financial
transactions with private investors or external creditors.
44.
Efforts are underway to improve the supervision of both onshore and offshore
financial institutions. Steps to improve banking supervision have continued with the support
of a long-term advisor from the Fund and technical assistance from the IDB. The staff
cautioned, however, that the central bank’s supervisory department appeared to lack
independence, that supervision of the various financial entities remained fragmented, and
that credit unions and the DFC were not effectively regulated or supervised.
45.
While the quality of data is generally adequate for surveillance purposes, there
is scope for improvement. The mission recommended the establishment of a set of high
frequency indicators to monitor developments on a timely basis, strengthening the coverage
and timeliness of some monetary statistics, in particular, and welcomed the authorities’
interest in participating in the GDDS.

- 21 -

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
46.
Over the past years, Belize’s fiscal and external current account deficits have
remained at unsustainable levels. The severe imbalances have led to a substantial increase
in public debt and an erosion of domestic and international confidence. A large external
financing gap is likely to emerge in 2006 and access to significant new external financing
appears unlikely, as evidenced by of the large risk spread and recent downgrades of Belize’s
creditworthiness by international ratings agencies. A strong, frontloaded, and sustained
adjustment effort is therefore needed to avoid the risk of a disorderly exit from the peg.
47.
The authorities have begun to tighten the fiscal and monetary policy stance, but
further measures appear necessary. Earlier problems with the passage of the FY05/06
budget, delays in implementing further adjustment measures, and new spending
commitments suggest that the original budget target for this fiscal year cannot be achieved
and that a sizable external financing gap will still emerge in 2006. The authorities have
appropriately sought to minimize cuts in social services, lessen the impact on the more
vulnerable segments of society, and to build a social and political consensus in favor of
adjustment. However, if the pegged exchange rate is to be sustained, the challenge remains to
tighten domestic demand sufficiently, restore confidence and creditworthiness, and address
the impending financing gaps.
48.
A comprehensive review of revenue and expenditure is needed to identify
measures to support consolidation. Thus far, revenue measures have mainly involved rate
hikes, and the main growth sectors in the economy continue to benefit from generous tax
holidays and exemptions. Reducing these preferences would broaden the tax base and assist
in consolidation, while improving the buoyancy of the system. On the expenditure front, the
decision to reduce domestically financed capital expenditure, curtail expenditure on goods
and services, and postpone further salary increases and reduce staffing was appropriate, but
further expenditure cuts appear to be needed to forestall the risk of a crisis.
49.
The state-owned DFC should be closed immediately. The DFC remains a heavy
burden on the public sector and its asset base continues to deteriorate. The authorities are
encouraged to seek technical assistance to deal expeditiously with the closure and orderly
liquidation of the DFC to halt further losses, and put in place a transparent and well-managed
mechanism to dispose of its portfolio.
50.
Monetary policy needs to be tightened until stronger fiscal measures take hold.
Recent monetary policy measures have begun to have some effect, as evidenced by the lower
growth rate in credit to the private sector. However, especially in the absence of further fiscal
adjustment, a more stringent tightening of liquidity conditions is needed to prevent a critical
loss of net international reserves and disorderly exit from the exchange rate peg.

- 22 -

51.
Debt service on public and publicly guaranteed debt will continue to be a
significant threat to the balance of payments and the exchange rate peg. Besides the
more immediate danger to Belize’s external reserve position in 2006, the debt profile
suggests a severe bunching of amortization payments over the medium term. Against this
background, the authorities have announced their intention to approach external creditors to
seek relief of debt service in 2006. In this context, it will be important to act expeditiously
and in a transparent and market-friendly manner, and to establish a more effective ongoing
dialogue with creditors within the framework of a medium-term debt strategy.
52.
Although the exchange rate peg has served the country well, its sustainability
depends on appropriate policies and continued efforts to improve competitiveness. To
be sure, growth of exports and foreign direct investment has been robust, but the projected
loss of preferential market access in the European Union and strong competition in the
tourism sector in the region suggest a risk that competitiveness may erode.
53.
Belize does not maintain exchange restrictions or multiple currency practices.
The staff welcomes the closure of the cambios and thereby the elimination of a multiple
currency practice, and notes that the central bank has not engaged in selective sales of
foreign exchange, that there is no unsatisfied demand for foreign exchange from commercial
banks, and that the parallel foreign exchange market is neither legal nor tolerated.
54.
Belize maintains non-tariff barriers and tax and duty exemptions that contribute
to a misallocation of resources. The staff recommends that import restrictions be phased out
in favor of tariffs and excises with a view to improving resource allocation and widening the
tax base.
55.
A lack of transparency and weak governance remain a concern. These shortfalls
have been evident within public financial institutions, tax policy, and with regard to the
management of Belize’s external debt, and have undermined domestic and international
confidence in recent years. Welcome decisions have been made to pass fiscal transparency
legislation and establish inquiry commissions into the DFC and the Social Security Board
and it will be important to persevere in these efforts.
56.
Belize’s statistical information is adequate to monitor macroeconomic
developments. The staff recommends the establishment of a set of high frequency indicators
to monitor developments on a timely basis. The staff also notes the authorities’ continued
efforts to improve the statistical base and welcomes their interest in receiving technical
assistance to participate in the GDDS.
57.
The next Article IV consultation is expected to be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

II. Stress Tests for Public Debt Ratio

1/ Refers to gross public and publicly guaranteed debt. The external debt sustainability table is not provided because data on external debt by household and corporate sectors are not available for Belize.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
8/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
9/ GDP growth is at historical average minus one standard deviation and primary deficit is at historical average plus one standard deviation for 2006-2010.
10/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).
11/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

BELIZE: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of June 30, 2005)
I. Projects
A five year Country Assistance Strategy was completed for Belize in August 2000 (Report
No. 20708-BEL), which identified only modest project assistance. The World Bank currently
has two active projects in Belize: one loan with net commitments of approximately US$13
million, and a Community-Managed Sarastoon-Temash Conservation Project for $0.8
million financed with grant funds from the Global Environmental Facility.
The loan finances a Roads and Municipal Drainage Project designed to rehabilitate or
construct drainage infrastructure in six municipalities to reduce flooding caused by
hurricanes, provide institutional strengthening of services to relevant ministries, and support
the formation of a Transport and Road Safety Strategy.

III. Economic and Sector Work
The new 2004–08 IDB-Country Strategy with Belize, approved in September 2004, aims at
assisting the country in its transition towards private sector-led growth. Accordingly, the
Bank’s strategy will focus on one major objective: “support private sector-led growth” by
financing interventions oriented to (i) improving the public sector’s institutional capacity to
foster an enabling environment for private sector development; (ii) supporting private sector
capacity-building and specific initiatives. Sustainable economic growth and poverty
reduction are considered the overarching goals of the Strategy.
From 1998 to 2005, the Bank approved seven operations for a total of US$ 91.8 million.
There were no loan approvals during 2002–04. However, the Bank has been very active in
supporting Belize through technical cooperation projects. For 2005, the pipeline has a $20
million Policy Based Loan to support the public sector’s financial management, as well as
two major Multilateral Investment Fund operations: one in airport security and the other
related to competitiveness of micro and small enterprises in cruise ship tourism, both
operations totaling US$ 1.2 million. In addition, the Bank has provided technical assistance
for the resolution process of the Development Finance Corporation as well as in the public
expenditure review and the diagnostic of the current tax regime. The Bank has also
expressed its willingness to provide technical assistance to the GoB in key areas such as tax
revenue collection, customs control and institutional strengthening to the Central Statistical
Office.

III. Economic and Sector Work
Much of CDB’s country and sector work in Belize since 2003 has focused on helping the
authorities to address significant macroeconomic and fiscal imbalances, and to address
sustainability issues in the operations of the Development Finance Corporation. This has
resulted in a slower rate of loan approvals, although appraisal work is currently ongoing on
two infrastructure project proposals. Activity levels on CDB’s main direct poverty reduction
program, the Basic Needs Trust Fund, has been maintained, and activity levels are expected
to rise somewhat following the expected replenishment of the CDB’s concessional resources
later in 2005.
The Belize authorities have indicated that significant effort is underway to address the
difficult fiscal and debt consequences that have resulted from the expansionary policies of
recent years; and the CDB proposes to prepare a new intervention strategy for Belize during
the second half of 2006.

- 37 -

APPENDIX V

BELIZE: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Outstanding statistical issues
In general, the quality, coverage, and timeliness of Belize’s statistical information permit an
adequate monitoring of economic developments. However, there are shortcomings in
national accounts, prices, external trade and debt, government finance, and labor statistics.
The authorities have indicated that they would be interested in receiving technical assistance
in all these areas. The Central Bank of Belize publishes, in irregular intervals, a quarterly
bulletin covering developments in the real, fiscal, monetary, and external sectors, as well as
an annual report and a statistical digest. The authorities have expressed an interest in
participating in the GDDS and have begun drafting metadata for submission to STA.
Real sector
A new national accounts system has been phased-in. Under the new system, national
accounts at constant and current prices are produced quarterly, instead of just annually. The
base year for the compilation of national accounts has moved from 1984 to 2000, with
consequent quality improvement of estimates at constant and current prices. The CPI market
basket is based on a household expenditure survey conducted from June 1990 through March
1991 and needs to be updated. Also, the CPI is calculated only four times a year (February,
May, August, and November), with a lag of about three months. Labor market statistics are
scant and available at irregular intervals.
Fiscal accounts
Classification of expenditure into current and capital does not conform to international
standards. The resumption of reporting annual data for the Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook and sub-annual data for the International Financial statistics is highly
recommended. The most recently reported annual data were for 1997.
Monetary accounts
Monetary data are reported to STA and WHD on a timely fashion. Recently, the authorities
implemented the STA’s Standardized Report Forms and for the first time reported data
through January 2005 in this format. However, the coverage of monetary data is incomplete
as it includes only the accounts of the central bank and commercial banks; other depository
corporations, including credit unions are not included. Contrary to methodological
recommendations, interest accruals are included in other assets or other liabilities, rather than
being classified along with the underlying instruments. In addition, unclassified assets and
liabilities are large.

Balance of payments
The compilation of Belize’s balance of payments is based on the fifth edition of the Balance
of Payments Manual (BPM5). Belize completed the transition to the BPM5 in 2004. In
addition, the authorities are refining the process for collecting relevant data that will enable
the presentation of quarterly balance of payments statistics. As for the coverage, currentness
and reporting of data for publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS) and in the
Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook (BOPSY), Belize has reported annual data on
balance of payments statistics albeit with some lags. Belize does not compile International
Investment Position (IIP) Statistics.
External debt
There are discrepancies between the data reported by the central bank and those reported by
the ministry of finance, particularly with respect to gross external disbursements of the
central government. In addition, the data reported by the central bank and the ministry of
finance on the external debt of the public enterprises are incomplete and inconsistent with the
information provided by the public enterprises. The authorities are seeking to reduce the
discrepancies and inconsistencies by fostering greater cooperation among the agencies
involved.
Development Finance Corporation
The accounts of the DFC, which is a major instrument of the government’s economic policy,
are not well integrated into monetary or fiscal accounts.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
September 19, 2005
This note provides additional information on recent developments in Belize since the
issuance of the staff report. The statement does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
•

The economy continued to grow at an annual pace of around 4½ percent during
the first half of 2005. The economy’s strength reflects buoyancy in the tourism as
well as wholesale and retail trade sectors.

•

Headline inflation has risen. Year-on-year CPI inflation increased from 3.0 percent
at end-2004 to 3.7 percent in May 2005, driven mainly by higher costs for energy and
transportation.

•

Fiscal adjustment has fallen somewhat short of the authorities’ goal. Preliminary
data suggest that the deficit for the central government during the first fiscal quarter
(April–June) was 1.6 percent of GDP, or 0.3 percent larger than planned. The
shortfall reflected lower revenues and grants, as well as higher current expenditure,
than initially projected.

•

The authorities plan to introduce a VAT-type tax by April 1, 2006. CARTAC has
taken the lead in coordinating technical assistance in this regard, including from the
Fund, IDB, and DFID. A mission from LEG is visiting Belize during September 19-23, 2005 to assist in preparations.

•

The government recently decided to re-nationalize the water company. This
company had been privatized four years ago, and after years of legal disputes, the
government agreed to repurchase a controlling majority for about the same price it
sold it in 2001 (roughly equivalent to 2 percent of GDP). The purchase was financed
through loans from the foreign owner and from Taiwan, Province of China. Although
the authorities have indicated their intention to re-privatize the company as soon as
possible, the decision and the additional debt it implies have exacerbated staff
concerns regarding debt sustainability.

•

The authorities are continuing efforts to improve the statistical base. In
September, the authorities started publishing monthly fiscal reports, which are
accessible to the general public via the websites of the central bank and the ministry
of finance. Efforts are also well underway to participate in the GDDS, and STA is
reviewing metadata submitted by the authorities.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation
with Belize
On September 14, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Belize.1
Background
The Belizean economy grew by 4½ percent in 2004, mainly reflecting strong
performance in the agriculture, fisheries, and tourism sectors. Inflation remained
subdued at around 3 percent.
The overall fiscal deficit of the central government, however, widened to 8¾ percent of
GDP in FY04/05 (April to March), from about 8⅓ percent of GDP in the previous year.
The deficit was significantly larger than the authorities’ target of 2¾ percent of GDP,
with noninterest current expenditure exceeding budgeted levels by some 3 percent of
GDP and substantial overruns in interest payments, mainly related to high costs of
borrowing that reflected the sharp deterioration in Belize’s external creditworthiness.
Public finances were also burdened by the weak position of the Development Finance
Corporation (DFC).

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions
with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and
financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments
and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the
basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive
Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.

-2-

The balance of payment remained under significant pressure. Although the external
current account deficit narrowed somewhat in 2004—to 18 percent of GDP from an
average of 22 percent of GDP during 2001–03—it remained unsustainably high.
Lower net loan disbursements in 2004 more than offset a marginal increase in capital
inflows to finance investment projects, causing the capital account surplus to erode,
and gross international reserves fell sharply. More recently, notwithstanding the
authorities’ success in refinancing several large debts with external commercial
creditors, Belize’s access to international capital markets has become more difficult,
with marked reductions in assessments by rating agencies.
In response to growing pressure on the reserves of the central bank and increasing
concerns regarding the risks to the balance of payments, the authorities announced in
May a major adjustment program. This included fiscal measures aimed at reducing the
FY05/06 deficit to less than 4 percent of GDP, mainly through tax increases and a
curtailment of capital expenditure and civil service employment. In addition, the Central
Bank of Belize tightened monetary policy to contain credit expansion.
Executive Board Assessment
While Directors welcomed Belize’s low inflationary environment and continued strong
growth performance, which reflect the robust expansion in the tourism, fisheries,
and agricultural sectors, they expressed concern that Belize’s fiscal and external current
account deficits remain unsustainably high, resulting in substantial increases in the
external public debt and a serious erosion of domestic and international confidence.
Directors underscored the urgency of addressing these imbalances to safeguard the
country’s international reserves and ensure the sustainability of the pegged exchange
rate system. They encouraged the authorities to mount a campaign to educate the
public on the benefits of reform and the growing risks of inaction.
Directors welcomed the steps taken earlier this year to tighten fiscal and monetary
policies, but were concerned that implementation delays and the emergence of new
expenditure commitments would make it difficult to meet the authorities’ fiscal targets for
fiscal year 2005/06. Moreover, even if these targets are met, a significant external
financing gap is still likely to emerge in 2006. Against this background, Directors called
for greater efforts to reduce domestic demand, close the remaining financing gap,
and restore confidence and Belize’s creditworthiness.
Directors therefore urged the adoption of additional measures to boost fiscal revenue
and rein in expenditure. They called for a reduction in tax holidays and exemptions to
broaden the tax base and increase tax buoyancy. They encouraged the early
introduction of a value added tax and the adoption of measures to ensure the passthrough of international oil price changes to domestic petroleum prices. Directors
suggested that further expenditure cuts be explored in the areas of goods and services
and capital spending, excluding essential social services.

-3-

Directors commended the authorities’ efforts to improve governance and transparency,
including the passage of fiscal transparency legislation and the decision to establish
commissions of inquiry into the Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and the Social
Security Board.
Directors welcomed the recent monetary policy measures aimed at tightening domestic
liquidity conditions. They encouraged the authorities to monitor domestic liquidity closely
and further tighten monetary conditions to support the balance of payments until an
additional fiscal effort takes hold.
Directors welcomed the steps taken to improve financial supervision and prudential
regulation, including extension of supervisory coverage to the DFC. However,
they expressed concern with the lack of progress in resolving the DFC, which continues
to be a drain on the public finances as a result of its deteriorating asset base. In order to
stem further losses, Directors urged the authorities to halt operations of the DFC
immediately and dispose of its assets in a transparent and orderly manner.
Directors also emphasized the need to monitor actively commercial bank balance sheet
vulnerabilities in light of rapid growth in credit to the private sector.
Directors noted that the balance of payments has come under increased strain as a
result of adverse terms of trade shocks, including the rise in world oil prices.
These shocks have compounded the severe pressures stemming from Belize’s external
debt service obligations. Directors agreed that in these circumstances the authorities’
intention to approach external creditors to seek debt service relief is appropriate.
However, Directors underlined the importance of engaging with external creditors in a
transparent and equitable manner, and within the framework of a credible medium-term
debt strategy. In this regard, a few Directors considered that a Fund-supported program
would underpin Belize’s efforts to bolster confidence and secure an agreement with
external creditors. Directors also called for a strengthening of the debt database to help
improve debt management.
Directors welcomed the unification of the foreign exchange market through the closure
of the “cambios”. They noted that Belize does not maintain exchange restrictions or
multiple currency practices. However, Belize maintains non-tariff barriers and tax and
duty exemptions that contribute to a misallocation of resources. Directors encouraged
the authorities to phase out import restrictions in favor of tariffs and excises, noting that
this will also strengthen revenue collection.

-4-

Directors commended the authorities for recent improvements in the quality and
timeliness of publication of statistical information, and supported the authorities’ request
for technical assistance to facilitate participation in the General Data Dissemination
System.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
