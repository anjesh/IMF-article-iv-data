October 4, 2004

Discussions. A staff team comprising A. Furtado (Head), C. Francis, P. Kufa, S. Rizavi, S. Eble, and
M. Williams (all WHD) held discussions in Port-of-Spain during July 19–30, 2004. The mission met
with Governor Ewart Williams, Mr. Conrad Enill (Minister in the Ministry of Finance), other
ministers and senior officials, representatives of the private sector and labor unions, and the
opposition party. Mr. Charles de Silva (OED) attended the policy discussions.
Key developments and policy issues. Led by the energy sector, real growth in 2003 picked up
sharply. Higher energy-based receipts have contributed to a sizable budget surplus, a marked
improvement in the finances of the energy-based public enterprises, and a strong external current
account position. Nonetheless, the unemployment rate remains at about 10 percent. Monetary policy
has been conducted in the context of a tightly managed exchange rate. Staff emphasized the need to
ensure continued fiscal surplus positions during the energy boom, contain the growth of the wage bill,
increase the efficiency of government capital expenditure, reform the public enterprise sector, and
prudently manage the monetary impact associated with large energy-related external inflows. In view
of the exchange rate policy stance, structural reforms take on added importance in fostering
competitiveness in the non-energy sectors.
Last Article IV consultation. At its conclusion on June 23, 2003, Directors viewed the effective use
of prospective higher energy revenues as key to Trinidad and Tobago’s future development. They
recommended targeting overall budget surpluses, urging the authorities to improve the tax system and
strengthen public expenditure and fiscal management. They emphasized reinvigorating structural
reforms, particularly in the areas of pensions, privatization, and financial sector supervision.
Exchange system. Trinidad and Tobago has accepted the obligations of Article VIII. It maintains an
exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions (see Appendix I on Fund relations; relations with other international financial institutions
are summarized in Appendices II and III).

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

Trinidad and Tobago’s economy is experiencing a strong energy sector-based
expansion due to increased output and high international prices. The fiscal and
external current accounts have recorded large surpluses, in the context of low
inflation and a stable exchange rate. Intermediation of energy-related resources has
strengthened Trinidad and Tobago’s position as an important source of funds in the
Caribbean region. Despite a decade of rapid growth, unemployment remains high.

•

The discussions focused on policies for enhancing the prospects for sustainable
growth and employment creation in the non-energy sector. A key policy
requirement is prudent fiscal management, which should be supported by a
monetary/exchange rate policy mix that contains the underlying pressures toward real
appreciation of the currency. Macroeconomic policy should be underpinned by
accelerated structural reforms aimed directly at enhancing competitiveness of the
non-energy sector.

•

The budget surplus is estimated at 3 percent of GDP in FY 2003/04 and—given
the outlook for continued strong energy-based revenues—this should be followed
by further sizable surpluses over the medium term. Net public sector debt is
projected to decline substantially to below 15 percent of GDP by 2009. The mission
emphasized that maintaining budget surpluses was also required for long-term
sustainability of the use of energy resources. The authorities agreed to pursue a
prudent fiscal policy stance in the context of a broad fiscal reform agenda, including
tax reforms.

•

High unemployment and slow growth in non-energy exports raise concerns
about competitiveness and the appropriateness of the level of the exchange rate.
However, greater exchange rate flexibility at this time would lead to an appreciation,
so that competitiveness issues needs to be addressed through well-targeted structural
reforms as well as prudent fiscal policy. Reforms could include measures to address
supply-side constraints, in transportation and telecommunications, as well as public
sector and financial sector reforms. The staff, on balance, supports the authorities’
decision to maintain the exchange rate at its current level, in view of the underlying
pressures toward currency appreciation, and agrees with their emphasis on structural
reforms.

•

The country’s large energy resources and the expanding regional role of its
financial sector reinforce the need for institutional strengthening. In the context
of ongoing related reforms to enhance fiscal transparency and the regulatory and
supervisory framework of the financial system, the authorities have indicated their
willingness to participate in a fiscal ROSC, and have requested an FSAP for 2005.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Trinidad and Tobago’s economy, which is endowed with large energy reserves,
is experiencing a strong energy sector-based expansion due to increased output and
high international prices. The energy sector already accounts for about 40 percent of GDP,
83 percent of domestic goods exports, and slightly more than 40 percent of government
revenue. Large increases in oil and gas output expected over the next decade will reinforce its
central role. As in other energy-rich countries, while energy exports greatly reduce domestic
and external resource constraints, they pose their own macroeconomic and governancerelated challenges—in particular, for employment creation, poverty reduction, and fiscal
transparency.
2.
Over the past decade, rapid growth rates have been achieved in the context of
low inflation. Real growth averaged about 6 percent per year, inflation was contained in the
low single digits, and the nominal exchange rate remained stable. While fiscal balance has
been broadly maintained, substantial monetary injections have taken place, associated with
external current account surpluses. However, the central bank—a key participant in the
foreign exchange market given the high share of budgetary revenue based on energy
exports—has sterilized much of the fiscal impact through sales of foreign exchange,
including for substantial investments in the region by Trinidadian financial institutions. This
intermediation of energy-related resources has strengthened Trinidad and Tobago’s position
as an important source of funds in the Caribbean region.
3.
Despite Trinidad and Tobago’s considerable energy wealth, social and ethnic
problems remain, and the political balance continues to be delicate. The People’s
National Movement government was elected in October 2002 for a five-year term, and
political tensions associated with ethnic factors continue to complicate policymaking. While
per capita income is relatively high by regional standards (almost US$8,400), serious poverty
and unemployment remain (21 percent and 10½ percent, respectively). The government’s
strategy is to use increases in energy revenue to address these issues and bring the country to
developed status by 2020.1
4.
The Fund’s policy advice in recent years has focused on reducing the
dependency of the budget on energy-related revenues, strengthening the financial
system, and enhancing the competitiveness of the non-energy sector. However, progress
in these areas has been slow, reflecting political factors and the renewed energy boom, that
has eased pressures to take upfront reform measures.

The United Nations Human Development Index ranked Trinidad and Tobago 54th among
174 countries in 2003, below Barbados and St. Kitts and Nevis, but above all other Caribbean
countries.

II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
5.
Real GDP growth picked up sharply in 2003, driven mainly by an expansion in
the energy sector, in the context of persistent high unemployment and continued low
inflation. Real GDP grew by 13 percent, led by a 30 percent expansion in the energy sector
(Table 1 and Figure 1). This was due to a surge in liquid natural gas (LNG) production as the
third LNG plant started operations in April 2003, as well as to increases in the output of
crude oil and petrochemicals. The performance of non-energy sectors was mixed: while there
was a strong expansion in manufacturing, construction, and financial services, the
agricultural sector declined by some 14 percent. Despite strong growth, the unemployment
rate remained unchanged at about 10 ½ percent.2 To some extent, this reflected an increase
in the labor participation rate; job growth continued at a reasonable pace. However,
unemployment has also been kept high by a number of structural factors, which have led to a
low labor intensity of growth. These factors include the high capital intensity of the energy
sector, skills mismatches, labor market rigidities which reduce wage flexibility, and the
impact of energy-related inflows on the real exchange rate. While average consumer price
inflation has been close to 4 percent, core inflation (which excludes food price increases) has
been about 2 percent.
6.
The central government accounts shifted to surplus in FY 2002/03, on the
strength of energy-based revenue growth. The budget recorded an overall surplus of
2 percent of GDP, compared with a deficit of about ½ percent of GDP in the preceding fiscal
year (Table 2). While energy-based revenue increased sharply, the growth in non-energy
taxes was modest, partly reflecting payment of outstanding VAT refunds. Government
spending increased only marginally, mostly on account of higher transfers and subsidies, and
capital expenditure and net lending. Wage increases were kept broadly in line with inflation.
The budget surplus contributed to a decline in central government debt (to 33 percent of GDP
as of September 2003) and a buildup of balances at the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago
(CBTT).
7.
The overall balance of the consolidated nonfinancial public sector (NFPS)
improved sharply in FY 2002/03, although deficits remain in some entities. The NFPS
shifted from a deficit of about 4 percent of GDP in FY 2001/02 to a surplus of 2 percent of
GDP in FY 2002/03 (Table 3). The turnaround reflected the marked improvement in the
finances of the state-owned energy companies due to strong product prices and, in the case of
gas, increased output. While most of the energy-related companies, and the
telecommunication company, had operating surpluses, a number of enterprises continued to
record deficits—in particular, the fuel distribution company and the water utility, whose
2

The unemployment rate used in this report corresponds to an extended definition based on a
relaxed “seeking work” criterion deemed to be the appropriate one for Trinidad and Tobago’s
labor market. Under the standard ILO definition, the unemployment rate would stand at
7½ percent. Labor market developments are discussed in Chapter II of the accompanying
Selected Issues Paper.

tariffs have not kept pace with costs, and the sugar company, which incurred large severance
payments related to its restructuring (Box 1). Public sector debt declined by about
4 percentage points of GDP, to 56 percent of GDP as of end-September 2003.
8.
The central bank continued to maintain a stable exchange rate against the
U.S. dollar, which—given the large energy-related inflows—was consistent with a
reduction in the policy interest rate and some further build up in international reserves.
The exchange rate has remained within a narrow band around TT$6.3 per U.S. dollar—a
virtually unchanged level since late 1997—and international reserves have accumulated
moderately over the last two years (Table 4). The CBTT lowered the benchmark repo rate by
25 basis points in September 2003, to 5 percent, which was intended to stimulate growth in
the non-energy sector. To improve financial intermediation and level the playing field
between banks and non-banks, the CBTT lowered the reserve requirement, from 18 percent
to 14 percent, in October 2003.3 These measures have contributed to a significant reduction
in commercial bank lending rates,4 and an increase in credit to the private sector (Table 5).
9.
The balance of payments recorded an increased surplus in 2003, despite large
capital outflows, reflecting the strong performance of the energy sector. The external
current account recorded an unprecedented surplus of 13 per cent of GDP, compared to
approximate balance in 2002 (Table 6). The sharp increase in gas output, combined with an
upswing in international oil and gas prices, resulted in a boom in total export earnings, which
rose by 13 percentage points of GDP, despite a decline in manufacturing exports. The capital
account recorded a deficit equivalent to 10 percent of GDP in the context of sizable bond
issues by regional governments and corporations, and outward foreign direct investments.
Direct investment inflows rose in the context of major energy-related investment projects. At
the end of the year, gross official reserves stood at US$2.3 billion, equivalent to 5 months of
imports. Public sector external debt declined by 3 percentage points of GDP, to about
15 percent of GDP at end 2003, most of which long-term and from commercial creditors.
10.
Since August 2002, the Trinidad and Tobago dollar has depreciated by 9 percent
in real effective terms (Figure 2). This movement reflected mainly the fall in the value the
U.S. dollar, to which the currency has been effectively pegged, against the currencies of
Trinidad and Tobago’s major trading partners, and in particular the euro. Nonetheless, the
REER remains some 15 percent above its 1997 level.

3

This measure was part of a phased reduction of reserve requirements aimed at reducing
them to 9 percent by mid-2005. The central bank further reduced the reserve requirement to
11 percent, effective September 15, 2004. The monetary impact of these measures has been
sterilized by special issues of government securities.

4

The prime lending rate declined by 200 basis points to 9.5 percent, with a further decline to
8.75 percent following the recent reduction in reserve requirements.

Box 1: Trinidad and Tobago: Restructuring of the State-Owned Sugar Company
In 2003, the government profoundly restructured and downsized the state-owned sugar
company CARONI to eliminate the huge drain on fiscal resources. The company was
incurring a loss of some 1 percent of GDP on an annual basis (exceeding its employment
costs of 0.8 percent of GDP), and had accumulated debt of 6 percent of GDP at end-2003,
which will continue to be serviced by the government following the restructuring.
The main elements of the restructuring plan were:
•

Closure of all of CARONI’s sugar cane production activity, including separation of
all its 9,000 employees, and creation of a new company, the Sugar Manufacturing
Company Limited (SMCL), which is now responsible for sugar manufacturing.

•

Return of all CARONI lands to the state for the establishment of heavy and light
manufacturing estates, agricultural estates, housing projects and commercial
complexes designed to stimulate new economic activity.

The government’s role in the sugar sector is now reduced to sugar manufacturing only.
The government now operates only one sugar manufacturing factory (compared to two
before restructuring). SMCL has cut sugar processing from 160,000 tons to 75,000 tons,
reduced its production costs, including through reduction in the labor force from 2,000 to
1,300, and is purchasing all its cane from private farmers at market prices. Continued
government involvement in this specific area was considered important from a socioeconomic viewpoint, since sugar production continues to be a major source of private
employment, particularly in rural areas, and the main user of agricultural land. Also, the new
operation should be financially viable, since the lower sugar output would be mainly sold
within the quota system to the high priced EU market.
To mitigate the social impact of the restructuring, a comprehensive separation package,
VSEP, was put in place. This included severance payments of 1–2 years of annual salary
(total cost TT$724 illion in 2003), retraining programs, and the leasing of land to former
CARONI employees for housing and agricultural purposes.
The restructuring is expected to generate the following benefits:
•

Removal of the drain on the budget over the next years.

•

Improved capacity of the sugar industry to compete in the global market.

•

Better position to further restructure the sector in light of the anticipated phasing out
of the EU preferential treatment in 2006.

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
11.
The discussions focused on policies to assure the prudent use of Trinidad and
Tobago’s energy resources and enhance the prospects for sustainable growth and
employment creation in the non-energy sector. While projected rises in energy output in
coming years are expected to sustain growth at high levels, and support strong fiscal and
external positions, employment creation may remain limited in view of the capital intensity
of the energy sector. Accordingly, an improvement in the social indicators will require a
policy framework that promotes economic diversification and growth in the non-energy
sector. A key element of such a framework is prudent fiscal management, which also
provides for long-term sustainability of the use of energy resources. This should be supported
by a monetary/exchange rate policy mix that contains the underlying pressures toward real
appreciation of the currency. Given these pressures, appropriate macroeconomic policies
should be accompanied by structural reforms aimed directly at enhancing competitiveness of
the non-energy sector.
A. Fiscal Policy
12.
The discussions covered the fiscal situation in FY 2003/04, the outlook for the
coming budget and the medium term, and the long-term sustainability of the use of
energy resources. The budget is expected to record a surplus of 3 percent of GDP in
FY 2003/04 and—given the strength of projected energy-based revenues—this should be
followed by continued substantial surpluses over the medium term, provided that expenditure
growth remains somewhat below GDP growth. While the authorities were still at an early
stage in the preparation of the FY 2004/05 budget (to be submitted to parliament in early
October), they indicated that the expenditure envelope assumed by the mission was broadly
realistic and agreed that it was consistent with sizable budget surpluses over the medium term
given the energy sector outlook. For 2004/05, as in previous years, the budget will be based
on a conservative oil price assumption, implying lower revenues estimates and,
correspondingly, a lower surplus than projected by the mission on the basis of WEO prices.
The mission emphasized that maintaining budget surpluses was required for long-term
sustainability of the use of energy resources, and that the assumed expenditure envelope
would also contribute to limiting pressures toward real appreciation of the currency. In this
context, it noted the potential benefits from institutionalizing fiscal procedures that would
help ensure a continued budget surplus position. The authorities stated that they plan to
pursue a prudent fiscal policy stance in the context of a broad reform agenda for the public
sector.5

The context for this reform agenda is the government’s Vision 2020 framework, aimed at
achieving developed country status by year 2020.

Estimates based on the three-quarter outturn to June point to an increase in the
overall budget surplus to 3 percent of GDP in FY 2003/04. While expenditure is estimated
to increase by about 9 percent, mainly on account of higher transfers and subsidies, this is
expected to be more than compensated for by strong receipts from the energy sector.
Nonetheless, total expenditure is expected to be lower than budgeted mainly due to slower
pace of implementation of capital projects.6 Meanwhile, the overall deficit of the public
enterprises is expected to increase somewhat, reflecting higher capital expenditure by the
energy-related companies. As a result, the overall NFPS surplus is estimated at 2.6 percent of
GDP in FY 2003/04.
14.
Over the medium-term, the budget is projected to record surpluses averaging
4 percent of GDP.7 The budget surplus would peak at 4½ percent of GDP in FY 2005/06.
Beginning in FY 2006/07, oil and gas revenue would decline in relation to GDP in line with
weakening prices, unless production volumes continued to rise. Total expenditure would
decline slightly in relation to GDP despite some increase in the public sector investment
program (PSIP). The budgetary projections are consistent with NFPS surpluses, averaging
2½ percent of GDP over the medium term. The underlying trends reflect the elimination of
the losses from the sugar company; an increase in capital expenditure of the statutory bodies
(mainly the water utility); and a weakening in the operating balance of the public enterprises,
as oil and gas prices gradually soften over the medium term.8 Overall public sector gross debt
and net debt would decline, respectively, to below 40 percent and 15 percent of GDP by
2009.
15.
Achievement of the projected budget surpluses hinges on a degree of
expenditure restraint. Specifically, the mission noted that the baseline projections assumed
growth of the wage bill and transfers to households be kept in line with inflation (about
3 percent on average), while the growth in other expenditure would be in line with that of
nominal GDP. These policies, the mission pointed out, would allow capital expenditure to
grow more rapidly than in recent years, permitting the government to address the country’s
infrastructure and social sector needs. The mission emphasized, moreover, the need to ensure
that public investment be of high quality and to improve the effectiveness of government
spending in general. To this end, the mission encouraged the authorities to undertake a Public
Expenditure Review with the World Bank, and recommended adoption of a medium-term
6

Wages and salaries also turned out below the budgeted amount, which included provisions
for unfilled positions.

7

The average projected during the mission was 2½ percent of GDP. Subsequently, WEO oil
prices for the projection period were raised from an average of US$30.7 per barrel to an
average of US$35.2 per barrel during the period 2005–09.

Possible improvements in the operating balances of public entities that could result from
planned reforms are not incorporated in the medium-term projections.

expenditure framework. The authorities indicated that their expenditure plans, while not yet
fully fleshed out, were likely to turn out well within the envelope assumed by the mission.
16.
Notwithstanding the strong energy revenue outlook, it is important to move
ahead with long-standing plans for tax reform. The mission noted that, over time, the nonenergy tax base (in particular the VAT) had been eroded, increasing the vulnerability of the
budget to drops in energy prices. In the energy tax regime, the royalty rate for natural gas
remains very low (about 0.3 percent per million cubic feet). To address these issues, the
mission recommended a reform of the energy-tax regime, citing related FAD advice,9 and a
strengthening of non-energy tax revenue through a reduction in tax exemptions, particularly
in the VAT area. The authorities are at an advanced stage of formulating a new energy tax
regime, to be implemented in the context of the FY 2004/05 budget, aimed at better capturing
the rents from natural gas, while still providing necessary incentives for investment and
exploration. The authorities recognized the need to stem and reverse the erosion of the nonenergy tax base that has taken place over time, due in part to tax exemptions. To help remedy
the situation, they had recently submitted a request for FAD technical assistance.10
17.
The mission discussed updated staff estimates of the use of oil and gas revenues
that would be sustainable over the long term. Based, inter alia, on data on oil and gas
reserves, projected extraction rates, and price trends, the estimates suggested that spending
on average TT$7 billion over the next five years would be consistent with long-term
sustainability (70–100 years) in the spending based on energy-related revenues.11 This
implies that the budget surplus should be, on average, at least 3½ percent of GDP during
FY 2004/05–FY 2008/09.12 While the baseline fiscal scenario more than meets this
sustainability criterion, the mission noted that the estimate of the minimum target balance
was highly sensitive to the assumptions and evolving information, and should be kept under
9

FAD has recommended simplifying the supplemental petroleum tax, and extending it to
natural gas production; adopting a uniform gas royalty for all producers; and terminating tax
holidays for investments in the petrochemical sector.
10

The medium-term fiscal projections do not include the effect of the revenue measures
discussed here, as these measures have not yet been fully specified.

11

For a description of the framework used by the staff to estimate sustainable use of energybased revenue in Trinidad and Tobago, see www.imf.org Country Report No. 03/232.

12

The authorities are in the process of formalizing the interim Revenue Stabilization Fund
(RSF). As the title indicates, this fund has been designed mainly for the narrower purpose of
smoothing out the use of energy revenue by the budget, rather than to buildup long-term
balances for inter-generational transfer of energy wealth. The authorities indicated that the
fund would be made more comprehensive in its formal version, through the inclusion of gasrelated revenues (in addition to oil-based revenues).

frequent review. The authorities concurred that long-term sustainability was an important
objective to be pursued in using the country’s energy resource endowment, in particular for
inter-generational equity reasons. However, they underscored that this objective would
continue to be balanced against the possibility of allocating additional energy-based revenues
to high priority social and infrastructure spending.
B. Monetary, Exchange Rate, and Financial Sector Policies
18.
The CBTT reaffirmed that its primary objective remains a low and stable rate of
inflation, which has been facilitated by a de facto exchange rate peg against the U.S.
dollar. Over the past year, in the context of continued low inflation and high unemployment,
as well as low international interest rates, the CBTT lowered domestic interest rates, which it
viewed as conducive to growth in the non-energy sector. The authorities explained that sales
of foreign exchange, which had increased substantially, had been calibrated to maintain
stable conditions in the foreign exchange market while moderating the strengthening of the
international reserve position and the consequent impact on liquidity. Open market
operations were enhanced in July 2004 with the introduction of a new auction system that
includes all government securities (rather than only treasury bills), concurrently with an
expansion of the primary dealer network to include nonbank financial institutions in the open
market auctions.
19.
The mission raised concerns about competitiveness and the appropriateness of
the level of the exchange rate.13 It noted that, while the currency had been depreciating
since 2002, the REER was still 15 percent above the level in 1997, the unemployment rate
was 10 percent, non-energy exports had declined by some 8 percent in 2003, and foreign
direct investment to the non-energy sector was low. The authorities indicated that, while they
were ready to allow the currency to depreciate, if necessary, to protect international reserves,
greater exchange rate flexibility at this time would in fact lead to an appreciation—noting
that they would not accelerate the pace of reserve accumulation to engineer a depreciation.
They expressed serious concern over the cost of such a policy in terms of inflation and
disruption in industrial relations, and the consequent likelihood of only minimal gains in
terms of real wage adjustments and competitiveness. Accordingly, the authorities argued that
competitiveness issues needed to be addressed through prudent fiscal policy and targeted
structural reforms. While the mission welcomed the indication that flexibility would be
exercised in exchange rate policy if needed to safeguard the reserve position, it emphasized
that, in the absence of exchange rate adjustment, structural reforms assumed even greater
importance.

13

Competitiveness issues are discussed in Chapter III of the accompanying Selected Issues
paper.

20.
The banking system remains broadly sound, and action is being taken to
strengthen further the regulatory and supervisory framework of the financial system.
The banking sector is well-capitalized, with the ratio of nonperforming loans quite low by
international standards (Table 7). In view of the substantial exposure to the region,14 work
will be needed to assess the associated vulnerabilities. In this connection, the mission
welcomed the authorities’ request for participation in the joint Fund/World Bank FSAP, on
which work is expected to start in early 2005.
C. Structural Reforms
21.
The authorities agreed on the need to improve competitiveness in the non-energy
sector, and indicated that this is being addressed through structural reforms. They
recognized, however, that the benefits of these reforms in terms of employment and poverty
reduction would require some time to materialize fully . The authorities noted that tax
reforms, upgrading of infrastructure, and supply-side enhancements would have a direct
beneficial impact on the competitiveness of the non-energy sector, although public sector and
financial sector reforms would also contribute importantly to competitiveness over the
medium term. They noted their plans to improve infrastructure, introduce supply side
enhancements, and accelerate fiscal, public enterprise, and financial sector reforms. The
mission underscored that full specification and steady implementation of a comprehensive
reform agenda was essential for economic diversification, employment creation, and poverty
reduction.
Budget
22.
The authorities emphasized that strengthening revenue administration was key
to improving the performance of non-energy taxation. The government approved, in late
2002, the establishment of an independent revenue authority which, when fully functional,
would integrate the operations of the current Inland Revenue Division and Customs and
Excise Department. This proposed administrative strengthening will be supported by a
strengthening of tax policy covering both the energy and non-energy sectors.
23.
To improve efficiency in the delivery of government services, the government
plans to phase in output budgeting in the context of the FY 2005/06 budget. The
authorities, as well as private sector representatives, emphasized that reducing the cost of
doing business with the government and accessing public services would enhance
competitiveness. In addition, the government issued a green paper on reform of the
procurement regime, for public discussion, in June 2004. The current regime is to be replaced
by a decentralized system incorporating the best international practices. More generally, in

14

Equivalent to about 20 percent of the investment portfolio of the licensed financial
institutions.

- 16 -

order to enhance transparency and accountability, the authorities indicated their willingness
to participate in a fiscal ROSC.
Public enterprise sector
24.
Improvements in efficiency and governance are being promoted in the public
enterprise sector. The Regulated Industries Commission (RIC) is implementing a strategic
plan whereby the public utilities will be given incentives to rationalize their operations in line
with international employment and cost standards. In this context, it is envisaged that the
Water and Sewerage Authority (WASA) will move fully to a meter system over the medium
term. To improve transparency and accountability, the state enterprises have been mandated
to publish a summary of their audited financial statement within four months of the end of
their financial year. Meanwhile, the government is also taking steps to review the legislative
framework governing the public enterprises.
Financial sector
25.
In view of the growth and complexity of Trinidad and Tobago’s financial system
and its increasing role in the region, the authorities are seeking to upgrade the related
supervisory and regulatory framework. In this context, the central bank’s supervisory role
was expanded in May 2004, to cover insurance companies, insurance intermediaries, and
registered pension plans.15 Also, steps are being taken to further strengthen the CBTT’s
supervisory and enforcement powers, including over financial conglomerates. In June 2004,
the authorities adopted a white paper outlining a broad legislative agenda for financial sector
reforms, including amendments to the Financial Institutions Act, the Insurance Bill, and the
Securities Industry Act, which are expected to be completed by mid-2005. Regulations
governing credit unions are also expected to be strengthened next year.
26.
The government is in the process of designing a reform of the pension system.
Such a reform will include a move to a fully funded contributory pension scheme for
government employees; integration of the Old Age Pension scheme with the National
Insurance Scheme (NIS), in the context of a broader reform of the NIS; and an improvement
in the legal and regulatory framework for private pension schemes.
Trade reform
27.
The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to further regional integration and
trade liberalization in the context of the CARICOM, the WTO, and the envisaged
FTAA. Trinidad and Tobago fully implemented the fourth phase of CARICOM common
external tariff in 1998 and currently most tariff rates on non-CARICOM imports are in the 5–
15

These reforms have been undertaken with technical assistance from the Fund and
CARTAC.

- 17 -

20 percent range.16 As preferential access to European markets is expected to be phased out
over the medium term, the authorities’ key trade policy objective is to broaden external
market access. The mission supported further trade liberalization, in coordination with other
CARICOM members.17
Supply-side enhancements
28.
The authorities view the PSIP as an important tool in their strategy to enhance
the supply-side of the economy. In this context, the composition of the PSIP is shifting
away from direct government involvement in productive activities toward economic
infrastructure (e.g., roads) and social spending (e.g., education and health).18 As part of the
PSIP, the government is developing a new industrial estate dedicated to the promotion of
high-technology industrial development, in collaboration with the new University of Trinidad
and Tobago, which will be located in the same area.
29.
Telecommunication costs are considered important for external competitiveness.
Accordingly, the Telecommunications Act was amended in July 2004, to pave the way for
full liberalization of the sector over the next year. The amendments remove the monopoly
privilege of the Telecommunication Services of Trinidad and Tobago. A new regulatory
body for the telecommunications sector, the Telecommunication Services Authority, has
been established.
30.
To improve the efficiency of the port operations, the government is at an
advanced stage in its plans to restructure the Port Authority of Trinidad and Tobago.
This restructuring would transfer cargo handling to a new company, with majority private
sector participation. Legislation to support the proposed restructuring plan has already been
drafted.
D. Medium-Term Outlook
31.
The outlook for the next three years is for continued rapid growth and budget
surpluses in the context of low inflation. The mission projected real growth of about
9 percent in 2004–06, led by a 15 percent expansion in the energy sector associated with
completion of large projects currently underway. A major event impacting the projections is
16

The tariff rate on imports of agricultural goods from outside CARICOM is 40 percent. In
January 2004, the Harmonized Commodity Descriptions and Coding System (HS2002)
structure was implemented.

17

Based on the IMF’s trade restrictiveness index, Trinidad and Tobago ranks 4 on scale of 1
(most open) to 10 (least open).

18

The share of the social sectors in PSIP allocations increased from 48 percent in 2001 to
56 percent in 2004.

the coming on stream of additional and substantial liquid natural gas production facility in
2006. Thereafter, oil and gas revenue would decline in relation to GDP with softening of oil
prices in line WEO projections. Nonetheless, under current trends and policies, the budget
would continue to record surpluses around 4 percent of GDP through FY 2008/09, while the
NFPS would record annual surpluses of about 3 percent of GDP. Gross public sector debt
would decline substantially, to less than 40 percent of GDP by 2009. The balance of
payments surplus is projected to average about US$600 million, or almost twice that
recorded in 2003, which would raise the CBTT’s gross international reserves to about
US$6 billion by 2009.
32.
Debt sustainability analysis anchored on the baseline scenario indicates that the
public debt would rise under a variety of shocks (Table 8). However, the baseline
scenario incorporates a significant build-up in assets, of some 18 percent of GDP over the
projection period, which could be used to cushion adverse shocks. In addition to the standard
stress tests, the earlier scenario prepared by the mission in the field may be used as a
sensitivity test, as it was based on a lower crude oil price. The results of that scenario indicate
that, for a reduction of US$4–5 in the average crude oil price during the five-year projection
period, in 2009 the public sector debt would be some 6 percentage points of GDP higher,
while the CBTT’s international reserves would rise less rapidly, to about US$4.3 billion,
compared with US$5.6 billion in the baseline scenario (Table 10).
E. Statistical Issues
33.
Trinidad and Tobago provides core statistics to the Fund that are broadly
adequate for surveillance. The mission was provided with rebased GDP data incorporating
methodological improvements to better capture growth in the energy sector and financial
services (Appendix IV). The authorities concurred with the mission that further strengthening
of the statistical system remains a key priority, particularly in the areas of public enterprises
accounts and the capital account of the balance of payments. The authorities indicated their
willingness to participate in the GDDS in the near future.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
The economy of Trinidad and Tobago continues to experience a strong
expansion driven by the energy sector. Expansion in energy output and high international
prices have boosted exports and fiscal revenues, giving rise to substantial fiscal and external
current account surpluses. These favorable developments have greatly reduced domestic and
external resource constraints. However, they also pose significant macroeconomic
challenges, notably because employment creation and poverty reduction require higher
growth in the more labor intensive non-energy sectors, where growth has remained sluggish.
Persistent double-digit unemployment, and the increasing dependence of the budget on
energy-based revenues underscore the need for a policy framework that promotes external
competitiveness and economic diversification.

- 19 -

35.
A key element of a growth-oriented policy framework is prudent fiscal
management, which also provides for sustainable consumption of energy resources. The
budget has remained in surplus in FY 2003/04 and—given the strength of projected energybased revenues—the government is in a position to maintain substantial surpluses over the
medium term. To this end, expenditure should continue to be managed prudently. The
authorities are advised to continue to contain the growth of the wage bill and transfers to
households. This would allow capital expenditure to grow more rapidly than in recent years
in order to better address the country’s infrastructure and social sector needs. However, it
will be important to ensure that public investment projects are of high quality and, more
generally, to improve the effectiveness of government spending. Over the long term, the
envisaged move to a fully funded pension scheme for government employees will help
maintain fiscal discipline.
36.
Notwithstanding the strong energy revenue outlook, it is important to move
ahead with long-standing plans for tax reform. The staff is therefore encouraged that the
authorities are at an advanced stage of preparation of a new energy tax regime, aimed at
better capturing the rents from natural gas, and have requested Fund technical assistance for a
reform of non-energy taxes, which have been eroded by exemptions and weak compliance.
While plans to strengthen the revenue stabilization fund to cover the natural gas sector are
welcome, the staff believes that a more comprehensive approach is needed, not only to
smooth out the budgetary use of energy resources but also ensure that such use is sustainable
over an appropriately long period. This would address inter-generational equity
considerations and allow time for economic diversification efforts to take hold. In this
context, the authorities should consider the scope for institutionalizing fiscal procedures that
would help ensure a continued budget surplus position over the medium term.
37.
Exchange rate stability has facilitated low inflation and helped shield the nonenergy sector from pressures towards exchange rate appreciation. Accordingly, the staff
supports the current de-facto pegging of the rate to the U.S. dollar, while also welcoming the
indication by the authorities that they would not resist downward pressures on the exchange
rate, and would allow flexibility if needed to protect the international reserves position. The
staff considers that the central bank, which is structurally a key recipient of foreign exchange,
has generally struck an appropriate mix in its liquidity management between sales of foreign
exchange and open market operations. In particular, over the past year, it was appropriate to
take advantage of the strength of the external inflows to allow some reduction in domestic
interest rates, which has provided some economic stimulus, while still maintaining low
inflation and permitting a moderate increase in international reserves. The recent expansion
in the auction system for government securities should enhance the role of open market
operations in managing liquidity, as well as promote development of the capital market.
38.
Persistent high unemployment, the decline in non-energy exports in 2003, and
the underlying pressures toward real appreciation reinforce the importance of targeted
structural reforms to enhance external competitiveness on the non-energy sector. The
staff, therefore, welcomes the authorities’ broad reform agenda, and encourages its full
specification and steadfast implementation. In the fiscal area, strengthening of revenue

- 20 -

administration through an independent revenue authority will be key for the success of
forthcoming tax reforms while the effectiveness and efficiency of government expenditure
would be improved by the planned adoption of output budgeting and reform of the
procurement system. The envisaged transition to an integrated financial management system
should strengthen the budgeting process and fiscal monitoring, and enhance debt
management. Regarding public sector reform, the government should be commended for
having undertaken a major restructuring of the state-owned sugar company, while providing
a significant safety net for the large work force affected by this measure. Looking ahead, the
staff attaches importance to the planned restructuring of the port operations, efforts toward
greater efficiency in the public utilities, and initiatives to improve transparency and
accountability in the public entities. It will also be important to address the unemployment
problem, including by redirecting government outlays to education and training to upgrade
labor skills, and developing a reform agenda aimed at tackling labor market rigidities. The
staff welcomes other ongoing supply-side reforms, notably liberalization of the
telecommunications sector.
39.
The ongoing program to modernize and upgrade the supervisory and regulatory
framework of Trinidad and Tobago’s financial system is critical, particularly in view of
the country’s increasing exposure to the region. In this context, the staff welcomes the
recent expansion of the central bank’s supervisory role to the insurance and pension sector,
and encourages the authorities to vigorously pursue their broad legislative agenda for the
financial system. The government is also encouraged to move ahead with its plans for
reforming the National Insurance Scheme and the regulatory environment for private pension
schemes. The staff welcomes the authorities’ request for participation in the joint
Fund/World Bank Financial Sector Assessment Program in 2005.
40.
While Trinidad and Tobago provides core statistics to the Fund that are broadly
adequate for surveillance, further strengthening of the statistical system remains a key
priority. Special attention is needed in the areas of public enterprises’ accounts, and the
capital account of the balance of payments. The staff welcomes the authorities’ decision to
participate in the GDDS.
41.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Trinidad and Tobago will be
conducted on the standard 12-month cycle.

1/ The nonfinancial public sector debt covers general government and nonfinancial public enterprises.
2/ The baseline projections assume a significant increase in government deposits at the CBTT, and accordingly lower net debt.
3/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange
rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
4/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
5/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
6/ Includes government deposit buildup at the CBTT.
7/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
10/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).
11/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and primary balance) remain at the level in percent of GDP/growth rate of the last projection year.

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation
(increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
4/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
5/ The implied change in other key variables under this scenario is discussed in the text.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(As of August 31, 2004)
The World Bank’s last Country Assistance Strategy for Trinidad and Tobago was discussed
at the Board in 1999. A new Country Assistance Strategy is being prepared and expected to
be finalized by the end of 2004. The current World Bank program includes two projects with
total commitment of US$31.5 million, of which US$23.4 million is undisbursed.
I. PROJECTS
Postal Service Reform: The Postal Service Reform project (US$11.5 million) assists the
Government in the privatization of the Postal Service, with the objective of reducing public
sector losses while improving the quality and efficiency of the postal service.
HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Program: The project was approved in June 2003 and
is funded under the Multi-Country APL for the Caribbean Region, with the following
objectives: (i) curbing the spread of HIV/AIDS epidemic; (ii) reducing the morbidity and
mortality attributed to HIV/AIDS; (iii) improving the quality of life for persons living with
HIV/AIDS; and (iv) developing a sustainable organizational and institutional framework for
managing the HIV/AIDS epidemic over the longer term. The Bank’s support to Trinidad and
Tobago under this project is for US$20.0 million.
II. ECONOMIC AND SECTOR WORK
A Caribbean-wide Growth and Competitiveness study is underway and expected to be
completed by the end-2004. A Financial Sector Assessment Program is expected to be
carried out by the World Bank and IMF in fiscal year 2005 (July 1–June 30).

TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO—RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of August 31, 2004)
As of August 27, 2004, the IDB has an active public sector lending portfolio with a total
value of US$437 million, of which US$177 million (41 percent) has been disbursed. These
loans reflect the implementation of the Bank’s strategy, approved in 1997, with emphasis on
economic diversification, public sector modernization, and social development. The Bank is
in the process of preparing a new strategy for the period 2004–07 concentrating on the
same three principal and inter-dependent areas of strategic focus. These three areas are:
(i) promoting private sector development to achieve economic diversification; (ii) promoting
public sector modernization to improve efficiency; and (iii) promoting social development
through improved public services.
In addition to loans for the public sector, the Bank lends directly to the private sector. The
IIC, one of the Bank’s private sector institutions that lends directly to the private sector, has
two small operations in execution. The first is a line of credit of US$10.0 million issued to
Republic Bank for on-lending to small and medium sized enterprises in Trinidad and Tobago,
Guyana and Suriname. In addition, the IIC has an 8.5 percent shareholder interest in
Development Finance Limited, an entity dedicated to serving the small business sector.
Finally, the Bank provides grant resources through technical cooperations. MIF, a Bank
institution providing grant resources for private sector development, has eight operations in
execution for an amount of US$5.7 million, of which US$2.9 million (51 percent) has been
disbursed. Two of these operations were approved in 1995 and came to a close in December
2003. More recently approved operations include Alternative Dispute Resolution, Secured
Transactions, Modernization of Telecommunications, Airport Security, and Improving
Accounting and Auditing Standards.
Following is a brief description of the Bank’s public sector loans in execution by strategic
area.
Promoting private sector development to achieve economic diversification
The Bank and the Government of Trinidad and Tobago signed a Business Climate Initiative
Aide Mémoire in November 2003. The Initiative calls for: (i) a Diagnostic Assessment to
identify a prioritized list of issues to improve the business climate; (ii) agreement on a
Business Climate Action Plan, the implementation of which the Bank would support with an
array of operational instruments; and (iii) agreement on a system to monitor and evaluate the
effectiveness of the action plan’s implementation.
In March 2003, the IDB approved a loan of US$5.0 million for a Trade Sector Support
Program. The operation was developed under a new sector facility and its main objective is
to improve the international trade performance of Trinidad and Tobago. That goal will be
met by strengthening the country’s technical and institutional capacity to formulate and

- 37 -

APPENDIX III

implement trade policy, to participate effectively in trade negotiations, to implement trade
agreements, and to increase and diversify exports.
In 1996, the IDB approved US$120.0 million in lending for the National Highway Program.
The program aims to improve and sustain road services provided by the main national road
network, reduce road transportation costs, and provide incentives for the development of
small contractors and microenterprises.
Promoting public sector modernization to improve efficiency
In December 2003, the IDB approved a loan of US$5 million for a Public Sector Reform
Initiation Facility. This facility is aimed at the development and initial implementation of a
long-term strategy to modernize the public sector. The plan or “road map,” which will result
from the project through a consensus-building approach, should be ready by December 2005.
It will include actions to improve the composition of public spending by optimizing the size,
management, structure, organization, functioning, human resources, legal framework,
accountability, and service delivery mechanisms of the government.
In 1995, the IDB approved a US$8.0 million reimbursable technical cooperation project to
assist the Government of Trinidad and Tobago in implementing the Agriculture Sector
Reform Program. This technical cooperation project is expected to assist agribusiness in the
identification of opportunities, and to strengthen the long-term institutional capacity of the
Ministry of Agriculture.
In 1993, the IDB approved a pre-investment program for US$2.3 million to enable the
government to energize the public sector investment program with well-prepared studies, and
to improve the allocation of public sector investment resources in Trinidad and Tobago.
Promoting social development public services
In 2002, the IDB approved funding in the amount of US$32.0 million to support the National
Settlements Program-Stage Two. The general objective is to establish a more equitable,
transparent and sustainable system of affordable housing, and more specifically to improve
housing conditions for low-income groups. The program includes support for squatter
upgrading, family subsidies and institutional capacity building.
In 1999, the IDB approved financing in the amount of US$l05.0 million for a secondary
education program. This program’s objectives are aimed at providing equitable, high quality
secondary education; updating educational content and teaching methodologies; and
developing a more efficient management of resources at the central and local levels.
In 1996, the IDB approved a US$134.0 million loan for a health sector reform program in
order to strengthen the policymaking, planning and management capacity of the Ministry of
Health. The program will finance activities aimed at separating health services from
financing and regulatory responsibilities, shifting public expenditures, redirecting private
expenditures to priority areas and finding cost effective solutions; establishing new

- 38 -

APPENDIX III

administrative and employment structures that encourage accountability, increased
autonomy, improved productivity and efficiency; reducing preventable morbidity and
mortality through lifestyle changes and social interventions; and financial sustainability of
the service delivery system.
In 1995, the IDB approved the community development fund loan for US$28.0 million to
enhance the government’s capacity to deliver social services to the poor and vulnerable
population during a period of economic adjustment and public sector reform.

APPENDIX IV

TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO—STATISTICAL ISSUES
Trinidad and Tobago produces a wide range of economic and financial statistics that are largely
based on sound methodological principles. However, institutional arrangements need to be
strengthened to facilitate improved compilation and reporting as well as collaboration among
the central bank, the central statistical office, and the ministry of finance, planning, and
development, and to avoid duplication of data production efforts and some inconsistencies
across sectoral databases.
Real sector
The central statistical office makes good use of available source data to produce annual national
accounts. In applying the recommendations by STA (2000), the CSO has revised the real GDP
series by rebasing it from 1985 to 2000, improved the methodology for calculating production
at each sector level, and switched from valuation at factor cost to market prices. This
particularly involved the inclusion of the large gas sector which came on stream in 2000; and
changing the estimation techniques in the telecommunications sector (by using the number of
call units as opposed to the number of callers) and the financial sector (by constructing
individual extrapolators for each sub-industry and then aggregating them up). The central
statistical office does not currently produce quarterly GDP estimates. Although the central bank
currently constructs quarterly indicators of real GDP, eventually the central statistical office
should assume exclusive responsibility for compiling quarterly national accounts. The retail
price index has been rebased from 1985 to January 2003 reflecting the 1997/98 Household
Budgetary Survey, and correcting the aggregation formula. The CSO should ensure that a
similar methodology is used to revamp the producer price index.
Fiscal accounts
Data on central government operations and debt are compiled separately by the ministry of
finance, planning, and development (MFPD) and the central bank, and data compiled by the
two agencies differ significantly. The authorities should work to reconcile on a regular basis
these two sets of data. Transfers to the revenue stablization fund are recorded as an expenditure
item, but should be recorded as a financial flow below the line. Data on the nonbank financing
are derived as residual owing to the absence of data collection. The national classification
system for government transactions and debt of the central government seems to be sufficiently
detailed for use in compiling data according to GFSM 1986 methodology, although no data
have been submitted for use in the GFSY. Also, there is no evidence of significant migration to
the use of GFSM 2001, which should be initiated.
Data on selected public enterprises and statutory bodies are being compiled by the investment
division, the domestic debt division and the budget division of the MFPD. The data from these
divisions have to be reconciled particularly on the transfers for debt servicing, transfers for
government capital projects, guaranteed debt, and letter of comforts. The capital expenditure on
behalf of government should be classified as capital expenditure instead of other goods and
services.

- 40 -

APPENDIX IV

Monetary accounts
The major recommendations of the IMF money and banking statistics mission have been
implemented by the authorities, leading to a substantial improvement in the analytical
usefulness of the monetary statistics. There are, however, some areas for improvement.
Monthly monetary account for other depository corporations (ODCs) currently covers only
financial institutions that are licensed by the central bank under the 1993 Financial Institutions
Act. Nonlicensed ODCs only report on a voluntary, quarterly basis. No data are reported by
credit unions and the Post Office Savings Bank. The lack of these data have prevented the
compilation of a more comprehensive Depository Corporation Survey. Currently only a few
commercial banks are involved in limited transactions in options and swaps. If the use of these
instruments becomes more significant, the central bank should initiate reporting of data on them
in the monetary statistics. The authorities should also consider developing systems for reporting
balance sheet accounts for the mutual funds, with a view to compiling a more comprehensive
financial survey in the future.
Balance of payments
The balance of payments data conform to many of the standards of the BPM5. The Private
Sector Capital Flows and Investor Perception survey needs to be improved on the quantity and
quality of responses, and estimating market value shares. There are sizable differences between
some items of the external public debt compiled by the central bank and the ministry of finance,
planning, and development. The central bank should expand its current debt reporting system to
include comprehensive coverage of external loans and debt of the entire public sector, as well
as publicly nonguaranteed debt. Timely reporting of the balance of payments data to STA is
encouraged (the latest data reported to STA were for the year 2001).

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
October 22, 2004
1.
This statement provides an update on fiscal developments since the issuance of the
staff report for the 2004 Article IV consultation with Trinidad and Tobago. This additional
information does not affect the thrust of the staff appraisal.
Fiscal outturn in FY 2003/04
2.
The overall budget surplus amounted to 2.2 percent of GDP, 0.8 percentage points of
GDP lower than estimated by the mission. While the current fiscal balance was in line with
the estimate, implementation of the public sector investment program in the last quarter of
the fiscal year exceeded the projected rate.
Budget proposal for FY 2004/05
3.
The budget proposal for FY 2004/051 was submitted to parliament on Friday,
October 8. As anticipated in the staff report, the budget proposal has been drafted using a
conservative oil price assumption. The budget is based on a crude oil price of US$32 per
barrel, substantially below current levels and lower than the price of US$37 per barrel used in
the staff report projections for FY 2004/05. Under this conservative assumption, the
government targets an overall budget surplus of 1.6 percent of GDP, compared with a
projected surplus of 3.3 percent of GDP in the staff report. If the budget proposal is adjusted
to use the same oil price assumption as in the staff report, it would imply a budget surplus of
2.6 percent of GDP—about ½ percent of GDP lower than projected in the staff report. The
shortfall would arise in the current fiscal balance, and is attributable partly to a higher wage
bill, on account of allocations for vacant positions. However, the budget surplus would rise to
4.0 percent of GDP if adjusted to the current oil price outlook.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 8, 2004

International Monetary Fund

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with Trinidad and Tobago
On October 22, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Trinidad and Tobago.1
Background
Trinidad and Tobago’s economy, which is endowed with large energy reserves, is
experiencing a strong energy sector-based expansion due to increased output and high
international prices. The energy sector already accounts for about 40 percent of GDP,
83 percent of domestic goods exports, and slightly more than 40 percent of government
revenue. Large increases in oil and gas output expected over the next decade will reinforce its
central role. As in other energy-rich countries, while energy exports greatly reduce domestic
and external resource constraints, they pose their own macroeconomic and governancerelated challenges—in particular, for employment creation, poverty reduction, and fiscal
transparency.
Real GDP growth picked up sharply in 2003, driven mainly by an expansion in the energy
sector, in the context of persistent high unemployment and continued low inflation. Real GDP
grew by 13 percent, led by a 30 percent expansion in the energy sector. This was due to a
surge in liquid natural gas production as the third LNG plant started operations in April 2003,
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2as well as to increases in the output of crude oil and petrochemicals. The performance of nonenergy sectors was mixed: while there was a strong expansion in manufacturing, construction,
and financial services, the agricultural sector declined by some 14 percent. The unemployment
rate continued to decline and stands at about 10½ percent. However, unemployment has been
kept high by a number of structural factors, which have led to a low labor intensity of growth.
These factors include the high capital intensity of the energy sector, skill mismatches, labor
market rigidities which reduce wage flexibility, and the impact of energy-related inflows on the
real exchange rate. It should be noted, however, that using the standard International Labor
Organization definition, the unemployment rate would stand at 7½ percent.2 While average
consumer price inflation has been close to 4 percent, core inflation (which excludes food price
increases) has been about 2 percent.
The overall balance of the consolidated nonfinancial public sector (NFPS) improved sharply in
FY 2002/03, although deficits remain in some entities. The NFPS shifted from a deficit of about
4 percent of GDP in FY 2001/02 to a surplus of 2 percent of GDP in FY 2002/03.
The turnaround reflected the marked improvement in the finances of the state-owned energy
companies due to strong product prices and, in the case of gas, increased output. While most
of the energy-related companies, and the telecommunication company, had operating
surpluses, a number of enterprises continued to record deficits—in particular, the fuel
distribution company and the water utility, whose tariffs have not kept pace with costs, and the
sugar company, which incurred large severance payments related to its restructuring. Public
sector debt declined by about 4 percentage points of GDP, to 56 percent of GDP as of
end-September 2003.
The Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago (CBTT) continued to maintain a stable exchange
rate against the U.S. dollar, which—given the large energy-related inflows—was consistent
with a reduction in the policy interest rate and some further build up in international reserves.
The exchange rate has remained within a narrow band around TT$6.3 per U.S. dollar—a
virtually unchanged level since late 1997—and international reserves have accumulated
moderately over the last two years. The CBTT lowered the benchmark repo rate by 25 basis
points in September 2003, to 5 percent, which was intended to stimulate growth in the nonenergy sector. To improve financial intermediation and level the playing field between banks
and non-banks, the CBTT lowered the reserve requirement, from 18 percent to 14 percent, in
October 2003. These measures have contributed to a significant reduction in commercial bank
lending rates, and an increase in credit to the private sector.
The balance of payments recorded an increased surplus in 2003, despite large capital
outflows, reflecting the strong performance of the energy sector. The external current account
recorded an unprecedented surplus of 13 per cent of GDP, compared to approximate balance
in 2002. The sharp increase in gas output, combined with an upswing in international oil and
2

The unemployment rate used by the authorities corresponds to an extended definition based on a
relaxed "seeking work" criterion.

-3gas prices, resulted in a boom in total export earnings, which rose by 13 percentage points of
GDP, despite a decline in manufacturing exports. The capital account recorded a deficit
equivalent to 10 percent of GDP in the context of sizable bond issues by regional governments
and corporations, and outward foreign direct investments. Direct investment inflows rose in the
context of major energy-related investment projects. At the end of the year, gross official
reserves stood at US$2.3 billion, equivalent to 5 months of imports. Public sector external debt
declined by 3 percentage points of GDP, to about 15 percent of GDP at end 2003, most of
which long-term and from commercial creditors.
Since August 2002, the Trinidad and Tobago dollar has depreciated by 9 percent in real
effective terms. This movement reflected mainly the fall in the value of the U.S. dollar, to which
the currency has been effectively pegged, against the currencies of Trinidad and Tobago’s
major trading partners, and in particular the euro. Nonetheless, the Real Effective Exchange
Rate remains some 15 percent above its 1997 level.

Executive Directors noted that strong expansion in energy output and high international prices
have boosted Trinidad and Tobago’s growth, exports, and fiscal revenues, giving rise to
substantial fiscal and external current account surpluses, while inflation has remained low.
These favorable developments have greatly reduced domestic and external resource
constraints. However, Directors observed that significant macroeconomic challenges remain,
notably to boost non-energy investment and growth in order to reduce the persistent high
unemployment rate and the dependence of the budget on energy-based revenues. This will
require determined implementation of a sound policy framework that promotes external
competitiveness and economic diversification.
Directors emphasized that a key element of such a growth-oriented policy framework would be
prudent fiscal management, which should also provide for sustainable consumption of energy
resources. They welcomed the budget surplus achieved in FY 2003/04 and anticipated that
—given the strength of projected energy-based revenues—the government is in a position to
maintain substantial surpluses over the medium term. To this end, expenditure should
continue to be managed prudently, based on a comprehensive public expenditure review.
Directors advised the authorities to continue to contain the growth of the wage bill and
transfers to households. This would allow capital expenditure to grow more rapidly than in
recent years in order to better address the country’s infrastructure and social sector needs.
However, it will be important to ensure that public investment projects are of high quality and,
more generally, to improve the effectiveness of government spending. Over the long term, the
envisaged move to output budgeting and a fully-funded pension scheme for government
employees will help maintain fiscal discipline.
Directors observed that, notwithstanding the strong energy revenue outlook, it is important to
move ahead with long-standing plans for tax reform and strengthening tax administration. They
were encouraged that the authorities are at an advanced stage of preparation of a new energy
tax regime, aimed at better capturing the rents from natural gas, and supported the authorities’

-4request for Fund technical assistance for a reform of non-energy taxes, revenue from which
has been eroded by exemptions and weak compliance. While plans to strengthen the revenue
stabilization fund to cover the natural gas sector are welcome, Directors noted that a more
comprehensive approach is needed, not only to smooth out the budgetary use of energy
resources, but also to ensure that such use is sustainable over an appropriately long period.
This would address inter-generational equity considerations and allow time for economic
diversification efforts to take hold. In this context, the authorities should consider the scope for
institutionalizing fiscal procedures that would help ensure a continued budget surplus position
over the medium term.
Directors considered that the defacto peg of the exchange rate has facilitated low inflation and
helped shield the non-energy sector from pressures towards exchange rate appreciation from
energy-related inflows. They concurred that competitiveness issues are best addressed
through prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms. However, they welcomed the
commitment by the authorities not to resist depreciation pressures, and to allow greater
exchange rate flexibility if needed to protect the international reserve position and increase the
economy’s ability to cope with external shocks. Directors felt that the central bank has
generally struck an appropriate mix in its liquidity management between sales of foreign
exchange and open market operations. They noted that the recent expansion in the auction
system for government securities should enhance the role of open market operations in
managing liquidity, as well as promote development of the capital market. They also supported
the reduction of reserve requirements to lower bank intermediation costs.
Directors stressed that persistent high unemployment, the decline in non-energy exports in
2003, and the underlying pressures toward real appreciation reinforced the importance of
targeted structural reforms to enhance external competitiveness in the non-energy sector and
support medium-term growth. They, therefore, welcomed the authorities’ broad reform agenda,
and encouraged its full specification and steadfast implementation. Regarding public sector
reform, Directors commended the restructuring of the state-owned sugar company in
conjunction with a significant safety net for the large work force affected. Looking ahead,
Directors attached importance to the planned restructuring of the port operations, efforts
toward greater efficiency in the public utilities, and initiatives to improve transparency and
accountability in the public entities. It will also be critically important to address the
unemployment problem in a determined manner, including by tackling labor market rigidities,
and fostering the right mix of labor skills through appropriate education and training. Directors
welcomed other ongoing supply-side reforms, notably liberalization of the telecommunications
sector.
Directors stressed the importance of the ongoing program to modernize and upgrade financial
regulation and supervision, noting Trinidad and Tobago’s increasing exposure in the regional
financial market. In this context, Directors welcomed the recent expansion of the central bank’s
supervisory responsibilities to cover the insurance and pension sectors, and encouraged the
authorities to vigorously pursue their broad legislative agenda for the financial system. They
also encouraged the government to move ahead with its plans for reforming the National
Insurance Scheme and the regulatory environment for private pension schemes. Directors

-5welcomed the authorities’ request to participate in the Financial Sector Assessment Program
in 2005.
Directors noted that Trinidad and Tobago provides core statistics to the Fund that are broadly
adequate for surveillance. Nevertheless, they encouraged further strengthening of the
statistical system, especially in the areas of public enterprise account, and the capital account
of the balance of payments. Directors welcomed the authorities’ decision to participate in the
General Data Dissemination System.

Statement by Murilo Portugal, Executive Director for Trinidad and Tobago
and Charles de Silva, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
October 22, 2004
The Trinidad and Tobago economy has continued to display considerable strength
driven in part by favorable international energy prices but, equally, the economy’s solid
performance has also been built on a platform of judicious macroeconomic management and
the dynamism of a sound, prudently managed and well-supervised financial sector. With
almost all the macroeconomic indicators pointing to an economy in exceptionally good
health the authorities have accepted the challenge of utilizing the present historic opportunity
to create the conditions for sustainable long-term growth and to deliver lasting improvements
in the social conditions that affect the population. Trinidad and Tobago adopted a program of
widespread and thoroughgoing economic reforms in the 1990s after emerging from a
prolonged downturn triggered by the end of the previous energy boom. The efficiency gains
generated by those reforms boosted the competitiveness and resilience of the economy but
the authorities recognize that strengthening and sustaining economic growth will require a
renewed emphasis on reforms in order to accelerate diversification of the economy alongside
continuing efforts to further develop the energy sector.
Recent Economic Developments
The Trinidad and Tobago economy grew at a robust pace in 2003, extending the
expansion that began in 1994 to its tenth consecutive year. The updated GDP calculation,
rebased to the year 2000 from its previous 1985 base, put real GDP growth in 2003 at 13.2
percent, almost double the rate of the previous year. The statistical revision was undertaken
in order to better reflect the changed structure of the economy, in particular the substantially
enlarged production share of natural gas. Growth was led by the energy sector, whose
expansion largely reflected the rapidly increasing levels of activity in the petrochemicals subsector and the commissioning of a third LNG plant, but crude oil production also increased.
The accelerating recovery of the global economy also helped to create favorable demand
conditions for Trinidad and Tobago’s energy exports which enjoyed significantly higher
prices compared with the previous year. Although growth in the non-energy sector was
generally more modest, energy sector investment projects gave a strong boost to the
construction sector, an important source of job creation, while manufacturing staged a
moderate recovery following the post-September 11 decline of the previous year.
The fiscal accounts recorded a surplus of the order of 2 percent of GDP in FY 20022003 and preliminary data point to a surplus of 0.6 percent of GDP in the just concluded
fiscal year, after taking account of transfers to the Revenue Stabilization Fund. As expected,
fiscal performance has strengthened substantially in the last two years based on the sharp
increase in energy-sector revenue while there were also clear signs of expenditure restraint.
Headline inflation remained well under control in 2003. Although the overall increase
in prices was held to an average of 3.8 percent, lower than in the previous year, food prices
were substantially more volatile, recording an increase of 13.8 percent in 2003 and

-2maintaining this trend into the current year. The twelve month increase in these prices to
August 2004 measured 10.5 percent.
Despite the fact that there was some net job creation, the unemployment rate
remained sticky throughout the year as new entrants joined the labor force. The
unemployment rate averaged 10.5 percent, marginally higher than the previous year, but
more recent data from the Central Statistical Office has pointed to an encouraging pick-up in
employment, with a substantial number of new jobs being added in the construction sector,
manufacturing and in business and financial services. The CSO has put the end-June
unemployment rate at 7.8 per cent, the lowest rate in over four decades.
The economy’s external performance strengthened appreciably in 2003 as reflected in
enlarged surpluses on the current account and on the overall balance of payments. Buoyant
prices for the country’s key energy exports combined with volume increases to push the
current account surplus to 12.8 percent of GDP and the overall balance to 3.2 percent of
GDP. The capital account remained in deficit as domestic investors continued to participate
heavily in regional bond issues and investment outflows accelerated in the expected
aftermath of the heavy influx of FDI that occurred over the last few years. The country’s
strong resource position has largely obviated the need for official external borrowing, such
that official capital transactions resulted in net outflows and a further paying down of official
external debt to reduce it to 15.3 percent of GDP and to a projected 12.9 percent of GDP by
end-2004. In keeping with Trinidad and Tobago’s steadily improving fundamentals and the
authorities’ commitment to disciplined and sensible macroeconomic policies, Standard and
Poor’s raised the country’s long-term foreign currency sovereign rating to BBB+ in 2004,
citing the strength of the fiscal and external balance sheets and the country’s strong growth
prospects. This was the second successive upgrade for Trinidad and Tobago in just over one
year.
Against the backdrop of a pick-up in the global economy, the central bank remained
firmly focused on its anti-inflationary policy objective in its conduct of monetary policy, but
also sought to respond to continuing slow growth in the non-energy sector. With private
sector credit demand responding only sluggishly to earlier interest rate reductions, the bank
considered that there was room for further monetary easing and lowered its benchmark repo
rate by 5 percentage points in September, capitalizing on the space provided by the lowinflation environment and the strong external position. In furtherance of its commitment to
the use of more market-based systems of monetary control and to fostering greater efficiency
in the financial intermediation process, the bank also continued the phased reduction of the
reserve requirement which had stood as high as 21 percent two years earlier. This second
reduction from 18 to 14 percent supported the transition to lower interest rates, marked by a
fall in banks’ prime lending rate from 11.50 percent to 9.50 percent. This process has since
been taken further with another reduction to 11 percent in September 2004 which triggered a
further decline in the prime rate to 8.75 percent. A stable US/TT dollar exchange rate
continued to provide a firm anchor for domestic inflationary expectations in 2003, with the
central bank maintaining a strong supportive role in the foreign exchange market.
Nevertheless, the bank remained open to allowing greater flexibility of the exchange rate in
the event of fundamental shifts in external sector conditions.

-3Against the backdrop of a buoyant economy the banking system remained sound and
profitable with no sign of a deterioration in asset quality despite a marked heightening in loan
marketing induced by high liquidity. Capital ratios averaged well above the minimum
requirement of 8 percent and licensed financial institutions easily met the additional capital
charge for foreign exchange risk introduced in 2000. Trinidad and Tobago consolidated its
status as the financial center of the region with local financial institutions arranging over
US$500 million in bond issues for regional clients and undertaking own investments of about
US$250 million in regional issues. Following the recent passage of legislation to tighten
insurance supervision, further regulatory strengthening for the financial sector has been put
on the agenda for 2005. The authorities have also requested and have reached agreement with
the Fund and Bank on the commencement of an FSAP in February 2005.
Prospects and Policies
The outlook indicates that over the next three years Trinidad and Tobago will enter a
period of even more dynamic growth, though the authorities expect that the trajectory will be
somewhat smoother than indicated in the staff report, which they believe understates the
growth of the economy beyond 2006 and will need to be revised. The planned start-up of a
new LNG plant in 2006 has now been delayed, as a result of which the initial impact on
growth will partly be felt in the following year. This will build on output increases from
several additional energy sector projects including a new methanol plant and a DRI plant that
should be operational by end-2005. The authorities project real GDP growth of 6.7 percent
in 2005, rising sharply to about 8-9 percent in 2006 and stabilizing around 5 to 6 percent
thereafter with the coming to fruition of a number of technology-based growth industries, to
be established in an already fully subscribed high-tech industrial park. Further down the road
the construction of an aluminum smelter, for which an MOU has already been signed, and
attendant co-generation facilities are planned. In the medium term non-energy growth will
derive considerable stimulus from an acceleration in construction activity, infrastructure
development and private sector projects.
The authorities are acutely aware that the prevailing economic and financial
circumstances of the country pose significant challenges to macroeconomic management,
chief among which are strengthening and preserving the competitiveness of the non-oil
sector, ensuring the long-term sustainability of the use of its non-renewable energy resources
and, in the short run, defusing the potential for an inflationary take-off. The authorities are
similarly mindful that the present conjuncture offers a unique opportunity to establish the
foundations for sustainable long-term growth and to propel the country towards its goal of
achieving developed country status within the next two decades. For this reason the
authorities are placing special emphasis on poverty alleviation and on improvements in
health, housing and education in the medium term, while continuing to respect the absorptive
constraints of the economy and the principles of sound macroeconomic management.
Maintaining price stability will remain the main focus of the Central Bank in the
months ahead. In the absence of strong signs of a pick-up in domestic demand, monetary
policy is likely to remain accommodative for the time being, but changes in the external
interest rate environment could also influence the policy stance. The Bank also intends to

-4press ahead with its schedule for lowering the cash reserve requirement applicable to banks
to the 9 percent level that currently applies to non-banks. This should lead to a further
tightening of intermediation spreads and, other things being equal, a further reduction in
domestic interest rates.
The authorities remain committed to the establishment of a Revenue Stabilization
Fund as a key tool of fiscal management and for preserving a share of the country’s natural
resource wealth for future generations. Notwithstanding that legislative bottlenecks have
delayed formal establishment of the Fund, the authorities in 2004 made deposits totaling
TT$1263.2 million to the Interim Revenue Stabilization Fund in keeping with pre-established
guidelines. The cumulative balance in the Fund now stands at TT$2775.6 million.
Legislation will be enacted early in 2005 for the establishment of the Fund which will be
based on the following design principles:
i.
ii.
iii.

The annual estimate of oil and gas revenues will be determined by the long-term
prices of crude oil and gas;
the larger part of the excess reserves (up to 60 percent) will be earmarked for
stabilization or inter-generational transfers;
the remainder of the excess (up to 40 percent) will be available to be allocated to
strategic investments.

The authorities concur fully with staff on the need to improve competitiveness in the
non-energy sector and are focusing on wide-ranging structural reforms as the most effective
way of addressing this objective. In the area of tax reform, the authorities are currently
drawing on technical assistance from the Fund to undertake an assessment of the VAT
system, which was introduced in 1990, but whose productivity has declined over time. In the
area of enterprise reform, the difficult and politically sensitive restructuring of the stateowned sugar company has been decisively addressed and further divestment and
restructuring of the state’s role are being aggressively pursued in areas such as port
operations, forestry and broadcasting among others.
In keeping with the thrust to strengthen the basis for policy making and to promote
greater transparency in economic reporting, Trinidad and Tobago has recently begun
participating in the GDDS and has published comprehensive information on its statistical
production and dissemination practices on the IMF’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin
Board. The authorities intend to build on this foundation with a view to eventually
subscribing to the SDDS.
In conclusion, our authorities wish to record their appreciation of the candid exchange
of views and helpful advice provided by the Fund during the course of the Article IV
discussions and of the Fund’s continuing support for Trinidad and Tobago through the
provision of technical assistance.
