PANAMA
Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2009 Consultation with Panama
Approved by Miguel A. Savastano and Michele Shannon
May 6, 2009
•

Background. Panama is facing the global financial crisis from a position of strength,
reflecting several years of rapid economic growth and fiscal consolidation, as well as
a strong banking system. Although the spillovers have thus far been limited, some
strains are becoming evident.
•

Prospects. Economic activity is set to slow significantly owing to the deterioration in
the external environment, but growth is expected to remain in positive territory due to
the strong growth momentum and ongoing Panama Canal expansion. The
government’s financing needs for 2009 have been met. The banking system, while
robust, may be vulnerable to further deterioration in international financial
conditions.

•

Policy issues and main recommendations. The scope for countercyclical policies is
limited owing to the absence of a national currency and fiscal deficit limits
established by a new fiscal responsibility law. Main recommendations are: (i) adhere
to the fiscal deficit mandated by the fiscal responsibility law; (ii) develop guidance to
operationalize the fiscal responsibility law to allow for rapid adjustment when growth
decelerates more rapidly than envisaged; and (iii) develop contingency plans to
address pressures on the banking system.

•

2008 Article IV consultation. During the July 2008 Board discussion, Directors
recommended the adoption of a stronger fiscal stance to contain excess demand and
inflationary pressures while providing room for additional measures to ease the
impact of inflation on the poor. Directors also stressed the need for continued
financial sector vigilance. In line with these recommendations, the government
maintained the fiscal accounts in surplus and stepped up the monitoring of the
banking system.

•

Mission. The 2009 Article IV consultation discussions took place during March 11–
24; the mission comprised of Ms. Gold (head), Messrs. Alichi, Dehesa, and Ms. Shi
(all WHD). Mr. Wezel (MCM) joined the mission in its second week.

I. BACKGROUND AND NEAR TERM OUTLOOK
Strong domestic fundamentals helped contain the impact of the global financial crisis but the rapid
deterioration in the global environment has weakened the economic outlook.
1.
Strong growth performance but a slowdown unavoidable. Real GDP growth during 2004–08
averaged 8.8 percent as Panama benefited from the favorable external environment including a high
level of foreign direct investment. Construction,

2.
Inflation on a downward path.
Inflation peaked at 10 percent in September
2008, reflecting high international food and fuel
prices, as well as demand pressures. In line
with global trends, inflation is declining
rapidly, falling to 3.7 percent by March 2009,
and is projected to fall to about 3 percent by
end–2009.

has made substantial gains on the candidate of
the ruling Partido Revolucionario Democrático.
Both parties have similar economic platforms that are not expected to alter the broad direction of
economic policies, although the opposition party is campaigning on important tax changes, including
the introduction of a flat tax.

Preliminary real GDP data indicates a significant slowdown in financial services in 2008 largely due to shortcomings in
estimating the sector’s deflator. An IMF STA mission that visited in March 2009 recommended several modifications to
the methodology that would lead to a substantive upward revision in the sector’s and real GDP growth.

Box 1. Panama: The Slowdown in Construction
The construction sector has become an
increasingly important engine of growth
for the Panamanian economy. In recent
years, construction activity has picked up
steadily, with annual growth reaching
34 percent in the second quarter of 2008.
Accordingly, construction’s contribution to
GDP growth rose from ½ percentage point
in 2006 to nearly 1½ percentage points in
2008.

Reduced foreign demand and credit
availability led to a slowdown in
construction activity in the second half
of 2008. Construction permits, a leading
indicator, fell sharply in January 2009,
signaling further slowdown in the months
ahead. However, there are several
mitigating factors that may contain the
collapse of construction, including the
Panama Canal expansion (which is
expected to pick up in late 2009), a large
increase in government spending on
infrastructure, and increased funding for
construction of middle and low-income
housing.

4.
A resilient regional banking sector. Panama’s banking system consists of 43 private
domestically licensed banks and 2 state banks. 2 Banks are well-capitalized, liquid, are subject to
effective supervision and have strong financial soundness indicators. 3 The banking system’s role in
the region has expanded in recent years, in a broadly balanced manner, with nonresidents deposit
growth providing the main source of expansion for nonresidents credit (Box 2). A new Banking Law
(drafted with technical assistance from the Fund) became effective in August 2008. The law
strengthens the legal basis for consolidated cross-functional supervision, extends banks' supervision
to financial conglomerates, improves the bank resolution framework, and enhances risk adjusted
capital requirements. The new bank resolution framework provides the Superintendent of Banks farreaching powers to request troubled banks to adopt corrective measures, and to reorganize or
liquidate non-compliant institutions.
5.
However, the financial system has not been immune to global developments. Following the
intensification of the global financial crisis in September 2008, Panamanian banks, like other banks
in the region, experienced difficulties in accessing foreign credit lines. 4 In addition, anecdotal
evidence suggests that there was some flight to quality and heightened concerns about possible
adverse spillovers. However, bank deposits remained stable and credit growth bottomed out by end
2008. The non-banking financial sector, including the stock exchange, is small, and has not been
affected much by the global financial crisis.
6.
The government took quick steps to contain the impact of the crisis. In early October, the
President formed a high-level crisis committee, the Superintendency of Banks (SBP) increased its
scrutiny of banks, and the Banco Nacional de Panama (BNP) established a collateralized line of
credit of US$400 million for banks affected by the reduced access to foreign credit. The SBP also
enacted temporary changes in regulations to reduce the impact of the global financial volatility on
banks’ equity positions. 5 In January, to address continued concerns about the limited access to
foreign credit, the government announced a stimulus package, Financial Stimulus Program (PEF), for
a total of US$1.1 billion for on-lending for productive investment and working capital. The program
is funded by loans from the IDB (US$500 million) and CAF (US$210 million) as well as BNP
resources. However, legal and institutional challenges resulting from not having a central bank, and
government efforts to make the assistance congruent with market needs delayed the availability of
PEF resources until April 2009. In February, the SBP took administrative control of Stanford
2

In addition, there are 30 offshore banks, which are not allowed to accept domestic deposits, and 15 representative
offices.

3

The 2006 Financial Sector ROSC (IMF Country Report No. 07/66) noted that the regulatory and supervisory framework
for banks showed a high level of observance of the Basel Core Principles for banking supervision.

4

The lower access was a consequence of prohibitive pricing, requests by correspondent banks to not activate lines or
instructions from parent banks that operations be locally funded.

In particular, Agreement No. 8-2008 permits the transfer of certain securities from the “available for sale” category to
the “held to maturity” category.

Bank-Panama, following a deposit run prompted by the allegation of fraud by the Stanford group
made by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The closing of Stanford Bank-Panama,
together with general uncertainty about the health of banks, fueled two small deposit runs, which
were quickly contained after the Superintendency of Banks gave firm public assurances about the
banks’ soundness.
7.
Public finances on a strong footing. The nonfinancial public sector (NFPS) surplus,
excluding the Canal Authority (ACP), declined from 3.5 percent of GDP in 2007 to 0.4 percent of
GDP in 2008, despite continued robust
revenues. A large increase in public
Overall balance (right scale)
investment—from 5 percent to 7 percent
of GDP—and measures to mitigate the
effects of higher food and oil prices
(equivalent to about 1 percent of GDP)
explain the lower surplus. 6 The Panama
Canal expansion, estimated to cost
US$5.3 billion, is broadly on track with
the government about to decide the
winning bid for the construction of the
locks, the most complex and costly component of the project. The high output growth and modest
surplus led to a further decline in the public debt-to-GDP ratio (39 percent by end-2008).

Significant progress in reforming the public finances. A new Social and Fiscal
Responsibility Law (SFRL), which sets a ceiling on the fiscal deficit, was enacted in June 2008
(Box 3), and the government is finalizing a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) law that would provide
a legal framework for PPP projects.
9.
A weakened external position. The external current account deficit deteriorated to
12½ percent in 2008 (7.3 percent of GDP in 2007), as a result of strong domestic demand, high fuel
and food prices in the first half of the year, and a sharp decline in net exports from the Colon Free
Zone. The large current account deficit was fully financed by ample foreign inflows, including
foreign direct investment, which rose to US$2.4 billion (10.4 percent of GDP) despite the adverse
external environment in the second half of the year.

6

In dollar terms, the capital expenditures of the nonfinancial public sector have more than tripled since 2004, increasing
by about 70 percent in 2008 alone.

welcome, increases risks. While the expansion
of credit and deposits in both segments of the market (residents and nonresidents) has been broadly
balanced, Panama’s banks are increasingly vulnerable to developments in other countries. Much lower
economic growth in other countries of the region for example, could lead to a rise in delinquencies on
Panama’s loans to nonresidents. Conversely, countries in the region are increasingly vulnerable to
possible transmission of shocks from Panamanian banks.

Significant decline in poverty. A recent household expenditure survey, conducted with the
assistance of the World Bank found that poverty rates declined from 37 percent in 2003 to 32 percent
in 2008, while extreme poverty fell from 17 percent to 14 percent. A CEPAL study based on income
finds an even larger decline in poverty and extreme poverty between 2001 and 2007. These findings
are consistent with the sharp fall in the open unemployment rate (from 10.9 percent at end-2003 to
4.2 percent in August of 2008). While inequality seems to have increased somewhat, indicators of
extreme poverty, literacy and longevity are reasonably good compared to the rest of the region.

II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
The impact of the ongoing global financial and economic crisis on Panama and the appropriate
policy response were the focus of discussions during the consultation. The staff reviewed the risks to
the outlook, discussed the scope for counter cyclical fiscal policy measures, and proposed steps to
further protect the banking system.
A. Outlook and Risks
11.
Panama’s strong ties with the global economy will contribute to dampen output growth
and slow inflation. Staff envisages that real GDP growth will slow to 3–4 percent in 2009–10, and
thereafter rise gradually to 7 percent.
Real GDP Growth 2009-10
Inflation is projected to fall to about
2.5 percent by 2010, above the long-term
average of 2 percent. The slowdown is
likely to impact many sectors, with
communications and transportation,
financial services, and the Colon Free Zone
being the most affected owing to their
strong external links. In addition, residential
construction (a key driver of the recent high
growth) is also likely to slow significantly.

acceleration of government
investment that started in the second half of 2008 will help sustain construction activity in face of
falling foreign demand. And third, although expected to decline somewhat, FDI is still projected to
remain high (at about 7 percent of GDP in 2009–10).
13.
The growth outlook, however, is subject to considerable risk. The depth and length of
Panama’s slowdown will depend on the magnitude and duration of the recession in the U.S. and the
rest of the region; on the absence of adverse shocks to confidence; and on the resilience of FDI. A
stronger-than-envisaged decline in credit growth could also result in slower than projected output
growth. The authorities were in broad agreement with the staff’s growth outlook for the short and
medium term. They indicated that aggregate demand had held up surprisingly well, and argued that
the construction sector would likely be protected from declining foreign demand by the higher
government investment and the pent-up demand for housing.
B. Scope for Counter-cyclical Fiscal Policy
14.
Notwithstanding significantly slower growth, the 2009 budget deficit target of 1 percent
of GDP seems achievable. The revenue projections underlying the budget prepared in mid-2008
were conservative and are broadly consistent with those of the staff. Revenues are projected to
decline by 2 percentage points of GDP relative to 2008 as a result of slower growth and lower capital
revenues. 8 Despite projected lower traffic in the Panama Canal, transfers to the government are
7

External financing for this project of US$2.3 billion was secured in October 2008, with the JBIC and the European
Investment Bank providing the largest share (with US$800 and US$500 million respectively). Repayment terms for the
total amount of borrowing are: 20-year amortization, and 10 years grace, with an average spread above LIBOR of
93 basis points.

8

Capital revenues in 2007-08 were particularly large due to sales of airport concessions, telecommunications bands, and
other government assets.

14
expected to remain at about the 2008 level due to a planned increase in tariffs (of about 15 percent)
and some additional cost saving measures. 9 With these projected revenues, achieving the budget
target stipulated in the SFRL (1 percent of GDP) would require reducing total government
expenditures by ½ percent of GDP relative to their 2008 level. The capital spending budget for 2009,
which is lower than the outturn for 2008, would help accommodate the deficit target. 10 The projected
deficit for 2009 will be externally financed, including through the placement of bonds in international
markets and loans from the IDB and World Bank. 11
15.
The mission argued that adhering to the SFRL in the current juncture was feasible and
appropriate. The SFRL law aims to institutionalize fiscal discipline, and enhance transparency and
accountability by establishing a ceiling for the fiscal deficit (excluding the ACP) of 1 percent of
GDP, unless real GDP growth is 1 percent or less. By design, the SFRL limits the scope for fiscal
stimulus in low-growth periods.

the overall fiscal balance
(including the ACP) is projected to shift from a surplus of 2.5 percent of GDP in 2008 to a deficit of
1 percent of GDP, an expansion of about 3½ percentage points; adjusting for the cyclical impact and
one-off revenues, those projections would imply a fiscal impulse of about 1 percentage point in 2009.
The authorities agreed with this assessment, and noted that that the Canal expansion would more than
offset the moderate reduction planned in government capital spending.
9

The ACP projects a decline in traffic of 6 percent, following a decline of 2 percent in 2008. In the ACP’s view, the
decline in trade volumes have had a less than proportional effect on traffic through the Canal. The staff’s projections are
based on a more conservative forecast of a 10 percent decline in traffic.

10

The authorized capital expenditure in 2008 was increased through supplementary budget authorization bills in light of
stronger-than-expected revenue performance.

11

The government took advantage of a rally in the international bond markets in March 2009, and placed US$323 million
through the reopening of bonds falling due in 2015, at a yield of 7.04 percent.
12

In February 2009 Fitch Ratings confirmed Panama's long-term foreign currency and local currency issuer ratings at
“BB+”, one grade below investment grade, with positive outlooks.

Box 3. The Social and Fiscal Responsibility Law
The Social and Fiscal Responsibility Law (SFRL) was approved by the National Assembly in June 2008
(Law No. 34) and became effective on January 2009. The law, which replaced the 2002 Fiscal
Responsibility Law, sets a fiscal rule that limits the deficit of the nonfinancial public sector (NFPS),
excluding the ACP, at 1 percent of GDP, and sets a target for total public debt (including debt held by the
Social Security Agency but excluding debt held by the Fiduciary Fund) of 40 percent by 2014.1 2 The law
allows the government to deviate from the fiscal rule in the event of (i) natural disasters, (ii) national state
of emergency, and (iii) an economic recession. Any deviations require the approval of the National
Assembly. The law contains some built-in room for counter-cyclical fiscal policy, allowing for an
increase in the NFPS deficit to up to 3 percent of GDP in cases where real GDP growth falls to one
percent or less, and 2 percent in the following year.
The law defines clearly the coverage of the NFPS and measures the deficit on a cash basis using
international accounting principles. Other requirements specified in the law include provisions for new
administrations to publish a medium term fiscal framework (including a public investment plan) and a
social strategy program within six months of assuming office.
_______________________
1

Under Panamanian law, the Panama Canal authority (ACP) is an autonomous legal entity, with a budgetary process
that is distinct from that of the government. The Fiduciary Fund is a trust established in the 1990s to invest
privatization proceeds; as of end-2008, the Fund held about US$890 million in Panamanian global bonds.
2

The debt-to-GDP ratio corresponding to the definition in the SFRL was 49 percent of GDP at end-2007, which
declined to 41 percent by end-2008.

16.
The staff argued that the government should be prepared to take action quickly, within
the context of the SFRL, if the output slowdown is stronger than envisaged. Although the law
allows for a higher deficit when output growth is at or below 1 percent, it does not provide clear
guidance on how to take account of the slowdown as it is taking place. The staff urged the authorities
to issue guidelines clarifying the data and methodology that is to be used to decide whether the fiscal
stance should be relaxed, noting that a rapid reaction by the government would be critical in a
downturn. Concretely, the mission recommended the adoption of a forward-looking framework that
would take account of preliminary growth estimates from the previous two quarters and growth
forecasts based on leading indicators. It also suggested that an independent body of experts
(composed of representatives from the government, the private sector, think tanks, and academia)
could furnish the government with an independent forecast for growth, as is the case in other
countries. The government agreed with the staff’s recommendations, and planned to issue regulations
that would allow them to modify the fiscal stance in a timely manner.

17
17.
The mission argued that adhering to the SFRL would help ensure fiscal sustainability
even in a low growth scenario. The mission discussed an alternative scenario, with output growth of
0 percent in 2009 and 1 percent in 2010, and a deficit in line with the SFRL. The scenario showed
that the higher fiscal deficit allowed

baseline scenario yielded similar
results, as it showed that only a prolonged shock to output growth would place Panama’s debt-toGDP ratio on a non-declining path (Figure 6).
18.
The mission recommended that the higher government spending be geared at
supporting domestic economic activity and protecting the poor. Staff noted that there is broad
agreement that public spending on goods and services has larger multiplier effects and stronger firstround impact effect than transfers or tax cuts. In view of this, staff recommended that priority be
given to maintaining existing social programs, including by providing transfers to sub-national
government agencies that are facing financing constraints.
C. Financial System Risks
19.
The mission and the authorities agreed that Panama’s financial system has fared well
during this crisis thus far, but continues to face risks. In particular, the system remains vulnerable
to exogenous shocks and a sudden loss of confidence; risks that are heightened by the significant
presence of foreign banks and the size of foreign deposits in the onshore banking system. Nearly
60 percent of Panama’s banking system is foreign-owned, and is thus exposed to risks from further
deterioration of the parent banks, notwithstanding the soundness of the local subsidiaries. In addition,
nearly 30 percent of bank deposits (40 percent including interbank deposits) are owned by foreigners
and, therefore, are also sensitive to developments in their home countries. Lastly, banks face the risk
of a deterioration in their asset quality in light of lower growth in Panama and the region.

20.
The mission noted that the absence of a central bank and the relatively large size of the
banking system (in terms of GDP) exacerbated the risks. Panama lacks an institution that can play
the role of lender of last resort in case banks experience liquidity shortages, including due to deposit
withdrawals. Moreover, the sheer size of the banking system, with deposits of about 130 percent of
GDP (excluding interbank deposits), poses serious challenges to the authorities’ capacity to provide a
credible safety net to safeguard confidence.
21.
The banks’ response to the heightened uncertainty, while appropriate, could exacerbate
the economic slowdown. The mission noted that banks had increased their already high liquidity
ratios (from about 58 percent in November
Credit to the private sector
2008, to above 64 percent by mid-April
600
2009) to self-insure against shocks, including

had recourse to emergency liquidity support.
22.
Possible actions to reduce uncertainty and facilitate credit expansion were discussed.
The staff recommended the development of contingency plans to provide emergency liquidity
support to deal with large or systemic liquidity shortages through a temporary facility. It indicated
that such a facility would need to be guided by clear and transparent rules (including the type of
collateral to be posted, and the magnitude that would be available to each bank) to provide assurances
to banks. The staff commended the authorities for the rapid creation of the collateralized credit line
from the BNP, but noted that the delays in finalizing the terms had created uncertainties among banks
and raised questions about its likely effectiveness. Staff urged the authorities to clarify the terms of
operation of the BNP credit line, and make public those terms as soon as possible. The authorities
agreed that establishing an effective system of liquidity support for banks was a priority at this time,
but noted that this would require additional external financing as the BNP resource were not freely
available. 13 They also noted that the delays in activating the BNP line reflected the complexities of
the Panamanian market, including difficulties in establishing a framework for liquidity support-type
lending in the absence of a central bank.

13

A large share of BNP’s foreign assets are the counterpart of deposits from the ACP and the Social Security System.

20
23.
The mission emphasized that the weak growth outlook for the country and the region
posed additional challenges. The mission indicated that stress tests conducted by the mission
showed that the banking system would remain adequately capitalized even under severe shocks to
loan quality, although a few banks with a high exposure to the construction and household sectors
could face some distress in the event of a severe economic downturn. 14 The mission commended the
Superintendency of Banks for its stepped-up monitoring of banks, and noted the continued
importance of timely interventions. In this regard, the mission welcomed the swift action on the
Stanford Bank-Panama, which had prevented contagion to the rest of the banking system. The
mission cautioned the authorities against a relaxation of the prudential framework (which should only
be considered in the context of a wider strategy of emergency support), and encouraged the
authorities to take advantage of the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) mission planned
for 2009–10 to discuss these issues further.
24.
The inclusion of Panama in a list of tax havens poses an additional challenge. Banks were
concerned that such designation could have adverse consequences for Panama’s financial industry.
The authorities have started a dialogue with the private sector to agree on a strategy to address
Panama’s inclusion in the list. The strategy could involve changes to financial industry regulations in
line with an earlier agreement with the OECD that had been only partially implemented. Other
options being considered include reforms that have been adopted in other jurisdictions, notably
limitations to the use of bearer shares, modifications in bank secrecy regulations, and permission to
exchange tax information. The mission strongly endorsed the authorities’ cooperative approach, and
took note of their concern about the lack of a level playing field in this area.
D. External Competitiveness
25.
The mission and the
authorities agreed that Panama’s
external current account deficit will
remain above its medium-term
norm while the Canal expansion is
underway. The staff noted that the
external current account deficit is
likely to remain high for several years,
reflecting the Canal expansion and the
large imbalance recorded in 2008
(12.4 percent of GDP). Despite this,

The tests suggest, however, that most of those banks would stay above the minimum required regulatory capital even
under those conditions.

staff analysis suggests that Panama’s competitiveness has improved (Box 4). Moreover, the analysis
shows that the underlying current account balance, adjusted for the expansion of the Canal and high
level of FDI, would remain broadly in line with the historical norm. Once the Canal expansion is
completed in 2014, the current account deficit is envisaged to decline below 6 percent of GDP, a
level consistent with Panama’s investment needs and potential growth rate (Table 10).
26.
Panama’s role as a regional banking center together with the offshore banks implies a
high level of foreign debt. Deposits from nonresidents and interbank credit lines account for more
than 2/3 of Panama’s external debt. Those bank deposits and credit lines, representing close to
120 percent of GDP, are mostly on-lent to nonresidents. Excluding banks, Panama’s external debt as
of December 2008 is estimated at 50 percent of GDP, of which close to 80 percent is owned by the
government and has an average maturity of 7 years. Nonbank external debt has fallen in recent years
and is expected to decline as a share of GDP over the medium term.
27.
Despite delays in the finalization of the free trade agreement with the U.S., trade links to
the region have strengthened. Panama ratified the agreement with the U.S. in July 2007, but
ratification by the U.S. is pending. Progress on other fronts has proceeded at a faster pace and include
the conclusion of trade agreements with all Central American countries. This has paved the way for
Panama joining the framework agreement for the establishment of a Central America Customs
Union, and participating discussions on an Association Agreement between the region and the EU.
Negotiations with Mexico and Canada on bilateral free-trade agreements are also underway.

22
Box. 4. External Stability
Despite the slowdown in global trade, Panama remains competitive. Panama has
capitalized on the rapid expansion in global commerce and many key sectors (transportation,
communication, financial services, and tourism) have gained market share. In recent years,

Compared with developments in other
countries in the region, Panama’s REER has
shown remarkable stability since the mid
1990s, and the one-to-one link to the dollar
does not seem to have adversely affected its
competitiveness relative to its neighbors.

The staff updated the REER analysis presented
during the 2008 Article IV consultation. As then, the equilibrium real exchange rate was calculated using
the coefficients from the estimations developed by the RES’s Consultative Group on Exchange Rate
Issues (CGER) (available via the Internet: www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2006/110806.pdf) and
Panama data from 1994 to 2008.

III. STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
Panama is facing the global economic crisis from a position of strength. Rapid growth, a
strong and well regulated banking sector, a solid fiscal position, and the Canal expansion project will
help Panama face the challenges posed by the difficult external environment. Panama’s growth
outlook for 2009 is less favorable than in recent years, but is expected to be stronger than in the rest
of the region. However, as in all countries closely integrated to the global economy, downside risks
are high.
29.
Economic performance in 2008 remained strong, but the external balance showed some
strain. Real GDP grew by more than 9 percent reflecting strong domestic demand and high foreign
direct investment (which started to taper off towards the end of the year). Inflation reached a 30-year
high of 10 percent in August 2008, but decelerated thereafter in line with lower international fuel and
food prices. The external current account deficit widened to 12.5 percent of GDP, reflecting both
high import prices and volumes and weak export performance (in particular from the Colon Free
Zone), as a result of lower external demand.
30.
Rapid economic growth helped strengthen the fiscal position. Continued strong revenue
performance and one-off-factors created room for higher government spending to mitigate the effects
of the high oil and food prices and increase government investment, while keeping the overall fiscal
balance in surplus. The increase in capital spending in the second half of the year was well timed and
helped support growth. Public sector debt-to-GDP ratio declined to 39 percent, one third lower than
in 2005.
31.
Staff supports the government’s intention to adhere to the Social and Fiscal
Responsibility law in 2009. The limits for the overall fiscal deficit established in the law, including
under cyclical downturns, will contribute to solidify Panama’s fiscal prudence and maintain public
debt on a sustainable path. Staff considers that a fiscal deficit target of 1 percent of GDP for 2009 is
appropriate. The conservative revenue projections used in the formulation of the budget will allow
the authorities to attain the deficit target despite the weaker growth outlook. Given the downside
risks, the staff encourages the authorities to carefully monitor revenue performance, and be prepared
to restrain expenditure if revenues are weaker than envisaged. Staff commends the authorities for
having secured the external financing needed to finance the 2009 deficit, including through
borrowing from international markets at relatively favorable terms.
32.
Panama’s large financial system has demonstrated its resilience in the current global
financial turmoil. Aside from lower access to foreign credit lines, domestic banks’ balance sheets
have not been severely affected by the global crisis, and bank deposits have continued to support
positive credit growth. Staff commends the authorities for the stepped-up monitoring of banks, the
steps to augment liquidity, and the prompt intervention of Stanford Bank-Panama early this year.

24
33.
However, continued external turbulence could cause strains on the banking system. The
large share of foreign banks in the system and the significant amount of deposits owned by foreigners
are two potential channels of transmission of external disturbances that make banks maintain high
levels of liquidity. Staff encourages the authorities to accelerate its plans to establish a safety net for
banks, including through the creation of a contingent credit line. Staff welcomes the credit facility
under the Financial Stimulus Program (PEF), and encourages the authorities to monitor its
operations to ensure its effective use.
34.
Panama’s external competitiveness continues to improve, notwithstanding the recent
increase of the external current account deficit. The rapid expansion of export services and the
high levels of foreign direct investment reflect improvements in its external competitiveness. The
relatively large external current account deficits projected for the near term are largely related to the
expansion of the Panama Canal and the continued high level of FDI, and do not pose a risk to
external sustainability. After adjusting for these factors, the underlying current account balance is
projected to converge to its historic norm without major policy adjustments.
35.
Panama’s economic statistics and data provision are broadly adequate for surveillance.
Panama is in the process of updating the CPI based on a new Household, Income, and Expenditure
Survey, and is also preparing to change the base year of the national accounts statistics. A new law
(Law 10), in effect since January 2009, will provide the National Institute of Statistics and Census
greater administrative and resource autonomy. The authorities welcomed STA technical assistance to
address the under-estimation of the real value added in the Financial Services; staff encourages the
government to implement the proposed recommendations of the technical assistance mission as soon
as possible.
36.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Panama takes place on the standard
12-month cycle.

ANNEX I. SUMMARY OF ANNEXES
Fund Relations
As of February 28, 2009, Panama did not have any outstanding purchases or loans. The latest
precautionary SBA expired on March 29, 2002. The last Article IV consultation was completed by
the Executive Board on July 27, 2008. Panama has received wide-ranging TA over time including
most recently on national accounts statistics to evaluate the compilation of valued added of financial
services in March 2009. The last safeguards assessment was completed on July 12, 2001, and
concluded that the National Bank of Panama external audit mechanism was at the time adequate.
There is no resident representative.
Relations with the World Bank
The World Bank Board endorsed a Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Fiscal Years (FY) 2008–
10 in October 2007. The CPS includes a lending envelope of US$390–465 million over FY08–10,
divided into three Development Policy Loans (DPLs), seven new poverty-focused investment
projects, and one Technical Assistance (TA) loan. The Competitiveness and Public Financial
Management Development Policy Loans DPL (US$100 million) was approved by the World Bank
Board in December 2008 while the Protecting the Poor under Global Uncertainty DPL
(US$80 million) was approved on April 21, 2009.
Relations with the Inter-American Development Bank
A policy dialogue planned with the incoming government in May–June 2009 will set the stage for the
elaboration of a new 2010–14 country strategy by end-2009. The 2009 lending program to Panama
envisages 3 project loans and 2 program loans amounting to US$700 million including the Liquidity
and Growth Support Program (a publicly-guaranteed emergency loan to the state-owned National
Bank of Panama in support of on-lending to private firms amounting to US$500 million). The latter
was approved by the Executive Board on April 15, 2009.
Statistical Issues
Panama’s economic statistics and data provisions have some shortcomings, but are broadly adequate
for surveillance.

Safeguards Assessment
The National Bank of Panama (BNP) was subject to the transitional procedures with
respect to the Stand-By Arrangement approved on June 30, 2000. The assessment,
which only required a review of the BNP’s external audit mechanism, was completed
on July 12, 2001 and concluded that BNP’s external audit mechanism was at the time
adequate.
B. Nonfinancial Relations

VIII. Exchange Rate Arrangement:
Panama uses the U.S. dollar as the primary means of payment in the local economy.
Its national currency (balboa) is issued in the form of coins only and serves as a unit
of account. The exchange rate of the balboa is fixed at B 1 per U.S. dollar. Panama
has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4, and maintains an
exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers
for current international transactions.
IX.

ANNEX II—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
1.
The World Bank Board endorsed a Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Fiscal Year
(FY) 2008–10 in October 2007. 1 This followed the satisfactory implementation of the FY 2006–
07 Interim Strategy Note. The CPS aims to provide selective, demand-driven assistance that
deepens the Panama-Bank partnership and helps the government achieve its poverty and
inequality reduction goals. The World Bank opened a resident mission in Panama in
October 2007 as a reflection of the strengthened partnership with the government and a rapidly
expanding project portfolio.
2.
The CPS includes a lending envelope of US$390–465 million over FY 2008–10, divided
into three Development Policy Loans (DPLs), seven new poverty-focused investment projects,
and one Technical Assistance (TA) loan. The current portfolio consists of nine IBRD projects
and one GEF donation under implementation, totaling US$379.5 million, of which about
US$287 million are undisbursed (owing mainly to the relatively recent build-up of the portfolio).
The second Competitiveness and Public Financial Management DPL (US$100 million) was
approved by the World Bank Board in December 2008. In addition, two new investment loans
were approved in FY 2009: the Health Equity and Performance Improvement Project
(US$40 million) and Basic Education Quality Improvement Project (US$35million). Protecting
the Poor under Global Uncertainty DPL (US$80 million) is being considered for approval in
April 2009 to support country efforts to mitigate the impact of economic shocks on the poor
through improved targeting and coverage of social sector programs. The existing project
portfolio consists of the Social Protection Project, the Water and Sanitation Project, the Basic
Education Project II, the Public Policy Reform Technical Assistance Loan, the Land
Administration Project, the Rural Productivity Project, and the Global Environment Facility
Rural Productivity Project.
3.
Four new investment loans are currently in the preparation stage and are expected to be
presented to the Board in FY 2010. These include: the Sustainable Tourism Project
(US$30 million), Access to Land (US$45 million), Rural Micro Finance Project
(US$25 million), and the Urban Transport Project (US$50 million).
4.
The Bank is also providing research and analytical and technical assistance to Panama. A
draft Country Economic Memorandum, including an Investment Climate Assessment, was
prepared and was presented to the government. A Country Environment Analysis was delivered
FY 2008. For FY 2009, the Bank will prepare a Poverty Assessment and an Urban Development
for FY 2010. A set of Policy Notes are also being prepared to support the government transition
by providing presidential candidates with an additional source of information on key
development challenges and on-going policies and programs.

The World Bank’s FY 2009 starts in July 2008 and ends in June 2009.

5.
The Staffs of the World Bank and the IMF are working in close collaboration, including
frequent exchange of data and information and coordination of policy advice. Most recently,
Fund staff contributed to two Policy Notes on inflation and financial sector stability.

ANNEX III—RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
The IDB country strategy with Panama for 2005–09 aims at supporting sustainable economic
growth and reducing poverty. Two specific objectives have been formulated: (i) boosting the
economy’s competitiveness; and (ii) developing the country’s human and productive capital. The
strategy also incorporates efforts to strengthen governance and transparency. Specifically, loans
will finance infrastructure and projects related to the investment climate and adjustment to free
trade agreements, competitiveness and growth, social sector development, modernization of the
state and its regulatory framework, and capacity building for trade negotiations and regional
integration. A policy dialogue planned with the incoming government in May–June 2009 will set
the stage for the elaboration of a new 2010–14 country strategy by end-2009.
The 2008 lending program to the sovereign included six new project loans approved amounting
to US$125.2 million:
•

Technological Transformation Program, phase I: US$19.7 million

•

Housing Conditions Improvement Program: US$30 million

•

Colon Province Sustainable Development: US$20 million

•

Development Program for the Central Provinces: US$43 million

•

ETESA Investment and Corporate Transformation Program I: US$12.5 million

Moreover, the IDB’s private-sector lending arm approved a loan to the Panama Canal Authority
for US$400 million to help finance the expansion of the Canal. Other loans to the private sector
(for an outstanding stock of US$150 million) include four lines of credit under the Regional
Trade Finance Facilitation Program (TFFP).
The 2009 lending program to the sovereign envisages 3 project loans and 2 program loans
amounting to US$700 million. These are (respectively).
•

Support of IDAAN’s Investment Program: US$40 million

•

Transportation Loan phase II: US$ 50 million

•

National Tourism Program: US$10 million

•

Support of the Consolidation of the Energy Sector I: US$100 million

•

Liquidity and Growth Support Program (a publicly-guaranteed emergency loan to the
state-owned National Bank of Panama in support of on-lending to private firms for
working capital, commercial credits and trade credits, given tighter global credit
conditions resulting from the current crisis): US$500 million.

7

The IDB plans to approve 5 loans to the private sector, including a line of credit to extract wood
(US$22.7 million), and lines of credit to banks for specific sectors (US$15 million to BBVA,
2 loans totaling US$13 million to BAC Panamá S.A. and 1 loan for US$8 million to Multibank,
Inc.. The latter two loans are under the TFFP.

ANNEX IV—STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Substantial progress has been achieved in improving the accuracy, timeliness, and
publication of economic statistics. Data provided to the Fund are generally adequate for
surveillance. However, there is a need to improve coordination between the Comptroller
General’s Office, which is responsible for official economic statistics, and other government
entities, including the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Panama has participated in the
Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since December 2000. The metadata
and plans for improving the statistical system that are posted on the Dissemination Standards
Bulletin Board (DSBB) need updating.
Real Sector
2.
The authorities completed a revision of the national accounts in 2004, based on
the 1993 SNA, with a change in the base year from 1982 to 1996. Revised data are available
for the period 1996−2008 from the Comptroller General’s Office (CGO)
(www.contraloria.gob.pa). In 2005, the authorities introduced quarterly GDP estimates
beginning in 1996. Current data are released with a lag of approximately three months. In
addition, the index of monthly economic activity is released with a lag of up to two months.
Although the timeliness of real sector data provision has improved, the data are often subject
to sizable revisions. The World Bank is supporting a project for changing the base year of the
national accounts to 2007, which is in its initial phase.
3.
The IMF national accounts technical assistance mission conducted in March 2009
noted the limited coverage of financial activity as well as the overestimation of the deflator
used to calculate the financial services output at constant prices. The revised financial
activity GDP estimates, and the related overall GDP revision, will be published in October
2009.
4.
A new Household Income and Expenditure Survey was conducted during 2007–08,
and the National Institute of Statistics and Census is in the process of updating the base,
basket, and weights of the CPI. The Household Income and Expenditure Survey also
provided new data on poverty levels, which were last estimated in 2003.
Government Finances
5.
The Ministry of Finance compiles budget execution data for the central government
and data on nonfinancial public sector operations (central government, public enterprises,
and agencies) on a cash basis. Monthly and quarterly data have been reported up to
December 2008 for the budgetary central government operations (www.mef.gob.pa).

9

6.
Further efforts are needed to improve the quality of fiscal data. Apart from timeliness,
data consistency in terms of transfers between public sector units should be improved; and
the coverage of the investment program should be made universal. Since September 2004,
the operational balance of the Panama Canal Authority (PCA) was excluded from the official
definition of the nonfinancial public sector used for fiscal policy purposes. Information on
the Panama Canal Authority (PCA) is only available in the Annual Report posted in its
website (www.pancanal.com) on a fiscal year basis. There is a need to ensure a consistent
and timely flow of PCA statistics on a calendar year basis. The authorities have received
technical assistance from STA to implement the government Finance Statistics Manual 2001
(GFSM 2001) and a FAD fiscal ROSC mission took place in October 2005. In February 2004
a STA mission undertook a comprehensive review of the coverage and methodology of fiscal
data, and suggested a tentative timetable to migrate to the GFSM 2001 but resource
constraints prevented substantial progress.
Monetary Accounts
7.
Panama has been publishing financial sector data based on the new standardized
report forms (SRFs) for monetary statistics in the IFS Supplement since March 2007 and
participates in a regional project for harmonizing monetary and financial statistics in Central
America and the Dominican Republic. The aim is to facilitate cross-country comparison and
regional analysis. Provision of monthly data by the two public financial institutions, the
National Bank of Panama and the Savings Bank (Caja de Ahorros), is regular and prompt.
Monthly data on the operations of the domestic and international commercial and savings
banks is prepared by the Superintendency of Banks, and posted on its website
(www.superbancos.gob.pa) and reported to STA with a lag of one to two months. The stateowned development banks, the Agricultural Development Bank, and the Mortgage Bank are
not regulated by the Superintendency of Banks and no data is reported to the Fund.
Balance of Payments
8.
Quarterly data is available with a delay of about one quarter, and is subject to
revisions thereafter. Revised estimates in key trade and investment data may result in
substantial revisions of the current account of the balance of payments. These revisions may
reflect improvements in coverage, but they also suggest that there is room for improvement
in quality control procedures. Data are not yet available on nonfinancial private sector debt
and transactions involving financial derivatives, resulting in large swings in errors and
omissions. Quarterly International Investment Position (IIP) data have been compiled
since 2002, and annual data are available since 1998. The most recent balance of payments
and IIP data pertain to December 2008.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Panama
June 1, 2009

1.
This statement summarizes key developments in Panama since the issuance of the
staff report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation. It does not change the thrust of the staff
appraisal.
2.
Ricardo Martinelli, the candidate from Cambio Democrático (CD), the
opposition party, won the May 3 presidential election by a large margin. The CD
alliance also won 42 of the 71 seats in congress. The new administration is scheduled to take
office on July 1 and is expected to continue with policies that promote private-sector led
growth and foreign investment. In addition, the new government plans to carry out a revenue
neutral tax reform (with a view to introduce a single income tax rate) and increase investment
on infrastructure.
3.
The latest indicators on activity are somewhat mixed but, on the whole, remain
consistent with the staff’s projections of real GDP growth of 3 percent in 2009. The monthly
indicator of economic activity (IMAE) increased by 2.9 percent (cyclically adjusted) in the first
quarter of March 2009 compared to a year earlier. First quarter data for tax revenue, social
security contributions, bank credit, and bank deposits all showed growth in the low double
digits, in stark contrast with other countries in the region. Other sectors, including
transportation, communication, tourism, and retail sales also posted positive growth.
Nonetheless, first quarter data for some sectors (i.e., the Colon Free Zone, residential
construction, nontraditional agriculture, and auto sales) showed a decline in activity.
4.
Although the pace of disinflation has slowed, inflation remains in line with staff’s
projection for end-2009 (3.2 percent). Inflation in April was 3.7 percent (y/y), the same as
in March, owing to a relatively high monthly rate (0.4 percent) driven by increases in the
prices of fuel and education.
5.
Fiscal data for the first quarter remains broadly consistent with the target of an
overall fiscal deficit of 1 percent of GDP in 2009. The balance of the nonfinancial public
sector (NFPS) excluding the Canal Authority (ACP) for the first quarter was 0.6 percent of
GDP, similar to the 2008 outturn. While tax revenues were 13 percent higher than those in
the first quarter in 2008, nontax revenues were significantly lower.
6.
Traffic through the Canal has declined much less than global trade. In the first
quarter of 2009, the number of vessels and cargo tonnage declined by 1½ percent and
3.3 percent, respectively, compared to their levels in the same period of 2008. At the same
time, total revenues from the Canal increased by nearly 12 percent as a result of higher tariffs
(tariffs were further increased in May, as had been scheduled).
7.
The new government is planning to cancel the US$500 million loan approved by
the IDB in April 2009 for on-lending to banks. The banks have indicated that the cost of
these IDB funds is too high and that they do not foresee any demand for them. On a related
development, preliminary data suggest that correspondent bank credit lines have returned to
normal levels in recent weeks.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with
Panama

On June 1, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Panama.1
Background
Strong economic fundamentals helped contain the adverse impact of the global economic
downturn and financial turmoil. Real GDP in 2008 grew by 9.2 percent, following an annual
average growth of 8.8 percent in 2004-07. However, a decline in global trade and tighter
credit conditions are becoming evident and real growth in 2009 is projected to slow to
3 percent. The high-growth period has led to a significant fall in poverty and a sharp decline
in the unemployment rate, from 10.9 percent at the end of 2003 to 4.2 percent in August
of 2008. Inflation, after peaking at 10 percent in September 2008, driven by the spike in
international food and fuel prices and demand pressures, has declined rapidly and reached
3.7 percent in March 2009. The external current account deficit widened to 12.5 percent of
GDP in 2008, as imports continued to increase at a relatively fast pace while exports slowed
reflecting lower trade in the Colon Free Zone and a decline in external demand.
Panama’s large banking system has weathered the global financial crisis relatively well. The
system is well-capitalized, highly liquid, and has strong financial soundness indicators. In
addition, recent assessments by the Superintendency of Banks has not revealed exposure

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

to complex structured assets. Following the intensification of the global financial crisis in
September 2008, access to foreign credit lines declined, but the situation stabilized, and
deposits and credit have been broadly stable. At the same time, banks have increased their
holdings of liquidity partly to self insure and in response to higher perceived risk.
Public finances remained on strong footing and the nonfinancial public sector had a positive
balance for the third subsequent year, albeit more modest than in 2007. Excluding the
Panama Canal Authority (ACP), the nonfinancial public sector surplus in 2008 was
equivalent to 0.4 percent. Continued robust revenues enabled a further large increase in
public investment—from 5 percent of GDP in 2007 to 7 percent in 2008—and allowed for an
increase in social spending of about 1 percent of GDP to partially offset the rapid increase in
the cost of living. The rapid GDP growth, combined with the fiscal surplus, led to a further
decline in the public debt-to-GDP ratio to 39 percent by end-2008.The Panama Canal
expansion, estimated to cost US$5.3 billion, is broadly on track, and the external financing
for the project has been secured on very favorable terms. A new Social and Fiscal
Responsibility Law (SFRL)—enacted in June 2008—and a Public-Private Partnership (PPP)
draft law that is being finalized, are important reforms that will further strengthen fiscal
management over the medium term.

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that Panama is facing the global economic crisis from a position
of strength, with sound economic fundamentals helping to contain the adverse impact of the
world economic downturn and financial turmoil. In particular, Directors commended the wellregulated banking sector, sustained fiscal consolidation, and Canal expansion project, which
will allow Panama to preserve macroeconomic stability and continue growing during 2009,
albeit at a slower pace than in recent years.
Directors noted the widening of the external current account deficit and the rise in inflation
during 2008 was influenced by transitory factors. High imports and weak export performance
were partly a reflection of the world food and fuel shock and the slowdown of external
demand. Buoyant capital inflows, including foreign direct investment, more than financed the
current account deficit, and inflation fell rapidly as world prices normalized. Looking forward,
Directors noted that downside risks remain given the difficult global environment.
Directors commended the authorities for the fiscal consolidation of recent years and the
associated rapid decline in the public debt-to-GDP ratio. They welcomed the continued
strong revenue performance and one-off factors that had allowed a substantial increase in
capital spending and social programs, which had supported activity and helped protect the
poor despite the deterioration in the external environment. Directors also commended the
authorities for securing external financing for the Panama Canal expansion project on very
favorable terms, and for making good progress in the implementation of the project.
Directors welcomed the effective adoption of the Social and Fiscal Responsibility Law
(SFRL) to help strengthen fiscal discipline, and enhance transparency and accountability.
While recognizing the challenges of adhering to a fiscal deficit target of 1 percent of GDP

3
during 2009, Directors encouraged the authorities to persevere in their efforts to comply with
the target stipulated in the SFRL in order to bolster credibility of Panama’s new fiscal
framework. Directors recommended that the authorities quickly adopt guidelines that would
allow rapid modification of the fiscal deficit target should growth decelerate more rapidly
than envisaged.
Directors welcomed the resilience of Panama’s financial system to the global financial crisis
reflecting, in part, the relatively strong liquidity position of banks. They noted that reduced
access to external credit lines had not unduly hampered the normal functioning of the
system, and that while deposit and credit growth had slowed, they remained positive.
Directors welcomed the steps taken to allow more timely monitoring of banks’ liquidity, asset
quality, and risk management practices, as well as the rapid resolution of Stanford BankPanama. They also welcomed the timely adoption of the new Bank Law that will enhance
cross border supervision and improve the bank resolution framework.
In light of ongoing external vulnerabilities and the absence of a lender of last resort,
Directors encouraged continued vigilance and further strengthening of the banking system.
They noted the authorities’ interest in creating a mechanism to provide emergency liquidity
support for transitory liquidity shortages, which could reduce the banks’ need to self-insure.
Directors observed that the inclusion of Panama in a list of tax havens released by the
OECD presented additional challenges. They welcomed the authorities’ intention to respond
constructively, and called upon them to reach agreement on the steps needed to normalize
its status.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the
IMF's views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the
country (or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article
IV consultations with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional
level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with

Statement by Paulo Nogueira Batista, Executive Director for Panama
and Alfredo Maciá, Advisor to Executive Director
June 1, 2009
1.
On behalf of the Panamanian authorities, we would like to express our sincere
appreciation of Mrs. Judith Gold’s policy advice and her trustworthiness as Mission
Chief to Panama. During this time, her support has been valuable, constructive, and
crucial in guiding policy implementation and also in the preparation of legislation. The
authorities asked us to convey their best wishes to her on her new assignments.
2.
The Panamanian economic performance in 2008 remained robust with GDP
growing as much as 9.2 percent supported by strong domestic demand. Although tourism,
port activities, free zone trade, construction, and bank intermediation did well last year,
these sectors will be adversely affected during 2009 by the global economic slowdown.
During the first quarter of 2009, the Colon Free Zone (CFZ) activity was down
4.3 percent, new car sales fell by 20 percent, but tourism was up 3.2 percent compared to
2008. With the Canal expansion in high-spending gear during 2009-2012, a public works
program estimated at 6 percent GDP, and FDI at about 7 percent of GDP, the authorities
expect a soft-landing in 2009 with GDP growth above 3 percent. The projections of the
Economic Council for Latin America and the Caribbean (CEPAL) for 2009 indicate that
Panama will grow by 4 percent, the highest rate in the region. The WEO projections
indicate 3 percent growth for Panama in 2009, the second highest in the Western
Hemisphere after Peru. Inflation eased to 3.7 percent at end-March 2009 from 8.3 percent
at end-2008 as oil and commodity prices receded. Open unemployment is down to
4.2 percent from 11 percent in 2004. According to CEPAL, poverty fell from 37 percent
to 29 percent of total population, and extreme poverty from 19 percent to 12 percent. The
authorities remain committed to reducing poverty.
3.
The policies implemented to protect the purchasing power of low income groups
and assist the most vulnerable in facing the rise in food and oil prices up to mid-2008 will
be continued. On the supply side, the “consumers assistance program”(PAC) discussed in
our last Article IV consultation, which included the elimination of import duties on
agricultural inputs and price support policies as well as low interest rates on agricultural
loans, helped Panama achieve over 90 percent self-sufficiency in rice in the 2008-09 crop
season. The cash-transfer program “Red de Oportunidades”, the school feedingprograms, subsidies on cooking gas and electricity, and low-pension retiree adjustments
are included in the 2009 budget. Lower fuel prices have allowed the diesel-subsidy for
public transportation to be reduced, supporting policy efforts for improving the targeting
of subsidies.

2
4.
The sharp increase of food and fuel prices until mid-2008 exerted pressure on
Panama’s external position. In addition, the 2008 surge of 26 percent in FDI and the
enhanced public works investments drive pushed up domestic demand. This combination
of events widened the current account deficit to 12.5 percent GDP in 2008 from 9 percent
in the previous year. This deficit was fully covered by FDI and other capital inflows. The
Canal expansion has a high import-content and will continue to exert pressure on the
current account in the medium term.
5.
The non-financial public sector (NFPS) posted a surplus for a third consecutive
year in 2008, in spite of increased expenditures with public works projects and vulnerablegroup programs. The surplus was due to high tax revenues and a one-off inflow from cell
phone concessions. The primary balance of the NFPS was 3.6 percent of GDP in 2008 and
remained positive in the first quarter of 2009. NFPS total revenues increased 9.4 percent in
relation to 2007, with tax revenues rising 16.5 percent and non-tax revenues 8.1 percent.
The authorities maintained a prudent wage control policy. The central government’s ratio
of wages to current revenues declined from 43 percent in 2004 to 26 percent in 2008. The
ratio of interest payments to current revenues decreased from 29 percent in 2004 to
17 percent in 2008. Revenue projections for 2009 are on the conservative side, in line with
Staff’s views.
6.
The authorities are committed to a NFPS deficit of 1 percent of GDP for 2009, as
called for in the new fiscal responsibility law (SFRL) approved in mid-2008. The new
SFRL sets a cap of 50 percent on the commitment of operating expenditures to provide the
incoming administration with adequate budget support until end-2009. This cap does not
apply to public investments and debt interest payments.
7.
Net public debt of the NFPS has fallen from 62 percent of GDP in 2004 to
40.2 percent at end-2008. The authorities have consistently pursued a debt-reduction
policy. In the beginning of this year, Standard and Poors (S&P) rated the sovereign BB+
with a stable outlook, and Fitch Ratings ratified Panama’s long-term debt BB+ with a
positive outlook.
Investment Activity
8.
The expansion of the Panama Canal (PCA) involves a peak construction period in
2009-2012, with an average investment of over US$850 million per annum. In 2008, the
expansion represented 2.2 percent of GDP, and should reach 3.5 percent of GDP in 2009
constituting an important anti-cyclical fiscal effort. The largest contract of over US$3
billion for the ¨locks construction¨ received three tenders from international consortiums in
March 2009. The technical and financial tenders are under evaluation for a final selection
by mid-2009. PCA assured its full financing needs of US$2.3 billion last October 2008
from five multilateral organizations. Revenues for FY2008-09 are expected to increase

3
about 4 percent as new tariffs fall in place in May and October 2009. These revenue
expectations should materialize in spite of an expected drop of 5 percent in tonnage for the
period.
9.
During 2008, the government remained committed to a robust public investment
policy as the global crisis exerted pressure on the economy. The Tocumen International
Airport (US$200 million) was mostly concluded by end-2008. The Panama-Colon
Highway (US$270 million) and the Balboa Avenue coastal-extension (US$200 million)
are to be concluded in June 2009. The Bay of Panama sewage and drainage project of over
US$500 million, financed through multilaterals, is under construction. Private sector
investments, which carry strong FDI support, are concentrated in energy, telecom, ports,
and tourism. In the energy sector, French Suez concluded two thermo-projects in 2008 and
one hydro project will go on stream in 2009 for a total investment of US$650 million. The
energy regulatory authority informed investments of US$1.3 billion in hydro and
US$520 million in thermo projects with S$970 million to be implemented during 2009.
Petroterminales’ oil pipeline and storage facilities, a US$500 million project, began to be
constructed in 2008. In telecoms, Digicel (Ireland) and Claro (Mexico) cellular
concessions started their operations in December 2008 and in April 2009 with investments
of US$350 and US$150 million, respectively. In so far as the expansion of ports is
concerned, a total of US$760 million in investments is expected during the 2008-2010
period. Hotel construction is estimated at US$200 million in 2009, according to the
American Chamber of Commerce. The construction sector is expected to target the high
demand for “middle and low-income housing” estimated at 140,000 units and to move
away from high-rise condos that dominated the sector during 2007-08. This wide range of
public investments sets the stage for private investments in 2009.
Financial Sector and Other Issues
10.
The banking sector has remained fairly untouched by the sub-prime crisis. It
continues to be profitable, highly liquid and well supervised. The capital adequacy ratio
remained at 14 percent. Absence of a lender of last resort in the system induced banks to
strengthen their liquidity levels in face of the present external conditions. Liquidity
levels in the system have increased from 58 percent in November 2008 to 62.7 at endMarch 2009. Non-performing loans (NPL) increased slightly from 1.1 percent at end2007 to 1.3 percent at the end of the first quarter 2009, according to the Superintendency
of Banks (SB). Given the strong presence of foreign banks in the system, parent banks’
liquidity deterioration in 2008 had a significant effect in Panama, forcing partial
tightening of credit access for trade and commerce. In response, the authorities activated
a US$1.1 billion stimulus package (PEF) supported by IDB, CAF and Banco Nacional
(Banconal). The SB has confirmed that banks are now requesting access to PEF funds.
In addition, foreign banks have already started to ease access to their credit lines.
Banking sector performance registered promising advances in the first quarter of 2009,

4
according to the SB report. Foreign deposits have increased 30 percent. Despite the
increase in liquidity levels, total new credits are up 7.3 percent in the first quarter 2009
compared to 2008, with credit to industry, commerce and mortgages increasing
considerably. Construction credit also went up 13 percent, though personal credit has
decreased 13 percent.
11.
Authorities are cognizant of the risks related to the continued world economic
slowdown and have expressed interest in pursuing the establishment of a safety net to
preserve the existing high confidence level in the financial sector and enhance its
capacity to withstand unforeseen liquidity stresses should external conditions deteriorate
further. The incoming administration will evaluate if circumstances warrant such a
decision.
12.
Panama has taken a positive view to improving its cooperation on internationally
agreed tax standards and other issues. This cooperation was agreed with the OECD in
2002. The authorities will share with the incoming administration their views on possible
future actions in this area.
13.
The new administration will start on July 1st. Its top priority is to sustain strong
economic growth in the medium term. This will be supported by strong public investment
programs, including the construction of an inner-city Metro system, the expansion of
transport infrastructure, as well as the continuation of the Panama Canal expansion. One
of the main fiscal pillars is a new tax reform to introduce a flat-tax, simplify the tax system
to curtail evasion, improve the effectiveness of tax collection, and maintain a strong fiscal
stance. Social programs will be supported and expanded. The new administration sees the
approval of the FTA with the United States as a crucial step to support growth and private
investment opportunities in Panama.
