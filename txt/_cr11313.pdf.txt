Staff Report for the 2011 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2011 Consultation with Albania
Approved by Juha Kähkönen and James Roaf
August 23, 2011

Executive Summary
Background: Albania weathered the global crisis well, owing to generally sound policies
during the preceding boom, which provided policy space to mitigate the crisis fallout. The
crisis also ushered in the needed rebalancing of the economy, and the very large external
imbalance has narrowed. However, TFP growth has decelerated, the budget repeatedly slipped,
and policy makers have yet to come to grips with the post-boom environment. Politics remain
divisive and threaten consensus on reform, including measures needed to progress with EU
candidacy. Short-term risks are elevated given Albania’s large exposure to the euro-area
periphery.
Challenges: The key challenge is to make the policy framework consistent with the
achievement of external sustainability, thereby reversing the decline in TFP growth. In the near
term, contingency planning with respect to euro-area periphery developments is essential.
Policy discussions: Fiscal consolidation is the lynchpin for a sustainable medium-term
outlook. This requires more realistic budgeting, and staff recommended an expenditure-based
fiscal rule tied to public debt reduction to 50 percent of GDP over the medium term. Also, it is
essential to address delays in key structural reforms, notwithstanding political difficulties.
Financial sector policy needs to remain nimble and quickly adapt to evolving risks.
Authorities’ views: There was a high degree of agreement in the discussions, especially on the
short-run need for fiscal measures and on financial sector policies. The authorities had a more
favorable medium term outlook, which also implied less of an adjustment need, and were not
yet ready to decide on the specifics of a fiscal rule.
Discussions were held in Tirana during June 9–22. The mission comprised Mr. Bell (head),
Ms. Chen, Mr. Stepanyan (all EUR), Mr. Eich (FAD), Ms. Araujo (SPR), and Ms. Spahia
(Tirana-based economist). The mission met with Prime Minister Berisha, the Minister of
Finance, other Ministers, the Governor of the Bank of Albania, other senior officials, and
representatives of financial institutions, corporations, donors, academia, and think tanks.

I. CONTEXT—PATCHY ADJUSTMENT TO THE POST BOOM
1.
The global crisis left Albania fairly unscathed and ushered in the needed
economic rebalancing. Recession was avoided, and the growth shock was less severe than
elsewhere in Europe (Figure 1). Meanwhile, external sustainability has begun to improve,
and the country was able to place a

(HP-filter with lambda=100; lambda=6.25 yields similar results)
struggled to align budget policies with the
new environment, putting already high public debt on a rising path. This heightens financing
risk and also threatens fiscal dominance for monetary policy. Albania’s exposure to the euro
periphery, including a large presence of euro-periphery banks, heightens near-term risks.
3.
Politics have been difficult. After fatalities during protests in January against the
contested 2009 election, the May 2011 local elections were keenly anticipated. The vote was
close and went largely smoothly. However, the very tight race in Tirana—a narrow win for
the incumbent mayor and opposition leader—was overturned in a controversial recount.
Renewed controversy is thus likely ahead of the 2013 general elections, putting into question
the achievement of a wide political consensus for key priorities, including those related to
advancing Albania’s EU candidacy.

II. BACKGROUND
A. An Uneven Start to Rebalancing
4.
The switch from the pre-crisis domestic-demand led growth model is imparting
significant headwinds. Though imbalances never reached the stark levels observed in some
other countries, Albania is no exception in the region, where the post-2000 economic boom
was associated with significant increases in domestic demand. Still, balance sheets needed to
adjust and the tighter financing conditions following the onset of the crisis sharply crimped
growth (notwithstanding the considerable margins of data uncertainty (Annex I)).

Despite improvement, external imbalances remain elevated, and foreign demand
could not fully offset the domestic demand drain. In 2010, strong export growth,
especially in manufactured goods, electricity, and

helped narrow the current account deficit to

in 2008. Still, this adjustment lags behind many

was to some extent one-off, in particular in

electricity, where abundant rainfalls boosted

also lifted export values.

6.
The financing mix of the current account has improved, lowering the importance
of remittances and boosting direct investment.


FDI withstood the trend decline in the region, overtaking remittances as the main
financing source. With a record €827 million in 2010, it accounted for roughly
one-quarter of FDI into the entire SEE region. Major destinations were

telecommunication, banking, manufacturing, and increasingly hydroelectricity, oil,
and gas. Reflecting the importance of large-scale privatizations and concessions, FDI
has primarily been in the form of equity capital, e.g., greenfield investments and
cross-border mergers and acquisitions; in the banking sector it has recently tilted
toward reinvested earnings and capital injections. With the privatization program now
essentially complete, FDI has slowed sharply in the first quarter of 2011.


Donor financing remains stable as European donors are increasingly coordinating in
facilitating the integration of Albania with the European Union, and emerging donors,
such as the Islamic Development Bank and the Abu Dhabi development fund, are
raising their profile.



Remittances are only slowly recovering due to economic uncertainties in major
source countries such as Greece and Italy, but perhaps also reflecting a secular trend,
though data problems make an assessment
somewhat uncertain (Annex II).

Inflation largely stayed in the target range
of 3±1 percent. The monetary policy stance has
been accommodative: in July 2010 the Bank of
Albania (BOA) eased its policy rate in response to
fiscal consolidation; it moved to tighten in
early 2011, when headline inflation overshot its
target band as a result of rising food and fuel prices.
Core inflation and inflation expectations have
remained stable throughout.

8.
The banking system has been resilient, but declining asset quality is a concern.
Notwithstanding a steep decline in deposits and increase in problem loans, banks remained
generally sound throughout the crisis with adequate capital; recently profits have begun to
recover as well. However, nonperforming loans rose from 3 percent pre-crisis to a record
high of 15 percent in April 2011, relatively high levels even in the region, and a major
concern for the banking sector. This is partly caused by institutional and judicial weaknesses
that have hampered collateral execution. Strict provisioning rules do not factor in any
recovery values from existing collateral, thereby building in some buffer against future
adverse developments. Deposits have been steadily increasing and credit growth moderating
(9 percent in 2010 and 10 percent in 2011:Q1).

B. Recent Policy Challenges
9.
The budget has been wrong-footed by slowing growth, resulting in stop-and-go
fiscal policy. Expansionary budgets for both 2010 and 2011 were predicated on
over-optimistic revenue assumptions. In the event, the 2010 budget deficit was held at
3.7 percent of GDP only after significant mid-year budget cuts, about half of which were
achieved through reductions in budgeted capital spending, which dropped from 8.8 percent of
GDP in 2009 to 5.8 percent of GDP. Reflecting the discretionary nature of the cuts and their
implementation mid-year, payment arrears of some 0.7 percent arose.
10.
Public debt has drifted up, heightening near-term rollover risk and constraining
budgetary flexibility. Debt is approaching the 60 percent of GDP statutory limit, a relatively
high level compared with emerging markets (average of 47 percent) and regional peers. With
an average interest of some 6 percent, and notwithstanding a still large share of concessional
external debt, debt servicing cost exceeds 3 percent of GDP or 15 percent of tax revenue.
Moreover, debt is set to increase further under the baseline and debt sustainability further put
at risk by standard shocks. Including personnel expenditure and social insurance outlays,
pre-committed spending amounts to three quarters of revenue, severely constraining budget
flexibility.

11.
Financial sector policies were adjusted to safeguard financial stability and revive
credit growth. During the crisis, macroprudential policies—including higher capital
requirements, tighter liquidity, and credit risk controls—were implemented. With steadily
increasing deposit funding, improved liquidity conditions, and adequate capital buffers, some
of the regulations were lifted. At the same time, market volatility surrounding the euro-area
periphery was reflected in the domestic markets, with some signs of increased stress with
local euro deposit rates edging up and banks competing for liquidity or to build net asset
positions with parents. All Greek-owned banks remained in compliance with prudential ratios
although their liquidity levels have been somewhat reduced. In response, the authorities have
stepped up liquidity monitoring across the system and are contemplating increasing
prudential liquidity ratios. There was recognition that achieving lower loan-to-deposit ratios
needed to be balanced with continued parent bank exposure. In a similar vein, the
remuneration of required foreign currency reserves was suspended.
III. OUTLOOK
12.
The staff’s baseline scenario is for continued moderate growth, with some
improvements in external sustainability, albeit subject to considerable risks. Significant
catch-up potential remains to be tapped. However, the elevated fiscal deficits and public debt
under unchanged policies are not consistent with external sustainability and stand in the way
of more vigorous and broader-based growth.


GDP growth is projected to decelerate to some 2½ percent in 2011, reflecting a weak
second quarter. Staff expect a gradual acceleration to potential of about 4 percent over the
medium term, largely driven by external demand, which is in turn boosted by past
investments in transport and energy infrastructure coming on line (Box 1). Private
consumption and investment are likely to remain more subdued. In particular remittances,
a key driver of household disposable income, could further weaken on the back of lagged
effects from developments in the neighboring euro area periphery, while lending to
households should remain moderate, as balance sheet repair progresses. On the other
hand, lending to companies is projected to grow somewhat faster. With privatization
coming to a close, greater investment and savings need policy reforms.



Inflation should remain within the target band, helped by the absence of administered
price increases in 2011 and projected global price trends. In the medium term, as the
output gap is closing, stronger retail competition could dampen price increases.



The current account deficit is expected to shrink on the back of continued buoyant
exports—notwithstanding the loss of some favorable one-off effects—and moderate
imports growth in 2011. In the medium term, the current account deficit would gradually
decline further. However, reflecting insufficient savings under an unchanged policy
scenario, it is not projected to reach sustainable levels, and (currently adequate) reserves
will erode. As a result, the real exchange rate, which—after a cumulative nominal

10
depreciation of close to 20 percent since the peak of the crisis—is currently competitive
and stable, would become overvalued over the medium term (Box 2).
Box 1. Potential Growth Estimate
Statistical filter methods as well as the production function
approach suggest that Albania’s potential growth has fallen
over recent years, mainly on account of a decrease in total
factor productivity (TFP) growth.1/ These results are in line
with standard growth accounting exercises that were
conducted for the new EU Member States in Central Europe
and the Baltics. They also pointed to a dominant role of
TFP dynamics for growth, with capital ranking second, and
labor making only a small—or, as a consequence of labor
shedding during economic restructuring, even negative—
contribution (Schadler et al., 2006).

A common shortcoming of the statistical filter and production function approaches is their failure to pick up
“bulky” structural supply shocks to potential growth (see, for instance, IMF WP 08/275 on the effect on
potential growth of the concentrated coming-on-stream of several car factories in Slovakia in 2006–07). Thus,
the recent completion of a major road corridor to Kosovo could constitute such a shock that increased potential
output by more than just adding this infrastructure investment to the capital stock. However, even if this is the
case, it does not change the conclusion that ceteris paribus, the development of total factor productivity and the
associated loss of structural reform momentum weighs down on potential output.
Reform delays could prevent the recent improvements in infrastructure and Albania’s other competitive
advantages (such as low wage cost, a very flexible labor market, a flat income tax regime, etc.) from coming to
full fruition. Structural reforms in bottleneck areas such as the rule of law, collateral execution, education, IT
infrastructure, a still unreliable electricity provision (mainly due to deficient regulatory implementation), etc.
are therefore urgent—the more so since fiscal policy is severely constrained and the revival of private sector
investments hinges on the improvement of the business environment.

HP-filters were run for annual GDP data with the standard value for lambda of 100 and the Ravn and Uhlig (2002) suggested 6.25. The
production function approach was Cobb-Douglas, where TFP and labor input were smoothed with an HP-filter (again lambda values of 100
and 6.25); the assumptions are: capital and labor shares of 0.3 and 0.7, respectively; a capital-to-output ratio in 1996 of 3; and depreciation
of 8 percent thereafter.

Box 2. Exchange Rate Assessment
The real exchange rate has recently returned to equilibrium. After a period of appreciation, the Albanian lek
depreciated by about 5 percent in nominal effective terms in 2010. Following a similar trajectory, the Real
Effective Exchange Rate (REER) has now reverted to 2003 levels. Three CGER methodologies are used to
assess the REER. The equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) approach is based on a CEE panel-based
regression model which estimates a long-run cointegrating relationship between the REER and a group of
fundamentals. This approach suggests the REER reached equilibrium in 2009 and moved to a slight
undervaluation (close to 5 percent) at end-2010. The set of fundamentals includes relative productivity, terms of
trade, and government consumption.

Underlying current account and external sustainability analysis, however, point to prospective
medium-run overvaluation. The macroeconomic balance (MB) approach, which uses a panel regression of the
current account on the fiscal balance, the oil balance, net foreign assets, old age dependency, FDI, population
and output growth, and a remittances dummy, shows that the projected underlying current account deficit is
above the norm by end-2016.1/ The real exchange rate adjustment that would close the gap between the
projected current account and its norm would be a depreciation of 12 percent. The external sustainability (ES)
approach indicates that a real depreciation of 25 percent would be required to stabilize the NFA to GDP ratio at
its estimated end-2009 level.

13.
Risks to the outlook are weighted to the downside. Uncertainty emanating from the
euro-area periphery is the key near-term vulnerability. Albania has large trade, labor-market,
and banking-system links with Greece and Italy. Especially the latter two links could result in
substantial spillovers with banking-system contagion potentially the most severe near-term
risk, while sharply lower remittances could result in a significant GDP shock. Other risks are
also mostly to the downside. Exports may slow down in a less buoyant global outlook and
private domestic demand could falter. High public debt, rollover risks, and interest costs also
leave the country exposed to a downturn in investors’ risk appetite, with knock-on effects on
confidence in the financial system. On the upside, higher foreign demand and capital inflows
could lead a stronger recovery of domestic demand and an improved political situation may
boost confidence.
14.
The authorities viewed the outlook as more favorable, expecting a quick return to
economic growth of 5 percent or higher in the near term. They pointed to the country’s
strong fundamentals and private sector base, as well as large public investment in
infrastructure in recent years, from which they expected higher returns than implied in the
staff baseline. High current account deficits were seen as temporary and increasingly
financed by FDI and concessional development lending. The authorities stressed that the
potential magnitude of the shocks emanating from the euro periphery was such that no single
country could offset them fully, and they expected the EU’s crisis management to be
effective in redressing any uncertainties. They also reported on their proactive contacts with
regional and European supervisors and central banks in advancing contingency planning.
They agreed that a Fund program could also help curtail contagion but so far saw no need in
requesting Fund financial support.
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
15.
Policy discussions focused on realigning the policy framework with the ongoing
rebalancing of the economy. In line with the generally favorable reception of past
Article IV consultations, there was again a high degree of consensus in the policy
discussions. Both sides agreed that the simultaneous achievement of higher growth,
resilience against risks, and external sustainability is within reach, especially if progress is
made on EU integration. Staff cautioned, however, that policies needed to be strengthened to

13
achieve these goals. In particular, a policy framework based on further fiscal consolidation,
redressing critical structural reform priorities, and maintaining financial sector stability could
raise growth to 5 percent while bringing the current account deficit in line with its underlying
equilibrium over the medium term (Figure 3).

A. Credible Post-Boom Fiscal Consolidation
16.
The fiscal policy discussions were overshadowed by a renewed large budget
slippage. At the time of the discussions in June, a considerable underperformance of
the 2011 budget had become evident, as revenue was again falling significantly short of
original budget projections. Staff and authorities agreed that the deficit should be held close
to the original 3.5 percent of GDP target not in the least to avoid breaching the legal limit on
public debt of 60 percent of GDP. The authorities subsequently adopted the required cuts in a
mid-year budget review in July. Given the limited time available to effect the correction, the
cuts once more centered on one-offs, especially in capital spending, without addressing the
underlying structural imbalance.
17.
Against this background, the potential need for further adjustment over the
medium term became the focus of discussions. The authorities considered that a return to
higher rates of growth and their ongoing efforts to boost tax administration would boost
revenues and relieve budget pressures. Staff agreed that the budget was negatively affected
by lower growth, but also viewed the budget as contributing to underperforming growth,
reflecting three key factors:


been a key driver behind the high current

wage bill.



With market financing increasingly important, unchecked debt will present
greater risks to macroeconomic stability even in a benign external environment. As
Albania moves away from concessional borrowing to commercial debt, interest costs
are likely to increase and average maturity to decline, and risk premia could rise
further.



Stop-and-go fiscal policies have real costs. This practice makes annual budgeting
unreliable and overly political, and imperils multi-year public investment targets

(with potential contingent liabilities from not honoring contractual obligations) with
adverse effects on private-sector confidence and investment plans, thereby potentially
further dampening TFP growth. The recent ad-hoc cuts have also resulted in large
payment arrears, which have the potential to trigger a non-payment chain in the
private sector, with adverse implications for economic activity.

that public debt would constitute a
desirable anchor and considered that the existing legal debt limit of 60 percent of GDP had
proven its worth. They were looking at augmenting it with a mechanism to guard against
procyclicality, but had not yet reached definite conclusions on a new debt target or the form
of the augmentation.
19.
There was agreement that future fiscal measures had to be of higher quality and
lasting nature, with fast-growing current expenditure seen as the prime candidate for
adjustment. Going forward, the authorities envisaged less pronounced increases in the
public wage and pension bills. Staff recommended that these only be indexed to inflation. In
a next step, public service reform could rationalize the wage bill and make the public sector
more efficient. The authorities intend to relaunch pension reform efforts, though they
cautioned that achieving the needed political consensus could be a challenge. Staff welcomed
this step and stressed that in order to protect other key spending priorities, it is essential that
social insurance spending increase by less than contributions over the coming years. This
could be achieved, for example, by targeting old-age pension spending increases on those
who need it most, or by tightening further the eligibility requirements for receiving
unemployment benefits (Annex III). Moreover, past social contribution cuts should be
revisited, given that the hoped-for increased compliance had proved elusive.

16
Box. 3. Public Finance Sustainability and Options for Fiscal Rules in Albania
Given the high public debt, the fiscal rule should be explicitly tied to debt reduction. Public debt declined
from 70 percent in 2000 to 54 percent in 2007 in the context of successive Fund-supported programs. This path
was reversed with the fiscal stimulus in 2009. Under current policies public debt would rise to 64 percent of
GDP by 2016. A return to the government’s pre-crisis target Public debt ratio under the debt rule, different adjustment coefficients

objective. While leaving debt higher than in most

The effectiveness of the rule will depend on its
simplicity, transparency and scope for macroeconomic
stabilization. A rule should be robust, not overtax the
statistical base (e.g., given the lack of reliable estimates of
potential output in Albania, a rule based on structural deficit
targets would be problematic), and be straightforward to
monitor for outside observers. A degree of cyclical
flexibility would also be desirable.

One option is to adhere to a simple debt rule. A debt rule
would comprise a target debt ratio and a convergence speed
when debt is above the target. The current debt level can be
sustained with primary deficits of about ¾ percent of GDP.
Debt reduction can be achieved by programming a factor α
(0≤ α ≤1) the ratio of the growth rates of the debt share and
GDP, respectively. To cut debt to 50 percent in 2016 (here,
α = 0.5), a surplus of 1½ percent of GDP is necessary.
Some countercyclical policy can still be accommodated, as
the rule relies on forecasted GDP (rather than actual).

An expenditure rule with a debt brake offers more advantages, allowing for greater play of automatic
stabilizers and keeping the size of the public sector in check. The rule would put a ceiling on real public
spending growth with the debt brake forcing a review of spending growth whenever debt is above the desired
target. To achieve a 50 percent debt level by 2016, real primary spending would have to be limited to 2 percent
per year with unitary revenue

20.
The case for further cuts to public investment was not seen as strong, especially
if concessional financing is available. The authorities and staff agreed that the infrastructure
can play an important role in boosting growth, leveraging Albania’s potential in accessing the
entire SEE region. However, project preparation and selection will need to be beefed up and
made more transparent, including by rigorous cost-benefit analysis. Public-private
partnerships could also be helpful in containing cost and securing private sector expertise,
and their merits and risks should be carefully weighed; in any event, staff recommended that
the required regulations and processes be developed.
21.
There is scope for revenue measures to offset the decline in structural revenue.
The authorities are progressing with tax administration reform but reported mixed success.
While acknowledging the considerable

budget. Similarly, the recent tax amnesty
posed risks to future compliance, if not accompanied by a comprehensive compliance
strategy. Against this background, staff recommended that the authorities also consider tax
policy changes such as lifting direct tax rates. Given their very low level (10 percent) even
small increases could result in substantial revenue without doing critical harm to Albania’s
tax competitiveness. Any positive revenue surprises should be allocated to debt reduction.
22.
Staff also pointed to scope for improvements in the budget process and debt
management.

to strengthen commitments monitoring.


Albania’s successful debut in international capital markets has lowered near-term
rollover risks. Further progress is needed on lengthening the maturity of domestic
debt, also with a view to develop lek markets; fiscal consolidation will help achieve
this at reasonable costs.
B. Protecting Monetary and Financial Stability Against New Risks

23.
Staff and authorities agreed that monetary policy should remain cautious, and
easing would require fiscal adjustment. The inflation targeting framework and flexible
exchange rate have served Albania very well and provided resilience throughout the global
crisis. Though the economy is still recovering and domestic demand remains weak, monetary
stimulus would need to be conditioned on fiscal adjustment and continued anchored inflation
expectations.
24.
Inflation volatility may increase in the future. So far, margins in the uncompetitive
retail sector have absorbed much of the imported price shocks, thereby smoothing inflation.
As structural reform will lead to erode these margins, inflation could well become more
volatile. Staff stressed the importance of updating the analytical framework and adapting
communications accordingly to guide and anchor expectations.

25.
There was agreement on the near-term priority of a swift resolution of
nonperforming loans and other crisis legacies. While bank profits are recovering, asset
quality has kept deteriorating. Banks have become increasingly dependent on profits from
T-bills. Accelerating resolution measures for problem loans (such as seizure and sale of
collateral) would help in cleaning up banks’ balance sheets. Staff welcomed the introduction
of the private Bailiff Officers, noting that further improvement of the court process would
also be needed. Staff and the BoA also agreed on a near-term work plan which comprised
stepped-up liquidity monitoring (followed up Fund TA); closer monitoring of positions

19

between parent banks and their subsidiaries/branches; and an improved contingency planning
framework (supported by Fund TA). There was agreement that early identification of
additional capital needs and assurances from parent banks to meet them—as well as maintain
exposure—are essential.
26.
Macro-prudential policy needs to stay ahead of the curve. Preventive
macro-prudential measures adopted prior to the crisis have helped to contain the build-up of
imbalances in the banking sector and to cope with spillovers from the recent crises. Any
macro-prudential easing needs to be geared towards fast balance sheet cleaning and
enhancing financial stability. The authorities intend to mandate higher-than Basel II norm, as
well as recent EU proposals.


Local-currency market development would help build buffers. Gradual
de-euroization has come to a halt as some banks have begun aggressive competition
for foreign-currency deposits. Staff and authorities agreed on the need to safeguard
against attendant risks and discussed possible measures (such as higher reserve
requirements, or more stringent liquidity ratios for foreign currency deposits).



Coordinating monetary and macro-prudential policies would be required to
manage capital flows. Notwithstanding current downside risks, returning
international risk appetite could lead to quick increases in capital inflows into Albania
(Annex IV) with attendant overheating risks. If the required fiscal tightening is
implemented, staff and authorities agreed that the floating exchange would provide a
defense against excessive inflows, but that strong appreciation and excessive
volatility could hurt competitiveness. In the short term these adverse effects could be
mitigated by building reserves, especially given uncertainty. Once comprehensive
fiscal adjustment is firmly under way, and if excessive inflows persist that cannot be
adequately addressed through exchange rate appreciation and reserve accumulation,
the use of capital flow measures could be considered to complement the macro policy
response.



The authorities are accelerating contingency planning. The BoA is updating its
stress testing framework to better capture liquidity risks. Jointly with the Fund and
World Bank, they are also working to keep the framework for emergency liquidity
assistance in line with changing developments and challenges. Staff welcomed these
steps and further recommended that high-frequency contacts with international
regulators and supervisors, importantly those of parent banks, be further deepened.

C. Upgrading the Business Climate to Raise Productivity and Speed up Convergence
27.
Authorities and staff agreed that boosting productivity by attracting foreign
investment is key for higher sustainable growth. The last decade’s arrival of large-scale
international investors in Albania was a critical factor in the transfer of technology and

20

innovation, which in turn were essential for raising productivity and providing higher-wage
employment in Albania. A favorable investment environment is thus a vital condition for
further progress.
28.
Structural reform needs
re-invigoration. Although
improvements have been made
on various fronts, Albania does
not compare favorably to many
of its regional peers in its
institutional qualities for doing
business and some investors
have raised concerns about an
unlevel playing field. The
downtrend in potential growth
has coincided with the
deceleration of the structural
reform momentum in recent
years. 2 Structural reform could
also boost critically low
domestic savings.



Securing property rights and improving contract enforcement was jointly seen
as the immediate priority. In contrast to most of Europe, Albania is arguably
under-regulated, creating idiosyncratic impediments to business. Especially land
titling and contract enforcement remain insufficient. Past government actions to
relieve the problem—such as the fast-tracking of large projects—have been uneven
and in some instances may even have contributed to uncertainty. The postprivatization regulatory framework for key industries such as electricity, energy, and
telecoms sectors is another area in need of progress. Authorities and staff agreed that
improvement in these prominent areas will also promote transparency and lower the
scope for corruption.



The shift to a new growth model could be supported by broadening the sources of
growth and diversifying exports. With their boost to transport infrastructure
essentially complete, the authorities saw a need to fund irrigation initiatives, given the
more limited access of agriculture to credit. This would help tap the vast agricultural

2

This is consistent with earlier staff analysis (see IMF Country reports 06/285 and 08/267) that found slowing
growth to a large extent to reflect institutional factors—against the backdrop of a generally stable
macroeconomic environment and sufficient provision of credit to the economy.

21

potential; agriculture employs most of the labor and yet remains largely segregated
and least productive, and agricultural imports account for 17 percent of the total
goods imports.


High-quality economic statistics are essential to improve policy making and
business environment. Priority areas for improvement include external sector
statistics and national accounts. Staff noted that adequate resources needed to be
provided to make effective use of the substantial technical assistance delivered by the
international community.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL

29.
The Albanian economy has shown admirable strength in recent years. It
weathered the global crisis well, avoided an output contraction—in contrast to most
European economies—and is leading the recovery in the region. Notwithstanding a
substantial deterioration in asset quality, the financial sector also proved resilient.
Throughout, inflation remained well anchored. The needed rebalancing of the economy has
begun, with the current account deficit narrowing.
30.
Rebalancing has dampened growth, though. Growth is projected to decelerate
further to 2½ percent in 2011. Over the medium term, it could recover to some 4 percent,
with some improvements in external sustainability. These levels, though respectable, are
considerably below the previous decade’s average of 6 percent, and also subject to downside
risks including from unaddressed external sustainability concerns.
31.
With the right policies, a return to sustained rapid growth is within reach. The
simultaneous achievement of higher growth, resilience against risks, and external
sustainability is in the cards, especially if progress is made on EU integration and if policies
are strengthened. Further fiscal consolidation, redressing critical structural reform priorities,
and maintaining financial sector stability are key.

32.
Fiscal consolidation is the near- and medium-term policy priority. It would
reduce the risks associated with the high level of public debt and advance external
sustainability. Moreover, lower deficits would boost sustainable private-sector led growth by
raising the flow of credit to the economy and securing lower interest rates.
33.
Repeated budget slippages underscore the need for a more realistic
macroeconomic framework. The budget shortfalls in 2010 and 2011 mainly reflect
overoptimistic forecasts. More realistic projections could be achieved by aligning them with
those of independent professional forecasters. Any positive revenue surprises should be
allocated to debt reduction.

23

34.
An expenditure-based fiscal rule could form the centerpiece of sustainable fiscal
policy. Basing budgets on tight limits for expenditure growth avoids risks of stop-and-go
fiscal policy, lowers incentives for revenue overoptimism, helps dispel any investor doubts
about the government’s commitment to a small government, and offers an anchor for
medium-term debt reduction. Lowering public debt to 50 percent of GDP over the medium
term can be achieved by limiting growth in annual real primary expenditure to 2 percent.
35.
Fiscal consolidation will require credible measures and sustained efforts. Already
interest, wage, and entitlement spending claim more than three quarters of revenue. If capital
spending is to be sustained at its current share in GDP, the wage and entitlement bills would
have to be indexed to inflation only. If the required spending cuts are viewed as unrealistic,
direct taxes or contributions will need to be raised. Especially the earlier cuts in social
contributions should be rescinded, as they have not resulted in the hoped-for increased
compliance. In addition, the very low flat income tax rates could be raised without imperiling
Albania’s competitive position.
36.
The monetary policy framework of an inflation target and flexible exchange rate
is a fundamental strength of the Albanian economy. In spite of higher imported inflation
and increases in administered prices, inflation has quickly returned within the Bank of
Albania’s target band, thanks to its credibility and a policy of timely and determined
adjustment of monetary conditions.
37.
Financial sector supervision and regulation will need to stay ahead of evolving
challenges. The limited fallout of the global financial crisis owes much to earlier proactive
and forceful supervision and regulation. Still, high NPL levels and thus far incomplete
balance sheet repair curtail the flow of new credit and pose risks to financial stability, if not
resolved more quickly. Other risks arise from the banking system’s high exposure to the euro
area periphery, requiring continued supervisory vigilance and monitoring of parent
institutions. Meanwhile, financial innovation is progressing, bringing with it new challenges.
Priority areas for action include expediting the execution of collateral, safeguarding liquidity,
enhancing the stress testing framework, and keeping contingency planning and preparedness
up to date.
38.
Boosting productivity by attracting foreign investment is essential for higher
sustainable growth. Key requirements include the maintenance of a level playing field, the
adoption of international best-practice regulations and their predictable enforcement by
professional institutions and accelerating the structural reform agenda, especially in securing
property rights, land titling and improving contract enforcement. High-quality economic
statistics are essential to improve policy making and the business environment.
39.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Albania will be held on
the standard 12-month cycle.

1/ Shaded areas represent actual data. Individual shocks are permanent one-half standard deviation shocks.
Figures in the boxes represent average projections for the respective variables in the baseline and scenario being
presented. Ten-year historical average for the variable is also shown.
2/ Permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and primary balance.
3/ One-time real depreciation of 30 percent and 10 percent of GDP shock to contingent liabilities occur in 2011,
with real depreciation defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local
currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).

Annex I. Improving National Accounts Statistics1
There has been notable progress in improving national accounts. The Albanian Statistics
Agency (INSTAT) has received substantial technical assistance from the IMF and the
European Commission during the last decade. The Fund’s most recent TA has focused on the
national accounts statistics. In particular, assistance has been provided on improving annual
national accounts by production and expenditure approaches and developing quarterly
estimates.
Still, some problems remain with respect to the reliability of the annual and quarterly
national account estimates. In particular, the consistency between quarterly and annual data
has not yet been secured.


The quarterly estimates by production approach are performed at too aggregated
levels and this makes the analysis and error detection in the data problematic. With
more disaggregation, specific and improved deflators would be needed, especially for
branches like trade, transport, financial services, and public administration. Another
related issue is the quality of the deflation methods and the use of specific deflators.
The use of the single deflation method often yields erratic results and one TA
recommendation, yet to be implemented by INSTAT, has been to use fixed value
added ratios at constant prices.



Notable areas for improvement for annual national accounts by expenditure approach
concern the estimation methodologies for household consumption and deflation of
external trade, respectively.

The quality of source data also remains a major concern. More disaggregated estimates
will require better quality and extended coverage of the data sources. Collection, processing
and use of the data from all three main sources, namely, the annual structural business
survey, the financial statements of enterprises, and VAT returns to the tax authorities, need to
be improved. In the medium term, the creation of adequate statistical infrastructure, such as
an automated centralized processing of administrative data, could facilitate these tasks.
The level of cooperation between units within INSTAT and between INSTAT and other
government agencies that provide significant inputs needs to be improved. INSTAT
units often seem to operate in silos and to lack a common vision for the development
priorities for statistics. Other government agencies need to better recognize the importance of
timely and accurate statistics and the Ministry of Finance should play a leading and
exemplary role in improving the data processing and provision to INSTAT.

Annex II. The Shifting Pattern of Remittances in Albania1
More than 25 percent of Albanian citizens are living abroad, making the country the
fourth in the world in terms of emigrants to population ratio. Neighboring Greece and
Italy attract most of the Albanian émigrés and account for 90 percent of remittances to
Albania. Estimates commonly put the diaspora in Greece at 800,000 and Italy at 300,000, as
high as 40 percent of Albanian labor force. Over 50 percent of the first generation of
Albanian emigrants to Greece and Italy had secondary or higher education. Around
60 percent of Albanian remittances are from Greece, 30 percent from Italy, and the rest from
the U.S., Germany, and other European countries.
Remittances played an important role in alleviating poverty and promoting financial
development. The 2005 Albania Living Standard Measurement Survey (LSMS) estimated
that remittances on average accounted for a third of disposable income of recipient families
and 40 percent for rural families. Remittances were mostly used for importing consumer
goods, services, and for the purchase or construction of houses. The level and particularly the
severity of poverty as a result were greatly reduced among households receiving remittances.
Remittances also helped promote financial development in Albania through the increasing
demand of banking access and services from both senders and receivers and raising banking
deposits and credit to GDP.
After peaking at $1,305 million (€952 million) in 2007, the amount of remittances and
their impact on the current account has since declined. Remittances, as a share of GDP,
started declining in the early 2000s, from around 15 percent of GDP then to 9.0 percent
in 2009 and an estimated 7.8 percent in 2010. Remittances traditionally covered more than
60 percent of trade deficits, but the share dropped to less than 40 percent after 2008. Rising
FDI has overtaken remittances since mid-2009 as the number one source of financing for
trade deficits. Notwithstanding the fall in total amount remitted, the amount transferred
through official channels such as banks and monetary transfer operators (MTOs) has been on
a steady rise since the early 2000s with the development of the banking system and the
elimination of the black market exchange premium.

The waning amount and diminishing role of remittances are likely to continue because
of changing demographics of emigrants and ongoing economic difficulties in host
countries. Two decades after the massive emigration wave in 1991, migrant workers have
either settled down in host countries with family unifications or begun to return to Albania.
In either case, remittances are likely to go down. This is broadly in line with international
experiences that remittances show a parabolic pattern with the prolongation of migration,
reaching the peak after 10–14 years of migration and decreasing thereafter. In addition,
economic difficulties in Greece and Italy are putting additional strain on remittances via
reduced migrant wages and employment opportunities. On the other hand, to the extent that a
new wave of workers were to leave Albania, either in response to improved labor markets in
Europe or increased domestic hardships, the importance of remittances could again increase.
Emigrant earnings and savings, however, are likely to continue coming back and
increasingly in forms other than remittances. For example, bank deposits in foreign
currencies in Albania rose drastically in the aftermath of the 2010 Greece debt crisis possibly
due to the Albanian émigré’s lack of trust in Greek banks. Emigrants’ savings may also enter
the economy as travel receipts, real estate purchases, and other business investment as part of
the broad FDI.
The shifting pattern of remittances and emigrant earnings could pose policy challenges
in coping with exchange rate volatilities and protecting financial stability. The challenge
on exchange rate volatility has long been associated with the seasonality of remittances to
Albania: large spikes in the summer and Christmas time. The challenge is further amplified
by foreign exchange inflows during the summer tourist season. The Bank of Albania has
avoided large exchange rate fluctuations by a measured build-up of foreign reserves
complemented with well-timed open market operations. An additional risk, however, might
arise with the surge in bank deposits from emigrants, which could very well be recycled back
to riskier source countries through their banking subsidiaries in Albania.
Declining remittances also present an opportunity in the long run for more robust and
dynamic growth. Remittances in theory can reduce the likelihood of employment and the
number of hours worked through a relaxed budget constraint and a rising reservation wage.
Based on the 2005 LSMS, Trako (2008) found that remittances to Albania indeed reduced in
recipient households the likelihood of participating in the labor force for adults between
22–65 years old and the likelihood of attending school for children between 12–17 years old.
Financial flows from migrants in forms such as direct investment have the potential to be
more productivity-enhancing than cash remittances as the latter mainly boost consumption.
The shifting pattern of remittances, if properly harnessed, is thus likely to help the Albanian
economy realizing its full potential.

40
Annex III. Albania’s Pension System and Fiscal Challenges1
The deficit in the state pension system has widened. Over the last decade spending on old
age pensions increased from 3.6 percent of GDP in 2000 to 4.3 percent in 2009. That
increase reflected higher spending on rural pensions, which more than doubled from
0.4 percent of GDP to 0.9 percent. Spending on urban old-age pensions, by contrast,
remained more or less stable. Over the same period the share of pension contributions in
GDP declined from 3.3 percent to 2.9 percent, with the fall since 2006 mainly due to the
reduction in employer contribution rates from 29 percent to 20 percent that year. In 2009 the
rate was lowered further to 15 percent, motivated by effort to increase compliance.
Moreover, rural contributions remain heavily subsidized. The government finances the
widening funding gap in the state pension scheme out of general taxation, taking financial
resources away from other types of spending.

Pension contributions

Sources:ISSH, INSTAT, and IMF staff calculations

Despite the substantial increase in spending on rural old-age pensions, they still—on average
—amounted to only 16.3 percent of the average wage or 37 percent of the official minimum
wage in 2009. While this compares favorably with the situation in 2000 (when these figures
were 6.8 and 14.6 percent, respectively), they are only half as generous as the urban old-age
pension. The latter was on average equivalent to 29.4 percent of the average wage and
66.8 percent of the official minimum wage in 2009. Despite this continuing relatively low
level, the rural pension accounted for a third of pre-transfer consumption of the poorest
quintile and as such was more than twice as important as the social assistance program for
this group of society as a source of income.
Per capita pension spending increased in line with
the average wage over the previous decade. This is
despite the fact that pensions are legally indexed to
inflation only.2 Up to 2006 pension contributions per
person employed followed a similar trajectory. The
reduction in employer contribution rates that year has
resulted in diverging trends since.

United Nations 2010 revised population projections, the median age of the Albanian
population was 30 years in 2010; more than a decade younger than the European and
Southern European averages.
Demographic trends pose significant challenges to Albania’s pension system. The
Albanian population is projected to age dramatically over the coming decades, with the
median age exceeding the European and Southern European averages by mid century.
Similarly, Albania’s old-age dependency ratio is projected to triple from around 18 percent
now to just over 50 percent and thus close to the European average. On current policies the
wedge between spending and contributions would continue to widen, requiring ever greater
transfers from general taxation to fill the gap. This would prove to be unsustainable within a
relatively short period of time.

Thus, pension reform is a priority, especially addressing the imbalances in the existing
pay-as-you-go system. The 2006 and 2009 reductions in contribution rates should be
revisited in order to strengthen the finances of the social security system, not least as these
have not led to an increase in compliance. Second, the continued need for subsidizing rural
contribution should be assessed. Third, pension spending increases could be kept at bay, by
raising pensions by less than earnings. Looking beyond these immediate measures to bolster
the social security finances, more fundamental changes should be contemplated; such as
eliminating the distinction between urban and rural pensions (which would allow for better
targeting) and making the link between contributions and pensions more apparent. The high
degree of redistribution within the pension system (the maximum pension is only twice the
minimum pension) has often been pointed out as a major reason why higher income earners
are reluctant to participate in the scheme. After the state system has been made sustainable
and coverage expanded–and the regulatory environment strengthened-a move towards a
multi-pillar system could be considered. Such a move would preferably lead to additional
pension savings rather than merely diverting existing contributions away from the social
security scheme. International evidence shows that the diversion of contributions away from
the first pillar into private pensions could create substantial and sustained transition costs
with a negative effect on the public finances.3

Annex IV. Managing Capital Inflows1
Capital flows to Albania were relatively smaller and less volatile than in other SouthEastern European (SEE) countries. From 2003 to 2010, the cumulative capital inflows
(in percentage of GDP) to Albania were one of the lowest in the region. Their volatility was
also lower, and in particular capital inflows into Albania withstood the global crisis better
than in other countries in the region. More than half of the capital inflows are in the form of
Foreign Direct Investments, which is in line with regional average.

Unlike in other SEE countries, where large capital inflows prompted rapid credit
growth and rising foreign currency lending, Albania steadily reduced the foreign
currency lending while maintaining high credit growth. The rapid credit growth is partly
due to an initially low level of financial development, and the opening of the banking sector
to foreign banks. Although timely supervisory intervention and macro-prudential measures
helped contain foreign-currency lending, it is still at 68 percent, around the average of the
region.

As the economy recovers and risk appetite returns to Europe, Albania could face higher
capital inflows as one of the least crisis affected countries. The successful placement of
1

43
Albania’s first Eurobond in October 2010 and the modest fall of capital inflows in 2009
and 2010 showed more stable investor interest in the economy. As risk appetite returns,
Albania could attract even more capital inflows. Appropriate policies would be needed to
manage the capital inflows and avoid the recent boom bust cycles experienced in emerging
Europe.
The recent experience in emerging European countries shows the importance of
managing excessive capital inflows. Greater integration enabled emerging Europe to
receive more “downhill” capital inflows than other emerging economies. However, large
capital inflows, especially when associated with a domestic credit boom, could lead to real
exchange rate overvaluation and overheating of the economy. A large part of the inflows
were in the form of cross-border loans or parent bank financing in foreign currency, which
prompted rapid credit growth and higher financial euroization. While growth picked up
significantly driven mainly by aggregate demand, external vulnerabilities were building up
with large current account deficits, currency mismatch in balance sheets, and increasing
dependence on foreign financing which makes the economies more vulnerable to sudden
stops. Fiscal policy was not used to build buffers and in some countries was pro-cyclical.
Structural reforms were lagging behind. When the global financial crisis hit the advanced
European countries and transmitted through the real and particularly financial channels,
countries which had put into place policies to manage the excessive capital inflows withstood
the crisis better than their peers that allowed the vulnerabilities to accumulate.
Experience shows that the policy response should be multidimensional and country
specific. The flexible exchange rate system provides a useful policy tool to stem excessive
capital inflows. Fiscal policy should be in place to respond to avoid a real exchange rate over
valuation. Composition of the capital inflows also matters. Since FDI related inflows are
generally more stable and tend to contribute to productivity growth or investments, policies
should be geared toward promoting FDI. On the other hand, more scrutiny should be given to
inflows to the non-tradable sector which triggers fast real exchange rate appreciation and
consumption based credit growth. In this respect, macro-prudential policies should be
adopted to mitigate risks of rapid credit expansion and the resulting asset bubbles. In certain
cases, capital controls should also be an option in the policy mix to avoid any negative
impact from volatile capital inflows.
Albania should be prepared to implement multidimensional polices while anticipating
higher capital inflows. The floating exchange rate has served the country well during the
recent crisis, and a good record of macro-prudential policies has helped avoid disruptions in
the credit market and preserve the strength of the banking sector. Faced with higher capital
inflows, Albania should tighten the fiscal policy, continue to rely upon the flexible exchange
rate and an adequate macro-policy mix and macro-prudential policies to manage the capital
inflows. If the excessive inflows persist and cannot be adequately addressed by these policy
responses, Albania should also be prepared to adopt less conventional capital flow measures.

Annex V. Transitioning to the GFSM 2001 Fiscal Presentation1
In March 2010, the IMF Executive Board called upon member countries to present fiscal data
according to the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) framework.2
The Statistics Department (STA) at the IMF assisted the Albania’s team to develop a
GFSM 2001-based reporting framework. This appendix presents the Statement of Sources
and Uses of Cash in the new formats and highlights ongoing tasks that will be necessary to
achieve a further alignment to GFSM 2001-based data. This appendix does not impact the
presentation of fiscal data used elsewhere in the report.
STA found that there are adequate source data to establish a GFSM 2001 presentation for
Albania which would cover the operations of the general government (defined as the
Budgetary Central Government, extra budgetary units, the Social Security Institute, districts,
and municipalities). However data on financial assets need to be compiled and further
disaggregation of debt instruments is necessary to report a financial balance sheet of
government that reconciles stocks and flows. Reporting of fiscal data on the basis of
GFSM 2001 does not appear to substantially change the overall primary balance (including
grants). For example, the attendant reclassification of some specific transactions (in
particular, “net lending”) would result in an increase of the overall balance deficit from -3.7
to -4.2 of GDP in 2010.
The next steps to further align the fiscal statistics are:


To provide greater detail on some of accounts3 to ensure proper classification in the
GFSM 2001.



To report transactions of Albania’s local governments in a separate statement instead
of an item in the Statement of Sources and Uses of Cash.



To break down the Net Acquisition of Nonfinancial assets (labeled as Capital
Expenditure in the local presentation) into the GFSM 2001 subcategories: fixed
assets, inventories, valuables, and nonproduced assets.4

Prepared by Frank Eich and Carlos Alberto Gutierrez Mangas.

The mandate requires that a GFSM 2001-based Statement of Government Operations along with a financial
balance sheet be included in staff reports as of May 2011, except for countries benefiting from Fund facilities.
See decision No. 14565 outlined in Government Finance Statistics to Strengthen Fiscal Analysis

Examples of these accounts are National Taxes, Income of Budgetary Institutions, Property Compensation,
and Compensation for Electricity.

VII. Safeguards Assessments:
The Bank of Albania (BoA) was subject to a safeguards assessment with respect to current
arrangements. The most recent assessment was completed on July 14, 2006 and found that
some weaknesses exist in the central bank's safeguards framework. The main
vulnerabilities identified by the assessment concern the quality of the external audit,
oversight of the external and internal audit functions and the system of internal controls,
and certain weaknesses in the controls over the Fund data reporting process. The

3
assessment recommended measures to alleviate these weaknesses. The authorities have
taken steps to improve the external audit process and staff will monitor the implementation
of the remaining recommendations.
VIII. Exchange Rate Arrangement:
On July 1, 1992 the Albanian authorities adopted a floating exchange rate system. Under
the Fund’s de facto exchange rate regime classification, Albania follows a floating
exchange rate regime, with the monetary authorities occasionally intervening in the foreign
exchange market in order to avoid excessive and short term disruptions in the functioning
of the market and to accumulate reserves. Albania’s exchange rate arrangement is free
from exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices subject to Fund jurisdiction
under Article VIII. However, the country still avails itself of the transitional arrangements
under Article XIV and maintains exchange restrictions in the form of outstanding debit
balances on inoperative bilateral payment agreements, which were in place before Albania
became a Fund member. These relate primarily to debt in nonconvertible and formerly
nonconvertible currencies. Albania has not imposed new restrictions under Article VIII.
The exchange rate stood at lek 98.16 per U.S. dollar at end July, 2011.
IX. Article IV Consultation:
The conclusion of the 2010 Article IV consultation took place in May 2010 (IMF Country
Report No. 10/205).
X. FSAP Participation and ROSCs:
An FSAP was carried out in early 2005. The Financial System Stability Assessment was
considered by the Executive Board on August 1, 2005 concurrently with the staff report
for the sixth review of the PRGF-supported program and financing assurances review. An
action plan for implementing the FSAP recommendations has been prepared in
consultation with the IMF. A data module ROSC was published on the Fund’s website in
June 2000. A fiscal ROSC was completed in June 2003. Albania participates in the
General Data Dissemination System (GDDS), and a complete set of GDDS metadata for
the external, financial, fiscal, and real sectors, as well as for the socio-demographic
indicators is posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
(http://dsbb.imf.org). A data module ROSC reassessment using the Data Quality
Assessment Framework was conducted in March 2006. A ROSC for assessing the
Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations for Anti-Money Laundering
(AML) and Special Recommendations on Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT)
was conducted in November 2010 and the report was published in July 2011.
XI. Technical Assistance:
The Fund, other multilateral organizations and donors have provided extensive assistance
for institutional development in Albania. The Fund has sent several technical assistance

4
missions to Albania every year since 1991. The extent and focus of Fund TA since FY
2008 is briefly listed below.

III. ALBANIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
August 15, 2011
A. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. The main
obstacles are in real sector statistics.
National Accounts: National accounts are compiled from insufficient and poor quality sources. While

technical assistance has been provided on methodological procedures, source data still do not provide
sufficient information to compile reliable estimates on the unobserved economy. In November 2005, the
Institute of Statistics (INSTAT) released major revisions of the national accounts estimates for
1996–2003 and updates for 2004, reflecting methodological improvements.
INSTAT has benefited from technical assistance from the Fund and the European Union, mainly to
address weaknesses in methodology, basic data sources, and coverage of the private sector. STA
continued to provide technical assistance through peripatetic missions in 2010 and 2011. The Labor
Force Survey was incorporated into the estimates of the unobserved economy in the annual national
accounts while attempts were made to use the Household Budget Survey to develop a new benchmark
estimate of private consumption. A new methodology for gross fixed capital formation based on a
commodity flow approach was developed. Quarterly national accounts were compiled during the project
and are now being published and revised. Due to severe resource constraints at INSTAT, the
improvement in the national accounts has been relatively slow.
Price statistics: Compilation generally follows international standards, and the estimation of imputed rent

within the CPI was improved in 2003. In December 2007, INSTAT has updated the CPI weights using
the results of a new national-level HBS conducted during the period October 2006-September 2007. PPI
has been published only quarterly due to financial constraints. The weights were derived from the 1998
annual Structural Business Survey.
Government finance statistics: GFS generally follow the Government Finance Statistics Manual 1986.

External donor financed-projects that do not pass through the treasury system represent a weakness in
source data. There are adequate source data to establish a GFSM 2001 presentation for Albania, but data
on financial assets need to be compiled and further disaggregation of debt instruments is necessary to
report a financial balance sheet of government that reconciles stocks and flows.

9
Monetary statistics: The monetary data compilation framework conforms to the methodology

recommended in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM) 2000. The depository
corporations survey covers the Bank of Albania (BoA) and all the other deposit-taking institutions
(commercial banks and savings and loans associations (SLAs)). The accounts of the SLAs, with the
exception of loans, are produced on a cash basis, which contrasts with the MFSM’s recommendations of
accrual accounting. Another deviation from the MFSM’s methodology is that the BoA’s and commercial
banks’ holdings of nontradable long-term securities are recorded at book value.
External sector statistics: The Balance of payments data compiled by the BoA are methodologically
sound, although some of the estimates, particularly for international transactions outside the banking
system need to be refined. Problems remain in the areas of service transactions and remittances, and in
the monitoring of financial account transactions, foreign assistance (grants from abroad to regional and
local governments are underreported), and external debt.

A September–October 2007 mission noted strong progress in adopting earlier recommendations but
advised that estimation methods for transactions outside the banking system (mostly remittances and
investment transactions by nonresident Albanians) require further improvement.
The external debt database ensures timely and accurate reporting of external government debt (including
commitments of state-owned enterprises). However, there have been some irregularities in the recording
and presentation of external arrears. The collection of data on external grants is not timely, with lags of
several months frequently encountered.
B. Data Standards and Quality

Dissemination System (GDDS).

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
October 21, 2011

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
Albania
On September 7, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Albania. 1
Background
Albania has weathered the global crisis well, as sound policies implemented during the
pre-crisis years provided policy space to mitigate the crisis fallout. The crisis also
ushered in the needed rebalancing of the economy, and the very large external
imbalance has narrowed. The financial system overcame heightened stress in the
immediate aftermath of the crisis and avoided a credit bust, though asset quality
declined.
The post-crisis environment has posed significant policy challenges. GDP growth is
projected to be around 2.5 percent in 2011, decelerating from above 3 percent in 2009
and 2010. The budget has repeatedly underperformed, prompting large cuts in mid-year
budget reviews in both 2010 and 2011, and public debt is approaching its statutory limit
of 60 percent of GDP. Despite improvements, external imbalances remain elevated, and
foreign demand could not fully offset the domestic demand drain. Politics remain divisive
and threaten consensus on reform including measures needed to progress with
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings
up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

European Union (EU) candidacy. Short-term risks are elevated given Albania’s large
exposure to the euro-area periphery.
The key challenge is to make the policy framework consistent with the achievement of
external sustainability, thereby reversing the decline in total factor productivity (TFP)
growth. Fiscal consolidation is the near- and medium-term policy priority, and requires
credible measures and sustained efforts. Contingency planning with respect to
euro-area periphery developments is essential to safeguard the financial stability, while
critical structural reform challenges must be addressed.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for pursuing sound policies, which have
permitted Albania to weather the global crisis well. Looking ahead, however, the
economy faces increasing challenges, particularly from high public debt, sluggish
productivity growth, and significant external vulnerabilities, including from potential
regional spillovers. Early and sustained actions are needed to ensure fiscal
sustainability, safeguard financial stability, and improve the investment environment.
Directors emphasized that fiscal consolidation is the near- and medium-term policy
priority for Albania. They advised the authorities to implement an expenditure-based
fiscal rule to anchor a credible medium-term debt reduction strategy. Directors
encouraged the authorities to implement further expenditure and revenue measures to
achieve the required fiscal consolidation. A better macroeconomic framework built on
more realistic revenue projections would help avoid the repeated budget slippages of
the past.
Directors noted that Albania’s flexible exchange rate and inflation targeting regime have
served the economy well. Going forward, monetary policy should remain cautious, and
coordinate with fiscal policy to anchor inflation expectations and safeguard growth
prospects. Directors noted the staff’s assessment that the exchange rate appears to be
broadly in line with fundamentals, and stressed that strong fiscal consolidation efforts
can help foster external sustainability.
Directors commended the resilience of Albania’s banking system during the crisis,
although cautioned that heightened risks, including from possible regional spillovers,
called for macro-prudential policy to stay ahead of the curve. A key near-term priority is
the swift resolution of the high level of non-performing loans and other crisis legacies.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue to enhance the monitoring of banks
and the development of the local currency market to build buffers. They underlined the
need to step up crisis preparedness, including by further development of the
contingency planning framework.
Directors urged the authorities to re-invigorate structural reforms to improve the
business environment and thereby boost productivity and growth, especially by securing

3
property rights, land titling, and improving contract enforcement. They noted that highquality economic statistics are essential to improve policy making.

Statement by Arrigo Sadun, Executive Director for Albania,
and Francesco Spadafora, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
September 7, 2011
On behalf of the Albanian authorities, we thank staff for the continued close and constructive
cooperation, as well as for the very informative report.
Overview
Albania has weathered the global crisis better than most other regional and European
economies, and is leading the recovery in the region. Generally prudent macroeconomic
policies, low external debt, a sound banking system, and adequate foreign exchange reserve
buffers allowed the authorities to use the available policy space accumulated in the boom
years to mitigate the impact of the crisis. As a result, Albania escaped a recession, and
growth continued at above 3 percent in both 2009 and 2010.
Strong export growth since the beginning of 2010 has helped narrow the large current
account deficit, from above 15 percent of GDP in 2008 to 12 percent in 2010. Robust inflows
of foreign direct investments have increased their importance as a source of financing of the
current account deficit, overtaking remittances in this role in 2010. The country was also able
to place a €300 million debut Eurobond in October 2010.
The authorities have more favorable expectations than staff on the outlook, as they currently
project that growth will return to a pace of 5 percent or higher in the near term. This
projection is based on the country’s strong fundamentals, as well as on large public
investments in infrastructure in recent years.
The authorities underscore the high degree of consensus in the policy discussions with staff,
and agree that the simultaneous achievement of higher growth, resilience against risks, and
external sustainability is within reach. Their policies remain focused on preserving
macroeconomic stability and external sustainability, consolidating public finances, and
advancing structural reforms.
Fiscal Policy
The crisis has inevitably led to deterioration in the government’s fiscal position. After
declining from 70 percent of GDP in 2000 to 54 percent in 2007, public debt has drifted up
(driven by its external component), approaching the 60 percent of GDP statutory limit;
however, the ratio declined between 2009 and 2010 (Table 1 of the report). Facing
underperforming revenue, significant corrective measures adopted in mid-2010 limited the
budget deficit to 3.7 percent of GDP, below the initial target of 3.9 percent set in the original
2010 budget.
The authorities concur with staff that fiscal consolidation represents the key policy challenge
for the near- and medium-term, given the need to contain public debt and rollover
requirements.

2
To this end, in July 2011 further expenditure cuts were adopted through a mid-year budget
review to keep the budget close to the original target of 3.5 percent. Moreover, the revised
Macroeconomic and Fiscal Framework 2012-2014, approved by the government in July
2011, targets a budget deficit of 3 percent over the medium-term and a public debt-to-GDP
ratio below the statutory limit.
Going forward, the authorities expect that a return to faster growth, together with their
ongoing efforts to boost tax administration, can increase revenues and relieve budget
pressures.
Given the growth of current expenditures, the authorities envisaged less pronounced
increases in the public wage and pension bills in the future; they also intend to re-launch
pension reform efforts, while remaining mindful of the challenges to achieve the needed
political consensus.
The authorities share the staff’s view on the need for a strong fiscal rule to firmly anchor
expectations of a sustainable conduct of public finances. The authorities agree that public
debt can constitute a desirable anchor, and they consider the existing legal debt limit of 60
percent of GDP to have proven its value. They take note of the staff’s preference for an
expenditure-based rule, but are looking at augmenting it with a mechanism to guard against
procyclicality, though they have not yet reached definite conclusions on a new debt target.
Monetary and Financial Sector Policies
The inflation targeting framework and flexible exchange rate have served Albania very well,
and have provided resilience throughout the global crisis. Inflation largely stayed in the target
range of 3±1 percent and inflation expectations remain well-anchored.
The monetary policy stance has been accommodative but responsive to inflation risk. In July
2010 the Bank of Albania eased its policy rate in response to fiscal consolidation; as headline
inflation overshot its target band because of rising food and fuel prices, the policy stance was
tightened in early 2011. The authorities concur with staff that a monetary stimulus would
need to be conditioned on fiscal adjustments and continued anchored inflation expectations.
The banking system has proven its resiliency through the crisis, as banks remain generally
sound and well-capitalized. Deposits declined substantially but only temporarily in the midst
of the crisis, and their current level is much higher than before the turmoil.
Financial sector policies were adjusted to safeguard financial stability and revive credit
growth. Preventive macro-prudential measures adopted prior to the crisis have helped to
contain the build-up of imbalances in the banking sector prior to the crisis. The latter led to
the adoption of further macroprudential policies, including higher capital requirements,
tighter liquidity, and credit risk controls; they were subsequently lifted in the face of steadily
increasing deposit funding, improved liquidity conditions, and adequate capital buffers.
While bank profits are recovering, the steep increase of nonperforming loans, from 3 percent
pre-crisis to 15 percent in April 2011, is a source of major concern. The authorities share the
staff’s view that a swift resolution of nonperforming loans (including by faster resolution
measures) and other crisis legacies is a key near-term priority.

3
The developments in the euro area periphery have led the authorities to more closely monitor
the positions between parent banks and their subsidiaries/branches, while engaging in
proactive contacts with regional and European supervisors and central banks in order to
advance contingency planning. While market volatility surrounding the euro-area periphery
was reflected in the domestic markets, all Greek-owned banks remained in compliance with
prudential ratios, although their liquidity levels have been somewhat reduced.
In response, the Bank of Albania has stepped up liquidity monitoring across the system and is
updating its stress-testing framework to better capture liquidly risks. Jointly with the Fund
and the World Bank, the Bank of Albania is also working to keep the framework for
emergency liquidity assistance in line with changing developments and challenges.
Increasing prudential liquidity ratios is being contemplated. Finally, the authorities intend to
mandate higher-than Basel II norms, as well as recent EU proposals.
Structural Reforms
The authorities agree that a favorable investment environment is a vital condition for further
attracting large-scale international investors and boosting productivity, which is key for
higher sustainable growth. They concur with staff that securing property rights and
improving contract enforcement are immediate priorities. The authorities would also like to
highlight the progress in improving transport infrastructure, and they see the need for
initiatives to help tap the vast agricultural potential so as to diversify exports and broaden the
sources of growth.
