PAPUA NEW GUINEA
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
April 30, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context: National elections are scheduled for June 2012 and the political situation is
complicated, with two claimants to the post of Prime Minister. However, the economic
impact has been limited, and Papua New Guinea is enjoying robust economic growth
supported by high commodity prices, mineral investment inflows, sound fiscal and
monetary frameworks, and a healthy banking sector.
Growth prospects: Growth is expected to remain high as the construction of a large
liquefied natural gas production facility (LNG) boosts economic activity. Exchange rate
appreciation has helped reduce inflation, but domestic cost pressures remain elevated
in particular in sectors facing capacity constraints. Risks are broadly balanced, with
external risks on the negative side and the potential for new resource projects on the
positive side.
Macroeconomic policies: In 2012, tight control of government spending and a flexible
exchange rate are needed to contain inflation. Over the medium term, staff advised
moving toward steady, affordable increases in public spending. Continued exchange
rate flexibility would help dampen the impact of commodity sector shocks.
Raising living standards: The resource sector is expected to make a greater
contribution to long-term growth and higher living standards, and could contribute
more. The composition of public spending is shifting toward high priority areas, but
spending efficiency needs to be improved. Staff welcomed initiatives to strengthen the
management of public enterprises and encouraged the authorities to implement
structural reforms to support the development of the non-mineral sector.
Financial and external stability: The financial system remains sound and should be
able to withstand moderate shocks. The large current account deficits are temporary,
reflecting LNG construction, and mostly financed by FDI and medium- to long-term
debt. The real exchange rate has appreciated and is expected to remain strong during
the resource investment boom.

PNG must manage its current

resource investment boom and prospective
resource revenues in ways that benefit the
whole country. This is a challenging

important to combine steady, affordable
growth in government spending with
improvements in public financial management
and expenditure effectiveness, as well as
structural reforms.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
3.

Real GDP is estimated to have

expanded by about 9 percent in 2011.
Elevated commodity prices, the construction of
a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, and
government spending are boosting the
economy and generating inflation pressures
(Box 1). The temporary closure of key mines,
caused by natural disasters, and dwindling oil
production dampened overall output growth.
Headline inflation peaked just below
10 percent in the second quarter of 2011, but
subsequently eased to 7 percent at year-end in
line with declining international food prices
and a 21 percent appreciation of the kina in
nominal effective terms, although the full
effects of the exchange rate appreciation may
not have been fully passed through to
consumers. Capacity pressures and sector-

specific skilled labor shortages have increased
underlying inflation (Figure 1).
Staff’s Views
4.

The medium-term growth outlook is

positive. In 2012, real GDP is projected to
grow at 8 percent. LNG construction-related
activity will continue at peak levels and mining
output is expected to recover. In 2013,
however, growth is likely to weaken to about
4 percent, as LNG construction winds down
and output at maturing mines slows. LNG
production is expected to start in 2014, raising
real GDP by about 20 percent when LNG
production reaches full capacity in 2015,
although GNI will rise by less because of
dividend outflows. Thereafter, annual GDP
growth is projected to average around
5 percent.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 1. Papua New Guinea: Liquefied Natural Gas Projects
PNG LNG Project (ExxonMobil)
Project construction began in 2010 and the first liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipment is scheduled
for 2014. Esso Highlands, a subsidiary of ExxonMobil, is operating the project. Building work accelerated in 2011
and is expected to peak in the second quarter of 2012. The main components of the project include:



Natural gas wells in the Southern Highlands. The first of two drilling rigs has been delivered and earthworks
at some sites have been completed.



Construction of a gas conditioning plant at Hides. Delivery of supplies was complicated by a mudslide in
January, and landowner unrest in March led to temporary suspension of work.



Construction of the main LNG plant site outside Port Moresby. Construction is ahead of schedule and the
jetty is more than 50 percent complete.



Offshore and onshore pipelines connecting the plants. The offshore portion is ahead of schedule, while the
onshore portion has been delayed by weather disruption and landowner protests.

More than 14,300 workers are employed by the project, with PNG nationals accounting for 60 percent.
Two thousand nationals have been trained through the National Training College. LNG-related goods imports
amounted to US$2 billion in 2011. Mineral sector service and income payments to foreign workers increased by
US$3½ billion between 2008 and 2011.
The US$15.7 billion construction costs are financed by a mix of 30 percent equity and 70 percent debt,
with the government responsible for funding its share of costs (including cost increases). The largest
private sector equity participants are ExxonMobil affiliates (33.2 percent) and Oil Search (29 percent). The PNG
government owns a 16.8 percent stake, mostly through the Independent Public Business Corporation, and
landowners own 2.8 percent. The government also owns shares amounting to 15 percent of Oil Search. To fund
initially estimated construction costs, these shares were pledged to Abu Dhabi’s International Petroleum
Investment Company through an exchangeable bond. They are due to be transferred in 2014, with additional
compensation required if the shares are worth less than the initial borrowing of $A 1.68 billion. The government’s
share of cost increases in 2011 was financed through domestic debt issuance.
LNG production will reach full capacity in 2015 and boost real GDP by about 20 percent. The annual output
of 6.6 million tons is fully contracted to buyers from Japan, mainland China and Taiwan POC. The LNG price is
linked to the oil price (Japan Crude Cocktail). Production costs will include goods imports and payments to
foreign workers, projected at about US$1 billion annually. The expected operational life of the project is 30 years.
Fiscal revenues from the LNG project are projected to begin in 2018 and peak in 2024. LNG-related
government revenues are projected to grow to around 10 percent of non-mineral GDP by 2024 as extended
depreciation allowances are used up.
Future Developments
Esso Highlands plans additional phases of LNG development. The Hides plant will undergo improvements
in 2019. New wells are planned at Angore over 2017−18 and Juha over 2021−22.
InterOil and Talisman have independent plans to develop additional gas resources in PNG. InterOil plans to
develop the Elk and Antelope gas fields, with estimated construction costs of US$7 billion and annual production
of 7.6-10.6 million tons. Talisman Energy found gas reserves at exploratory wells in 2010 and will spend US$800
million on further exploration over 2012-15.

The risks to the outlook are broadly

has so far had only a limited impact, it
constitutes a major downside risk. Lower
commodity prices would reduce government

The authorities broadly agreed with

staff’s assessment of the economic outlook
and inflation. They noted that intensification
of the European debt crisis would negatively
impact global commodity prices and hurt
PNG’s growth. They agreed that inflation
pressures are likely to persist in the medium
term, and pointed to increased capital inflows
and heightened economic activity related to
the LNG project. Their tolerance for inflation is
higher than in the pre-LNG construction
period.

Box 2. Papua New Guinea and China: Similarities in Quantitative Monetary Policies
Over the past decade, both Papua New Guinea (PNG) and China have seen large capital inflows. Although
PNG experienced a temporary capital outflow in 2008, capital inflows resumed afterwards and were over
5 percent of GDP in most years. As in the case of the Chinese renminbi, inflows caused persistent appreciation
pressure for the kina.
Both central banks opted for foreign exchange intervention. As central banks were the sole market clearers,
they accumulated large amounts of foreign exchange reserves and injected the equivalent amount of liquidity in
local currency into domestic financial markets. The Bank of PNG allowed more flexibility of the kina in 2011, and
the kina appreciated 22 percent against the U.S. dollar, but reserve accumulation remained high.
Cash reserve requirements (CRR) and central bank bills (CBBs) were used to absorb excessive liquidity.
China used CRRs aggressively, raising the CRR ratio from 7.5 percent in September 2004 to 20.5 percent in
December 2011, while outstanding CBBs were raised by a factor of 3 during the same period. PNG relied more on
expensive CBBs, the outstanding amount of which grew by a factor of 32, while the CRR ratio was only increased
from 3 percent to 6 percent. The sterilization ratios, calculated as the percentage of liquidity absorbed by the CRR
and CBBs, stayed at around 70 percent in both countries in 2011.
The Bank of PNG can achieve the same sterilization effect by further raising the CRR ratio. At the same
time, the amount of CBBs can be reduced, so as to lower the cost of liquidity management.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 3. Papua New Guinea: Exchange Rate Assessment
Papua New Guinea’s real effective exchange rate appreciated by 27 percent during 2011. The kina
appreciated by 22 percent against the U.S. dollar and 24 percent against the Australian dollar.
Owing to the projected structural change in the PNG economy, standard CGER methodologies disagree on
the exchange rate assessment, with an average overvaluation assessed around zero. For the MB approach,
staff used coefficients estimated from a standard CGER regression, but to account for the importance of mineral
exports for PNG (including LNG production from 2015), the norm was calculated by substituting PNG’s entire
mineral balance (export revenues less wage and dividend payments) in place of the traditional oil trade balance
variable. This method indicates an 8½ percent undervaluation. The ERER approach predicts the exchange rate
directly from movements in the terms of trade and net foreign assets, and estimates an overvaluation of
13 percent, reflecting the large appreciation over 2011.
Over the medium term, the equilibrium real exchange rate will depend on the precise balance between
large trade surpluses and a reversal of LNG investment-related capital inflows, and fiscal policy. Neither of
the CGER approaches captures all the details of this specific trade-off (which is sensitive to commodity price
assumptions). Staff’s external sector analysis (Table 3) projects a medium-term buildup of reserves at the 2012
real exchange rate, indicating undervaluation. If authorities follow staff’s advice of higher medium-term fiscal
spending, the current account norm would decline, pushing toward further undervaluation of the kina today.
However, this assessment is tempered by the fact that the real appreciation has pushed up rents and other nontradable input costs relative to other countries, damaging the competitiveness of the non-mineral sector. This
calls for structural reform and infrastructure improvements to raise efficiency and ease structural adjustment.

PAPUA NEW GUINEA

Box 4. Papua New Guinea: Medium-Term Fiscal Strategies and the Sovereign
Wealth Fund 1/
Over the past 10 years, fiscal policies were guided by Medium-Term Fiscal Strategies (MTFS).
The 2002−07 MTFS was a stabilization and structural reform program. Its balanced budget target was
achieved in 2004, three years ahead of schedule, but progress on structural reforms was slow.
The 2008−12 MTFS added rules to limit the fiscal impact of volatility in resource revenue. It required
that resource revenue above a ‘normal’ level (4 percent of GDP) be used for infrastructure
development (70 percent) and debt reduction (30 percent). Annual spending out of trust accounts
was capped at 4 percent of GDP. Together these rules imposed an 8 percent of GDP limit on the nonmineral budget deficit.
To address the challenge of smoothing government expenditure and decoupling it from the
short-term volatility of natural resource revenues, the authorities decided to establish a
Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF). The Parliament approved the Organic Law on the SWF in late
February 2012. The law envisages a consolidated pool of two offshore funds, stabilization (SF) and
development (DF). The SWF model, design, and institutional framework were guided by international
best practice with consideration of domestic features: a single governance framework to manage the
two funds, offshore investment and onshore management, integration with the fiscal framework and
the budget, and accountability and transparency rules based on the Santiago principles.
The law provides guidelines for contributions to, and withdrawals from, the funds. It stipulates
that contributions to the SF will include all mineral and petroleum revenues, earnings from its
investments, and other government contributions. Withdrawals from the SF will go through the
budget process and should not exceed 15-year moving average of mineral and petroleum revenues
as a share of non-mining revenues. Annual contributions to the DF will be no less than the
guaranteed minimum allocation based on the expected average of the LNG project dividends
determined by the parliament, earnings from its investments, and other government contributions.
There is no clear rule defining withdrawals from the DF except that funds are to be made available to
support the development plans of the government in accordance with an act of parliament.
Implementation details are still to be determined, in particular the relationship between the SWF
withdrawal rules and the new MTFS.
The authorities intend to publish a new MTFS in late 2012 in connection with the planned SWF.
Based on the SF withdrawal rule, the drawdown of funds would be equal to about 6 percent of
non˗mineral GDP in 2011, largely corresponding to the lower revenue scenario in the 2011 FAD TA
report. This report assumes a decline in non-LNG natural resource revenue to a long-run level of
3 percent of non-mineral GDP. On top of this, LNG revenue are projected to average about
3½ percent of non-mineral GDP over 2015−30 in the low revenue scenario, yielding a ‘new normal’ of
about 6½ percent of non-mineral GDP. In a higher revenue scenario the new normal could reach
14 percent of non-mineral GDP.

Box 5. State Owned Enterprise Reform1,2
The government of Papua New Guinea (PNG) owns nine State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) which are
managed by the Independent Public Business Corporation (IPBC) and vested in the General Business Trust

(GBT) . These SOEs play a significant role in the domestic economy, with a total net asset value of $US 870 million
and responsibility for providing essential public services such as power, water, postal services, banking,
telecommunications, air travel, and seaports.
Yet the performance of SOEs in providing services to the people of PNG continues to be poor. Just 12% of
households have access to power, and only 15% of schools are connected to the electricity grid. Moreover, while
about 47% of the population had access to improved water
and sanitation facilities in 1990, only 45% had access in 2008.

Significant SOE reforms were initiated during 1999-2002, including a privatization program, establishment
of the Independent Consumer and Competition Commission and implementation of a policy introducing
competition into sectors previously reserved for SOEs. However, with a change of government in 2002 came a
new policy focused on the consolidation and growth of the SOE portfolio. While progress was made in
introducing competition for the telecommunications and airlines sectors, privatization activities were halted and in
some cases reversed, and accountability and transparency gradually eroded. During the subsequent period from
2002 to 2010, PNG’s SOE portfolio grew rapidly in asset size while generating steadily declining returns.
In the past six months the SOE policy framework has again shifted, with the 2012 National Budget
identifying a number of reform priorities. These include setting out the government’s dividend expectation for
the SOEs, a Community Service Obligation (CSO) policy to ensure SOEs identify and deliver CSOs on a commercial
basis, the development of Public Private Partnership (PPP) legislation to complement existing arrangements, and
an on-lending policy to ensure a level playing field between SOEs and the private sector.
In addition, a number of initiatives have also been identified to strengthen the role of the IPBC as an
independent and transparent manager of SOEs. These initiatives include amending the IPBC Act to clarify
IPBC’s governance and accountability frameworks; and developing a long-term SOE strategy which identifies
opportunities for public-private partnerships, and strengthened SOE monitoring mechanisms.

● Super-funds suffer decline in return on assets of 1½ points
● Big banks can absorb 40 percent drop, smaller entities suffer
● Distressed sales and in the extreme, credit crunch

equipment is dismantled and re-exported
● Sectors servicing LNG project and workers slow down
● Future LNG and mineral projects put into doubt

Fund Recommendations
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
Monetary policy needs to be tightened to contain inflationary
pressures and reduce the risk of higher inflation becoming
entrenched in expectations.

Policy Actions
The BPNG increased its policy rate twice to 7.75 percent last
year. In addition to issuing CBBs to mop up liquidity, the cash
reserve requirement has been increased twice by a total of
200 basis points to 6 percent. The nominal effective exchange
rate appreciated by 21 percent.

the MTFS threshold of 4 percent of GDP.
The government’s decision to allocate funds to meet its
superannuation obligations should be implemented as planned.
It should develop a payment schedule for remaining unfunded
superannuation liabilities.
The decision to move all new trust accounts to the BPNG
should be fully implemented.

The authorities met their current obligations but did not
allocate funding for the outstanding arrears prior to 2010,
which stands at about K2 billion.
Little progress has been made so far. The authorities plan to
further strengthen financial and reporting systems. They
intend to closely monitor spending from trust accounts and, if
required, consider ways to exercise expenditure control. They
plan to develop a finance instruction to guide the use of DSIP
trust accounts.

APPENDIX 3: PAPUA NEW GUINEA—DEBT
SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS1
1

Papua New Guinea (PNG) has reduced its risk
of public debt distress from moderate to low
since the 2011 Article IV Consultation. This
reflects both PNG’s reduction in public external
debt over the past decade, and an enhanced
debt capacity under the DSA following an
upgrade of the country’s policy and institutional
rating by the World Bank2. Under the baseline
scenario, all external debt sustainability
indicators remain well below their applicable
thresholds. Stress tests indicate that unstable
debt dynamics only occur if prices of copper,
gold and natural gas collapse and remain low

Background
1.

PNG has successfully reduced its

public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt
burden over the past decade. Total public
debt declined from 71 to 25 percent of GDP
from 2001 to 2011 (Table III.1). External public
debt fell from 50 to 10 percent of GDP during
this period (Tables III.1 and III.3). Multilateral
lenders such as the World Bank and the AsDB
account for about 75 percent of PPG external
debt, and bilateral creditors account for the
bulk of the remainder.

abroad to finance current expenditure plans.

Economic Outlook and Underlying DSA
Assumptions
3.

Until full scale LNG production in

2015, PNG’s economic performance will be
driven by LNG construction, commodity
price developments, and spending
associated with the 2012 elections. Real GDP
growth increased to 9 percent in 2011 as LNG
construction approached its peak phase, and
growth is projected to remain high at
8 percent in 2012 before slowing to 4 percent
in 2013. Large current account deficits (about
30 percent of GDP) during 2010–12 are being
mostly financed by a combination of FDI and
loan drawdowns by the mineral sector, and

persistent current account surplus. LNG
revenues will be used to pay down the mineral
sector’s external debt and provide dividend
payments to shareholders located abroad and
in PNG. Fiscal revenues from LNG are
projected to materialize from 2018 and total
mineral revenues will reach around 10 percent
of non-mineral GDP by 2024 (between the low
and moderate revenue scenarios identified in
FAD’s technical assistance report for PNG’s
sovereign wealth fund). Box III.1 contains the
medium-term macroeconomic framework for
the DSA.

Real GDP growth is projected to be 8 percent on average over the medium term, above the historical average
of 4 percent, and slow gradually to 3–4 percent in the long run. Over the medium term, growth in the LNG and
non-mineral sectors will offset the decline in copper and petroleum production.



Construction of the LNG project will pass its peak phase in 2013, and be finished by 2014. Production and
exports are expected to start in 2014 and reach full capacity in 2015, with a maximum capacity of 6.6 million tons
of LNG produced annually. Staff estimates that LNG production will raise the level of real GDP by about 20
percent in 2015. However, accounting for substantial income outflows, the LNG project is expected to increase
annual GNI by about 8 percent.



Inflation is projected to decline to 7 percent in the near term due to the end of PNG production. It will stabilize
at 6.5 percent by 2017, and at around 5 percent in the long run (after 2021).



The current account is in deficit in 2011 and the deficit is expected to remain sizeable until 2015, reflecting
strong import growth as well as services and income deficits associated with LNG construction. FDI and mediumto long-term debt inflows are financing most of the imports.



The grant element of loans is expected to decline. As GDP per head rises, the share of external financing
provided on concessional terms is expected to decline slightly over the projection period.1/



The primary fiscal balance is estimated to be in surplus of 1.5 percent of GDP in 2011, accounting for spending
from the trust accounts. Over the medium term small primary deficits are anticipated, but these turn into large
surpluses especially after 2022, as LNG tax revenues are realized.

__________________________
1/ Grant-equivalent financing (in percent of GDP) decreases over time. From 2016 onwards, the majority of new AsDB
disbursements are through OCR facilities, which carry a higher interest rate than ADF loans.

1/ Gross debt of central government less assets in sovereign wealth fund. State-owned enterprises are not included due to data limitations. Deposits held at the Bank of PNG are not included.
2/ Gross financing need is defined as the primary deficit plus debt service plus the stock of short-term debt at the end of the last period.
3/ Revenues excluding grants.
4/ Debt service is defined as the sum of interest and amortization of medium and long-term debt.
5/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
6/ The GDP deflator increases sharply in 2014-15 owing to a base year effect as the share of real activity accounted for by the oil and gas sector (which has experienced high inflation since the base year of 1998) increases

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes. Large
residuals in 2009-14 are due to a difference in timing between LNG-related debt disbursements and the shipping of imported component purchases to PNG. Long-run residuals reflect BPNG reserve accumulation.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly a
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

macroeconomic stability and fiscal
sustainability, the pre-requisites for
sustained growth. Given the developments of
the LNG projects and increased business
activity associated with these projects, it is an
opportune time, with appropriate policies, to
help notably lift living standards in PNG.
However, to avoid the paradox of plenty there
is a need to effectively manage the revenues
from nonrenewable resources. In addition to
spending these revenues gradually over time
to address development needs such as
infrastructure, education, health, and law and
order, the authorities will need to be
particularly mindful of the absorption capacity
of the economy. On top of that, the authorities
should not borrow against future LNG revenue
to fund large infrastructure projects. Further,
holding accumulated assets offshore will be
essential to avoid currency appreciation that

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

ANNEX V: PAPUA NEW GUINEA—STATISTICAL ISSUES
A. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some
shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for
surveillance. Severely affected area is national
accounts with fiscal accounts and balance of
payments of concern as well.
National accounts: The National Statistical
Office (NSO) lacks sufficient staff with
computer training. The accuracy and reliability
of the data are affected by inadequate source
data. The Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG)
and the Department of Treasury produce the
most current data. In mid-2000, the NSO
released a set of national accounts (NA)
estimates: National Income, Expenditure and
Product, 1993–98. These estimates were
compiled using the 1968 System of National
Accounts. However, the NSO has been working
to implement the 1993 SNA. In March 2004,
the NSO released a preliminary set of national
income, expenditure, and production accounts
estimates for 1994–2002, rebased to 1998
prices. As these figures are still in need of
substantial improvements, the 2006 STA
multisector mission recommended against
publication of the new GDP data until the
needed revisions are made. In an attempt to
fill the vacuum, the Treasury—responsible for
Government finance statistics (GFS)—has
actually assumed the role of estimating the NA
for 2002 to the present. Expenditure side data
are available until 2006.
Prices statistics: The NSO currently compiles a
new quarterly wholesale price index (which it
does not publish) and a quarterly consumer
price index that is based on weights that are
thirty-five years old. The NSO intends to use

the results of the 2009/10 Household Income
Expenditure Survey (HIES) to rebase the CPI.
The survey documents are currently being
prepared for publication
Government finance statistics: Annual GFS
reported to STA suffer from insufficient
coverage. While central government tax
revenue statistics are generally accurate and
timely, nontax revenue and public expenditure
data are deficient. In particular, development
budget expenditures and the utilization of
grants and project loans are recorded with
long lags, and few records on the use of trust
accounts are available. While interest payment
records are accurate, there are timing issues
regarding the recording of interest on discount
securities. These weaknesses contribute to
discrepancies in domestic financing between
estimates from monetary and debt data and
those derived from fiscal records. The 2006
STA multisector mission encouraged the
authorities to prepare a list of public sector
units to permit a comprehensive delineation of
the levels of government, which should help
reconcile the GFS with other datasets.
Monetary statistics: Monetary data are now
being produced and reported to STA on a
regular basis. Previous monetary and financial
statistics (MFS) missions helped to (i) finalize
the review of the collection, compilation, and
dissemination procedures of monetary
statistics by the BPNG; (ii) develop a work
program to facilitate the full implementation
of the methodology recommended in the
Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual
(MFSM); (iii) introduce the standardized report

forms (SRFs) for reporting monetary data of
the central bank, other depository
corporations, other financial corporations
(OFCs) monetary aggregates; and (iv) finalize
the integrated monetary database that meets
the data needs of the BPNG, STA, and APD. A
MFS mission is scheduled for FY 2013 to
introduce the SRF for OFCs with complete
institutional coverage.
Balance of payments statistics: Annual
balance of payments data are derived from the
International Transactions Reporting System
(ITRS), which is not tightly monitored despite
the BPNG reporting requirements. There are
marked differences between the official data
on exports and imports of goods and those
reported by trading partners. The financial

accounts data are of poor quality because of
major deficiencies in data collection, especially
in the area of private external debt and foreign
direct investment. Quarterly data are also
published by the BPNG. The 2006 STA
multisector mission identified as a priority the
strengthening of current account estimates,
including through improved classification of
investment earnings, trade credits, and grant
receipts as well as enhancing source data for
imports and exports. Progress is being made
to implement the recommendations from the
PFTAC’s BOP missions in June 2008 and
November 2009. A follow-up PFTAC BOP
mission is scheduled for FY 2012, but not yet
fielded.

B. Standards and Quality
PNG participates in the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS) since February
2012.

C. Reporting to STA
Papua New Guinea last reported government
finance statistics for publication in the
Government Finance Statistics Yearbook and in
International Financial Statistics for 1999–2002

government.
Monetary data are reported to STA for

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
June 1, 2012

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Papua New Guinea
On May 14, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Papua New Guinea, and considered and
endorsed the staff appraisal without a meeting. 1
Background
Papua New Guinea has seen solid economic growth over the past decade, supported
by sound macroeconomic policies, improved public finances, moderate inflation, and
attractive conditions for foreign investors in the mining and petroleum industries. While
Papua New Guinea remains a low-income country, its resource wealth is an opportunity
to raise living standards for all. To achieve its development targets, the government is
focusing on public services, including education, health, law and order, and
infrastructure. Reforms are under way to raise the efficiency of public enterprises and
increase competition in the private sector.
Real GDP is estimated to have increased to about 9 percent in 2011 from about
7.6 percent in 2010. Elevated commodity prices, the construction of a liquefied natural
gas project, and government spending are boosting the economy and generating
inflation pressures. The temporary closure of key mines, caused by natural disasters,
and dwindling oil production dampened overall output growth. Headline inflation peaked
just below 10 percent in the second quarter of 2011, but subsequently eased to
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings
up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

7 percent at year-end in line with declining international food prices and the appreciation
of the kina.
After a large fiscal deficit in 2009, the budget returned to surplus in the last two years.
Higher-than-expected commodity prices boosted government revenue and greater
spending discipline, including on spending out of trust accounts, resulted in budget
surpluses. The Bank of PNG raised its policy rate by 75 basis points to 7¾ percent,
increased commercial banks’ cash reserve requirements by 200 basis points to
6 percent, and issued central bank bills to mop up liquidity. The nominal effective
exchange rate appreciated by 21 percent in 2011.
The financial sector remains profitable and well capitalized, but vulnerabilities have
increased. Exposure to the heated real estate sector continues to fall. However, the
non-performing loans ratio increased and provisioning of commercial banks dropped.
The current account deficit widened to 36 percent of GDP in 2011, driven by the rise in
imports for the construction of the LNG plant and the compensation of foreign workers.
The deficit was, however, largely financed by FDI and private external debt related to
the LNG project. Public external debt declined to 9.8 percent of GDP by end-2011.
Executive Board Assessment
We commend the authorities for achieving macroeconomic stability and a sustainable
fiscal position. 2To preserve these achievements and promote inclusive development, it
will be important to combine steady, affordable growth in government spending with
improvements in public financial management and expenditure effectiveness. This
should be accompanied by structural reforms and a flexible monetary policy.
After 10 years of uninterrupted economic growth, the medium-term outlook remains
positive. Risks to the outlook are broadly balanced and predominantly related to the
resource sector. 2
Further monetary tightening would likely be needed to anchor inflation expectations at
the Bank of PNG’s 5 percent reference value. Reducing excess liquidity by raising
banks’ cash reserve requirements and limiting reserve accumulation would be the most
effective ways to achieve tighter monetary conditions. Going forward, greater exchange
rate flexibility would provide an important buffer against external shocks.
Fiscal policy should target a smooth expenditure path. Such a policy would help sustain
solid economic growth with moderate inflation, and provide reliable funding for essential
public services. It could be implemented through tighter control of expenditure growth in

responses by the authorities.

the current election year, and steady increases in real spending per capita over the
medium term.
PNG’s resource sector could make a larger contribution to public revenues. Efforts to
promote this could include strengthening revenue collection, reinforcing the internal
revenue and customs services, streamlining existing tax concessions, and applying the
Additional Profits Tax to mining activities, given that the average effective tax take from
resources appears to be on the low side of fiscal regimes across the world.
The SWF provides a strong framework for insulating public expenditure from volatility in
resource revenue, and for improving transparency, accountability, and good
governance. Withdrawal rules should be set in accordance with the new Medium-Term
Fiscal Strategy. Once the SWF is established, all existing trust accounts should be
consolidated with the fund.
We welcome the government’s agenda for better public services. Plans to increase the
expenditure share of key development priorities—education, health, law and order, and
infrastructure—go in the right direction. However, to deliver better public services
marked gains in the effectiveness of public spending are needed. Therefore we
encourage the authorities to develop a multi-year budget for selected expenditures and
invest in the reform of key ministries responsible for planning and service delivery.
More competition would benefit consumers and raise efficiency. We encourage the
authorities to strengthen enforcement of competitive behavior and replace existing
monopolies. The introduction of exclusive production rights and import protection for rice
would go in the wrong direction and hurt consumers. The authorities should proceed
with SOE reforms.
The current account deficit is largely financed by FDI and is not expected to threaten
external stability. The exchange rate is estimated to be modestly undervalued and
reserves are adequate to address potential balance-of-payments needs.
The financial sector remains sound. Banks have high capital adequacy ratios and
should be resilient to contagion from the Euro area, but need to maintain appropriate
lending standards and further reduce exposure to the real estate sector. Financial
supervision has been of high quality, and the planned enhanced cooperation among
supervisors is welcome. The authorities should implement the remaining 2011 FSAP
recommendations.
The authorities need to urgently tackle structural deficiencies in the provision of national
statistics. Gaps in macroeconomic data provision complicate PNG’s public policymaking and Fund surveillance. This requires immediate reform and strengthening of the
relevant government agencies.
