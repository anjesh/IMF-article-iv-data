Political Background: Following elections in July 2009, the center-right Citizens for
European Development of Bulgaria (GERB), led by Mr. B. Borisov, the former
Mayor of Sofia, formed a new minority government, with 116 out of 240 seats in the
National Assembly. It has promised to crack down on organized crime and corruption
and to reduce the role of the government. The largest opposition parties include the
Bulgarian Socialist Party, the National Movement for Stability and Progress (the
former King Simeon Saxe-Coburg's party), and the Movement for Rights and
Freedom. The next parliamentary elections will take place in July 2013, while the
presidential election is scheduled for October 2011.
Fund Relations and Exchange Rate Regime: The previous Article IV consultation
was concluded by the Executive Board on March 4, 2009. Since July 1, 1997, the
Bulgarian National Bank has operated a currency board arrangement, pegged to the
euro at the rate of lev 1.95583 per €1. Bulgaria has accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, Sections 2–4, and maintains an exchange system free of restriction on
the making of payments and transfers for current international transfers.

I. STAFF APPRAISAL AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.
In the years that preceded the global economic and financial crisis, large capital
inflows into Bulgaria generated a domestic demand boom. This brought strong GDP and
employment growth, but also widened the current account deficit to very high levels, and led
to an overheating of the economy, with high wage growth and double-digit inflation.
2.
The boom came to an end in the fourth quarter of 2008, amid the global crisis
that followed the default of Lehman Brothers. A sharp adjustment in capital inflows led to
a contraction of domestic demand, while the recession in Bulgaria’s trading partners caused a
drop in exports. As a result, GDP contracted by 5.0 percent in 2009.
3.
With capital inflows unlikely to re-reach pre-crisis levels both the private sector
and public sector will need to adjust. The private sector will need to shift resources from
the non-tradable to the tradable sector. For the shift to the tradable sector to be successful,
wage growth will need to slow considerably in 2010 and remain moderate over the medium
term. Public policies will also need to attune to the end of the domestic demand-driven
revenue boom and adjust spending growth to the new environment. Sustaining the built-up
public buffers is important because private sector vulnerabilities remain considerable. Private
sector external debt is 106 percent of GDP, while foreign currency debt of the non-financial
private sector amounts to 80 percent of GDP.
4.
Adjusting public policies would also help prepare the country for eventual euro
area membership. The currency board has been a pillar of stability and eventual euro
adoption continues to be the only viable exit strategy. Maintaining fiscal discipline and
deepening structural policies will strengthen economic fundamentals and the viability of the
Bulgarian economy. It will also help make a compelling case that Bulgaria can rapidly adjust
its economy within the confines of the currency board, meet all the Maastricht criteria, and
prevent the re-emergence of external and internal imbalances.
5.
Fiscal policy in 2010 will be challenging—notably meeting the government’s
cash deficit target of 0.7 percent of GDP. On the revenue side, projections seem optimistic,
in particular given the shortfalls in the second half of 2009. Recent increases in excise duties
and a number of reforms to improve tax compliance are important contributions in
preventing a further erosion of tax revenues. However, in the short term they may not be
sufficient to offset the deterioration in receipts resulting from the macroeconomic situation
and the cut in the social security contribution rate by 2 percentage points. On the expenditure
side, the budget foresees a tight envelope, including a welcome freezing in public wages and
general pensions, streamlining of the public administration, and stricter controlling of health
care spending. The repayment of arrears built up in 2009 will further add to pressures on the
cash deficit but should be swiftly pursued to prevent cascading of arrears in the private
sector. Staff currently projects a cash deficit of 1.8 percent of GDP for 2010. Given the large

5
uncertainties on the revenue side, it will be key that the budgeted spending limits are closely
adhered to avoid risking an even larger deficit.
6.
For 2011 and beyond, giving fiscal policy a larger role in stabilizing the economy
can best be achieved by focusing, within a medium-term budgetary framework, on the
overall spending envelope rather than on headline balances. Targeting real spending
growth in line with cautious estimates of potential GDP growth would make public spending
more predictable, help prioritize spending and contain the large intra-year adjustments that
have characterized the past few years. Revenue windfalls should be used to build up fiscal
buffers that can be used in times when revenues fall short, while tax rate reductions would
need to be compensated by further expenditure reductions.
7.
As the Bulgarian economy emerges from the crisis and shifts toward more
export-led growth, fiscal policies can lend support to the adjustment also by creating
room for growth-enhancing expenditure shifts. By rationalizing the public administration
and making it more efficient and effective, including in absorbing EU funds, fiscal space for
expenditure in other areas could be created, including accommodating needs for higher
infrastructure outlays. Containing public wage growth, through the announced public wage
freeze in 2010 and increases in line with productivity over the medium term would not only
serve the budget constraint but also help limit economy-wide wage growth and help
competitiveness.
8.
Ensuring the sustainability of the social pension systems requires urgent
reforms. The combination of large pension increases and reductions in social security
contribution rates in the past has widened the gap between pension contributions and pension
expenditures, and the increases in minimum insurable incomes were insufficient to make up
for the revenue losses. At the same time, in the health care system distorted incentives have
led to a proliferation of hospitals, mispricing, and rising financing pressures, while
satisfaction with the quality of health services remains low.
9.
Continued stability of the financial system is key to safeguarding the economic
recovery. The main challenge for the banking system will be to absorb the increase in
non-performing loans that Bulgaria, like other countries, is currently experiencing. Thanks to
prudent regulation, the banking system has built up substantial buffers during the boom
years. Nevertheless, supervisors’ enforcement of a cautious dividend policy continues to be
appropriate. Contingency planning remains of the essence in Bulgaria as elsewhere, and in
that respect the recent creation of a financial stability unit at the BNB is welcome.
10.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

6
II. INTRODUCTION
11.
This year’s Article IV Consultation focused on how Bulgaria can adjust to the
end of the capital-inflows boom. Previous concerns that the global crisis might trigger a
balance of payments or banking crisis have not materialized, and the downturn has led to a
correction of previously built-up flow imbalances, although stock imbalances and
vulnerabilities remain high. However, while capital inflows will, over time, recover
somewhat from the low levels during the crisis, they will mostly likely remain well below the
unsustainable levels experienced before 2009, and both the private sector and public sector
will need to adjust to lower capital inflows.1
Box 1. Bulgaria’s Reactions to Past IMF Advice
Bulgaria and the IMF have maintained excellent relations, as reflected in the successful
completion of a series of Stand-By Arrangements. In recent years, the government has
maintained, in line with IMF advice, a prudent fiscal policy and built up large fiscal reserves,
thus providing strong support to the currency board.
Last year’s staff report noted that with the end of the domestic demand and fiscal revenue
boom, expenditure growth would need to slow substantially. The new government that came
into office in mid-2009 heeded this advice, and reversed much of the large spending increases
that had occurred in the first half of the year. Many of the key recommendations of the 2008
FSAP update mission and the FAD TA missions on tax administrations are being implemented.

III. THE GLOBAL CRISIS AND THE END OF THE CAPITAL-INFLOWS DRIVEN BOOM
A. The Boom of 2003–08
12.
Between 2004, when agreement was reached on EU accession, and 2008,
Bulgaria experienced a surge in capital inflows and a credit boom. Inflows were driven
by expectations of rapid convergence with the EU, and were further boosted by the
confidence-enhancing effect of the currency board and strong fiscal policy. By 2008, net
inflows had increased to about 34 percent of GDP—one of the highest among emerging
market economies. Boosted by capital inflows, credit to the private sector rose rapidly, and
the credit-to-GDP ratio climbed from 35 percent in 2004 to 73 percent in 2008.
13.
The surge in inflows generated strong GDP growth, but also a sharp widening of
external and internal imbalances.

1

Experience in previous EMC-crises suggests that after capital inflows-driven booms have ended, capital
inflows tend to remain depressed for a considerable time.

7



Real GDP grew by more than 6 percent annually, leading to a significant narrowing
of the income gap with Western Europe.



As the increase in domestic demand outpaced GDP growth, the current account
deficit widened from 5.5 percent of GDP in 2003 to 24 percent of GDP in 2008.



With unemployment dropping and the labor market tightening, wage growth
accelerated to a peak of 25 percent in June 2008. The overheating of the economy,
together with rising food and oil prices, resulted in a surge of inflation, which peaked
at 14.7 percent in June 2008.



The overheating of the labor market resulted in a real exchange rate appreciation.
Between the third quarter of 2006 and the third quarter of 2008, the unit labor cost
(ULC)-based real effective exchange rate (REER) appreciated by 26 percent, while
the CPI-based REER appreciated by about 16 percent.



GDP growth was to a large extent been driven by activities in the non-tradable
sectors—in particular financial services, real estate and construction.2

14.
As a result of the capital inflows boom, private sector balance sheet
vulnerabilities became large.


Foreign currency mismatches—largely in euros—have become substantial. Foreign
currency debt of the non-financial corporate sector stands at 80 percent of GDP; of
households 10 percent of

Construction and real estate business contributed more than half of gross valued added (GVA) growth
between 2004 and 2008H1, raising its share in GVA from 20.7 percent to 24.5 percent. During the same period,
average housing prices increased by more than 150 percent, with prices in Sofia and resort areas rising even
faster.

8
banks, which reduces concerns about debt sustainability. Public sector debt, on the
other hand, declined rapidly to only 16 percent of GDP (Table 1).


The net international investment position deteriorated to minus 112 percent of GDP
as of end-September 2009 (Table 2).

15.
With private sector vulnerabilities increasing, the public sector built up
significant buffers. Between 2004 and 2008, Bulgaria’s fiscal surplus averaged 2.8 percent
of GDP (the highest among EU new member states), which led to a sharp decline in the
public debt-to-GDP ratio (from 48 percent at end-2003 to 16 percent by end-2009), and
significant reserves in the fiscal reserve account (12 percent of GDP at end-2009).

B. The Global Crisis of 2008–09
16.
In the fall of 2008, the boom came to an end. In the global crisis that followed the
default of Lehman Brothers, the Bulgarian economy was hit by two shocks: capital inflows
declined sharply, which reduced domestic demand, while exports were hit by the recession in
Bulgaria’s trading partners (Figure 1). The impact of the shocks was fully felt in 2009, when
GDP declined by 5 percent—the first decline since the crisis of 1996/97:

FDI and other capital inflows declined as
well, although not as sharply. FDI decreased

investment plunged by 28.5 percent), and credit stagnated. Housing prices slumped
by 29 percent from their peak in Q3 2008, and the stock market corrected sharply.3


At the same time, exports were hit by the recession in Bulgaria’s trading partners.
Exports declined strongly in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009,
and stabilized thereafter. For the year as a whole, they declined by 22½ percent
(10 percent in volumes).

17.
The downturn led to a correction of previously built-up private sector flow
imbalances (Figure 3). The current account deficit narrowed from 24 percent in 2008 to an
estimated 9½ percent of GDP in 2009, and inflation dropped to 1 percent—from 15 percent
in mid-2008. Nevertheless, stock imbalances remain high (Figure 4).
18.
The decline in domestic demand led to a drop in fiscal revenues, but strong
corrective action in the second half of the year ensured that this did not result in a large
fiscal deficit (Figure 5).


In the first half of the year, in the run-up to the elections, expenditure continued
to increase rapidly (growing by 24.5 percent y/y in the first seven months) even
though revenue dropped by 11 percent. Most of the expenditure surge came from
pension increases (by 17 percent) and higher capital spending (66 percent increase in
the first seven month of 2009 y/y). Revenue shortfalls were exacerbated by a
reduction in social security contribution rates by 2.4 percentage points.



Decisive correction was taken in the second half of the year. The new government
that took office in July 2009 implemented sharp across-the-board spending cuts, in
particular for maintenance and capital spending. At the same time, most end-year and
other bonus payments in the public sector were scrapped, allowing to contain overall
cash spending growth in 2009 to less than 1 percent. Overall, the government
managed to contain the cash deficit to 0.8 percent of GDP. However, the cash deficit
was artificially lowered by the build-up of arrears, largely to the construction sector,
and the accrual based deficit widened to around 1.9 percent (in ESA-95 terms).

19.
The banking system remained stable (Figure 6). The end-2009 aggregate Capital
Adequacy Ratio (CAR) was 17 percent—well above the BNB regulatory minimum of
12 percent and the EU minimum of 8 percent—and the Tier I ratio increased to 14 as a result
of conversion of Tier II capital. Asset quality has deteriorated since the third quarter of 2008
but banks have been able to generate enough profits to cover the associated impairment
costs, and the coverage ratio of non-performing loans (NPLs) by provisions of 80 percent is
3

As of March 15, 2010, the blue chip SOFIX index is still some 78 percent below its peak reached in Q3 2007.

12
comfortable. Contrary to fears expressed by some international market participants 18
months ago, foreign parent banks have broadly maintained their level of funding of their
local subsidiaries and the BNB is unlikely to ask for commitment letters from parents of
systemic banks as it did last year.
20.
Nevertheless, aggregate financial soundness indicators mask substantial
heterogeneity across institutions. A few banks have a CAR just above 13 percent; several
domestic banks maintained positive profitability but provisioned less than their peers; and
most banks have limited the increase in NPLs by renegotiating with borrowers facing
difficulties. Banks that were the most expansionary just before the peak of economic activity
face more significant challenges.
C. Outlook for 2010 and Risks
21.
The authorities agreed that an increase in exports will lead to a recovery this
year, in line with other countries in the region. Staff projects that real GDP will increase
by 0.2 percent. However, domestic demand is expected to decline further, even though
financial markets have stabilized (Figure 7). On the back of an unwinding investment boom,
tightened credit, and weak economic activity, investment will likely drop further. At the

IV. POLICY CHALLENGES
The currency board remains the appropriate exchange rate regime for Bulgaria, and euro
area membership is the only viable exit strategy (section A). Maintaining the fixed exchange
rate regime, however, puts restrictions on policies. Growth will need to shift towards the
tradable sector (section B); fiscal policy will need to address the challenges arising from the
end of the revenue boom and heightened financing pressures in the social security system
(section C); while financial sector stability needs to be maintained (section D).
A. ERM-II Membership and Euro Adoption
23.
The authorities and the mission agreed that the currency board remains the
appropriate exchange rate regime for Bulgaria and euro area membership is the
authorities’ declared policy goal. The currency board has contributed to macro-economic
stability, not only by providing a nominal anchor, but also by disciplining fiscal policy. To
protect the currency board, Bulgaria has run large fiscal surpluses during the boom years,
built up significant foreign exchange reserves (Box 2), and these buffers served the country
well when the global crisis hit—avoiding the financing difficulties that have affected other
countries in the region.
24.
The government aims to apply for ERM-II membership in the spring. It would
proceed with this after its Convergence Report has been assessed by the European
Commission. The authorities felt they had strong arguments to be admitted, as they were one
of the few countries in the European Union that met the fiscal Maastricht criteria, the other
one being Estonia.
25.
Staff argued that the best way for Bulgaria to boost its ERM-II membership
prospect would be to maintain fiscal discipline and deepen structural reforms. This
would not only strengthen economic fundamentals and the viability of the Bulgarian
economy; but also help make a compelling case that Bulgaria can rapidly adjust its economy
within the confines of the currency board, meet all the Maastricht criteria, and prevent the
re-emergence of external and internal imbalances.
B. Shifting Growth Toward the Tradable Sector
26.
With the end of the domestic demand boom, growth will need to shift from
domestic demand to exports. During the boom years, growth in Bulgaria was to a large
extent driven by capital-inflows that fuelled domestic demand (Figure 8), and GDP growth
was concentrated in the non-tradable sector.

To facilitate the shift, wage growth, which had accelerated to over 20 percent
annually during the boom years, will need to be moderate. Average wage growth of the
employed under labor contract increased from 6 percent in 2004, to 22.7 percent in 2008,
resulting in a sharp appreciation of the ULC-based REER (37 percent since 2006).4 Wage

they did not include the sharp
reductions in under the table payments. Another composition effect which boosted official
wage growth, the authorities pointed out, was that employment had declined most strongly
among the lowest paid. Overall, the authorities stressed that labor markets and private sector
wages had already started to adjust; the freeze in public sector would also help contain
private sector wage growth.

29.
Staff and the authorities agreed that while the real exchange rate had
appreciated sharply in recent years, it was not obvious that the real exchange rate level
had become a problem (Box 3). Seen over a longer time period, Bulgaria’s real exchange
rate appreciation has been smaller than that of most other new member states of the EU
(Figure 9). Also, its market share has continued to increase, while wages remain the lowest in
the EU. This judgment was further corroborated by interactions of the mission with the
private sector, which did not consider the level of wages or the real exchange rate as an issue.
30.
A sustainable longer-term adjustment of the economy would be further helped
by a number of supportive structural reforms (Box 4). The business climate can be
strengthened by further cutting red tape and reducing the regulatory costs for doing business,
which are still considered burdensome and costly by the private sector, and by decisively
tackling the high share of the informal economy and corruption. As the health of the
corporate sector has deteriorated during the downturn, it is important to have strong legal and
institutional frameworks in place that support corporate workouts, restructuring and
bankruptcy procedures. Staff welcomed the authorities’ plan to assess the effectiveness of the
corporate insolvency framework and to amend it with a view to making it more supportive of
fast resolutions and of trust between creditor and debtor.
C. Fiscal Policy
31.
The 2010 budget sets out a cash deficit of 0.7 percent of GDP, to be achieved
through a combination of revenue and expenditure measures.


On the revenue side, the government has taken several measures. To increase tax
compliance, the government has restructured the National Revenue and Customs
Agencies, and intensified inspections to tackle particularly contraband activities. It

16
projects that these measures will yield about 0.6 percent of GDP in increased
revenue. It has also raised excises on cigarettes and electricity, and taxes on gambling
and real estate (with an estimated yield of ½ percent of GDP). These revenue gains,
however, will in part be offset by the reduction in social security contributions rate by
2 percentage points.5


On the expenditure side, cuts are planned in a number of areas. Wages and general
pensions in 2010 will be frozen and no end-year bonuses paid. The number of civil
servants will be reduced by 3 percent (with greater cuts at the ministries of about
15 percent) and the originally planned increase of pensions to widowers and those
over 75 years old was delayed from January 1 to July 1, 2010 (a saving of 0.2 percent
of GDP). Capital spending and subsidies are budgeted to rise; but the increase is
contingent on the expected higher absorption of EU funds and could be halted if
absorption falls short of targets.

32.
Staff argued that meeting the government’s cash deficit would be challenging,
and projected a cash deficit of 1.8 percent of GDP. While increases in excise duties and
reforms to improve tax compliance were important contributions in preventing a further
erosion of tax revenues, in the short term they may not be sufficient to offset the
deterioration in receipts resulting from the macroeconomic situation and the cut in the social

17
security contribution rate. Moreover, the projected yields from improved tax compliance
seemed optimistic, in particular given the shortfalls at end-2009 that highlighted the
difficulties to achieve measurable impacts from better tax compliance in difficult economic
times. On the spending side the repayment of arrears built up in 2009 would further add to
pressures on the cash deficit, but should be swiftly pursued to prevent cascading of arrears in
the private sector. Also, the projected savings on health care and social spending were
uncertain as they depend on the implementation of reforms. Given the large uncertainties on
the revenue side, it would be key that the budgeted spending limits are closely adhered to
avoid risking an even larger deficit.
33.
The authorities acknowledged the risks, but noted that they were committed to
not letting the deficit exceed 2 percent of GDP. Containing the fiscal deficit with a view to
supporting the currency board arrangement and preparing the way for ERM-II and euro area
membership remained the authorities’ overarching objective and they stood ready to take
additional measures on both the expenditure and revenue side.
34.
The mission argued it would be important to shift from ad hoc fiscal measures to
a medium-term strategy of fiscal policy from 2011 and beyond. Giving fiscal policy a
larger role in stabilizing the economy can be achieved by focusing, within a medium-term
budgetary framework, on the overall spending envelope rather than on headline balances.
Zooming in on headline balances in the past had given fiscal policy a pro-cyclical character.
Targeting real spending growth in line with cautious estimates of potential GDP growth
would make public spending more predictable, help prioritize spending and avoid across-theboard-cuts, and contain the large intra-year adjustments that have characterized the past few
years. Revenue windfalls should be used to build up fiscal buffers that can be drawn down in
times when revenues fall short. The authorities agreed with the desirability of a greater
medium-term orientation, particularly in the light of lower revenues.
35.
Within such a medium-term framework any tax rate reductions would need to
be compensated by further expenditure cuts. The authorities are well aware that lowering
the social security contributions rates further, an announced element of the government’s
fiscal strategy to reduce the cost of labor and support competitiveness, would widen the
financing gap of the social security system and require larger government transfers. This
would put at risk the government’s medium-term balanced budget targets and the
sustainability, in particular of the pension system. Staff also advised against a cut of VAT
rates as the budget relied heavily on this source of income6 and with the end of the demand
boom shortfalls are expected to be significant for years to come. The authorities agreed that

6

At 55 percent of total revenue, Bulgaria has the highest share of indirect taxes in the EU.

18
there might not be space for further tax rate reductions, and noted that they would only cut
tax rates further, if there was fiscal space.
36.
Staff argued that as the Bulgarian economy shifts toward more export-led
growth, fiscal policies can lend support to the adjustment process needs in a number of
ways. This includes not only containing the overall spending envelope, but also creating
room for growth-enhancing expenditure shifts, including accommodating needs for higher
infrastructure outlays. Priority should be given to the following areas (see also Box 4):


Ensuring the sustainability of the social pension systems requires urgent reforms. The
combination of large pension increases and reductions in social security contribution
rates in the past has widened the gap between pension contributions and pension
expenditures, and the increases in minimum insurable incomes were insufficient to
make up for the revenue losses. While
government transfers averaged about
3 percent of GDP until 2008, they have
surged to 5.2 percent in 2009, and are
expected to rise further to 6.2 percent
in 2010, as a result of the carry-over of the
sharp pension increase in 2009. This gap
can be reduced by a combination of the
envisaged slowing of pension increases
over the next years, after the freeze
in 2010, an adjustment of the pension
system parameters—including an increase
in the retirement age or the minimum years of contribution—addressing the
underreporting of insurable income, as well as a revision of those parameters that
have created inefficiencies in the system, including weaknesses in management of
disability pensions.



At the same time, distortions in the health care system need to be addressed. Due to
mispricing and other distorted incentives in particular hospitals have proliferated in
recent years (122 new hospitals had been created since 2004; about a 40 percent
increase) and created financing pressures for the public health insurance fund. A
comprehensive health care reform, with a view to improve the efficiency and quality
of the health care system is needed.7 The government’s on-going reform efforts aim at

7

Bulgaria has one of the highest numbers of hospitals and an above average number of hospital beds per capita
in the EU as well as longer hospital stays, lower bed occupancy rates, and an above average share of non-wage
spending.

19
mitigating the weaknesses in the health care system, including by rationalizing the
in-patient care. Swift completion of a broad-based health care reform will be crucial.


By rationalizing the public administration and making it more efficient and effective,
including in by raising the poor absorption of EU funds, fiscal space for expenditure
in other areas could be created. This is particularly needed to complete the delayed
agenda for upgrading Bulgaria’s public infrastructure and avoid it becoming a
bottleneck to economic growth as well as through other productivity-raising
measures, including in education and training.



Containing public wage growth, through the announced public wage freeze in 2010
and increases in line with productivity over the medium term would not only serve
the budget constraint but also help limit economy-wide wage growth and help
competitiveness.



A renewed push for privatization would not only enlarge the role of the private
sector, but also yield resources that could be used to replenish the fiscal reserve
account.

37.
The authorities broadly agreed on these issues, including the need for fiscal
structural reforms. They noted that health care reforms were already underway with the
goal of raising the system’s efficiency while improving quality of care. Eligibility criteria to
obtain funds from National Health Insurance Fund had been tightened and would soon result
in the closure of many hospitals. Moreover, the authorities are in the process of developing
quality standards, conducting a cost analysis, and review the pricing policies of medication.
On pension reforms, the authorities noted that an advisory council of experts had been set up
to develop reform proposals. Improving the absorption of EU funds is a priority of the
government as reflected in the recent nomination of a Deputy Prime Minister in charge of
this issue.
D. Financial Sector Stability
38.
The mission and the BNB agreed that existing capital buffers, together with
further countercyclical macro-prudential measures should allow the banking system to
absorb the increase in NPLs and associated provisions. Both the BNB and the mission
expect a further increase of the NPL ratio from 6½ percent at end-2009 to 10–10½ percent
in 2010 under the baseline scenario.8 Even if banking sector earnings could come under
8

The mission’s and BNB’s methodology were very similar: the mission used an estimated relationship between
the NPL ratio and the output gap, while the BNB’s methodology related the NPL ratio to the cumulative GDP
loss relative to the pre-crisis GDP growth trend.

20
greater pressure this year as a result of greater loss recognition and lower collateral values,
capital buffers are large. These buffers were further boosted by the BNB’s decision in
March 2010 to align its risk-weights to less conservative EU standards. This decision, which
is a further step in the BNB’s countercyclical regulatory policy, added about 1 percentage
point to the aggregate CAR. In addition, the BNB has asked banks to fully retain 2009
earnings and has decided to allow the inclusion of previous year’s audited earnings in the
calculation of own funds prior to a decision taken at the shareholders’ meeting.
39.
Another source of risk is a reversal of parent funding to their Bulgarian
subsidiaries. With many subsidiaries operating with a loan-to-deposit ratio well above 100,
the banking system crucially depends on parent funding for the extension of credit. Although
all foreign-owned institutions appear adequately capitalized and sufficiently liquid at the
current juncture, persistent financial tensions in a parent bank’s country of origin (which
could result from market concerns about sovereign debt sustainability) could spill over to
Bulgaria. The authorities emphasized that the BNB had appropriate tools in place for
liquidity monitoring and regular exchanges of information with parent bank supervisors.
Furthermore, the level of minimum reserve requirements as well as the requirement of a 15
percent coverage ratio of deposits from credit institutions, households and retail customers
by liquid assets have created buffers against liquidity risk.

The financial stability framework has recently been enhanced with the creation
of a Financial Stability Unit at the BNB. The mission welcomed the establishment of this
new unit, which reports directly to the Governor. It will produce an annual financial stability
report and will serve as the BNB’s secretariat in the context of the Domestic Standing Group
for Financial Stability. Other expected enhancements to the framework include the increase
of the deposit insurance coverage from EUR 50,000 to EUR 100,000 by end-2010 and the
inclusion of so-called preferential deposits in the set of insured deposits during 2011, in line
with a new EU directive in the making.9
41.
The frameworks for emergency liquidity assistance and bank resolution have
remained unchanged since the conclusion of the last Article IV consultation. According
to the BNB Law and BNB’s Ordinance No. 6, the BNB may extend loans in the event of a
liquidity risk affecting the stability of the banking system only to solvent banks experiencing
acute need of liquidity that cannot be provided from other sources. Such loans may not
exceed the limit fixed by the currency board arrangement. In case of need, the law would
also permit the use of part of the fiscal reserve account (3.9 bn euros at end-February 2010)
by the government. Following an FSAP Update recommendation, the BNB and the BDIF are
currently analyzing the modalities of the introduction of purchase and assumption
transactions in the bank resolution framework.
42.
The BNB believes it continues to be appropriate to give the same prudential
treatment to exposure denominated in euros and in leva. Forthcoming discussions at the
EU level will soon address the question of how EU level prudential regulation could help
reduce banks’ indirect currency risk in countries with high foreign currency denomination of
loans. The BNB explained that the Bulgarian real estate market was completely euroized and
that, as a consequence, the collateral value of most euro-denominated loans was also
denominated in euros, even if the borrowers’ income was denominated in domestic currency.

As of end-March 2010, before the increase in coverage, the resources of the deposit insurance fund covered
2.6 percent of insurable deposits.

Box 2. Reserve Coverage
Reserve coverage remains relatively comfortable under the staff’s baseline scenario. At end 2009,
official reserves (which were equal to 36 percent of GDP) covered 182 percent of base money.
Bulgaria’s currency board was designed in a way that foreign currency reserves equal much more
than 100 percent of the monetary base, as they also cover the government's deposit with the central
bank and the deposit of the central bank's Banking Department (the latter being set aside as a
safeguard against systematic liquidity problems). As a result, reserve coverage of broad money
(49½ percent) is well above the median of 34 percent for emerging economies and 32 percent among
emerging markets pegged regimes. Reserve coverage of short-term debt on a residual maturity basis
is 75 percent. Large part of short-term debt is from Bulgarian subsidiaries to their parent banks, which
reduces the roll-over risk.

Box 3. Bulgaria: Competitiveness
As a result of the sharp reduction in the current account deficit, CGER estimates of possible
overvaluation are well below last year’s estimates. According to the macro balance approach, which
compares the underlying current account deficit with the current account “norm”10 the real exchange
rate is now undervalued by 6.5 percent (compared to an overvaluation of 7.4 percent in last year’s
report). The external sustainability approach—which assesses the REER change needed to stabilize
the international asset position at the current level—suggests that the REER is undervalued by
4 percent—compared to an estimate of an overvaluation of 16.1 percent last year. Even with a far
more ambitious target (stabilizing the international investment position (IIP) at 60 percent of GDP),
the overvaluation would be only 5.6 percent.
However, CGER-type methods, which link the current account balance to the real exchange rate
level, may be less appropriate for Bulgaria, given that the large swings in the current account deficit
have primarily been the result of the swings in capital inflows and domestic demand, rather than
changes in the REER. The current account deficit increased between 2004 and 2007, as capital
inflows generated a domestic demand boom, and came down in 2009, when capital inflows declined.
Indeed, while the current account deficit came down in 2009, the CPI-based REER has continued to
appreciate in 2009, rising by 2.2 percent between 2008Q4 and 2009Q4.

Other indicators of competitiveness do not suggest that the real exchange rate is overvalued. Seen
over a longer time period, Bulgaria’s real exchange rate appreciation has been smaller than that of
most other new member states of the EU (Figure 8). Also, its market share has continued to increase,
averaging that of other EU transition economies, while wages remain the lowest in the EU.

Box 4. Structural Reforms and Convergence of the Bulgarian Economy11
Structural reforms can help accelerate the convergence of Bulgaria’s income levels with those in
Western Europe. In addition to the need for pension and health care reforms, discussed in the main
text, the following reforms are most essential:


Public administration reform. This reform is central to achieving higher levels of efficiency
and effectiveness of public spending, improving administrative capacity to use EU funds, and
further improvements in revenue collection. Optimization of administrative structures
includes reorganization of units, including closing down of unnecessary or duplicated units
and restructuring of staff. In addition, development of e-government may enhance
transparency, improve timely delivery of services, and minimize conditions for corruption.



Education reforms: Building on past achievement, education reforms can now focus on
enhancing the quality of student learning. Specifically reforms aim at improving quality of
education, promoting life-long learning, and providing equal access to education.



Business environment reform. Reducing the administrative burden on businesses and
enhancing entry/exit of firms is key to improving competitiveness and productivity, and to
developing a knowledge-based economy. The government aims at reducing the
administrative burden for businesses by 20 percent by 2012. While important improvements
in business environment have been undertaken, including reduction of the start-up capital for
firms, further reforms are needed to modernize the insolvency framework, extend the
regulatory reform to the municipal level, streamline the construction permits regime, contract
enforcement, and reduce costs of trading across borders.

Structural reforms in other areas—including energy and agriculture would also be helpful. Public
investment has a critical role in addressing infrastructure and environmental challenges in the medium
term. The government expects to make better use of EU funds to finance public investments.
Strengthening administrative capacity to absorb EU funds including at the municipal level together
with public-private partnerships can be main instruments for regional development, rural
development, and environmental protection.

1/ After the adoption of the budget, a change in the expenditure composition was made with interest spending lowered by BGN 33 million, maintenance lowered by BGN 166
million, and capital spending raised by BGN 199 million. The overall spending envelope remained unchanged.
2/ Public sector debt (includes guaranteed debt).
3/ Actual fiscal balance adjusted for the automatic effects of internal imbalance (output gap) and external imbalance (absorption gap) on fiscal position.
Structural balance (adjusted) = Fiscal balance - 0.4 * output gap - 0.1 absorption gap (see Country Staff Report 07/390, Chapter III).
4/ Percentage deviation of actual from potential GDP.
5/ Percentage deviation between actual absorption and the level consistent with external balance.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt;
r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency),
and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock.
r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth,
and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels of the last projection year.

II. BULGARIA: IMF-WORLD BANK RELATIONS
A. Partnership in Bulgaria’s Development Strategy
1.
The World Bank has been leading the policy dialogue in structural and institutional
reforms aimed at Bulgaria’s successful EU integration and convergence. On June 13, 2006
the Board of Directors discussed the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) of the Bank which
outlined the roadmap for the Bank’s country support for the period FY07-09. The strategic
priorities of the last CPS focused on: (i) productivity and employment; (ii) fiscal
sustainability and absorption of EU funds; and (iii) social inclusion. In addition to the Bank’s
ongoing lending operations in areas such as revenue administration, social investment and
employment promotion, district heating, and environment, the CPS included a three-year
program of three development policy loans (DPLs), totaling US$500 million equivalent, that
supported institutional reforms in the social sectors. In addition, the CPS program included
investment lending in road, trade and transport facilitation for South East Europe, social
inclusion, and municipal infrastructure. The Bank continues to undertake diagnostics,
providing a solid base for policy dialogue and design and implementation of its lending
operations in Bulgaria. The Bank is currently discussing with the Government the CPS for
the period FY10-13.
B. IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
2.
The Bank has the lead on the dialogue on the core structural aspects of the reforms,
while the Fund has the lead on the dialogue on the macroeconomic, in particular fiscal and
financial sector, aspects of the reforms. The IMF leads in the areas of macroeconomic
stability, fiscal, income, external sector policies, and its analyses serve as inputs into World
Bank policy formulation and advice. The Bank and the Fund share responsibility in the
financial sector, public expenditure management and budgeting, and tax administration.
B.1.

Areas of shared responsibility

3.
Financial Sector. In late 2001, staff of the two institutions carried out a joint IMFWorld Bank Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) for Bulgaria, providing a shared
perspective on the development agenda of the country and on the prioritization and
sequencing of reforms in the financial sector. Key findings of the FSAP have been used as
conditionalities on financial sector policies under both the SBA and the PAL program. A
follow-up to the FSAP was undertaken by Fund staff in the context of the 2004 Article IV
Consultation mission in March–April 2004, with the most recent update completed in
June 2008.
4.
Revenue Administration. Joint World Bank-IMF efforts led to the Revenue
Administration Reform Project (€31.9 million), approved by the Bank’s Board in 2003,
under which the new National Revenue Agency became operational on January 1, 2006,
integrating collection of tax and social security revenues and establishing an economically

4
efficient public revenue collection system that facilitates private sector development and
complies with EU requirements.
5.
Public Expenditure Management. The Bank has taken the lead in the dialogue on
the efficiency and effectiveness of public expenditures and has outlined policy directions in
the context of the Public Expenditure and Institutional Review1 of 2002, the Public Finance
Policy Review2 of 2006, and the Judicial Public Expenditure Review of 20083. In FY08-09,
the Bank provided technical assistance to the Ministry of Finance in strengthening
performance based budgeting and public investment budgeting and management. A public
expenditure review of the agriculture sector is currently being finalized.
B.2. Areas where the World Bank leads and its analyses serve as inputs into the IMF
policy formulation and advice.
6.
Education. The Bank has supported the government program in education. The three
DPLs, which were approved by the Bank’s Board in March 2007, November 2008, and
May 2009, supported the deepening of education reforms, in particular strengthening of the
institutional capacity of the Ministry of Education and Science to assess the quality of
education, and improve school governance and financing system. In addition, a second
Public Finance Policy Review4, finalized in 2007, outlined options for reforms aimed at
improving quality of education at all levels with special focus on vocational education and
training as well as the quality of and access to tertiary education.
7.
Health. The Bank supported the government program in health through two
investment operations and the DPL program. The DPL program focused on strengthening the
financial sustainability of the national health insurance system and enhancing the efficiency
of public spending on hospitals and pharmaceuticals.
8.
Social protection programs. Social protection programs—pensions, labor market
programs, social assistance, and short-term and family benefits—have a wide coverage
among the population. The Bank’s DPL program supported an employment promotion
program, which includes interventions to alter incentives both on the labor supply and the
labor demand sides. To create additional incentives for job searching and lower reliance of
able-bodied individuals on social welfare programs, the government has changed eligibility
criteria of some social assistance programs. In November 2008 the Bank completed a policy

The Bank has embarked on a multi-year poverty monitoring program aimed at
assessing the impact of government policies and economic growth on the poor. The first
poverty monitoring report5 provides a feedback loop so that policy adjustments can be made
as appropriate to take account of findings. In addition, in November 2008 the Bank’s Board
approved a Social Inclusion Loan aimed at addressing longer term constraints to social
inclusion, and facilitating the government’s absorption of grants from the European Social
Fund.
C. The World Bank Group Strategy and Lending Operations
10.
The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Bulgaria6, discussed by the Bank’s
Board on June 13, 2006, focused on three main themes: (i) productivity and employment, (ii)
fiscal sustainability and absorption of EU funds, and (iii) social inclusion. A CPS covering
the period FY10-13 will be presented to the Board in the latter half of FY10.
11.
The current active Bank portfolio in Bulgaria consists of 7 operations at the total
amount of US$ 369.6 equivalent. The World Bank’s assistance program in Bulgaria to date
comprises 46 IBRD operations with a total original commitment of US$3,003 million
equivalent, consisting of 15 adjustment loans (US$1,725.8 million), 24 investment projects
(US$1123 million), one debt reduction loan (US$125 million), four Bank-managed Global
Environmental Fund (GEF) grants, and two Bank-managed Prototype Carbon Fund (PCF)
operations. Of these 46 operations, 39 have been completed, of which 13 have been fully or
partially cancelled during implementation, and 7 operations are currently under
implementation (Table 1).

Economic and Sector Work. The country diagnostic work recently completed by the
Bank focuses on improving the transparency and accountability of public spending in the
judiciary, on strengthening institutions and governance in the forestry sector, and on policies
to increase skills and productivity of the labor force. A public expenditure review of the
agriculture sector is currently being finalized. Various pieces of country diagnostic work also
focused on private sector development issues and improvements in the regulatory
environment for doing business. These include an Investment Climate Assessment, a review
of the regimes of state fees, and a Review of Consumer Protection and Financial Capability.
In addition, the Bank updated the assessment of Bulgaria’s corporate governance and
auditing and accounting standards in the context of the Report on the Observance of Standards
and Codes program.
13.
As of March 1, 2010, IFC has 30 projects (completed and ongoing) in Bulgaria
with total commitments of over US$ 660 million. The single biggest investment of IFC in
the country is in the field of renewable energy in the form of a loan for the construction of
the largest wind park in Bulgaria. IFC is also involved in the development of the Galata gas
field near the Black sea cost. In line with IFC’s strategic goals for Bulgaria, IFC has
supported a company investing in agricultural land and promoting land consolidation. In the
financial sector, IFC is supporting two specialized SME banks; it established Bulgaria’s first
micro-lending bank and has invested in a venture fund, which is also targeting the SME
sector. In other industries, IFC had contributed to key manufacturing projects in the country–
it has supported the modernization and expansion of an electronics producer, a large steel
mill, and two glass processing plants. Some IFC projects entail an important environmental
component. One of the manufacturing plants, for example, is purchasing equipment which
would reduce its GHG emissions and the electronics producing company is making sensors
for cars that monitor the emission of polluting gases and improve fuel efficiency.

The Municipal Infrastructure Development Project was approved by the Board on November 24, 2009 and is
pending effectiveness.

7
III. BULGARIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision is generally adequate for surveillance purposes. Bulgaria participates in the
SDDS since 2003.
Real sector
1.
The National Statistical Institute (NSI) is responsible for compiling national accounts,
based on a system consistent with the System of National Accounts 1993 (SNA 1993) and the
European System of Accounts 1995. GDP data by activity and expenditure categories are
compiled and reconciled within an annual supply and use framework. However, government
output and final consumption are estimated on a cash basis. In addition, published national
accounts include current and capital accounts for the five main domestic sectors (general
government and its sub-sectors, financial corporations, nonfinancial corporations, nonprofit
institutions serving households, and households). Financial accounts and balance sheets by
institutional sectors and sub-sectors are compiled on annual basis since 2006. Quarterly
financial accounts and balance sheets are prepared by Bulgarian National Bank.
2.
The NSI has compiled estimates of quarterly GDP by the production and expenditure
approaches in current and constant prices since 1994. The preliminary flash estimates of
GDP and its components by production and expenditure side are produced and disseminated
45 days after the reference period. The quarterly updates are disseminated 70 days after the
end of the reference quarter with final figures disseminated after approximately 5 quarters.
The annual data are disseminated about 5 quarters after the end of the reference year. The
estimates at constant prices, which follow international standards, use chain-linked indices.
Problems remain in the coverage of private sector activities as well as regarding constant
price estimates of capital formation and external trade, although progress has been made in
the development of export and import deflators.
3.
On price data, the NSI produces a domestic consumer price index (CPI), a
harmonized consumer price index (HICP) according to Eurostat methods, and a producer
price index (PPI). All are updated monthly. The CPI series begins in 1995, the PPI in 2000
and the HCPI in 2005 (for earlier years it is set equal to the CPI). The coverage of the CPIs
was extended, although they still exclude some important sectors, mainly owner-occupied
housing and health and life insurance. Since 2004, financial services are included. Currently,
work has started on inclusion of owner-occupied housing in CPI within a Eurostat project.
The geographical coverage of the index is restricted to 27 urban areas that account for an
estimated 65 percent of sales.
4.
The flow of customs data has improved significantly in recent years and a new system
for processing customs records is near completion. The development of export and import
unit value indices is progressing smoothly and additional support is expected from Eurostat
in this area. The current indices are used as deflators for the import and export components of
the national accounts. The Import and Export Division of the NSI meets monthly with the
BNB to review data issues and ensure consistency between the NSI export and import data
and the balance of payments data.

8
5.
The national account data on employment and hours worked are compiled by the NSI
based on Labor Force Survey and adjusted according to the ESA’95 methodology. The NSI
also obtains current monthly estimates from a quarterly survey of establishments using all
public enterprises and a sample of private employers that excludes establishments with less
than five employees. The sample included 14,500 private employers out of approximately
142,000 qualifying private enterprises. The NSI household labor force survey is an
alternative source of data, but improvements are needed to make it more consistent with the
establishment survey, especially regarding agricultural employment. The survey is conducted
four times a year.
6.
The NSI also compiles and publishes wage data for various economic sectors. The
main shortcomings include: (i) under-reporting of private sector wages; and (ii) reporting of
average gross earnings only, not wages for time worked and wages by occupation.
Since 2002, every four years a survey on earnings is conducted which provides information
about average monthly and hourly earnings by economic activity, by occupation, by gender
and by education. The National Social Security Institute (NSSI) administrative data are
currently used to estimate wages by occupation and age (as well as the number of selfemployed and employment in small firms). The household budget survey could provide an
alternative source of data for private sector wages.
7.
A Population Census was conducted in early 2001 and is a source for redesigning the
household surveys conducted by the NSI, particularly the household budget survey and the
labor force survey.
Government finance
8.
In recent years, following the recommendations of a combined STA/FAD mission
and within the framework of fiscal reporting requirements for EU accession, the authorities
have made significant progress on implementing accrual accounting for government,
budgetary and statistical systems. Consolidated data on a cash basis, covering general and
central government operations, are routinely reported for publication in the GFS
Yearbook/Annual CD-ROM and in IFS. In addition, quarterly accrual GFS data are reported
on a quarterly basis for publication in IFS, through Eurostat. Since September 2008, the
Ministry of Finance (MOF) prepares and submits the SDDS indicators for the central
government finances in the IMF’s GFSM 2001 format. The same indicators are published on
the MOF’s website on a monthly and quarterly basis.
9.
The Ministry of Finance prepares data on the execution of the consolidated
government budget on a monthly basis, following the national presentation. These data are
not according to GFS standards. Aggregate data on revenue, expenditure, balance of the
general government and composition of the financing (in national formats) are published in
the monthly bulletin and posted on the MOF’s website, in addition to the GFSM 2001 data.
The authorities have made progress in presenting data on a disaggregated basis, including
expenditure by functional classification. In addition, a full economic classification of
expenditure is now available, and the authorities have provided such data on an annual basis
back to 1998.

9
Money and banking statistics
10.
BNB reports monetary data for publication in IFS based on the ECB framework for
the collection and compilation of monetary data.
Balance of payments
11.
Bulgaria provides quarterly balance of payments (BOP) statistics for dissemination in
the IFS on a timely basis. Yearly BOP data are disseminated in the Balance of Payments
Statistics Yearbook up to 2008. The BNB derives other sectors investment income data on
reinvested earnings, (debit) from the annual direct investment surveys of the NSI, as well as
through surveys of the largest foreign-owned enterprises, used for preliminary estimates.
Starting from 2002, data series on freight were revised according to a new methodology
introduced jointly by the BNB and the NSI. Since joining the EU in January 2007, the trade
data with EU countries are being collected following the INTRASTAT system. Data
collection for imports and exports with non-EU member states and the movement of goods
within the EU are still recorded through customs declaration.

BULGARIA
Staff Report for the Article IV Consultation—Supplementary Information
Prepared by the European Department
(In Consultation with Other Departments)
Approved by Anne-Marie Gulde-Wolf and Aasim Husain
April 27, 2010
1.
New information has become available since the Staff Report was issued. The
information does not change the thrust of the staff report, but further adds to staff’s concerns
in para 5 of the staff report that fiscal policy in 2010 will be challenging, and raises the likely
fiscal cash deficit for 2010.
Fiscal policy
2.
The 2009 fiscal deficit on an accrual basis (the concept used by the European
Union) was revised from 1.9 to 3.9 percent of GDP. The upward revision largely reflected
previously unidentified payment commitments for capital, maintenance and hospital
spending (1.3 percent of GDP) and exclusion of revenue of some cash dividends that were
received in 2009.1 The deficit on a cash basis has changed only marginally, from 0.8 to
0.9 percent of GDP.
3.
According to preliminary data, the cash deficit in the first three months of the
year amounted to 2.4 percent of GDP. The deficit in part reflects temporary factors.
Expenditures were affected by the partial settlement of arrears and payment commitment
built up in 2009. VAT receipts were affected by the temporary closure of the refinery in
February, which led to a reduction in oil imports, and by the repayment of VAT refunds that
had accumulated in the last quarter of 2009. Nevertheless, while detailed data are available
only until February, underlying revenues seems to have been weaker than expected as well,
highlighting the concerns in the staff report that revenue might fall short. The deficit has been
largely financed by a draw-down of fiscal reserves.
4.
To contain the full-year deficit, the government has adopted a package of new
fiscal measures, which it estimates will yield about 2.4 percent of GDP. On the revenue
1

The government had received in 2009 dividend payments from state-owned enterprises that exceeded the
profits of the companies in 2009. To the extent that they exceeded the 2009 profits, the dividends were already
included in revenues from previous years, which reduced revenues for 2009.

2
side, measures include the sales of emissions under the Kyoto protocol (0.7 percent of GDP),
the introduction/ increase in lottery, gambling, and luxury taxes, as well as the rent and sale
of state-owned land. On the expenditure side, the biggest savings are to come from acrossthe-board cuts in current spending (0.7 percent of GDP), a postponement in increases of
special pensions, and a reduction in social spending, while subsidies to the poor will be
raised somewhat.2
5.
With revenue shortfalls and higher payment obligations partly offset by new
measures, the government now expects to contain the cash deficit to 2½ percent of
GDP—compared with an original target of 0.7 percent of GDP, and a staff projection of
1.8 percent of GDP in the staff report. The deficit on an accrual basis would be slightly
lower (2.0 percent of GDP). The government plans to finance part of the higher deficit
through additional privatization proceeds (0.4 percent of GDP) and by issuing eurodenominated securities on the domestic market.
6.
In staff’s view, reaching the new deficit target with current measures alone may
be challenging and more will likely be needed. The estimated overall impact of measures
both on the revenue and the expenditure side appears optimistic, in particular given the risk
of implementation delays. To contain the cash deficit to below 3 percent of GDP, an increase
in the VAT rate may be needed (raising the VAT by 2 percentage points on July 1—an
option that is currently under consideration—could yield about 0.7 percent of GDP in 2010).
Other possible measures are an increase in social security contribution rates, as well as
additional expenditure restraint (in particular, maintenance and subsidies). The significant
and unexpectedly high amount of payment commitments and arrears that was built up
in 2009 also highlights the importance of timely and adequate fiscal reporting on an accrual
basis.
Economic Outlook
7.
Staff’s macro-economic projections remain broadly unchanged. The recovery in
exports is continuing (in the first two months of 2010, exports were 10 percent higher than a
year earlier), while domestic demand and capital inflows remain weak. Based on the strong
export performance, the government is considering raising its GDP growth projections
for 2010 to 1.0 percent, but staff’s projections remain unchanged at 0.2 percent.

2

The expenditure cuts are to be implemented by the Ministry of Finance allocating only 90 percent of budgeted
resources to line ministries for current non-interest expenditure until late in the year, when a revised budget is to
be adopted depending on budgetary developments. This procedure was adopted after a Constitutional Court
ruling rejected an article in the 2010 budget law which allows the government to revise the level of revenues
and expenditure without parliamentary approval in case of worse-than-expected economic performance. The
government has de facto resorted back to the “90-percent rule” used in previous years.

3
ERM-II membership
8.
Following the revision of the 2009 deficit, the government has put its ERM—II
application on hold. Whether it will pursue the application this year, will depend on whether
the EU commission will start an excessive deficit procedure for the 2009 deficit. The
European Commission has launched a procedure under which it will produce a report
identifying whether an excessive deficit exists, which is tentatively scheduled for mid-May.
9.
Market reaction to the postponement has been muted. CDS spreads changed little
after the announcement, remaining in the 200 basis points range reached in the weeks prior to
the announcement– well below the highs of over 650 basis points from a year ago. Similarly,
the stock market has shown little reaction, with prices remaining stable. Ratings agencies
have not changed their outlook on Bulgaria. Moody’s even announced that a ratings upgrade
for Bulgaria is still possible in the next 12-18 months despite the sharp revisions to the fiscal
deficit and its subsequent implications. In the last week, CDS spreads have increased by
30 basis points, to 236, as contagion from Greece led to an increase in CDS spreads for most
countries in Emerging Europe.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
June 2, 2010

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
Bulgaria
On May 3, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Bulgaria.1
Background
In the years that preceded the global economic and financial crisis, large capital inflows into
Bulgaria generated a domestic demand boom. This brought strong GDP and employment
growth, but also widened the current account deficit to very high levels, and led to an
overheating of the economy, with high wage growth and double-digit inflation.
The boom came to an end in the fourth quarter of 2008, amid the global crisis that followed the
default of Lehman Brothers. A sharp reduction in capital inflows led to a contraction of
domestic demand, while the recession in Bulgaria’s trading partners caused a drop in exports.
As a result, GDP contracted by 5.0 percent in 2009.
An increase in exports will lead to a recovery this year, and real GDP is projected to increase
by 0.2 percent in 2010. Investment will likely drop further, on the back of an unwinding
investment boom, tightened credit, and weak economic activity, while private consumption is
forecast to suffer from the decline in employment. Inflation is projected to remain moderate at
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
2.2 percent, while the current account deficit is expected to drop from 9½ percent in 2009 to
6¼ percent of GDP in 2010.
The downturn has led to a correction of previously built-up flow imbalances, although stock
imbalances and vulnerabilities remain high. However, while capital inflows will, over time,
recover somewhat from the low levels during the crisis, they will mostly likely remain well
below the unsustainable levels experienced before 2009, and both the private sector and
public sector will need to adjust to lower capital inflows. The private sector will need to shift
resources from the non-tradable to the tradable sector. Public policies will also need to attune
to the end of the domestic demand-driven revenue boom and adjust spending growth to the
new environment. Sustaining the built-up public buffers is important because private sector
vulnerabilities remain considerable. Private sector external debt stood at 102.7 percent of GDP
at end-2009, while gross foreign currency debt of the non-financial private sector amounts to
80 percent of GDP.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Bulgarian authorities for maintaining prudent
macroeconomic policies, which had helped steer the economy through the global financial
crisis. Directors noted that while the economy is poised to recover this year after a sharp
contraction, large private external debt and the potential spillover from regional uncertainties
pose considerable downside risks. Capital inflows are likely to remain low and domestic
demand is expected to decline further, requiring substantial adjustments by both the private
and public sectors. Wage moderation, alongside structural reforms to increase productivity, will
help facilitate a reorientation of the economy toward the tradable sector, while containing the
growth of public spending is a necessary response to the end of the revenue boom.
Directors underscored the importance of adjusting public policies to help prepare the country
for eventual euro area membership. The currency board arrangement has been a pillar of
stability, and euro adoption continues to be the most viable exit strategy. Maintaining fiscal
discipline and deepening structural policies will not only strengthen economic fundamentals
but also demonstrate that Bulgaria can rapidly adjust its economy within the confines of the
currency board arrangement.
Directors recognized the challenges facing fiscal policy in 2010, arising from revenue shortfalls
and a higher-than-expected stock of payables and arrears. They endorsed the government’s
plan to implement a package of measures in order to achieve the revised cash deficit target,
notably further cuts in current spending. Directors welcomed the authorities’ readiness to take
further steps to preserve fiscal sustainability, including tax measures. The higher-thanexpected build-up of arrears in 2009 also highlights the need for timely and adequate fiscal
reporting, including on an accrual basis.
For 2011 and beyond, Directors saw a larger role for fiscal policy in stabilizing the economy by
focusing, within a medium-term budgetary framework, on the overall spending envelope rather
than on headline balances. This would help make public spending more predictable and limit

the large intra-year adjustments. They encouraged the authorities to save revenue windfalls,
and to compensate any tax rate reductions by further expenditure cuts. On the fiscal reform
agenda, high priorities are closing the gap between pension contributions and pension
expenditures, and improving the efficiency and quality of the health care system.
Directors welcomed the continued stability of Bulgaria’s financial system, underpinned by
prudent regulation and adequate capital buffers. Nevertheless, in light of the rising
non-performing loans and the risk of a reversal of parent funding to subsidiaries in Bulgaria, it
will be important that the authorities remain vigilant, monitor liquidity closely, and continue
close cooperation with parent bank supervisors. Enforcement of a cautious dividend policy and
contingency planning are also priorities. Directors welcomed the recent creation of a financial
stability unit at the central bank, and looked forward to further improvements to the bank
resolution framework.

Statement by Age Bakker, Executive Director for Bulgaria
and Victor Yotzov, Advisor to Executive Director
May 3, 2010
The Bulgarian authorities appreciate the continued constructive dialogue with the Fund. They
broadly share the staff analysis and policy advice as presented in the Article IV report.
The end of the capital-inflows driven domestic demand boom
Until late 2008, Bulgaria experienced high growth rates and a rapid catch-up with the EU
countries. The confidence inspired by a good economic performance and, more recently, by
the accession to the EU has continued to attract substantial amounts of private capital
inflows, mostly in the form of FDI. While the surge in inflows did generate strong GDP
growth (above 6 percent on average for the last four years), it also caused a sharp widening
of the external current account deficit as the increase in domestic demand outpaced GDP
growth.
As a consequence of the global financial crisis that followed the default of Lehman Brothers,
the investment-driven boom came to an end. Capital inflows, that were fueling growth for
years, dried up which led to a significant contraction of domestic demand. On top of that, the
recession that hit Bulgaria’s main trading partners, mostly EU countries, caused a substantial
drop in exports. The impact of these two shocks was fully felt in the second half of 2009
when it became obvious that the economy will record the first contraction in more than a
decade. The decline in domestic demand and the reduction of imports, in turn, led to a swift
correction of previously built-up internal and external imbalances as evidenced by the sharp
decline of inflation and current account deficit. At the same time, the decline in domestic
demand, consumption in particular, along with shrinking imports, caused a considerable drop
in fiscal revenues which eventually resulted in an overall budget deficit – the first one since
2002. The level of public debt, however, remained low (about 16 percent of GDP) and is not
projected to rise.
The financial system, dominated by the banking sector, remained stable. Following the
global financial turmoil that started in 2007 and intensified after September 2008, foreign
funding declined, resulting in strong competition for deposits and a sharp reduction in credit
growth. The interbank market was affected as well but calmed down after some targeted
steps taken by the central bank it. Subsequently, volumes have resumed and interest rates
have moderated.
The policy response
The effects of the global financial crisis were exacerbated, to some extent, by the political
cycle and the large spending increases in the run up to the July 2009 parliamentary elections.
However, the new government that took office after the elections promptly reversed the trend

2
by implementing across-the-board spending cuts, in particular for maintenance and capital
spending. Thus, the government managed to contain the cash deficit to just 0.9 percent of
GDP. On accrual basis, however, the deficit is higher, currently estimated at about 3.9
percent of GDP. This rather big upward revision reflects accumulation of arrears due to some
previously unidentified payment commitments for capital, maintenance and healthcare
spending as well as exclusion of revenue of some cash dividends that were received in 2009.
It should be clarified, though, that a large part of the accumulated arrears is due to ongoing
revisions of the annexes to the contracts that various ministries had signed before the
elections. The government is well aware that repayment of the arrears should be swiftly
pursued to prevent cascading of arrears in the private sector. It has already started to repay to
those firms where the revisions have been finalized.
With regard to the 2010 budget, the authorities are trying to preserve fiscal sustainability in
the context of possible further slumps in revenue. In this regard, the National Revenue and
Customs Agencies have been restructured to allow for more and better coordinated
inspections so as to improve tax compliance. The excises on cigarettes, as well as taxes on
real estate were raised. On the expenditure side, cuts are planned in a number of areas.
Wages and general pensions in 2010 will be frozen and no end-year bonuses will be paid.
The number of civil servants will be reduced by 3 percent and the originally planned increase
of pensions to widowers and those over 75 years old was delayed. Moreover, while capital
spending and subsidies are budgeted to rise, the increase is contingent on the expected higher
absorption of EU funds and could be halted if absorption falls short of targets.
The authorities realize that fiscal policy will be challenging in the near future. As the crisis
deepened, the overall fiscal deficit of 0.7 percent of GDP budgeted for 2010 is hardly
achievable. Accordingly, the government is working on a new budgetary framework and a
new set of measures. On the revenue side, measures include the sales of emissions under the
Kyoto protocol, introduction/increase in lottery, gambling, and luxury taxes, as well as the
rent and sale of state-owned land. All this is estimated to yield about 2.4 percent of GDP
which, along with additional across-the-board cuts in current spending, will help offset
revenue shortfalls (mostly VAT) and higher payment obligations. These measures
notwithstanding, the overall fiscal deficit for 2010 (on cash basis) is now estimated to reach
about 2.5 percent of GDP and about 2 percent on accrual basis. This said, the authorities
stand ready to take further measures (including by raising the VAT rate) to preserve fiscal
sustainability. By applying such an approach the authorities reaffirm their strong
commitment to sound macroeconomic policies, acknowledging the paramount importance of
a prudent fiscal stance.
With regard to the financial sector, thanks to the prudent regulation in the years before the
crisis, the banking system has built up substantial buffers. The existing capital buffers, in
particular, together with further countercyclical macro-prudential measures should allow the
banking system to absorb the increase in NPLs and associated provisions. The BNB has
asked banks, as it did in the previous year, to fully retain earnings which will add to capital
buffers. Furthermore, the BNB recently implemented additional countercyclical measures

3
such as the alignment of its risk-weights on the EU standards, which are less conservative,
and inclusion of current and previous year earnings in the calculation of own funds. In
addition, and in relation to recent economic developments in some neighboring countries, the
central bank has intensified the liquidity monitoring and initiated regular exchanges of
information with parent bank supervisors.
The challenges ahead
The authorities are fully cognizant that the end of the capital-inflow driven boom creates
significant policy challenges. Recent economic developments in Bulgaria, as well as in the
region as a whole, suggest the need of a swift change in policy priorities. Until just a short
time ago, these were speeding up convergence and raising living standards, whereas now the
priority is focused primarily on preserving macroeconomic stability. In this regard, the most
important challenge is ensuring that the drop in capital inflows does not result in a
confidence crisis. Accordingly, the authorities attach great value to maintaining confidence in
the currency board arrangement and the financial system. Keeping public finances in check is
regarded as the key instrument.
Given the paramount importance of fiscal policy in the context of the currency board
arrangement, the authorities agreed with staff that an important policy challenge will be to
shift from ad hoc fiscal measures to a medium-term strategy of fiscal policy from 2011 and
beyond. More specifically, it was agreed that giving fiscal policy a larger role in stabilizing
the economy can be achieved by focusing, within a medium-term budgetary framework, on
the overall spending envelope rather than on headline balances. Under such a framework,
targeting real spending growth in line with cautious estimates of potential GDP growth
would make public spending more predictable, and help prioritize spending while avoiding
across-the-board-cuts. In addition, any revenue windfalls could be used to build up fiscal
buffers that can be drawn down in times when revenues fall short.
As the crisis escalated last year, there were some concerns that it might trigger a balance of
payments or banking crisis which would have forced the country to seek financial assistance.
Those concerns did not materialize. What happened was that the downturn led to a correction
of previously built-up flow imbalances. While capital inflows will, over time, recover from
the low levels during the crisis, an important policy challenge for the economy is to provide a
business-friendly environment.
Finally, with regard to the ERM II, the authorities maintain their long-stated position that
they will seek joining at the earliest possible date. The ongoing global financial crisis may
delay somewhat the process but has not changed the authorities’ determination. On the
contrary, they have started talks with their European partners and are ready to provide them
with firm and detailed policy commitments. The authorities’ plan is to uphold the currency
board arrangement at the existing exchange rate until Bulgaria joins the euro area. The
Bulgarian government and the central bank have committed to unilaterally maintaining a zero
deviation of the exchange rate after Bulgaria joins the ERM II.
