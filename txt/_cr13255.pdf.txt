STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 17, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context:
 Germany’s strong fundamentals underpin its role as an anchor of stability in Europe.


But uncertainty surrounding prospects and policies for the euro area—more so than
in Germany itself—are now weighing significantly on activity.



Reviving growth in Germany is tied to a sustained reduction in this uncertainty.

Risks:
 Should the alleviation of euro area uncertainty and a gradual recovery in the region
fail to materialize, German growth would remain below potential for longer.


A rise in financial stress in the euro area could interact with already weak regional
demand and uncertainty and amplify inward spillovers.



Weaker global growth prospects could compound these risks.



An extended period of low growth could also reduce the economy’s potential.

Policy recommendations:
 The small projected loosening of the fiscal stance is appropriate and fiscal overperformance should be firmly avoided in the current growth environment.


Financial reform momentum should be maintained both at the domestic and the
euro area level in order to alleviate uncertainty and reduce downside risks. The main
priorities are to build on recent improvements in financial stability and on progress
towards reversing the fragmentation of banking systems across Europe.



Over the medium term, efforts to raise the German economy’s growth potential
need to be sustained.

CONTEXT: THE IMPACT OF EURO AREA UNCERTAINTY
1.
Activity in Germany lost momentum in 2012. This staff report argues that despite
supportive domestic financial conditions and robust corporate balance sheets, the sharp slowdown
during the course of last year and into early 2013 is mainly due to negative spillovers from the
recession in the euro area that has been
amplified by uncertainty about prospects
and policies in the region more so than in
Germany itself. In this sense, the
circumstances for Germany have changed
since the 2012 Article IV consultation: at
that time, Germany seemed relatively
immune to developments in the rest of the
euro area although the risk of inward
spillovers were flagged. Of course, euro
area uncertainty is likely to be a factor
restraining growth in other euro area
economies as well. It is nevertheless
reasonable to question the extent to which
the staff’s diagnosis is valid that euro area
uncertainty is now playing an important key role in German economic prospects. The section “Point
and Counterpoint to the Staff Views” (page 29) therefore attempts to highlight counterarguments to
the staff’s diagnosis and key policy recommendations, and offers some responses in order to
provide additional context to the staff’s preferred policy recommendations.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
A. From Rebound to Moderation
2.
The rebound of 2010-2011 gave way to weakening momentum during the course of
2012 when growth fell below potential (Figure 1). While exports to the rest of the world began
to recover by mid-2012, in line with improved prospects in the United States and emerging
economies, exports to the rest of the euro area continued to decline as the deep recession in the
region continued. However, as anticipated in last year’s consultation, consumption grew robustly as
unemployment remained near post-reunification lows and wages rose well above inflation.
Negotiated wages in manufacturing rose 3.4 percent in 2012, well above the average of the
preceding decade. Nevertheless, the decline in business investment continued to closely track
exports to the euro area, leading to a contraction in activity in the last quarter of 2012, before
stabilizing in the first quarter of this year. For 2012 as a whole, GDP grew by just under 1 percent,
appreciably below potential.

The decline in export growth is largely driven by a
substantial slowdown of exports to Europe and, in
particular, to the rest of the euro area, while exports to
non-European countries has held up relatively well.

In contrast, the decline in import growth in all three
regions has converged more recently.

Box 1. What is the Effect of Uncertainty on Economic Activity in Germany?1
Heightened uncertainty appears to be holding back a more robust rebound in Germany. In the current
environment, corporates find it worthwhile to delay projects which are costly to undo.
Measuring uncertainty can be challenging. The economic policy uncertainty index by Baker, Bloom, and
Davis (2012) is an important advancement in the literature.2 It has two underlying components: The
dispersion of individual-level forecasts regarding consumer prices and federal government budget balances
as a proxy for uncertainty, and the quantification of newspaper coverage of policy-related economic
uncertainty. While this measure could be challenged, it is highly correlated with other uncertainty measures
developed in the literature, including those based on confidential micro data from the German IFO Business
Climate Survey (see figure below ).3 Moreover, the German and European measures of policy uncertainty
move in tandem indicating uncertainty spillovers. In contrast, the VDAX—a measure of financial stress—has
been on a downtrend over the last year, as expected given ample liquidity (see Figure 2 and paragraph 3).4
The index-based evidence is corroborated by firm-level surveys. A survey of 23,000 firms in Germany
reveals that economic policy conditions are more of a risk factor than foreign demand (although these are
not necessarily mutually exclusive). More generally, it seems that firms are now more sensitized to
developments in the region. Other secondary sources of uncertainty are domestic in nature and include
ambiguity regarding potential post-election tax increases and the future cost of energy.

The VDAX index (broadly the European counterpart of the VIX) is one measure of financial uncertainty (a financial “fear” index),

and corresponds to the implied volatility of the DAX (German stock index).

3.
Elevated levels of uncertainty have been an important contributor to the unexpected
weakening of business investment. Both financial stress and policy uncertainty have been
established in the recent economic literature to be associated with weakening economic activity (see
Bloom (2009) and Cardarelli and others (2011)). Financial stress in the euro area has abated, in part
due to decisive and timely policy actions by major central banks. However, policy uncertainty at the
euro area level is still perceived as high, and uncertainty in Germany is closely linked to that of the
region (Figure 2). Moreover, the sensitivity of various components of German GDP, and especially

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

GERMANY

investment, to uncertainty appears to have risen since the beginning of the global financial crisis
(see Box 1). This sensitivity of German businesses to euro area uncertainty with the potential to
dampen regional prospects further is also borne out in recent surveys, which indicate that this is one
of the most important reasons to postpone investment and adopt a wait-and-see attitude for some
40 percent of SMEs, suggesting that the real option value of postponing investment is currently very
high despite easy financing conditions. While heightened euro area uncertainty (as well as domestic
policy uncertainty in some cases) may play an

There are no signs of elevated
inflation or asset price pressures. Lower
inflation in recent quarters reflects mainly a
decline in food and energy prices and some
widening of the output gap. Core inflation has,
however, increased slightly reflecting rising
wages. Nationwide property prices have
continued to rise, driven mainly by stronger
increases in apartment prices in some major
cities. However, these prices remain below
historical averages and do not appear excessive.

B. Outlook and Risks: Contingent on Euro Area Uncertainty
Staff Views
5.
The outlook for the remainder of 2013 and next year is heavily dependent on a
gradual recovery in the rest of the euro area and a sustained reduction in uncertainty.
Consumption is expected to continue to expand robustly this year given favorable labor market
conditions and wage agreements. However, exports to the euro area are expected to recover only
gradually, and economic prospects for key emerging markets (EMs) have recently weakened. Euro
area uncertainty is expected to continue to have an amplifying impact on investment through the
end of the year and assumed to diminish subsequently. Growth for 2013 as a whole is thus projected
at around 0.3 percent, reflecting continued below-potential growth in the second half of the year.
8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GERMANY

Growth in 2014 is projected to return to potential. Core inflation is expected to continue rising
gradually over the next two years due to wage increases. Headline inflation this year is, however,
projected to moderate due to the lower energy prices.

6.
The baseline outlook is subject to a number of interrelated and mutually reinforcing
downside risks (see Risk Flow Chart and Risk Assessment Matrix).


Given its high degree of trade and financial openness, Germany is highly susceptible to a
slowdown in external demand and/or elevated financial stress. At the regional level, euro area
shocks could be transmitted via trade and financial channels. Higher borrowing costs associated
with an exit from unconventional monetary policies in the United States could dampen growth,
especially if the rise in yields is not commensurate with the pickup in global economic activity
(see 2013 Spillover Report for a discussion). At the same time, the interaction between weaker
economic activity and elevated financial stress in the euro area could be mutually reinforcing,
owing to already strained balance sheets in a number of countries, and be further exacerbated
by waning confidence or heightened euro area uncertainty. A deeper-than-expected slowdown
in major emerging market trading partners would compound these risks. A significantly weaker
German outlook would in turn affect both regional and global growth prospects, primarily
through the trade channel.



Policy uncertainty regarding the roadmap and key elements of reforms to the euro area
architecture, prospects for a recovery of activity in the euro area, and the still unsettled

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

GERMANY

regulatory and supervisory landscape for the financial system, represent another factor which
could magnify the effects of the intertwined shocks discussed above.


In terms of risks of a more medium-term nature, an extended period of low growth could lead
to hysteresis-type effects by lowering potential growth.



Risks to domestic financial stability may surface owing to, for example, a shock to confidence by
depositors and creditors in systemically important institutions, which by increasing risk aversion,
could disproportionately suppress economic activity and trigger contagion more broadly.

Authorities’ Views
7.
The authorities agreed with staff’s diagnosis that euro area uncertainty was the
primary driver of the decline in business investment. They agreed that domestic balance sheets
and labor markets are strong in Germany, financial conditions remain supportive, and that exports
to destinations outside of Europe are rebounding. They noted that businesses have postponed
investment projects, adopting a wait-and-see attitude towards euro area uncertainty, rather than
cancelling projects outright as they await uncertainty to diminish. They were optimistic that on the
basis of reforms taken by other economies in the region, as well as decisions and measures adopted
at the level of the EMU in recent months, uncertainty could be expected to recede relatively quickly.
Therefore a rebound in pent-up investment demand could happen earlier than staff assume and
lead to somewhat higher growth in 2013 than is currently being projected by staff.
8.
The authorities agreed that a number of downside risks cloud the outlook. Germany
remains susceptible to changes in external conditions, and the authorities supported the staff’s
conclusion that the decline in overall investment primarily reflected developments in the euro area
and not domestic conditions. They noted that German businesses have been reorienting themselves
towards the economies that drive global growth, and could expect to eventually be less vulnerable
to adverse developments in the region. The authorities did not fully share the view that the roadmap
towards reforms of the euro area architecture was uncertain and highlighted the many important
advances made over the past year and the still ambitious agenda for this year. The impact of euro
area risks could thus be somewhat lower than indicated by staff. The authorities also underscored
that the risks facing the Germany economy are multifaceted and intertwined, creating a wide margin
of uncertainty around individual risks’ probabilities, especially when the time frame for the
materialization of risks is unclear. They were of the view that a qualitative assessment of risks and
impacts is somewhat easier to communicate and understand.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GERMANY

REVIVING GROWTH IN AN UNCERTAIN
ENVIRONMENT
The main policy challenge over the near term is to reinvigorate growth and manage
downside risks. Policies need to ensure that the fiscal stance does not induce headwinds
to a recovery, and efforts need to be made to address the underlying causes of
uncertainty in the euro area. Guarding against downside risks primarily involves
maintaining steady progress on financial reforms both domestically and at the euro area
level. Progress on financial reforms would also help alleviate an important source of
uncertainty that is weighing on growth.

A. Fiscal Policy

Once again in 2012, the outturn was better than projected by both staff and the
authorities. The surplus of 0.1 percent of GDP was 0.8 percentage points stronger than projected at
the time of the 2012 Article IV consultation.

10.
Following three successive years of robust fiscal performance, Germany’s fiscal stance
is comfortably in line with its medium-term objectives. Germany has achieved the deficit goals
at the federal level under the national debt brake rule (Schuldenbremse) well ahead of schedule and
the general government balance is already in line with commitments under the Fiscal Compact of
the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).

11.
A modest loosening of the fiscal stance is projected for 2013 and with little further
consolidation over the medium term. Staff projections point to a general government balance of
–0.4 percent of GDP this year, consistent with a widening output gap. The structural fiscal position is
projected to be in balance, implying a mildly expansionary stance. From 2014 onwards, only modest
structural consolidation is foreseen. While public debt is projected to decline under the baseline, the
debt trajectory remains sensitive to negative growth surprises.

The fiscal stance is appropriate in the current low growth environment and fiscal
overperformance should be firmly avoided. Past fiscal overperformance has largely reflected
gains from exceptional labor market performance that has translated into higher revenues,
particularly from taxes and social security contributions, and lower unemployment-related benefits.
Interest payments on public debt also benefited from Germany’s safe haven status. Looking ahead,
with unemployment rates and employment creation having stabilized, further revenue and
expenditure gains are less likely. Nevertheless, past official budget projections have also reflected
some in-built conservatism. It will be important to avoid continued fiscal overperformance as this
may imply a contractionary fiscal stance. Macroeconomic policy settings now need to be

appropriately supportive of growth in Germany given the substantial downside risks, as flat growth
could eventually translate into higher unemployment and weak longer-term domestic demand. In
practical terms, this would imply that if fiscal overperformance appears definitive, planned
expenditures should be accelerated, especially for public investment and other measures that
enhance the economy’s growth potential, including if necessary through reallocation across
spending categories.
13.
Unless growth strengthens, fiscal policies would need to be recalibrated. As discussed
in the risk section, external shocks could have significant implications for the outlook. Should growth
prospects sour and labor markets be expected to weaken, proactive fiscal policies would be needed.
Automatic stabilizers should as usual be allowed to operate freely. However, a large shock may
necessitate invoking the escape clause under the debt brake rule in order to support domestic
activity and employment. The case for fiscal fine tuning to adjust to smaller growth shocks remains
weak, especially when labor markets continue to remain robust. Germany’s overall strong balance
sheets provide an anchor for the region as a whole (see next section) and fiscal spillovers from
Germany to the rest of the euro area are limited (see Box 2 and Point and Counterpoint). However,
should growth not recover as envisaged, the fiscal stance will need to be reassessed.

Authorities’ Views
14.
The authorities agreed that fiscal overperformance should be avoided but thought it
unlikely. They pointed to the difficulty of correctly estimating the natural rate of unemployment in
the past given the structural changes in the labor market. They suggested that the gains from past
reforms had now largely run their course, as evidenced by the stabilization of unemployment. They
also noted that gains from savings on interest payments were relatively small (around €5 billion (0.2
percent of GDP) in 2012). Looking ahead, they doubted revenues would continue to surprise on the
upside, and expected that expenditures would likely be in line with the budget.
15.
The authorities noted that the debt brake rule allows sufficient flexibility to respond
to large unanticipated shocks to growth. They had demonstrated in the immediate aftermath of
the collapse of Lehman Brothers that they were willing and able to take strong fiscal measures to
support growth. They also agreed that fiscal spillovers to the economies in recession in the euro
area are small. In light of this, they pointed out to measures being undertaken directly by Germany,
for example to support financing for SMEs in other economies. Germany is implementing a plan to
make around €800 million in financing available for SMEs in Spain, which would lower the borrowing
costs for some SMEs, and could extend similar schemes to other economies where viable SMEs face
difficulty in accessing financing.

Banking system soundness has improved but vulnerabilities remain. Banks have
continued to raise capital (Table 6) and the quality of capital has also improved. Funding conditions
also remain favorable for most German banks and the system’s reliance on wholesale funding has
continued to decline. However, the capital

The financial system continues to face several structural challenges:
Earnings are weak. Competition in
the domestic segment is intense, net
interest margins are suffering from
low interest rates and deleveraging,
operating costs have not been
reined in (in some banks related to
extraordinary costs associated with
restructuring efforts), and efficiency
remains low.

ratios. Earnings before tax have been positive for three consecutive years, and the business focus
has been reoriented around domestic customers including corporate clients, central banking
functions for the savings banks, and municipal finance.

19.
Progress has been made in some areas of the financial reform agenda. The restructuring
fund for banks set up in 2011 is fully operational. In addition, a macroprudential policy framework is
now in place with the establishment of the Financial Stability Committee, in line with European
Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) recommendations. Progress has also been made on recommendations in
several areas of the 2011 FSAP Update (see Annex II). Support measures for the financial sector
through SoFFin have been extended through end-2014 to strengthen the restructuring process and
safeguard financial stability.
20.
Further efforts to strengthen cross-border supervision of German banks active
internationally remain a key priority. Germany is home to only one global systemically important
bank (G-SIB), for which international cooperation efforts are deemed critical to ensure global
financial stability. A trilateral college among German, U.S., and U.K. authorities is a good first step, on
which to build further in-depth exchange of information and actionable group-wide supervision.
Germany is also home and host to 21 and 40 supervisory colleges respectively. More broadly,
around 25 German banks and 5 foreign banks operating in Germany are expected to move to ECB
supervision under the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), representing around two-thirds of
banking system assets.
21.
Despite the progress made, the financial regulatory landscape remains unsettled both
domestically and at the euro area level.


A German legislative proposal to separate the risky activities of large banks has been adopted by
Parliament. Discussions at the EU level on the separation of investment and retail banking

activities based on the Liikanen report are also ongoing. Eventually, the two versions will have to
be harmonized to create a level playing field across the euro area, and the implications for the
twelve affected banks’ business models will only become clear at that stage.


The recent draft Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) sets out future rules on how to
restructure and resolve banks, and provides guidance on the rankings of various creditors in the
bail-in regime. The full impact of the new rules on German borrowers remains to be seen, with
the German SME sector possibly affected on both the lending side (through borrowing costs)
and on the deposit side (through the bail-in regime).



Deposit insurance reform, including depositor preference in bank resolution, is another
important area and the BRRD introduced tiered depositor preference which is a major step
forward. The two issues are treated separately in Germany, where the legal frameworks do not
provide for depositor preference, but the merits of insured depositor preference are under
consideration. The various banking associations in Germany that run domestic deposit insurance
schemes have expressed reservations about a centralized euro area scheme.

Staff Views
22.
The overall stability of the German financial system has helped maintain supportive
domestic financial conditions (Figure 4). Germany’s status as a safe haven and favorable funding
conditions for banks have allowed bank lending rates to hover near all-time lows. However, bank
lending remains moderate, and the demand for credit remains weak especially from businesses,
against a backdrop of elevated uncertainty, particularly in Europe.
23.
The introduction of a macroprudential policy framework is welcome but no new
measures are needed at this juncture. There are currently no signs of excessive credit growth,
weakening of lending standards, or excessive asset price increases. While the prices of apartments in
some urban centers have risen more than nationwide trends, mortgage lending remains benign, but
needs to be monitored.
24.
While important progress has been made in implementing several FSAP
recommendations, more progress is needed in some areas. The implementation of measures to
enhance stress testing, strengthen the crisis management framework, reduce state aid support, and
restructure weaker banks is welcome. However, it is also important to step up efforts to improve the
supervision and resolution of cross-border SIBs to reform the fragmented deposit insurance regime,
and to ensure that German legal and regulatory initiatives are carefully meshed with European
proposals.

25.
The banking system needs to continue to make efforts to increase capital and improve
profitability. Bolstering capital through conservative earnings retention and raising capital
whenever possible should remain a priority. Stronger capital ratios would ensure that German banks
are well prepared ahead of the stress tests and the move to SSM. In addition, banks also need to
make efforts to improve their profitability especially through greater efforts at reducing costs,
improving efficiency and streamlining their business model to adapt to the new regulatory and
operating environment.
26.
The surveillance of large cross-border banks needs to be anchored by strong domestic
supervision and close coordination with key financial center supervisory authorities.
Supervisory colleges and crisis management groups are important steps. However, deepening
coordination with non-euro area authorities, particularly with the United States and the United
Kingdom, is essential ahead of the centralization of supervision of cross-border banks by the SSM.
Continuing refinements to raise domestic supervisory standards to the highest possible quality
would benefit not only German financial stability, but also global stability.
27.
Taken together, financial reform momentum needs to be sustained both domestically
and at the euro area level. While difficult to achieve, strong political backing for institutional
reforms remains critical and is in the interest of all EMU members. Swiftly advancing the roadmap
toward a full banking union based on the SSM, SRM and common safety nets, as recommended by
the EU FSAP and euro area staff report (Country Report No. 13/231) is important to reverse
fragmentation. Delaying or diluting the roadmap, including a centralized resolution authority and
common deposit insurance mechanisms and backstops, would preserve an unsatisfactory status quo
and run the risk of destabilizing confidence again.

Authorities’ Views
28.
The authorities agreed that credit conditions are benign and macroprudential
measures are not warranted at this juncture. They underscored that the relatively low credit
growth amid supportive financial conditions reflects low demand for credit—in part owing to
uncertainty—and not any constraints on the supply of credit. They also agreed that overall house
price trends suggest that valuations are still moderate, but need to be carefully monitored.
29.
They highlighted progress made in restructuring weaker banks, including
Landesbanken. The authorities believed their approach in providing wide-ranging Federal backing
and allowing banks to clean-up their balance sheets over a long period of time worked better than
more frontloaded methods used in other European countries. They also viewed the diversity of their
banking sector as a source of stability, with local savings and cooperative banks largely unscathed
by the financial crisis, and universal banks still considered as a desirable model going forward.
30.
The authorities were of the view that progress on both domestic and European
initiatives has been substantial. They contended that most domestic initiatives largely follow
European guidelines, and as such did not expect particular challenges in harmonizing the German

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GERMANY

framework with the European one. The vision of German authorities for the design of the Banking
Union however is not fully aligned with what is being considered at the European level. The
authorities seem particularly reluctant to grant resolution to centralized euro area authorities, which
they argue would require changes to the European Union treaty. The authorities would also have
preferred a more rules-based bail-in framework, with limited flexibility and limited country
discretion.

GERMANY AS AN ANCHOR OF REGIONAL STABILITY
Germany plays an important role in stabilizing the region due to its strong balance sheets
and safe haven status, in part by better absorbing external shocks rather than amplifying
them to key trading partners. It could help prevent excessive imbalances by facilitating
more investment through structural reforms that increase the labor force and increase its
productivity, and facilitate the allocation of resources into new areas outside Germany’s
traditional strengths in manufacturing exports.

Strengthening Germany’s role as a regional anchor of stability
31.
Germany’s trade and financial integration with Europe and the rest of the world has
accelerated. Trade as a share of German GDP has nearly doubled to 90 percent, in part reflecting
higher exports to Emerging Asia and the development of a dynamic supply chain involving the
Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia (the CE4 economies; see FO/DIS/13/100 “The
German-Central European Supply Chain Cluster Report”). As a regional safe haven, financial linkages
are also extensive, driven by a growing volume of capital flows, a reflection of the cross-border
intermediation activities of large German banks.

Staff Views
32.
Against the backdrop of globalization, Germany has become increasingly sensitive to
economic developments in the rest of the world. Greater trade and financial openness has
increased the economy’s exposure to global shocks. When measured in terms of final demand (by
explicitly accounting for domestic value added content of exports), while the European Union is still
Germany’s largest trading partner, exposures to China and the U.S. are larger than what gross trade
statistics suggest. While German growth is likely to have benefited from closer trade ties to these
relatively faster growing regions, Germany has also become more sensitive to global trade
downturns as witnessed by the experience of 2008-09. Germany’s financial system is highly
connected with the rest of the world and remains exposed to developments elsewhere.

Germany also generates outward spillovers through real and financial channels.



A few large German banks are heavily interconnected to other European and international
systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). These internationally active banks continue to
hold large foreign claims, which exposes them to adverse inward spillover risks. Robust home
supervision should aim for a comprehensive mapping of the risks, both on- and off-balance
sheets at home and abroad, to understand the linkages between these SIFIs and other parts of
the domestic and global financial system.



As a reflection of deeper trade integration, intermediate exports across the region have
increased substantially, including between Germany and the CE4. This is important because the
growth of intra-supply chain trade owing to the exchange of intermediate goods implies that
final demand in Germany is not necessarily the main determinant of CE4 exports to Germany.



Fiscal stimulus in Germany has a relatively small impact on the rest of the euro area. Trade links
are weak for smaller trading partners such as Greece and Portugal, and stronger for larger ones
including Italy and Spain, so that the spillovers as a share of the trading partners’ GDP is low in
both cases (see Box 2).



Germany also generates beneficial
medium-term spillovers to the
region. In the context of the
supply chain with the CE4, there is
evidence that income
convergence in these four
countries was higher than
average. Higher growth in these
countries was associated with
technology transfers and financed
by a relatively greater share of FDI
inflows from Germany.

34.
Owing to its strong fundamentals—including sound balance sheets—and its safe
haven status, Germany plays the role of a regional anchor of stability. Although German growth
has lately been too low to offset the contractionary forces in the region, the country has
nevertheless played an important stabilizing role. In particular, balance sheets in Germany are
generally healthy with, for example, low debt-to-GDP ratios in the household, corporate, and
government sectors. This allows Germany to better absorb shocks from other trading partners
instead of transmitting or amplifying them to its supply chain partners. Thus, maintaining strong
balance sheets, preserving financial stability and ensuring that excessive external imbalances do not
accumulate would generate continued beneficial spillovers from Germany for the region.

public and private sector balance sheets have benefited the region. The authorities pointed out
that while the fiscal stance should not be contractionary, the costs outweigh the benefits of fiscal
fine tuning. They underscored that it was important to maintain the strength of household balance
sheets to ensure that easy financing conditions do not lead to future vulnerabilities owing to
mortgage-related lending. More broadly, the authorities welcomed the German-Central European
Supply Chain Cluster Report prepared by staff and agreed with its main conclusions.

Box 2. Fiscal Spillovers1
Fiscal stimulus in Germany is likely to have a relatively
small impact on the rest of the euro area and Germany’s
supply chain partners. Model simulations find that the
maximum impact of a two-year 1 percent of GDP fiscal
stimulus in Germany on the rest of the euro area amounts to
0.2 percentage points.2 Fiscal spillovers from Germany to its
main supply chain countries have increased over the past
decade, but remain small overall. This is explained by the
supply chain nature of trade integration: final demand in
Germany is not the main determinant of CE4 exports to
Germany.3 The domestic impact of fiscal stimulus in Germany,
in contrast, can be large, ranging between 0.7 and 0.9 percent
of GDP on average over two years. Hence, fiscal policy can be
an effective tool in addressing domestic growth shortfalls.
Fiscal spillovers are larger for relatively small and open
neighboring countries. Countries in close proximity with
relatively strong trade links to Germany, such as the Czech
Republic, Austria, the Netherlands and Belgium would benefit
most from a German fiscal stimulus. Countries in the euro
area periphery would receive relatively small spillovers,
reflecting weak trade links for the smaller economies (Greece,
Portugal) and the large size of countries with stronger trade
ties to Germany (such as Italy and Spain). Moreover, fiscal
spillover estimates for some countries are likely to be
overestimated due to the prevalence of trade in intermediate
goods that conventional trade statistics do not capture,
implying greater reliance on demand outside of Europe.

The sectoral composition of the current account has changed in recent years. The
corporate sector contributed strongly to the increase in the current account surplus during 2000-10,
as the rise in corporate savings exceeded investment. Over the past two years, however, corporate
savings have declined in line with reduced profitability although their cash buffers remain
substantial.

external assessment methodologies).
39.
The rebalancing of domestic sources of growth is expected to gain momentum as the
decline in investment bottoms out and associated imports pick up. Over the medium term, staff
sees an additional reduction in the current account balance by about 2-3 percent of GDP over and
above the natural rebalancing process as appropriate and could be linked to growth-enhancing
structural reforms in non-traded sectors. Reflecting a strong labor market, it would not be
inappropriate for real wages to rise, and therefore help improve the labor share of national income.
This would help spur domestic demand, and make the economy less vulnerable to external shocks,
while not endangering Germany’s competitiveness. In addition, policy levers such as making the tax
structure more growth-friendly within the fiscal envelope and reforming the financial sector could
be beneficial in rebalancing the sources of the growth.

Authorities’ Views
40.
The authorities welcomed staff initiatives such as the External Balance Assessment to
better understand German external balances but urged caution in interpreting results. They
broadly agreed that the current account surplus was on the high side and agreed that an investment
rebound and higher growth potential would facilitate a more durable rebalancing of the economy.
With the robust growth in wages and consumption amid the favorable labor market conditions, they
contended that rebalancing is underway.
41.
The authorities also noted that uncovering a reliable statistical relationship explaining
German current account dynamics is proving to be difficult. They explained that, similar to staff

analysis (including the EBA/ESR), they could not associate the German current account balances with
any identifiable policy distortions. Therefore, the authorities emphasized that especially because the
EBA/ESR are still work in progress, any econometric residuals from the analysis should not be
characterized as unidentified policy distortions as this would be outright misleading and
furthermore does not yield any actionable policy recommendations.

B. Germany and the Euro Area
Background
42.
As the largest economy in Europe, Germany plays an important role in shaping policies
at the regional level. With euro area uncertainty a drag on German growth, policies at the regional
level pushed forward by Germany could have large payoffs in terms of a rebound in domestic
activity. This in turn would also benefit Germany’s closest trading partners, as discussed in the
German-Central European Supply Chain Cluster Report.

Staff Views
43.
Heightened uncertainty can weaken the impact of macroeconomic policies. The
prevailing elevated levels of uncertainty in the euro area could make fiscal (or monetary) policy less
effective because the real option value of inaction is very large, making households and firms less
responsive to policy stimuli.
44.
In addition to financial sector uncertainty, there is still a lack of clarity on the steady
state architecture of EMU, and also ambiguity on policies to revive growth. The policy
challenge in the short run is to restore growth, employment, and address other crisis-related issues,
and for the medium term, it is more important than ever to provide clarity on the shared vision for
the euro area (see Country Report No. 13/231).

Authorities’ Views
45.
The authorities underscored that substantial progress has been made on euro area
reforms over the past year. They pointed to progress towards the single supervisory mechanism
(SSM) and the imminent adoption of the Bank Resolution and Recovery Directive (BRRD). The
authorities are of the view that progress towards greater integration needs to be built on firm legal
foundations as they involve far-reaching changes to institutional mechanism and a the shift of
responsibilities from national to European institutions. Meaningful reforms to euro area architecture
could thus only be achieved at a deliberate pace. The authorities were clear that a well functioning
EMU is in the best interest of Germany, and that they are fully committed to an integrated and wellfunctioning EMU that serves the interests of all its members.

C. Structural Reforms to Raise and Diversify Growth
Background
46.
Germany’s potential growth at around 1¼ percent is low and highly dependent on
external sources of demand. At the same time, with an aging population, a shrinking labor force
will increasingly act as a drag on potential growth over the longer term. Raising potential growth is
therefore important to maintaining living standards and long-term fiscal sustainability and reducing
the economy’s vulnerability to external demand shocks. In 2012, the inward migration of
369,000 workers into Germany was an important positive development, although this likely reflected
some exceptional factors such as the deep recession in some other EMU member countries and this
volume is unlikely to be maintained.

Staff Views
47.
Raising potential growth and diversifying its sources requires additional labor marketrelated and structural reform efforts. Progress is needed on two broad fronts: (a) addressing the
decline in the working-age population and (b) raising productivity outside of Germany’s
manufacturing exports sector.
48.
In recent years, Germany has implemented some reforms to offset the shrinking of the
labor force:
To increase labor force participation rates of secondary earners and low-income workers, the
contribution rate for statutory pension insurance was reduced and the personal basic tax-free
allowance for income tax and the monthly pay threshold for mini-jobs were increased in 2013.
Joint income taxation reform was introduced in 2009 which addresses some of the disincentives
for second earners. However, the tax wedge for workers earning 50 percent and 67 percent of
the average wage is still among the highest in the EU, and secondary earners still face significant
fiscal disincentives due to the joint taxation of income for married couples and the free health
insurance coverage for non-working spouses.



To facilitate immigration, a law to enhance the recognition of professional qualifications
obtained abroad came to force in 2012. The new EU Blue Card makes procedures simpler for the
immigration of skilled workers from outside the European Union. Recent changes have also
made it easier for international students to remain in Germany and work. In addition, training
programs have been expanded to help increase the supply of skilled workers.



Day care services are being expanded through several programs at the federal, Laender, and
municipal levels, to provide needs-based day care for children under three, with a view to
facilitating the participation of women in the labor force. The federal government is also
providing support to the Laender towards raising the standards of services provided and
maintaining high quality child care in the long term.



Early retirement opportunities have also been restricted and the statutory retirement age is
being raised to 67 from 65.

49.

Looking ahead, reform efforts in this area should focus on:



Removing remaining disincentives to increase labor force participation.



Continued efforts to support inward immigration of both high- and medium-skilled workers. In
addition to the successful programs for immigration of skilled workers, pathways for attracting
medium-skilled workers are needed. Standardizing applications, and continued efforts to
provide information especially to small- and medium-sized employers would help reap further
benefits.



Increasing the availability of full-time high-quality childcare and reviewing family policies with a
view to identifying and addressing more efficiently disincentives to having children.

50.
Raising productivity as well as measures to support investment outside of the
manufacturing exports sector will also be necessary to raise potential growth. In this regard,
recent efforts to increase spending on education and research are welcome. Further efforts to
strengthen the human capital of workers especially in areas outside of manufacturing would be
helpful. In addition, the following reforms would help raise the economy’s growth potential:


Reforms need to be sustained to increase competition and productivity in the services and
infrastructure sector, including accelerating the integration of pan-European transportation and
energy networks and increasing competition in network industries;



Broadening the channels of financial intermediation would facilitate the allocation of resources
to new areas of growth;



While the government programs for high-risk start-ups at an early stage of development have
proven to be successful, access to risk capital for firms at a more advanced stage of
development and marketing remains limited;

28

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GERMANY



A framework, including tax provisions and regulation of institutional investors, that encourages a
larger investor base for risk capital with appropriate financial stability safeguards would help
stimulate innovation and broaden development of new growth engines.

51.
Ensuring the long-term sustainability of public finances in the face of demographic
pressures will be an important priority. In addition to the measures identified above to address
the demographic challenge, the efficiency of public spending will need to be improved. This could
include introducing spending reviews to support top down budgeting and medium-term budget
strategy reports as well as examining healthcare spending for potential cost savings.

Authorities’ Views
52.
The authorities shared staff’s view that demographic challenges pose a threat to
longer-term potential growth. They agreed on the need for continued structural reforms to raise
potential growth and productivity. In this context, they noted the recent reforms in immigration and
the recent upturn in inward migration. They agreed that the unusually high rate of inward migration
is unlikely to be sustained but efforts will be sustained. They also underscored the need for creating
pathways for medium-skilled workers in the SME sector. In addition, the authorities also agreed with
the importance of more effective and efficient family policies to reverse long-term unfavorable
demographic trends. In this context, the authorities are undertaking a review of family policy to align
family and work-life balance with a view to increase fertility rates and female labor force
participation. Finally, the authorities noted that risk capital funding is an area of focus with several
programs already in place to provide seed capital to new innovative firms. They were also in broad
agreement with staff on the need to improve venture capital financing and the facilitation of exit
and restructuring for companies.

POINT AND COUNTERPOINT
While the staff’s conclusions articulated in the previous sections reflect extensive
discussions not just with official counterparts but also with private sector and think-tank
representatives and Fund staff, they can be debated. Three aspects of the staff’s views are
scrutinized below, with a view to providing the reader a better sense of the arguments
and counterarguments.
53.
With uncertainty as measured by financial market indicators such as the VIX and VDAX
at multi-year lows, how can staff argue that uncertainty is high?
Argument: Historically, the VIX and VDAX indices have risen sharply during recessions or episodes
of acute financial distress when economic and financial prospects were uncertain (for example,
during the global financial crisis of 2008-09).1 Moreover, both indices are widely used measures of
1

respectively.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

29

GERMANY

financial uncertainty and are informally known as “financial fear” indices. Therefore the fact that
these indices are hovering around multi-year lows seems to challenge the notion that uncertainty is
elevated.
The Counterargument: The VIX and VDAX are dependent on financial market conditions, and both
indicators are still below their historical averages primarily because of the unprecedented
abundance of global liquidity amid historically low interest rates and the unconventional monetary
policies implemented by major central banks (albeit prospects for exit from these policies have
recently led to elevated financial market
turbulence). Moreover, while these

additional corroborating evidence on
uncertainty in Germany.
54.
Is the diagnosis that euro area uncertainty is restraining German investment correct,
given that the investment decline is highly correlated with German exports to the rest of the
euro area?
Argument: Germany is a very open economy with an exports-to-GDP ratio of more than 50 percent,
and with extensive trade linkages with Europe. Therefore, rather than uncertainty, it is the
pronounced decline in exports to the euro area that has adversely impacted German investment—
which has a sizeable import content—via the trade channel.
The Counterargument: Germany is a highly open economy, but while exports to the euro area have
declined, exports to countries outside of the euro area—comprising around 60 percent of total
exports—have held steady or have been on an uptrend. Furthermore, when the trade of
intermediate goods is taken fully into consideration, export linkages to the euro area are even lower,
implying that an even greater share of final demand for German exports lies outside of Europe. In
any event, the correlation of business investment with exports to the euro area need not imply
causality, as these could both be driven lower by a common factor—namely uncertainty.
Furthermore, German corporate balance sheets are healthy and awash with cash, financial conditions
are favorable with lending rates near multi-year lows, and banks are willing and able to lend.
Household balance sheets remain sound and are bolstered by a strong labor market and rising

30

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GERMANY

wages, and confidence indicators are stable or rising. With nearly all conditions in place for a
rebound, weak investment suggests that some other factor seem to be at play, which in the staff’s
view is mainly related to uncertainty surrounding prospects and polices for the euro area—more so
than in Germany itself (see also Box 1).2

55.
Should Germany not pursue a larger fiscal stimulus to generate beneficial positive
growth spillovers to the rest of the euro area?
Argument: Given the significant current account surplus, the fact that around 70 percent of imports
come from Europe, the relatively lower stock of public debt, and the fact that euro area GDP has
contracted for six consecutive quarters, it follows that an expeditious German fiscal stimulus could
effectively boost aggregate demand in the region.
The Counterargument: While Germany has a significant current account surplus, its sovereign debt
is not low at 82 percent of GDP in 2012, although it is still lower than many other regional peers.
More critically, however, along with the fact that German imports from the euro area are only about
38 percent of total, trade linkages with countries in the region that could benefit the most from a
German fiscal stimulus are small, and therefore imply limited growth spillovers (see Box 2 for a
review of estimates using alternative approaches). In addition, as highlighted in the staff’s GermanCentral European Supply Chain Cluster Report, Germany’s strong balance sheets provide a buffer
against shocks from outside Europe to the country’s trading partners, including those in Central and
Eastern Europe. As a result, strong German balance sheets are important for the resilience and
stability of the region.

STAFF APPRAISAL
56.
Economic activity in Germany is expected to be weak in 2013. Domestic fundamentals
continue to remain strong, and past reforms have paid off as seen in low unemployment. Wage
increases over the past few years, which reflect the strength in labor markets, have interacted with
strong household balance sheets to help ensure robust consumption growth. In contrast, despite
strong corporate balance sheets and supportive financing conditions, corporate business investment
has been declining since late 2011. Uncertainty surrounding prospects and policies for the euro
area—more so than in Germany itself—has been associated with declining German exports to the
region as well as a sharp pull back in overall business investment. As a result, the German economy
is projected to expand at around 0.3 percent in 2013. A gradual pick-up in activity projected towards
the end of the year is conditional on a further and tangible reduction in this uncertainty and a
materialization of the expected gradual recovery in the rest of the euro area.
57.
Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. Should the alleviation of euro area
uncertainty and an expected gradual recovery in the region fail to materialize, growth in Germany
2

Analysis in the Bank of England’s Quarterly Bulletin (2013 Q2) also suggests that uncertainty regarding the euro area is holding
back economic activity in the U.K.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

31

GERMANY

can be expected to remain below its potential for longer, leading to a widening of the output gap
which would eventually result in slack in the labor market. Another important source of risk is a rise
in financial stress in the region, which could interact with already weak demand and uncertainty, to
amplify the impact on the German economy through both trade and financial channels. These risks
could be further compounded by weaker global growth prospects. A more medium-term risk is that
of an extended period of low growth, which could result in a reduction of the economy’s growth
potential.
58.
In the current low-growth environment, the modest loosening of the fiscal stance this
year is appropriate. Germany has already achieved the deficit goals at the federal level under the
national debt brake rule (Schuldenbremse) well ahead of schedule and the general government
balance is in line with commitments under the Fiscal Compact of the Economic and Monetary Union
(EMU). For 2013, a mildly expansionary fiscal stance is projected which is appropriate given the risks
to the outlook. From 2014 onwards, only modest structural consolidation is projected, which is
broadly consistent with a neutral fiscal stance while ensuring that public debt remains on a firmly
declining path.
59.
Given the weak growth environment and significant risks to the outlook, it will be
important to avoid overperforming on consolidation. Over the past three years, the fiscal
balance has exceeded plans, reflecting in part unusual factors such as the greater-than-expected
strength in labor markets and the low interest rate environment. With the labor market adjustments
expected to have run their course, fiscal overperformance due to these factors is unlikely.
Nevertheless, fiscal overperformance should be firmly avoided as it could imply a contractionary
fiscal stance that is unwarranted in the current low growth environment. Furthermore, unless growth
strengthens as envisioned, fiscal policies would need to be recalibrated.
60.
The soundness of the banking system has improved, but vulnerabilities remain. The
level and quality of capital across the banking system has continued to improve, funding conditions
remain favorable for most German banks, and the system’s reliance on wholesale funding is
declining. Overall asset quality has remained broadly stable, although there are vulnerabilities
related to exposures to specific sectors such as shipping, international commercial real estate, and
certain foreign asset holdings. Despite financial stability improvements, credit growth remains
moderate, owing to weak credit demand stemming from uncertain prospects for the euro area, and
a still unsettled regulatory landscape. The macroprudential framework that has been put in place is a
timely evolution of the financial system, but there is no need to tighten policies at this juncture.
61.
The financial reform momentum should be sustained both domestically and at the
regional level. At the domestic level, further augmenting capital buffers, improving profitability and
efficiency, and adjusting business models ahead of new international and European regulatory
requirements would help consolidate financial strength. The surveillance of large cross-border banks
needs to be firmly anchored by strong domestic supervision and close coordination with key
financial centers' supervisory authorities. A clear, harmonized, and coherent roadmap towards
achieving domestic and European initiatives, including steps towards reversing the fragmentation of

banking systems across Europe and creating an integrated pan-European banking system, would
help alleviate a major question mark over the European financial system.
62.
Germany’s strong fundamentals provide an anchor of stability to the region. Germany’s
safe haven status and strong balance sheets provide a buffer against external shocks for the region.
Germany also plays a pivotal role in the development of policies and the evolving architecture of the
EMU. Given the important role of euro area uncertainty and external demand for German growth,
Germany’s continued leadership towards further integration within the EMU is welcome. Germany
can also play an important role in clearly articulating the longer-term shared vision for closer
economic and financial integration among EMU member countries, which would provide a crucial
anchor to the expectations of households, firms, and the financial system.
63.
Efforts to support the economy’s growth potential need to be sustained. In the context
of an aging population, recent efforts to augment the labor force through tax measures, the
expansion of day care services, training programs, and encouraging the migration of high-skilled
workers are welcome. Looking ahead, lowering the tax burden for low wage and secondary earners,
increasing availability of full-time high-quality childcare, facilitating migration of medium-skilled
workers, as well as identifying and addressing disincentives to having children could hold promise.
Further efforts to accelerate the pan-European integration and harmonization of energy and
transportation networks would also help raise productivity and growth. Additional reforms to
improve the productivity of the services sector remain important. Finally, broadening the sources of
financial intermediation beyond bank-based channels could promote investment and create new
drivers of growth beyond the manufacturing sector.
64.
Ensuring the long-term sustainability of public finances in the face of rising
demographic pressures requires a multi-pronged strategy. In addition to immigration and family
policies, the strategy requires efforts to improve the efficiency of public spending, including on
healthcare. Reforms to improve efficiency could include the introduction of elements such as
spending reviews to support top down budgeting as well as medium-term budget strategy reports.

Germany: Risk Assessment Matrix
Source of Risks
Risks to the economic outlook
I. Slowdown of external demand (including
because of a deeper than expected slowdown in
emerging economies). Given its high degree of
trade openness, Germany is highly susceptible
to a slowdown in global growth.
II. Re-emergence of financial stress in euro
area (which could be related to stalled or
incomplete delivery of euro area policy
commitments). Shocks from the euro area could
be transmitted via trade and financial channels,
resulting in lower growth. The interaction
between weaker growth and elevated financial
stress could be mutually reinforcing, and be
further compounded by waning confidence or
heightened policy uncertainty.
III. Global oil price shock. Geopolitical risks
could lead to a sharp increase in oil prices
($140/barrel), which could also dampen global
growth prospects.
Medium-term risks
IV. Slowdown of potential growth (which
could be related to a protracted period of
slower European growth). Strategies to
counteract demographic pressures and increase
productivity and investment may fail to deliver
results. Large shocks could also have hysteresistype lasting effects on growth.
Risks to the financial sector
V. Domestic financial instability (which could
be related to incomplete regulatory reforms or
inconsistent approaches). A loss of confidence
by depositors and creditors, which by inducing a
disorderly deleveraging process, could
disproportionately weaken growth, but also
trigger contagion more widely.

Reduce vulnerabilities of the financial sector,

financial restructuring efforts.

If the output gap widens significantly,
depending on the size and nature of the
shock to the economy, invoking the escape
clause under the fiscal rule could be
appropriate to support German growth.

The need for monetary tightening would
need to be assessed in relation to risks of
second-round effects.

Note: The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to
materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relatively likelihoods of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks
surrounding the baseline (with L, M, H, denote low, medium, and high, respectively). The RAM reflects staff views on the sources of
risk and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities.

Recommendations
IMF 2012 Article IV
Recommendations

Authorities’ Response
Fiscal Policy

Allow automatic stabilizers to
operate fully and deploy more active
fiscal policies in the event of serious
economic downturn
Step up the pace of implementation
of the 2011 Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP),
including:

The 2012 fiscal outturn was better than projected, largely due to favorable
macro-economic developments.

Financial Sector Policy
Further progress on the implementation of FSAP recommendations has
been made, but more progress is needed in some areas (see Annex II for
details).



Reduction in outstanding public
capital support to some banks;
reduction in the size of the
balance sheet of the two winding
up institutions

SoFFin guarantees and capital injections have been reduced, the two
winding up institutions are gradually deleveraging, and exit from
government support is underway for some institutions, while being
planned for others.



Restructuring of the
Landesbanken and reform of
their business models

Progress has been made on the restructuring of Landesbanken but further
efforts are needed.



Strengthening of the crisis
management framework

Progress on establishing recovery and resolution plans has been made but
there is little momentum in reforming the fragmented deposit insurance
regime.

Ensure that risks from the global
activities of large banks are
understood and internalized

Continue to take measures to raise
potential growth and diversify its
sources. Broaden the access to risk
capital, including through the
development of more arms-length
financial intermediation

Capital buffers of large banks have been strengthened but further efforts
are needed to strengthen supervision of cross-border SIFIs. German
initiatives on the financial sector have to be meshed with European
proposals.

Structural Reforms
Steps to increase labor force through higher participation and migration
of skilled workers as well as those directed at strengthening competition
in network industries, financing research and development and providing
risk capital, have been taken. Further efforts are needed on all these
fronts.

efforts is key to ensuring the viability of business
models.
There are no plans to loosen regional constraints

(a) Establish viable business models for the
Landesbanken;
(b) Loosen the regional constraints under which
local banks operate;
(c) Open up the public banks to private
participation; and
(d) Strengthen these banks' governance to

Exchange Rate Arrangement
Germany’s currency is the euro, which floats freely and independently against other currencies.
Germany is an Article VIII member and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on
payments and transfers for current international transactions. It maintains measures adopted for
security reasons, which have been notified to the Fund for approval in accordance with the
procedures of Decision 144 and does so solely for the preservation of national or international
security.
Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT)
The Fund assessed Germany against the AML/CFT in 2009. The detailed assessment report was
adopted by the FATF in 2010. The assessors found that, while generally comprehensive,
Germany’s AML/CFT framework was not fully in line with the standard. Shortcomings were
identified with respect to, inter alia, the money laundering and terrorist financing offenses, and
AML/CFT preventive measures (including the reporting of suspicious transaction requirements,
and customer due diligence requirements). In the 2012 and 2013 follow-up reports to the FATF,
the authorities indicated having taken a number of legislative and structural measures during the
three years that followed the assessment to address many of the deficiencies identified. They
mentioned in particular having broadened the scope of the money laundering offense (by
including additional predicate offenses), strengthened the reporting of suspicious transaction
requirements, enhanced the identification of beneficial owner requirements, and strengthened
sanctions for noncompliance with AML/CFT preventive measures. Remaining deficiencies to be
addressed notably include the criminalization of self-laundering and shortcomings in the
freezing of terrorist assets.”

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance.
National accounts
Germany adopted the European System of Integrated Economic Accounts 1995 (ESA95) in 1999. The 2005
ROSC Data Module mission found that the macroeconomic statistics generally follow internationally
accepted standards and guidelines on concepts and definitions, scope, classification and sectorization, and
basis for recording. However, the sources for estimating value added for a few categories of service
industries could be improved. A direct source for quarterly changes in inventories, which is an important
indicator of changes in GDP over the business cycle, is lacking. There is no systematic, proactive process to
monitor the ongoing representativeness of the samples of local units and products between rebases of the
producer price index.
Government Accounts
Comprehensive data reporting systems support the accuracy and reliability of the government finance and
balance of payments statistics. However, documentation exists to explain the differences between the
general government data in the ESA95 classification and the general cash data on an administrative basis;
Germany publishes—through Eurostat—general government revenue, expenditure, and balances on an
accrual basis on a quarterly basis (ESA95) and submits annual data for publication in the Government
Financial Statistics Yearbook, in GFSM 2001 format. Monthly data are only disseminated on a cash-basis.

Balance of Payments Accounts
The Bundesbank compiles the balance of payments in close cooperation with the Federal Statistical Office.
Balance of payments is compiled according to the Balance of Payments Manual, fifth edition (BPM5) and the
legal requirements of the ECB and Eurostat.
Financial Soundness Indicators
Germany is participating in the Coordinated Compilation Exercise for financial soundness indicators (FSIs). In
2006, as part of this exercise, the German authorities compiled a comprehensive set of FSI data and
metadata. There are, however, substantial lags in the publication of some of the financial soundness
indicators such as nonperforming loans. In addition, the quality of data on bank exposures submitted to the
BIS needs to be improved, including provision of the data on ultimate risk basis for advanced countries.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
August 6, 2013

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with
Germany
On August 1, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Germany. 1
Germany’s economic rebound of 2010-2011 gave way to weakening momentum during the
course of 2012. While exports to non-European trading partners began to recover by mid-2012,
in line with improved prospects in the United States and emerging economies, exports to the rest
of the euro area continued to decline as the recession in the region continued. Consumption
grew robustly as German unemployment remained near post-reunification lows and wages rose
well above inflation. Business investment however continued to closely track the decline in
exports to the euro area, leading to a contraction in activity in the last quarter of 2012, before
stabilizing in the first quarter of this year.
The outlook for the remainder of 2013 and next year is heavily dependent on a gradual recovery
in the rest of the euro area and a sustained reduction in uncertainty. Consumption is expected to
continue to expand robustly this year given favorable labor market conditions and wage
agreements. Exports to the euro area are expected to recover only gradually. Uncertainty is
expected to continue to have an amplifying impact on investment through the end of the year
and assumed to diminish subsequently. Growth for 2013 as a whole is thus projected at around
0.3 percent, reflecting still below potential growth in the second half of the year. Growth in 2014
is projected to return to potential.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director,
as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
This baseline outlook is subject to a number of interrelated and mutually reinforcing downside
risks. Given its high degree of trade openness, Germany is highly susceptible to a slowdown in
external demand and/or elevated financial stress. At the regional level, euro area shocks could
be transmitted via trade and financial channels. At the same time, the interaction between
weaker economic activity and elevated financial stress in the euro area could be mutually
reinforcing, owing to already strained balance sheets in a number of countries, and be further
exacerbated by waning confidence or heightened uncertainty. A significantly weaker German
outlook would in turn affect both regional and global growth prospects, primarily through the
trade channel. Policy uncertainty regarding the roadmap and key elements of reforms to the euro
area architecture, prospects for a recovery of activity in the euro area, and the still unsettled
regulatory and supervisory landscape for the financial system, represent another factor which
could magnify the effects of the intertwined shocks discussed above. In terms of risks of a more
medium-term nature, an extended period of low growth could lead to hysteresis-type effects by
lowering potential growth. Risks to domestic financial stability may surface owing to, for
example, a shock to confidence by depositors and creditors in systemically important
institutions, which by increasing risk aversion, could disproportionately suppress economic
activity and trigger contagion more broadly.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the German authorities for prudent economic management,
preserving strong domestic fundamentals, healthy balance sheets, and financial system
soundness. Directors noted that these positive developments have provided an important anchor
of regional stability. Meanwhile, uncertainty surrounding policies and prospects for the euro
area is weighing on business investment and exports to the region. Directors stressed that policy
priorities in the near term should aim at reducing this uncertainty to rebuild confidence and
managing downside risks to the outlook. They also emphasized that, given the size of
Germany’s economy and its large external imbalances, stronger and more balanced growth in
Germany is critical to a lasting recovery in the euro area and global rebalancing.
Directors commended the authorities for achieving national and supra-national fiscal targets.
They welcomed the modest loosening of fiscal policy to help generate growth in domestic
demand. Most Directors supported the current policy stance for this year, although some saw
scope for a more proactive stimulus, given the significant risks to the outlook. Going forward,
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to avoid over-performance on fiscal consolidation,
and encouraged a recalibration of policy should growth fall short of expectations. Ensuring
fiscal sustainability remains a long-term objective in light of demographic pressures.
Directors welcomed the improved soundness of the banking system, the introduction of a
macroprudential framework, and progress in implementing the recommendations of the
Financial Sector Assessment Program Update. They encouraged the authorities to build on these
achievements and remain vigilant to vulnerabilities, including those related to a still unsettled
regulatory landscape and the dependence on wholesale funding by some large banks. Key

3
priorities are further improving capital buffers, profitability, and efficiency of the financial
system, and facilitating the adjustment of business models ahead of new international and
European regulatory requirements. Directors also urged continued efforts to strengthen the
surveillance of large cross-border banks and enhance coordination with supervisory authorities
in key financial centers.
Directors saw an important role for Germany in facilitating the advancement of the financial
reform agenda at the regional level. In this context, they pointed to the merits of further aligning
national legal and regulatory initiatives with European proposals, and of reducing the
fragmentation of deposit insurance mechanisms and banking systems more broadly. Directors
looked forward to German leadership in articulating a clear, coherent roadmap toward achieving
European financial sector initiatives.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ continued commitment to help forge a robust architecture
for the economic and monetary union (EMU). They stressed that a clearly-communicated
longer-term vision for closer economic and financial integration among EMU member countries
would provide a crucial anchor to the expectations of households, firms, and the financial
system.
Directors emphasized the need to sustain reform momentum to raise the economy’s growth
potential and promote a more balanced economy, which will contribute to a further reduction in
external imbalances. They welcomed recent initiatives to increase labor force participation, and
encouraged steps to raise real wages by lowering the tax burden. Additional efforts are also
essential to accelerate the pan-European integration and harmonization of energy and
transportation networks, improve the productivity of the services sector, and broaden the sources
of financial intermediation.

Statement by Steffen Meyer, Alternate Executive Director for Germany
August 1, 2013
I would like to convey my authorities’ gratitude for productive and insightful discussions
during this year’s Article IV consultation. Staff’s efforts to reach out to a broad range of
stakeholders like think tanks, SMEs, and the financial sector are very welcome and
resulted in a balanced and comprehensive assessment of the German economy. My
authorities also welcome the innovative approach of presentation staff has chosen in the
report as for example the section on “point and counterpoint” and the Risk Flow Chart
that more clearly expresses the intertwined relationship of potential risks than the
traditional Risk Assessment Matrix.
My authorities agree to the main thrust of the staff appraisal. I would like to highlight
Germany’s strong fundamentals, healthy balance sheets, appropriate fiscal position,
solid private consumption, and its positive role as anchor of stability in the region. At the
same time, my authorities recognize that they also have homework to do: uncertainty
needs to be reduced and investment strengthened, and potential growth should be
raised by appropriate structural reforms and demographic challenges have to be dealt
with.
Recent developments and outlook
The German economy remains highly competitive and economic growth remains overall
robust. Against the background of substantial trade linkages, my authorities are aware
that favourable global economic developments and steady growth in Europe are very
important for a positive economic outlook for Germany.
At the same time, the domestic resilience of the German economy has substantially
improved. Employment in Germany has been increasing steadily over the past few
years accompanied by wage growth roughly in line with productivity growth resulting in
robust private consumption as the main driver of economic growth.
In 2012, Germany registered a growth rate of 0.7 percent. However, the dynamics
declined steadily over the course of the year. Causes for the weak performance at the
end of 2012 were lingering uncertainties resulting from a tangible slowdown in the world
economy, financial market tensions and the situation in the Euro Area dampening the
propensity of German firms to invest.
However, my authorities expect the German economy to expand again in 2013 and
growth will gain strength over the course of the year. After a weak first quarter – which
was mainly weather-related – my authorities expect the economy to start catching up
and growth is projected to reach 0.5 percent for the whole year, slightly better than
projected by staff. For 2014, the outlook is clearly positive. Against the background of

GERMANY

strong fundamentals – favourable cash flow situation of the private sector, low interest
rates, and increased domestic demand – my authorities project a growth rate of
1.6 percent.
Economic activity will mainly be driven by domestic demand contributing 0.7 percentage
points and 1.5 percentage points to GDP growth in 2013 and 2014 respectively. In view
of the positive development of disposable income of private households and moderate
inflation, a leading role will be played by consumer spending and private-sector
investment in housing. Furthermore, once the uncertainty among investors dissipates,
companies are likely to set aside their reluctance and start to realise deferred
investments. Net contribution to growth from exports will be weaker than in previous
years: slightly negative in 2013; slightly positive in 2014.
Germany, External Stability, and the Euro Area
Staff’s balanced analysis of Germany’s current account in the staff report and the 2013
Pilot External Sector Report is welcome. The analysis shows that rebalancing is on its
way. As staff rightly points out, the current account surplus with the Euro Area has been
steadily declining since 2007. The overall trend might gain even more momentum as
investment in Germany picks up and consumption holds up robustly. As stated in earlier
Article IV discussions, I would like to highlight that the German current account surplus
is not the result of targeted policy measures but the outcome of complex market
processes and high (especially non-price) competitiveness of German enterprises. In
addition, as staff highlights in both the staff report and the 2013 Pilot External Sector
Report, policy gaps and the need for fiscal consolidation elsewhere play an important
role.
My authorities’ view coincides with staff’s analysis that a fiscal stimulus in Germany to
support demand in other European countries would not be advisable. As discussed in
the German-Central European Supply Chain-Cluster Report and in the staff report, fiscal
spillovers from Germany to the rest of the Euro Area are limited whereas healthy
balance sheets serve as a buffer against shocks and generate positive spillovers that
extend well beyond Germany.
My authorities agree with staff that the German economy plays an important role as an
anchor of regional stability. This puts a premium on prudent policies to safeguard
Germany’s sound balance sheets and ensure relatively low debt to GDP ratios in the
household, corporate and government sectors. My authorities are therefore committed
to ensuring that the newly introduced and enhanced European procedures for economic
and budgetary monitoring are implemented rigorously. There must be no relaxation in
the efforts to reform – this also applies to Germany. Moreover, my authorities are fully
committed to an integrated and well-functioning EU and Euro Area that serves the
interest of all member states. A strengthened European integration is crucial to the long2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GERMANY

run prosperity of Germany with its very open economy. Against this background,
Germany fully subscribes that changes to the EMU architecture are necessary to create
a stronger and more sustainable and resilient monetary union. I would like to emphasize
that substantial progress has already been achieved in this regard.
This progress is also important in the shorter term to reduce uncertainty and thereby
catalyze held-up investment in Germany. My authorities remain somewhat more
optimistic than staff that uncertainty will recede against the background of strong
European policy commitment to reforms and the measures already taken by other Euro
Area member states and measures adopted at the regional level.
Reviving Growth
Germany’s role as an anchor of regional stability has to be kept in mind when discussing
policies to reinvigorate growth. Prudent macroeconomic and macroprudential policies as
well as structural reforms play an important role in reinvigorating strong, sustainable,
and balanced growth and firmly anchoring expectations of market participants. This will
also contribute to further reduce uncertainty about economic prospects so as to trigger
investment that has been postponed so far.
Fiscal Policy
In 2012, Germany’s general government balance posted a small surplus. The balance is
projected to stay close-to-balance or in surplus in the coming years.
My authorities broadly concur with staff’s fiscal policy analysis. They remain committed
to letting automatic stabilizers operate freely. Above that, the fiscal stance in 2013 will
even be mildly expansionary given a considerable reduction in taxes, social insurance
contributions and fees totalling nearly € 8 billion for companies and private citizens.
While my authorities also agree that fiscal overperformance should be avoided, the
recent better than expected outcome in Germany largely reflects reform dividends
without exercising a dampening impact on economic activity.
The German economy is expected to grow above economic potential next year with a
high level of employment, rising disposable income, and low interest rates. Against this
background, my authorities agree with staff that there is no macroeconomic reason for
proactive fiscal policies to support growth. A discussion about exceptional measures
could even be counterproductive at this point in time, as it could undermine strong
consumer confidence in Germany. During the crisis, the German authorities
demonstrated that they can react quickly to exceptional circumstances.
I would also like to emphasize that the debt-to-GDP ratio in Germany is still high and
demographic pressures are looming. Therefore, it is important that fiscal policy also
focuses on the medium term. It is my authorities’ objective to reduce the debt ratio by
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

maintaining the current targets for the structural fiscal balance in compliance with the
“debt brake” enshrined in the constitution and the commitments at the EU and Euro
Area level. The debt-to-GDP ratio – which rose markedly in particular due to the
stabilisation measures taken in response to the crisis – is forecasted to decline to below
70 percent of GDP by 2017.
Structural Reforms
Structural reforms are indispensable to address the demographic challenges Germany
is facing and to increase potential growth. Against this background, my authorities are
committed to further increasing the overall efficiency of public expenditure and to further
reforms on the labour market, improving infrastructure, a comprehensive energy
strategy, higher and more effective R&D spending, improving the general framework for
competition, and facilitating access to financing for SMEs.
The positive developments on the labour market in recent years resulted not only from
the good economic situation, but in large part from labour market reforms, reliable
labour relations, and prudent wage agreements. It is now important to build on this
success and further improve the functioning of the labour market. My authorities’
comprehensive Skilled Workers Strategy is geared towards averting shortages of skilled
labour and mobilizing individuals through new opportunities. Improving parent’s ability to
combine career and family commitments through promoting a family-friendly working
environment and an expansion of childcare facilities is a central part of this strategy.
Furthermore, education and training are strengthened and the EU Directive on Highly
Qualified Employment was implemented to attract skilled workers from abroad.
My authorities attach great importance to state of the art and well functioning
infrastructure. For this reason, the Infrastructure Acceleration Programme II provides
additional resources for the construction of new or the upgrading of existing federal
transport infrastructure. Furthermore, the revision of the Telecommunications Act
optimises the framework for the expansion and construction of high-speed networks and
creates incentives for investment in new networks. This supplements my authorities’
Broadband Strategy. Further to this, a Strategy for Smart Networks has been developed
in the first half of 2013.
Germany’s energy policy is based on a secure, affordable and environmentally
sustainable energy supply. My authorities launched a fundamental restructuring of
Germany’s energy supply towards renewable energy and higher energy efficiency
(“Energiewende”). In this context, competition in the energy sector is to ensure that all
consumers can benefit from low-cost energy.
Federal Government spending on research and development (R&D) is rising
continuously. The High-Tech Strategy foresees R&D activities in five main areas:
4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GERMANY

climate/energy, health/nutrition, communications, mobility, and security. Also in the
context of the High-Tech Strategy, an innovation policy concept has been drafted with a
view to taking further measures to strengthen Germany’s already high innovative
capacities.
The Federal Government has improved the general framework for competition in
Germany. The revision of the Act against Restraints of Competition (“8. Novelle des
Gesetzes gegen Wettbewerbsbeschränkungen”) has come into effect at the end of
June. It aims at improving conditions of competition, particularly in the areas of merger
control, the abuse of dominant positions, provisions on fines, and procedures governing
violations of anti-trust rules.
By introducing the new Venture Capital Investment Grant, my authorities aim to improve
access to capital for young, innovative companies. It supplements the European Angels
Fund and the High-Tech “Gründerfonds”. The new Mezzanine fund of fund for Germany
has also been set up with the aim of expanding the availability for SMEs of financing
which can substitute for a lack of equity.
Financial sector policies
I welcome staff’s assessment that banking system soundness has improved and that
progress has been made in implementing several FSAP recommendations. With
financing costs being at very low levels in wholesale and retail markets, German banks
are taking advantage of the historically low level of policy rates. In general, banks do not
experience difficulties with funding and loans to the private sector are growing robustly.
Moreover, with regard to the Landesbanken, substantial restructuring measures have
enabled them to develop profitable, sustainable business models.
Furthermore, I am pleased to report that the German Financial Stability Act entered into
force on 1 January 2013. It established a Financial Stability Commission (FSC)
composed of members from the Federal Ministry of Finance, the Federal Financial
Supervisory Authority (BaFin) and the Deutsche Bundesbank. The commission can
issue warnings regarding threats to the stability of the German financial system and
make recommendations to German public institutions that aim at averting those threats.
Moreover, intensity and effectiveness of SIFI supervision has been stepped up in line
with FSB recommendations and proposals. It is my authorities’ view that cross-border
cooperation of microprudential supervision is most efficient if organized alongside the
structure of the most important parts of the supervised group. Within the European
Economic Area (EEA), Capital Requirement Directive (CRD) provisions and European
Banking Authority (EBA) guidelines form a material part of supervisory cross-border
cooperation. Additionally, there are efficient supervisory cooperation arrangements in
place which contributes especially to an enhanced cooperation with supervisory
authorities domiciled outside the EEA.
