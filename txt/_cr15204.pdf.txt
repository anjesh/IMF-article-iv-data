IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation on Euro Area Policies
On July 24, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with the Euro Area.
The recovery is strengthening, driven by rising domestic demand and supported by lower oil
prices, the ECB’s quantitative easing under the expanded asset purchase program, and a weaker
euro. The improving sentiment, rising inflation expectations, and easing credit conditions suggest
that the recovery is likely to continue in the near term. In this context, euro area GDP is expected
to accelerate from 1.5 percent this year to 1.7 percent next year. Headline inflation is expected to
remain close to zero this year and rise to 1.1 percent next year, reflecting a still large output gap.
Risks to growth are now more balanced than in recent years when they were clearly to the
downside. On the upside, low oil prices, quantitative easing, a weaker euro, and rising
confidence could bring larger-than-anticipated benefits. Downside risks include lingering
weakness and low inflation, a potential slowdown in emerging markets, geopolitical tensions,
and financial market volatility, whether from asymmetric monetary policies or contagion from
events in Greece.
But the medium-term outlook is subdued, as a chronic lack of demand, impaired corporate and
bank balance sheets, and weak productivity continue to hold back employment and investment.
Potential growth, estimated to average around only 1 percent over the medium term, is well
below what is needed to reduce unemployment to acceptable levels in many countries. Because
growth prospects are subdued and policy space is limited, the euro area is vulnerable to negative
shocks and prolonged low growth, with negative spillovers.
Addressing the weak medium-term outlook requires a comprehensive policy response. Cleaning
up bank balance sheets would encourage banks to lend and firms to invest, while accelerating

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

structural reforms and strengthening further the economic governance framework would help
secure lasting growth for Europe and create positive spillovers for the global economy.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the strengthening of the recovery in the euro area on the back of
lower oil prices and a weaker euro, supported by strong policy actions, notably by the European
Central Bank. Directors noted, however, that the medium-term outlook remains subdued, held
back by insufficient demand, still high unemployment, impaired balance sheets, and persistent
structural weaknesses.
Directors considered that, while risks to the outlook are more balanced than in recent years, the
euro area remains exposed to vulnerabilities. Although market reaction to the recent reform
package passed in Greece has been broadly positive, further episodes of significant uncertainty
and volatility arising from the situation cannot be ruled out. Directors urged policymakers to use
all the available instruments, if needed, to manage contagion risks that might originate from
Greece. They also highlighted the need to continue enhancing the architecture of the monetary
union and European firewalls.
Directors recommended a concerted, comprehensive approach to bolster domestic demand,
especially in surplus countries, clean up bank balance sheets, accelerate structural reforms to
raise productivity, and strengthen the economic governance framework. They noted the
complementarities among these priorities and the benefits of a more balanced policy mix in
generating growth, employment, and positive external spillovers. These efforts would also
facilitate further external rebalancing within the euro area.
Directors noted that quantitative easing under the expanded asset purchase program has improved
confidence and financial conditions, and raised inflation expectations. They supported full
implementation of the expanded asset purchase program, with flexibility in asset purchases, until
there is a sustained adjustment in inflation consistent with meeting the medium-term price stability
objective, while addressing potential financial stability concerns through macro-prudential policies.
Directors saw room for growth-friendly fiscal measures to lessen the burden on monetary policy and
its potential spillover concerns. They considered that countries with fiscal space and low public debt
should make full use of the flexibility embedded in the Stability and Growth Pact to support
investment and structural reforms. They welcomed efforts underway to swiftly implement the
centralized investment plan, carefully select high-return projects, and remove regulatory barriers. 3

Directors underscored the urgency of repairing bank balance sheets and severing bank-sovereign
links, crucial for credit growth and effective monetary policy transmission. They encouraged
comprehensive action to reduce the high level of non-performing loans, tighten supervision,

improve insolvency regimes, and develop distressed debt markets. Directors stressed the need for
common deposit insurance with an effective fiscal backstop, a well-resourced Single Resolution
Fund, and ease of access to direct bank recapitalization from the European Stability Mechanism.
They looked forward to further advancement toward a complete banking union.
Directors urged further reforms to improve labor markets and productivity, the business climate, and
potential growth. They recommended focusing regional efforts on implementing the Services
Directive, and establishing a single market in transport, energy, and the digital economy. Directors
looked forward to an action plan to deepen the integration of capital markets, aimed at diversifying
funding sources and enhancing cost efficiency.
Directors welcomed proposals for a more effective governance framework, including a consideration
of outcome-based benchmarks for setting priorities in structural reforms. They noted that
independent councils could help enhance monitoring and innovation. Directors also saw scope for
simplifying the fiscal framework, based on a single fiscal anchor and a single operational target.

WITH MEMBER COUNTRIES

KEY ISSUES
Context. The recovery is strengthening, underpinned by lower oil prices and the ECB’s
expanded asset purchase program. But the medium-term outlook remains weak,
weighed down by the legacies of insufficient demand, lagging productivity, and weak
bank and corporate balance sheets.
Policies. A concerted, collective effort is needed to sustain the recovery, avoid
overburdening monetary policy, and lift potential growth over the medium term, which
would have positive spillovers for the rest of the world:
Demand support. Quantitative easing (QE) has boosted confidence and improved
financial conditions. The ECB’s clear communication to stay the course on QE until
inflation is on a sustained adjustment path will help anchor expectations. Countries
should adhere to the SGP, but those with fiscal space should use it to support
investment and structural reforms.
Balance sheet repair. High non-performing loans (NPLs) in some banks are eroding
profitability and discouraging new lending. Complementary policies are needed to
incentivize NPL resolution through strengthened prudential supervision, insolvency
reforms, and development of distressed debt markets. Asset management
companies (AMCs) could help banks to offload NPLs and assist with corporate
restructuring.
Productivity-enhancing structural reforms. Labor and product market reforms
should be combined with faster implementation of the Services Directive, further
improvements of insolvency regimes, and a greater push toward a single market in
capital, transport, energy, and the digital economy. A capital markets union would
help diversify funding sources and reduce reliance on bank lending.
Better economic governance. A more effective and simpler governance framework,
including a move towards “outcome-based” benchmarking, could help advance
structural reforms, while the fiscal framework could be simplified and strengthened.

EURO AREA POLICIES

CONTEXT: CYCLICAL RECOVERY UNDERWAY…
1.
The recovery continues. After weakness through mid-2014, growth picked up late last year
and has continued in 2015, driven by domestic demand (Figure 1 and Table 1). Private consumption
remained robust, reflecting rising employment and real wages, while fixed investment has expanded
moderately. Among the large economies, Germany continues to grow slightly above 1½ percent,
while Spain is rebounding strongly. Italy is emerging from three years of recession, and activity in
France picked up at the beginning of this year.
2.
Very low inflation appears to be bottoming out. After widespread deflation in early 2015,
the rebound in oil prices since March has helped return inflation to positive territory. HICP inflation in
June was 0.2 percent (y/y) with core inflation remaining around 0.8 percent (Figure 2). Inflation is
expected to remain close to zero this year before rising to 1.1 percent in 2016, reflecting the still
large output gap (2¼ percent of GDP).
3.
Cheaper oil, monetary easing, and a weaker euro are expected to support the upturn
in the near term. The nearly 50 percent decline in USD oil prices through early 2015 has lifted
consumer and business spending. European Central Bank (ECB) monetary policy action, including
quantitative easing (QE), has boosted confidence, improved financial conditions, and contributed to a
reduction in financial fragmentation (Figure 8).2 While recent volatility has returned bond yields to
levels of last fall in many countries, equity markets and inflation expectations are up. The euro in June
was around 7 percent weaker in nominal effective terms compared to 2014, and given the lagged
pass-through should boost exports through 2016. And after substantial fiscal adjustment through
2013, the euro area fiscal stance is projected to remain broadly neutral this year and next. Reflecting
these factors, growth is projected to rise modestly to 1.5 and 1.7 percent in 2015–16.3
4.
The external position is strengthening... The current account remained in surplus last year
even as real imports picked up strongly (Figure 3). Overall, the euro area’s external position in 2014
was broadly consistent with the level implied by medium-term fundamentals (Table 2). The REER
depreciation of the euro so far in 2015 has been beneficial given the economic cycle, but the
currency is now moderately weaker than the level consistent with medium-term fundamentals. Along
with accommodative monetary policy, a broader reform agenda that strengthens growth and
inflation would contribute to a gradual strengthening of the real exchange rate over the medium
term.

2

QE here refers to the ECB’s expanded asset purchase program (APP) which adds the purchase of public sector
securities to pre-existing programs to purchase private asset-backed securities and covered bonds.
3

For comparison, the June 2015 Eurosystem (ECB) staff projections foresee growth of 1.5, 1.9, and 2.0 percent for
2015–17 with risks more balanced, but still tilted to the downside. The European Commission’s Spring Forecast (May)
also has growth of 1.5 and 1.9 percent for 2015–16, with risks evenly balanced.

costs. However, the weaker euro is also likely to
exacerbate imbalances in surplus countries without a strengthening of domestic demand. Further
rebalancing within the currency union will ultimately require addressing excess saving and weak
investment in creditor countries, while improving further the competitiveness of debtor countries.
6.
Risks are now more balanced than in recent years when vulnerabilities dominated
(Table 3). On the upside, low oil prices, QE, a weaker euro, and rising confidence could bring largerthan-anticipated benefits. Downside risks include lingering weakness and low inflation, a potential
slowdown in emerging markets, geopolitical tensions, and financial market volatility, whether due to
asymmetric monetary policies or contagion from events in Greece.
7.
Managing potential contagion from evolving developments in Greece will require
timely and effective policy actions. Initial market reaction to the breakdown in talks between
Greece and official creditors was relatively contained, but recent difficulties have raised market
volatility and uncertainty: sovereign spreads have widened among some euro area economies, but
the impact on nominal yields has been smaller as Bund yields fell on safe haven flows; equities,
especially bank shares, have fallen; and the euro has weakened moderately. The spillover impact
compared to a few years ago is lower, reflecting in part the addition of tools such as QE, OMT and
TLTROs. The situation in Greece is fluid, however, and remains a key source of uncertainty. To
manage contagion risks, policy-makers should stand ready to deploy, and if necessary adapt, the full
arsenal of available instruments; the ECB in particular should ensure that banks continue to have
access to ample liquidity and maintain orderly conditions in sovereign debt markets. If financial
conditions tighten significantly, the ECB should consider further loosening monetary policy through
an expansion of its asset purchase program (see below).
8.
Beyond the near term, there should be a concerted effort to accelerate steps to
strengthen the monetary union and European firewalls. Fully severing bank-sovereign links
would require a common deposit insurance scheme with a fiscal backstop, a larger and fully funded
Single Resolution Fund, and easier access to direct bank recapitalization from the ESM. The greater
risk-sharing implied by these measures should be underpinned by a strengthened fiscal and
structural governance framework which could require possible Treaty changes. These reforms are
desirable in any case, but accelerated progress could help bolster market confidence in the face of
recent events.

Likelihood of Risk (high, medium, or low)
High
Weak demand and persistently low inflation from
a failure to fully address crisis legacies and

medium-term growth and accumulation of
financial imbalances.

Medium
Maturing of the cycle, misallocation of
investment, excess corporate leverage and
insufficient progress with reforms leading to
significant medium-term growth slowdown.
Medium
Persistently low prices triggered by supply factors
reversing only gradually, and weaker demand.
Medium
Mounting conflict depresses business confidence

9.
Only tepid growth is expected over the forecast horizon. Despite the cyclical upturn,
growth of only about 1.6 percent is expected over the medium term, with potential growth averaging
around 1 percent. The output gap would close around 2020 with unemployment still near nine percent
and inflation reaching 1.7 percent, somewhat below the ECB’s medium-term price stability objective.
The picture is more disappointing in comparison to the U.S. with the per capita income gap now the

11.
Without more determined collective action, the euro area is vulnerable to shocks and
prolonged stagnation. Staff analysis suggests that in a downside scenario, a demand shock that
lowers investment and raises real interest rates through disinflation could reduce the level of output by
about 2 percent by 2020, threaten public debt sustainability, and worsen euro zone imbalances (Box 1).
With limited policy space, the euro area runs the risk of being mired in a bad equilibrium, with negative
consequences elsewhere. Countries with close trading ties, especially those in central and eastern
Europe, would suffer from weaker external demand and imported disinflation. Other non-euro area
countries and especially those defending pegs to the euro, could face complications from capital
inflows, upward real exchange rate pressure, and negative deposit rates. Without comprehensive
policies to stimulate demand and lift potential growth, the euro area could remain overly reliant on
monetary policy, generating negative external spillovers through lower growth and inflation, and a
weaker euro.6

policy approach, including from greater infrastructure investment.

EURO AREA POLICIES

Box 1. A Downside Scenario of Stagnation in the Euro Area1
Subdued medium-term prospects leave the euro area susceptible to negative shocks. A
modest shock to confidence—for example, from lower expected future growth, or heightened
geopolitical tensions—that lowers private investment could affect households via labor income
and wealth. Expectations of lower inflation at the zero lower bound would keep real interest rates
high. For countries with high public debt, risk premia could rise, amplifying the shock and raising
the risk of a debt-deflation spiral. Policy space would be limited with short-term interest rates at
the zero lower bound and public debt high in countries with large output gaps (Bullard, 2013).
An illustrative downside scenario, assuming lower investment for all euro area countries
and increased risk premia for high debt countries, suggests that euro area output could be
nearly 2 percent lower by 2020. The main channels would be through higher real interest rates
depressing investment and consumption as well as lower inflation and wage growth constraining
adjustment within the euro area. The impact would vary across countries with real interest rates
higher in countries with weaker balance sheets. Fragmentation progress would reverse and public
debt would increase more in high debt countries due to lower fiscal balances and nominal output.
“Bad” internal rebalancing would follow, as current accounts in high debt countries would rise due
to import compression. Lower inflation would worsen external imbalances, by forcing countries
with large output gaps and imbalances to adjust through lower prices and employment.

Spillovers to the global economy would be through weaker imports and higher global risk
premia. The euro area current account would increase by 0.7 percent of GDP, with real imports
contracting by 3 percent. In particular, other EU countries’ exports would fall by 1.2 percent, while
the rest of the world’s exports would decline by 0.6 percent. Although not captured in the model,
negative spillovers could also stem from confidence effects and financial links through higher
global risk aversion. The results of this illustrative scenario highlight the importance of broader
actions now to strengthen the euro area’s resilience and lift potential growth.

Authorities’ Views
12.
The authorities see a stronger cyclical recovery. While sharing staff views on the factors
behind the cyclical upturn, the ECB was more optimistic about the recovery’s strength and saw QE (the
expanded asset purchase program) working via improved credit conditions, greater confidence, higher
inflation expectations, and, indirectly, through the exchange rate. The European Commission (EC) also
saw greater benefits from the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) to promote investment.
The authorities largely shared staff views on the sources of risks with the ECB seeing risks as slightly
tilted to the downside.
13.
The ECB was more upbeat on inflation, expecting it to rise more quickly along with the
closing of the output gap. They noted that the dispersion of inflation had fallen among euro area
countries and that the Phillips curve has steepened in some places, perhaps reflecting reforms in the
crisis-affected countries that could lead to higher inflation as employment recovers. In the near term,
however, these structural changes have rendered the relationship between the output gap and
inflation more uncertain.
14.
The authorities view the exchange rate as close to the value implied by fundamentals
and long-term averages. They saw few signs of misalignment, with the weaker euro reflecting
divergent monetary policies and economic outlooks. The EC considered that the early rebalancing via
import compression among deficit countries had slowed in recent years as these economies recovered.
Exports have played a larger role in rebalancing lately, but a further shift in resources to export sectors
will need to rely on structural reforms to improve flexibility and productivity. In terms of outward
spillovers, the authorities considered low growth and inflation in the euro area as a more serious threat
to other economies than temporary weakness in the euro.
15.
The euro area now has greater capacity to deal with potential risks from Greece. While
acknowledging uncertainty on the potential impact of adverse developments in Greece, the authorities
considered that the toolkit with respect to both monetary policy and crisis management facilities of
euro area countries (e.g., OMT, QE, and the ESM) has been greatly enhanced in recent years and would
help prevent contagion. They agreed that a common deposit guarantee scheme and fiscal backstop for
the banking union would reduce risks further—points emphasized in the Five Presidents’ Report—but
these do not yet command wide support among member states.7
16.
The authorities concurred on the subdued medium-term outlook. Although somewhat
more optimistic on the near-term forecast, the authorities nevertheless agreed with staff on the weak
medium-term outlook, including the likelihood that potential growth could be only around 1 percent,
and noted that demographics are already weighing on potential growth. The ECB highlighted the
possibility that inflation could rise to the price stability objective, but with very high structural
unemployment. For this reason, the ECB and EC placed heavy emphasis on structural reforms to
address low growth, employment, and productivity.

A COLLECTIVE, CONCERTED COMMITMENT TO LASTING
GROWTH
17.
Given the weak medium-term outlook, a stronger collective push is urgently needed to
consolidate the recovery, raise potential growth, and strengthen the union’s resilience. A
concerted commitment should build on four key pillars: continuing demand support, cleaning up bank
balance sheets, accelerating structural reforms, and strengthening the economic governance
framework to incentivize reforms. Action in these areas would be self-reinforcing and strengthen the
monetary union’s resilience to shocks.
18.
A more balanced policy mix would generate a large growth dividend for Europe and
positive spillovers for the global economy. To assess the impact of a comprehensive approach, staff
examined the combined impact of monetary easing with a stronger credit channel, use of fiscal space
and SGP flexibility, and implementation of structural reforms (Box 2). This upside scenario suggests
that combined action could lift growth and inflation rates substantially in 2015 and 2016, close the
output gap much faster, and bring down unemployment more quickly. These results reflect important
policy interactions: a stronger credit channel increasing the effectiveness of monetary policy; QE
limiting crowding out from fiscal expansion, lowering real interest rates, and boosting nominal growth,
which would help address weak balance sheets; and structural reforms boosting productivity and
bringing forward additional investment. While the sizeable near-term growth benefits are largely oneoff, spending now could raise potential growth by reducing hysteresis and deepening capital
investment. Higher growth and inflation in the euro area would also have positive spillovers for the rest
of the world via stronger domestic demand and import growth in the euro area, as well as higher
prices that appreciate the real exchange rate.

EURO AREA POLICIES

Box 2. An Upside Scenario of Demand Support and Comprehensive Reforms
A scenario combining monetary easing, fiscal support under the SGP, and comprehensive structural
reforms would include:



Monetary easing. Current interest rate policy continues through 2020 and QE through September
2016.



Fiscal space within the SGP. For the eurozone, fiscal space available within the SGP could amount to
0.6 percent of euro area GDP. This includes (i) room under countries’ Medium-Term Objectives (MTOs)
(0.3 percent of euro area GDP); (ii) SGP flexiblity that a few qualifying countries could use for structural
reforms (0.2 percent of euro area GDP); (iii) windfalls from lower interest payments due to QE
(0.1 percent of euro area GDP) for one-off investments or structural reforms for a few countries already
meeting their MTOs; and (iv) growth-friendly fiscal rebalancing for countries with limited fiscal space to
lower the labor tax wedge by two percentage points, financed by base-broadening measures.



Centralized investment. An increase in private investment of 0.2 and 0.8 percent of euro area GDP in
2015 and 2016 is assumed, which is equivalent to ⅓ of the targeted amount of European Fund for
Strategic Investments (EFSI) projects.



Clean-up of bank and corporate balance sheets A fully functioning credit channel is simulated as a
decline in corporate borrowing rates, by 80 basis points in Italy, 25 basis points in Germany and France,
and 50 basis points in the rest of the euro area. This would bring the spread between selected and core
countries roughly to pre-crisis levels.



Structural reforms. Gradual implementation of product and labor market-related reforms in the 2014
G20 Comprehensive Growth Strategy could increase total factor productivity (TFP) by about 0.1 percent
in 2015, 0.5 percent in 2017, and 0.9 percent in 2020. The implied TFP changes would differ
substantially among member countries, with France, Italy, and Spain enjoying the largest gains.

The growth dividend of a balanced policy mix can be large. The EUROMOD module of the IMF’s
Flexible System of Global Models (FSGM) points to a substantial growth dividend, particularly from fiscal
policies and the improvement of the credit channel. Real growth for the euro area would increase by
1.3 and 1.4 percentage points to 2.7 and 3.0 percent for 2015 and 2016, and HICP inflation rate in these
two years would rise to 0.6 and 2.1 percent. The output gap would close by the end of 2016, about
four years faster than in the baseline, and unemployment would be 0.8 percentage point lower than in the
baseline by 2016.
A balanced policy mix would also generate positive external spillovers. Stronger growth and inflation
would reduce the current account surplus by 0.4 percent of GDP in 2015 and by 0.9 percent of GDP in
2016. The spillovers to other EU countries are especially large due to trade links, raising their GDP by
0.4 percentage point in 2015 and 0.6 percentage point 2016. Comprehensive policies could also help
external rebalancing within the euro area, since current account balances in creditor countries would
decline more than in external debtor countries. For instance, the current account surplus in Germany would
decline by 1.3 percent of GDP in 2016, much larger than changes in Italy (-0.4 percent of GDP), France
(-0.4 percent of GDP), and other countries with negative external debt positions.

Staying the course on QE is essential to meet the inflation objective. While the trend
decline in inflation expectations has been reversed, they still remain below the historical average and
the ECB’s medium-term price stability objective. Despite early signs of a turnaround in lending,
previous episodes of QE suggest that the impact on credit (and inflation) will take more time, especially
given banks’ weak balance sheets and corporate deleveraging. In light of risks from low inflation, staff
strongly supports the ECB’s intention to implement QE fully until at least September 2016, looking
through temporary periods of volatility. If inflation and inflation expectations fail to pick up as
expected, the ECB should stand ready to extend the program. Continued clear communication of the
Governing Council’s intentions will help mitigate
excessive market volatility and reinforce its

Greater flexibility would enhance the
effectiveness of the asset purchase program. Given
the Eurosystem’s large purchases, the restriction on
sovereign bond purchases below the negative deposit
rate combined with the ECB’s single issuer and
exposure limits have raised concerns about possible
shortages of sovereign bonds and their availability as
collateral. Although there are few signs of scarcity

supranational debt, and relax security issue/issuer
limits and private sector asset purchase criteria, which are slightly more stringent than for public



Developing a common securities lending framework. The conditions on pricing and eligibility to relend securities under the Public Sector Purchase Program (PSPP) differ across NCBs. To improve
market functioning and access to collateral, the ECB could preemptively harmonize conditions for
securities lending and promote use of specialized securities lending agents across NCBs.

22.
If financial stability risks arise in the future, macroprudential policies should be used. The
ECB and Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) should remain vigilant regarding excessive risk-taking
and asset price bubbles, and coordinate macroprudential policies as the first line of defense, should
risks emerge (Figure 9). Macroprudential tools could include raising capital buffers; imposing stricter
requirements on capital, liquidity, large exposures, and risk weights; and national measures such as
loan-to-value limits to dampen real estate lending. The ECB should also intensify macroprudential
surveillance of non-bank financial institutions in close coordination with the ESRB. On combating antimoney laundering, the SSM should consider entering into memorandums of understanding (MoUs)
with national competent authorities (NCAs) responsible for anti-money laundering and combating the

Further steps to establish a common backstop would help sever the bank-sovereign link.
The resolution framework and bail-in regime under the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD)
are expected to be operational from 2016. In addition, more work is needed in the following areas:


Resolution: The financial capacity of the Single Resolution Fund (SRF) is limited (€55 billion)
relative to the size of the euro area banking sector (€22 trillion).To ensure that funding is indeed
available to resolve large banks in a crisis, the schedule for SRF funding and the mutualization of
“national components” should be accelerated from the current eight-year transition period and its
capacity expanded.



Direct recapitalization: The current preconditions for ESM direct recapitalization of banks—bail-in
of at least 8 percent of bank liabilities, followed by a sovereign recapitalization (if necessary) to
raise common equity tier 1 to 4.5 percent of liabilities—are too high and should be relaxed.
Consideration should also be given to raising the €60 billion ceiling on the ESM direct
recapitalization capacity.



Deposit guarantees: Deposit guarantee schemes (DGSs) across the euro area have been
harmonized under the recent DGS Directive, but still fall short of a pan-European DGS. To
discourage liquidity “ring-fencing” within national jurisdictions, a pan-European DGS should be
established. Since such a pan-European DGS will take time, consideration should be given now to
developing a common fiscal backstop to national DGSs, perhaps through the ESM.

24.
Low interest rates pose risks for life insurers. As noted in the April GFSR, many life insurers
in Europe may face future stress since investment returns have fallen below minimum return
guarantees. Past stress tests assumed higher interest rates than have prevailed recently and may
understate insolvency risks from prolonged low rates. To avoid medium-term risks materializing,
regulators should reassess the viability of guarantee-based products while adopting prudential
measures to improve the sector’s asset-liability matching and diversification of long-term investments.
Some vulnerable insurers may need to raise capital before Solvency II comes into force next year and
so might allocate less profit to policyholders.9 With less than half of EU countries having insurance
guarantee schemes, harmonizing national policy holder protection schemes and unifying resolution
frameworks would reduce the risk of contagion from a single failure.

Authorities’ Views
25.
The ECB stressed the importance of fully implementing QE until inflation is on a
sustained adjustment path, notwithstanding the near-term cyclical upturn. The ECB viewed the
initial impact of QE as fairly strong and broad-based, working through term premia, expectations, and,
given significant differences in the monetary cycles among major advanced economies, exchange rate
effects. It stressed the need to continue with QE until there is a sustained adjustment in the path of
inflation consistent with the ECB’s aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2 percent over
the medium term.
26.
The ECB agreed on the need for flexibility in asset purchases and a harmonized securities
lending program to avoid collateral scarcity. It stands ready to expand the range of eligible assets
9

The Solvency II framework represents a risk-based regulatory framework for insurance companies, which overhauls the
current book value-based accounting framework under Solvency I.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

EURO AREA POLICIES

and widen the scope for “substitute purchases” of agency and supranational debt securities, if
warranted, but emphasized that no shortages were evident. To preempt potential collateral scarcity,
the ECB decided that securities would be available for lending in a harmonized manner across NCBs
and the ECB. The ECB also indicated that price and other incentives could help encourage dealers to
borrow securities from NCBs before approaching the ECB.
27.
The ECB intends to look through temporary market volatility. With the risk-free rate at the
zero lower bound, the recent surge in bond market volatility did not arise unexpectedly. The ECB
intends to “look through” episodes of volatility and continue with the announced schedule of asset
purchases until there is a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with price stability.
Market volatility is a factor only to the extent that it tightens financial conditions and undermines the
ECB’s ability to meet its objective, in which case the ECB can flexibly alter the composition, amount,
and timing of its purchases. Currently, the ECB conducts QE operations in a “market-neutral” way, by
buying at secondary market prices and with a weighted average maturity broadly consistent with the
outstanding stock of securities. Information about its asset purchases is provided in weekly disclosures
of cumulative purchases and the average maturity of holdings.
28.
ECB, SSM, and EC counterparts considered that financial stability risks remain contained
at this time. The main risks to financial stability, apart from developments in Greece, stem from an
abrupt reversal of global risk premia and weak profitability prospects for banks and insurers. Credit
growth is still low and the housing market recovery is still at an early stage. Macroprudential policies
are the first option, although responsibility in this area is shared between the ECB and national
authorities. While the ECB is not vested with AML/CFT supervisory powers, it is reviewing legal
possibilities of entering into MoUs with NCAs responsible for AML/CFT.
29.
Progress is being made to break bank-sovereign links but there are still national
obstacles to greater cross-border liquidity. The transposition of the BRRD into national laws has
been slow but is on track, with the majority of countries expected to complete the process by endyear. Moreover, the Single Resolution Board will be fully operational in January 2016. The authorities
agreed that the threshold for direct recapitalization of banks by the ESM is very high, reflecting the
desire to minimize the likelihood of public aid being deployed. The authorities concurred with the
need for a single DGS; this would constitute the third pillar of a fully-fledged banking union, and
potentially lessen the incentives for ring-fencing liquidity.
30.
Regulators considered the impact of the low interest rates on life insurers mostly a
medium-term concern. EIOPA, the European insurance regulator, saw the problems from low
investment returns relative to liabilities as a medium-term risk, concentrated mainly among small and
mid-size insurers that face difficulties in lowering guarantees and enhancing their capital positions.
EIOPA and the ECB agreed on the benefits of a common resolution framework, perhaps similar to the
BRRD, as well as harmonized policy holder protection schemes modeled after the Deposit Guarantee
Scheme Directive, but saw few prospects for action in the near term. EIOPA has already encouraged
national supervisors to limit certain underwriting activities, increase provisions, and restrict dividend
pay-outs for some insurers. The lack of a unified supervisory or resolution regime makes it more
difficult to deal with possible cross-border links, such that preventing contagion or a wider loss of
confidence in the industry would depend on national backstops. The ECB also noted that Solvency II
requirements may contribute to some challenges with respect to financial stability since some features
of a risk-based approach to capital requirements could be at odds with efforts to reduce asset-liability
mismatches among insurers.

B. Delivering Fiscal Support within the SGP
31.
Using fiscal space and flexibility within the SGP can support the recovery and
complement QE (Figure 5 and Box 2). Countries should adhere to their commitments under the SGP
to strengthen the credibility of the collective framework, and where possible, seek to support
investment and structural reforms.


Use fiscal space where available… Countries with fiscal space under their medium-term objectives
(MTOs) and benefiting from lower interest rates due to QE should use this space, totaling around
0.4 percent of euro area GDP. Countries without fiscal space under their MTOs should save their
interest windfalls to reduce debt and meet their fiscal targets. In general, all countries should
pursue growth-friendly fiscal rebalancing that lowers marginal taxes on labor and capital, financed
by cuts to unproductive spending or base-broadening measures.



…and SGP flexibility to pursue structural reform. Countries not under the EDP could use the
flexibility under the SGP (i.e., one-off and temporary deviations from countries’ MTOs) to support
critical structural reforms. To ensure high-quality spending, the EC should identify structural
reforms and investments that would qualify under the flexibility (see structural reform discussion
below).

32.
Centralized support can provide a needed boost to lagging investment. Centralized
investment through the EFSI—leveraging €21 billion in public funds and guarantees to catalyze
€315 billion in private investment—could help support the recovery in countries with limited fiscal
space. Particular attention should be paid to project selection to support new, higher risk investments
that would not be undertaken otherwise, and to removing regulatory barriers.

Authorities’ Views
33.
The authorities cautioned on the need to uphold and strengthen SGP credibility. They saw
the neutral euro area aggregate fiscal stance this year as broadly appropriate, but noted the uneven
distribution; countries with fiscal space are choosing not to use it, while those without fiscal space still
need further adjustment. The authorities recognized the synergies from combining fiscal expansion
with QE, but stressed the need to ensure compliance with the fiscal framework. QE has lowered interest
bills, which countries in need of further adjustment are already spending. The authorities cautioned
that these windfall savings should be used for deficit reduction, especially in countries with high debt.
Interest savings could prove temporary if interest rates normalize, or trend growth could decline
further. The EC also indicated that in practice eligibility conditions as well as safeguards against
deviating from MTOs were likely to limit space for structural reforms and investment to qualify for
flexibility under the SGP.
34.
Efforts to implement the EFSI swiftly are underway. The authorities highlighted that the EIB
had already approved several projects and the EFSI should be fully operational by autumn. They
agreed that project selection would be critical, and pointed to the investment committee to help
ensure the EFSI backs additional, riskier projects.

C. Balance Sheet Repair to Enhance Monetary Transmission
35.
High NPLs are hindering lending and the recovery. By weakening bank profitability and
tying up capital, NPLs constrain banks’ ability to lend and limit the effectiveness of monetary policy
(Box 3 and Figure 6). In general, countries with high NPLs have shown the weakest recovery in credit.
36.
A more centralized approach would facilitate NPL resolution. The SSM is now responsible
for euro area-wide supervisory policy and could take the lead in a more aggressive, top-down strategy
that aims to:

Accelerate NPL resolution. The SSM should
strengthen incentives for write-offs or debt
restructuring, and coordinate with NCAs to have
banks set realistic provisioning and collateral values.
Higher capital surcharges or time limits on longheld NPLs would help expedite disposal. For banks
with high SME NPLs, the SSM could adopt a “triage”
approach by setting targets for NPL resolution and
introducing standardized criteria for identifying
nonviable firms for quick liquidation and viable
ones for restructuring.10 Banks would also benefit
from enhancing their NPL resolution tools and
expertise.



Improve insolvency and foreclosure systems. Costly debt enforcement and foreclosure procedures
complicate the disposal of impaired assets. To complement tougher supervision, insolvency
reforms at the national level to accelerate court procedures and encourage out-of-court workouts
would encourage market-led corporate restructuring.



Jumpstart a market for distressed debt. The lack of a well-functioning market for distressed debt
hinders asset disposal. Asset management companies (AMCs) at the national level could support a
market for distressed debt by purchasing NPLs and disposing of them quickly. In some cases, a
centralized AMC with some public sector involvement may be beneficial to provide economies of
scale and facilitate debt restructuring. But such an AMC would need to comply with EU State aid
rules (including, importantly, the requirement that AMCs purchase assets at market prices).11 In
situations where markets are limited, a formula-based approach for transfer pricing should be
used. European agencies, such as the EIB or EIF, could also provide support through structured
finance, securitization, or equity involvement.

10

See SDN on “Tackling Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Problem Loans in Europe” (IMF SDN/15/04, March 2015).
Any public sector support for a financial institution is subject to investigation under EU State aid rules, and if deemed
non-permissible by DG Competition, would result in such support being removed.

Box 3. The NPL Problem in the Euro Area and Its Macro-Financial Implications1
High NPLs erode bank profitability and hold back new lending, limiting the effectiveness of
monetary policy. Rising asset impairments tie up substantial amounts of capital due to diminished
retained earnings and higher provisioning requirements, restricting banks’ ability to support
economic recovery (figure below). And a deteriorating balance sheet raises a bank’s cost of capital,
resulting in some combination of higher lending rates, reduced lending volumes, and increased risk
aversion. Credit growth remains particularly slow in countries where banks report high levels of
impaired assets.

Note: 1/ Left graph shows annual interest income to gross loans, for over 100 euro are banks, relative to the annual average for banks with the same nationality, calculated
over the period 2009–13. The right graph shows annualized lending growth relative to average lending growth in the same country, using data from the European Banking
Authority for a sample of more than 60 banks over the period 2010–13. Outliers have been excluded, based on extreme values for lending growth, nonperforming loans and
interest margins. 2/ Calculations based on bank-by-bank data from the EBA Transparency Exercise (2013). 3/ NPLs reduced to historical average and capital adequacy ratio
(CAR) of 13.0 percent.

NPL disposal affects bank capital, and therefore potential credit supply. The illustrative analysis
assumes that banks reduce the current stock of NPLs (end-2014) by selling their distressed loans to
external investors. This reduces the regulatory capital charge of loan books in proportion to the share
of NPLs (and their applicable credit risk weight). It is assumed that banks sell their loans at net book
value (yielding the upper bound of capital relief), or at a uniform haircut to net book values of either
five percent (mid-range), or at a 10 percent (lower bound). In practice, the selling price would reflect
the expected foreclosure time (prices would be lower where foreclosure times are long and debtenforcement regimes weak) and would need to offer a sufficiently high return on investment
consistent with general profit expectations in distressed debt markets.1
NPL disposal can free up large volumes of regulatory capital and generate significant capacity
for new lending. For a large sample of euro area banks covering almost 90 percent of all institutions
under direct ECB supervision, the amount of aggregate capital that would be released if NPLs were
reduced to historical average levels (between three and four percent of gross loan books) is
calculated. This amounts to between €13–€42 billion for a haircut range of between zero and
5 percent, and assuming that banks meet a target capital adequacy ratio of 13 percent. This in turn
could unlock new lending of between €167–€522 billion (1.8–5.6 percent of sample countries’ GDP),
provided there is corresponding demand for new loans. Due to the uneven distribution of capital and
NPLs, capital relief varies significantly across euro area countries, with Portugal, Italy, Spain, and
Ireland benefiting the most in this stylized example.

Area.”

37.
Harmonizing capital requirements would strengthen the resilience of the system. While
most banks already meet the minimum capital requirements under Basel III, definitions of capital still
vary across countries under the transitional arrangements of the Capital Requirements Regulation
(CRR). National differences in the definition of capital should be removed quickly to enhance
regulatory consistency. In addition, banks, particularly in stressed economies, hold large amounts of
deferred tax assets (DTAs) and goodwill, which are of doubtful loss-absorbing capacity.12 Regulatory
treatment of DTAs should be harmonized in a way that does not encourage excessive de-risking. Also,
further work is required to close gaps between the CRR and Basel III rules regarding the treatment of
leverage and liquidity risk in the banking sector.

Authorities’ Views
38.
The ECB has made NPL resolution a policy priority, but faces hurdles. It has placed a
subset of banks with elevated NPLs under enhanced monitoring and to encourage the resolution of
NPLs, will consider setting targets on restructured loans to either convert them to performing or write
them off, and urging the NCAs to follow the same approach for less significant institutions. It is also
reviewing bank assets not covered under the asset quality review (AQR) of the CA last year. The ECB
stressed the importance of improving national insolvency and foreclosure regimes to facilitate NPL
resolution. The ECB does not have the power to change International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) accounting rules, but will use all means possible to foster realistic provisioning and collateral
valuation practices to encourage write-offs. The ECB agreed with staff on the possibility of using
prudential measures to set time limits or capital surcharges on long-held NPLs.
39.
National AMCs would need to meet EU State aid rules. The authorities noted that the
appropriateness of an AMC depends on the circumstances and asset composition (i.e., AMCs might
work better for real estate than SME loans). There was little political appetite for a pan-European AMC
given the large heterogeneity of legacy assets. Moreover, the scope for national AMCs may be limited
due to large segments of NPLs that might not be the most appropriate for transfer to an AMC. They
observed that EU State aid rules would require that assets be sold at market prices; for sales above the
market price, banks would face bail-in of creditors under the State aid rules and BRRD. Where markets
are very illiquid, a formula-based approach to determining market prices is possible.
40.
The harmonization of capital and liquidity will take some time. The ECB is currently
focused on harmonizing definitions of NPLs (and capital) across countries, in coordination with the
European Banking Authority, and on supervisory implementation of the Single Rulebook. This will help
to ensure a level playing field across banks and countries, although some options and national
discretions remain outside the ECB’s purview where transitional measures have been enacted under
national laws. The ECB agreed that high levels of DTAs are a problem for bank loss absorption capacity
in some countries.
12

DTAs are instruments that may be used to reduce future tax obligations contingent on future profitability; these can
currently count as part of regulatory capital. Because DTAs are not loss-absorbing, their use as capital will be phased out
over a 10-year transition to Basel III. However, some economies have introduced legislative changes enabling DTAs to
be transformed into Deferred Tax Credits, which are not contingent on future profits and can be counted as capital
regardless of whether the bank is profitable.

D. Closing Structural Reform Gaps—Boosting Growth and Integration

The opportunity provided by the cyclical upturn,
SGP flexibility, and monetary easing should be used to
accelerate structural reform priorities. This would raise
potential growth, improve confidence and help jumpstart
investment, and strengthen the resilience of the euro area to
shocks. Supportive macroeconomic policies would offset some
of the negative demand effects from structural reform.
Estimates indicate that implementation of product and labor
market reforms, as described in Box 2, would boost the level of
euro area output in 2020 by 1.6 percent.

the business climate and increase competition. The latter
should include measures to ensure stronger contract
enforcement, improved public sector efficiency, and expanded access to credit, especially for
SMEs. Table 4 lists a number of country-specific reform priorities.



At the regional level, there should be a renewed emphasis on convergence and productivity.
Faster implementation of the Services Directive should be prioritized to phase out long-held
national barriers. Deeper integration would improve the resilience of the EMU. To this end there
should be a reinvigorated push toward completing the Single Market in goods, services, capital,
transport, energy, and the digital economy, as well as harmonization of insolvency regimes. The
new Commission has pushed for action in many of these areas, which has been echoed in the Five
Presidents’ report.



Implementing both national and regional reforms together could yield synergies as countries that
improve flexibility and competitiveness would be in a better position to benefit from deeper
integration. For example, greater labor mobility through effective implementation of the Services
Directive would complement national labor market reforms.

42.
A capital markets union would enhance access to finance. The lack of cross-border
integration limits the efficient allocation of savings to investment and the ability of the zone to
respond to shocks. The EC’s Green Paper on Building a Capital Markets Union (CMU) outlines principles
for a broader and more efficient financial system, which will be followed in the fall by an action plan.
Key priorities should include:

High-quality securitization. Moving toward a pan-European definition of high-quality
securitization (HQS) comprising simple, transparent, and efficient asset structures would help

treatment (e.g., lower capital charges under Basel III)

could prove especially beneficial to SMEs, which
tend to be particularly reliant on bank lending.



Increasing transparency. Common standards for
market disclosure for firms, integrated tax and

registries (especially in countries where privacy laws
have prevented greater information sharing) would
facilitate investment, especially cross-border.

Removing national differences in market infrastructure and regulations. The priority should be to

43.
Agreement on an ambitious Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP)
would enhance growth and productivity. Since tariffs are already low for most EU-U.S. goods trade,
negotiations are focused on trade in services as well as enhanced regulatory cooperation and common
standards and rules such as investor dispute resolution. Exposure to greater competition, especially in
the services sector, could help encourage productivity-enhancing reforms, streamlining and
harmonizing of regulations, as well as possibly greater cross-border investment.

Authorities’ Views
44.
Further progress on structural reforms is needed to improve the outlook and increase
resilience. The authorities noted that progress has been mixed and slow, hence stepped-up action is
needed, especially on product markets, repair of bank and SME balance sheets, and the business
environment to support an investment recovery. The EC also stressed the need to improve services
productivity, reduce structural and youth unemployment through active labor market policies, enhance
vocational training, and lower labor taxation.
45.
The authorities agreed on the importance of better integrating national capital markets
and developing them as an alternative to bank lending. In the short term, the authorities put
priority on increasing lending through HQS, private placements, and ways to expand financing for
SMEs. Over the medium term, more difficult issues such as harmonization of insolvency regimes and a
single regulator would need to be addressed.
46.
A TTIP agreement could yield growth benefits in the medium-term. The EC estimates that
TTIP implementation could permanently raise output by 0.5 percent of GDP with the bulk of the
benefits coming from removal of non-tariff barriers. The authorities did not expect negotiation of TTIP
to lead to harmonization within the EU—rather, areas already harmonized would likely be taken up in
TTIP—but more competition once a trade deal is in place could help increase productivity.

E. A Stronger, Simpler Economic Governance Framework
47.
A more effective and simpler governance framework would help advance structural and
fiscal reforms, as emphasized in the Five Presidents Report. Given the mixed record of adherence
to EU targets and recommendations, a stronger framework to monitor, incentivize, and enforce
reforms and sound fiscal policies could foster convergence within the euro area. Such a framework
should promote increased ownership, transparency and accountability.
48.
“Outcome-based” area-wide structural benchmarks would help improve transparency
and incentivize reform implementation. Current peer review practices under the European semester
could be strengthened by using concrete and measurable outcome-based indicators (“benchmarks”) to
define the reform agenda. Their use could improve transparency, simplify implementation, and
promote innovation among member states in addressing reform challenges since each country could
design its own approach to meet the target. Benchmarks should focus on reforms that are macrocritical and linked to ambitious euro area-wide goals, such as the number of days to enforce a contract
or lowering labor tax wedges.
49.
EU legislation and SGP flexibility could help catalyze reform progress. Compared to
coordination, EU legislation is more binding and effective in enforcing outcomes (e.g., the directive on
late payments). Consistent with the EU initiative to reduce excessive legislation, the EC could prioritize
legislative action on critical reforms, such as integrating energy and digital markets. Further EC
guidance to facilitate the use of SGP flexibility for reforms could enhance incentives by identifying ex
ante a list of permissible reforms and using historical cross-country estimates for costing when
possible.
50.
Independent structural councils would improve monitoring and design of reforms. An
EU-level “structural council” of experts could be created to assess ex post the EC’s prioritization and
enforcement of structural reforms. In member countries, “national productivity councils” with wide
representation could assist ex ante in translating euro area-wide reforms into a national reform agenda
(as is done in Belgium, Germany, and Australia), thereby fostering ownership and innovation.
51.
Simplifying and strengthening the fiscal framework would enhance its effectiveness.
While successive reforms have improved some elements of the EU’s fiscal framework (e.g., taking
greater account of the economic cycle), they have increased its complexity, hampering effective
monitoring, public communication, and compliance. The framework could be simplified by focusing on
two main pillars: a single fiscal anchor (public debt-to-GDP) and a single operational target (an
expenditure growth rule, possibly with a debt correction mechanism) linked to the anchor.14 To
enhance enforcement, fiscal policy monitoring could be improved through better interaction between
national fiscal councils and the EC, possibly facilitated by the EU Network of Independent Fiscal
Institutions (EUNIFI), or through an independent fiscal council at the EU level to assess application of
fiscal rules.

How would benchmarking work? “Outcome-based” structural reform benchmarks would
increase the specificity of the reform agenda, and improve transparency and accountability in the
application of the current framework. The first

Advantage. Benchmarking could increase ownership as member states would decide them jointly;
benchmarks would apply to all countries but member states would have leeway in developing
action plans to achieve targeted outcomes; and, the process could spur greater discussions on the
best way to achieve economic outcomes. Benchmarking would also improve the prioritization of
reforms, and facilitate monitoring and pre-emptive corrective action where necessary. By
increasing transparency, it would make performance gaps clearly visible and comparable across
countries, reduce excessive discretion and a perceived lack of even handedness in the application
of the existing governance framework, increase accountability, and level the playing field across
members.
Challenge. It may be operationally difficult to identify and quantify specific benchmarks with all
the desired characteristics, particularly given the uncertainty surrounding links to the outcome of
some reforms. For example, targets on employment rates (such as those in the Europe 2020
strategy) may seem specific and outcome-based, but can be difficult to target effectively since
they are not entirely under the control of policymakers. A better and more easily enforceable
benchmark might be one on the labor tax wedge (e.g., “reduce labor tax wedge to x percent in y
years”) as this can be directly influenced by policy and has been shown to be associated with
higher employment rates.

Authorities’ Views
52.
Enhanced economic governance is desirable, but progress is likely to be made in stages.
As noted in the Five Presidents’ Report, near-term efforts should focus on improving the operation of
the current framework without deeper reforms that would require a Treaty change. The authorities
broadly agreed with the proposals for an improved structural governance framework, but also
highlighted practical challenges. They regarded greater ownership, specificity, transparency,
independent evaluation, and accountability as appropriate principles.
53.
Outcome-based benchmarks could be useful for enhancing specificity and transparency.
This would facilitate a more rules-based approach to application of the Macroeconomic Imbalances
Procedure (MIP). The EC noted, however, that identifying appropriate outcome-based benchmarks
could be operationally difficult, in particular identifying measurable indicators under the control of
country authorities that can deliver desired outcomes, and indicators may not accurately reflect reform
progress. More consistent and transparent application of the existing structural reform governance
framework, including the MIP, could strengthen credibility and compliance.
54.
There are limits to how much legislation and SGP flexibility could help advance reforms.
Greater use of legislative approaches could help achieve action on product market and other reforms,
but without treaty changes, the EU has limited legislative jurisdiction, and the appetite for additional
EU legislation is low. While in principle there is a case for supporting structural reforms through SGP
flexibility, a cautious approach is needed to avoid undermining credibility of the framework and debt
sustainability, especially given uncertainty about the impact of structural measures and the
commitment of countries to follow through on reform pledges.
55.
The proposed approach to SGP reforms is sensible, but again, broader changes are
unlikely now. The authorities agreed on the merits of focusing on a debt anchor and an expenditure
growth rule. More prominence could be given to the expenditure benchmark and debt criterion within
the current fiscal framework, but the authorities saw little support now for deeper changes that may
entail modification of the Treaty to streamline the complicated framework. The ECB noted the
importance of enforcement problems. The authorities saw some merit in the idea of a technical EUlevel fiscal council to underpin economic judgment on use of the room for maneuver under the SGP
and dispel perceptions of politicized enforcement of it.

STAFF APPRAISAL
56.
The cyclical recovery is gaining strength, supported by a number of tailwinds. Although
unemployment is still high, steady job growth and rising real wages have underpinned a rebound in
consumption. Low oil prices, accommodative monetary policy, including QE, and a weaker euro are
supporting the upturn, with major euro area economies expected to grow near or above last year’s
rate. With oil prices stabilizing, domestic demand recovering, and QE helping support inflation
expectations, prices are expected to rise gradually through the medium term.
57.
The external position continues to strengthen. The euro area’s external position in 2014 was
broadly consistent with the level implied by medium-term fundamentals. The real depreciation of the
30

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

EURO AREA POLICIES

euro so far this year has been beneficial given the economic cycle, but the currency is now moderately
weaker than the level that would be consistent with medium-term fundamentals. A broader reform
agenda that raises growth and inflation would contribute to a gradual strengthening of the euro over
the medium term, and limit potential spillovers from relying too heavily on accommodative monetary
policy.
58.
Risks to the forecast are now more balanced than recent years when they were clearly to
the downside. Greater positive impact than expected could come from low oil prices, QE, a weaker
euro, and rising confidence. These offset risks from potential for lingering weakness and low inflation, a
slowdown in emerging markets, geopolitical tensions, and financial market volatility from asymmetric
monetary policies among major economies or developments in Greece.
59.
Managing potential contagion from evolving developments in Greece will require timely
and effective policy actions. Policy-makers should stand ready to deploy, and if necessary, adapt
available instruments, such as QE, OMT and TLTROs, to manage contagion risks. If financial conditions
tighten significantly, the ECB should consider expanding its asset purchase program. Beyond the near
term, there should be a concerted effort to strengthen the monetary union and European firewalls.
Fully severing bank-sovereign links would require a common deposit insurance scheme with a fiscal
backstop, a larger and fully funded Single Resolution Fund, and easier access to direct bank
recapitalization from the ESM in a systemic crisis.
60.
Despite the cyclical upturn, only subdued growth is expected over the medium term. The
tepid medium-term outlook reflects insufficient demand, weak balance sheets, and slow progress on
structural reforms gaps that continue to hold back employment and investment. As one-off factors
driving the cyclical recovery fade, there is a risk that low growth and limited policy space leave the euro
area vulnerable to shocks.
61.
A stronger collective push is urgently needed to strengthen the recovery and deepen
integration. Concerted action should focus on four pillars: continuing demand support, cleaning up
bank balance sheets, accelerating structural reforms, and strengthening the economic governance
framework. A more balanced policy mix that includes not only ongoing monetary accommodation, but
also fiscal support within the SGP, improved credit conditions to enhance monetary transmission, and
structural reforms to boost productivity would yield larger growth dividends and positive external
spillovers.
62.
Staying the course on QE is essential. QE’s initial implementation has improved confidence
and financial conditions, and raised inflation expectations. Given still important risks from low inflation,
fully implementing QE and looking through temporary periods of market volatility are critical to
meeting the inflation objective, and the program should be extended if there is not a sustained
adjustment in inflation consistent with meeting the medium-term price stability objective. Although
there are few signs of scarcity, the ECB could expand the list of assets eligible for purchase and work
with NCBs to preemptively harmonize conditions for re-lending securities to ensure sufficient
availability of collateral for smooth market functioning.
63.
Potential financial stability risks should be addressed through macroprudential and other
policies. Close monitoring remains appropriate, and macroprudential policies should be used as a first
line of defense. To address challenges faced by life insurers in a low interest rate environment, the
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

31

EURO AREA POLICIES

viability of guarantee-based products should be reassessed, minimum returns should be brought in
line with interest rates, and steps should be taken to improve asset-liability matching.
64.
Fiscal support within the SGP and centralized investment can help support demand.
Countries should adhere to their SGP commitments, but those countries with fiscal space, including
from lower interest costs due to QE, should use it to raise investment and pursue structural reforms.
Others should use windfall savings to reduce debt and meet fiscal targets. Rapid implementation of the
EFSI would help boost investment, especially in countries with limited fiscal room. Careful project
selection to target additional and higher-return investments, as well as removal of regulatory barriers
will help maximize potential impact of the EFSI.
65.
More comprehensive actions are needed to reduce the high level of NPLs. NPL resolution
should be accelerated through strengthened provisioning and collateral valuation, as well as capital
surcharges or time limits on long-held NPLs. Insolvency reforms and more effective out-of-court
workout procedures are needed in many countries. Policies should also seek to jumpstart a market for
distressed debt to assist in corporate restructuring, including through use of AMCs, subject to EU State
aid rules.
66.
Structural reforms are urgently needed to raise potential growth. Notwithstanding some
progress in recent years, long-standing challenges have contributed to lagging productivity. Priorities
at the national level should include labor market reforms to reduce duality and increase employment
opportunities, as well as product and service sector reforms to improve the business climate. At the
regional level, faster implementation of the Services Directive, further improvements to insolvency
regimes, and a greater push toward a single market in capital, transport, energy, and the digital
economy would help further integration. A capital markets union would enhance access to finance;
efforts in this area should focus on increasing transparency, improving market infrastructure and
regulations, and promoting high quality securitization, especially for SMEs. Agreement on an ambitious
TTIP would boost growth and productivity.
67.
A more effective governance framework would help advance structural reforms. Using
outcome-based structural reform benchmarks would improve transparency and accountability.
Selective use of EU legislation would help achieve progress in critical areas, and better use of SGP
flexibility for countries undertaking structural reforms would provide incentives for action. An
independent structural council at the EU level would enhance monitoring ex post, while national-level
productivity councils could enhance ownership and innovation in the design of reform programs.
68.
The fiscal framework would also benefit from simplification and strengthening. The
complex framework would be made more effective by focusing on two key pillars: a single fiscal anchor
(public debt-to-GDP) and a single operational target (an expenditure growth rule, possibly with a debt
correction mechanism). Enforcement, monitoring, and coordination of fiscal policy could be improved
through better interaction between national fiscal councils and the EC, and possibly by an EU-level
independent fiscal council to assess SGP application.
69.
It is proposed that the next Article IV Consultation on euro area policies take place on
the standard 12-month cycle.

Table 3. External Sector Assessment
Euro Area
Foreign asset and
liability position
and trajectory

Background. The net international investment position (NIIP) of the euro area deteriorated through the crisis, to
-17 percent of GDP in 2008, but has since rebounded to around -11.6 percent in 2014:Q4, as a result of improved current accounts,
modest nominal GDP growth, and valuation effects. A more stable outlook and projections of continued current account surplus
suggest that the NIIP to GDP ratio will continue to improve at a moderate pace, rising to about zero percent over the medium term.
Assessment. The NIIP positions of individual member countries still vary greatly. Despite recent improvements, external vulnerabilities
persist due to market perceptions of the capability of some euro area countries with sizable net foreign liabilities to service their debts.

Current account

Background. The current account (CA) balance for the euro area strengthened slightly in 2014 to 2.3 percent of GDP, up from
2.2 percent of GDP in 2013. The cyclically-adjusted current account in 2014 is estimated to be a surplus of about 1.9 percent of GDP.
The cyclical position and adjustment of the CAs, however, varies significantly across member countries.
Assessment. Staff assesses that the euro area 2014 current account is broadly in line with the level suggested by medium-term
fundamentals and desired policies (as in the EBA estimated norm), with a CA gap ranging from -1 to 1 percent of GDP. The CA norm of
2.0 percent of GDP reflects primarily the adverse demographics and weak medium-term growth prospects in the euro area. The CA is
expected to strengthen further in 2015 by nearly one percent of GDP, reflecting an improvement in the net oil balance by about
0.7 percent of GDP, some competitiveness gains, and continued weak domestic demand. External imbalances at the national level
remain and are expected to persist. Improvements in the current accounts of debtor countries have been driven mainly by import
compression, reflecting sluggish domestic demand, while surpluses in large creditor countries continue to increase.

Real exchange
rate

Background. The CPI-based real effective exchange rate was essentially unchanged from 2013 to 2014, but fell by 10 percent as of
May 2015, compared with its average level in 2014, reflecting both a nominal depreciation and slowing inflation in the euro area
relative to its trading partners. The nominal depreciation in 2015 is expected to persist, not least due to the divergent economic and
monetary policy outlook among the major advanced economies.
Assessment. Staff assesses the euro area real exchange rate in 2014 (year average) to be consistent with medium-term fundamentals,
with a REER gap of between -5 to 5 percent. The REER depreciation in 2015 is also consistent with the near-term cyclical outlook and
the need for continued monetary accommodation. Important differences, however, remain at the national level and are expected to
persist.
Background. The slight rise of the CA surplus in 2014 was mirrored by financial outflows on a net basis. In particular, the financial
account deficit was predominantly driven by bank-related and portfolio debt outflows, which were partially offset by increases in
portfolio equity inflows.

FX intervention
and reserves level

Background. The euro has the status of a global reserve currency.

Technical
Background
Notes

1/ The IMF EBA analysis for the euro area covers 11 euro area members, which are Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,
Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain. The assessments of CA and REER gaps for the euro area are derived from GDPweighted averages of the assessments of the individual countries listed above, as well as from estimates for the euro area as a whole.
2/ When applying GDP-weighted aggregation for the euro area, the CA is corrected for reporting discrepancies in intra-area
transactions, as the CA of the entire euro area is about ½ percent of GDP less than the sum of the individual 11 countries' CA balances
(for which no such correction is available).3/ Data vintage as of June 2, 2015. Revision since then indicates that the current account
balance in 2014 is 2.1 percent of GDP in the euro area.

Assessment. The trend of financial flows has closely followed developments in the current account and was supported by easing
financial conditions in the euro area. Looking ahead, the return of capital flows would depend crucially on growth prospects of the
region, external conditions, and institutional reform efforts including the long-term vision to complete the architecture of the EMU.

Assessment. Reserves held by euro area economies are typically low relative to standard metrics, but the currency is free floating.

The external position of the euro area in 2014 was
broadly consistent with the level implied by mediumterm fundamentals and desirable policies. In 2015, the
current account is projected to rise, reflecting
continued weak demand, an improvement in the net
oil balance, and the weaker euro, pointing to a
strengthening external position. The REER depreciation
so far in 2015 has been beneficial, given the current
stage of the economic cycle and the need to address
low inflation and reduce deflation risks. At the same
time the REER is moderately weaker than the level that
would be consistent with medium-term fundamentals.
Along with accommodative monetary policy, a
broader policy agenda that includes more growthfriendly fiscal policy, a strengthening of bank balance
sheets, and productivity-enhancing structural reforms,
would contribute to a gradual real appreciation of the
euro over the medium term.
In addition, imbalances in the external position remain
at the national level, stemming from weak demand,
low inflation, persistently high unemployment, and
financial fragmentation. Further adjustment is needed
for both surplus and deficit member states to
rebalance their external positions.
Potential policy responses:
Continued monetary accommodation is appropriate
to lift inflation closer to the ECB’s medium-term price
stability objective, which should mitigate the real
depreciation caused by the weaker euro, help
increase demand and facilitate relative price
adjustments at the national level. Monetary easing
should be complemented with policies to strengthen
banks’ balance sheets, structural reforms to enhance
productivity and improve competitiveness, and more
growth-friendly fiscal policy to promote investment
and structural reforms. This should also help achieve
external rebalancing within the union.

 Adopt and implement the planned public
administration reform. The reform should specifically
include reforms to the provision of local public
services; tendering procedures; and human resources
management in the public administration to unlock
productivity.
 Further measures are needed to improve the efficiency
of civil justice: rationalize types of cases that reach the
Supreme Court; allow further specialization of courts;
push ahead with the project develop court
performance indicators; and use ad hoc measures to
reduce the backlog of pending measures.
 Legislate and implement concrete measures to
redesign wage-supplementation scheme to turn it into
universal support system conditional on job search
and training, and strengthen active labor market
policies as envisioned in the Jobs Act.
 Further decentralize wage setting by allowing greater
flexibility in national contracts and tackling the
existing constraints to second-stage wage bargaining.
 The swift approval and implementation of the Annual
Law on Competition and addressing existing
regulatory barriers in key sectors—such as retail and
transport—would support growth. The full
implementation of already legislated reforms by all
levels of government is needed to improve business
environment.

Appendix 2. Statistical Issues

European statistics are developed, produced, and disseminated within their respective spheres of
competence by the European Statistical System (ESS) and the European System of Central Banks
(ESCB). The ESS, composed of Eurostat and the national statistical institutes (NSIs), and the ESCB,
composed of the ECB and the national central banks (NCBs), operate under separate legal
frameworks reflecting their respective governance structures and cooperate closely when designing
their respective statistical programs.2 The European statistics produced by the two statistical
systems are of sufficient coverage, quality, and timeliness for effective macroeconomic surveillance.
This appendix provides an update on developments of statistical issues since the previous Article IV
consultation with the euro area member states.
1.
Transition to the new international statistical standards3 is largely complete. All
member states now compile national accounts according to the new European System of
National and Regional Accounts (ESA 2010) and many took the opportunity to implement
benchmark revisions and introduce other statistical improvements, including to data sources and
compilation methods to improve the consistency and completeness of data. Most countries
requested derogations in some areas up to 2020. The transition to the Sixth Edition of the IMF’s
Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6) is also complete. The
ECB’s new data reporting requirements on external statistics under BPM6 are more detailed,
particularly as regards the instrument breakdown within the various functional categories, and
have full stock-flow reconciliation. The dissemination of these data will be completed in 2015
when their quality is sufficiently enhanced and large asymmetries coming from some euro area
countries are addressed to reduce “errors and omissions”. Eurostat and the ECB are working
closely with all stakeholders on resolving outstanding issues regarding extending the availability
of historical series. The methodology of monetary and financial statistics (e.g., interest rates,
investment funds, financial vehicle corporations, securities issues) has also been adapted and
new statistics will become available in the second half of 2015.
2.
A number of significant initiatives are underway to improve the quality and
timeliness of statistical data.


Flash quarterly GDP estimates at T+30 days. The progress of the Task Force established
by the National Accounts Working Group to assess the feasibility of producing a flash
estimate of euro area and European Union quarterly GDP at T+30 days has been
encouraging. Internal estimates of quarterly GDP have been produced at T+30 days and

1

Prepared jointly by the European (EUR) and Statistics Departments (STA) of the IMF in consultation with
Eurostat and the ECB. Florina Tanase acted as the STA coordinator.
2
The ESS is defined by Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No. 223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council
on European statistics. The ESCB performs its statistical function on the basis of Article 5 of the Statute of the
ESCB and of the ECB.
3
The transition to ESA 2010 is regulated by EU Regulation No. 549/2013 and the transition to BPM6 is regulated
by EU Regulation No. 555/2012 and ECB Guideline ECB/2011/23, as amended. Changes to monetary and financial
statistics are regulated by the ECB.

EURO AREA POLICIES

test calculations showed limited deviations from those produced at T+45 days. Faster
flash quarterly GDP estimates could be published next year if a majority of Member
States supports them in a decision foreseen towards the end of this year.


European level supply and use tables. The FIGARO4 project, foreseen by Eurostat in
cooperation with the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission aims to
establish an annual production of EU multi-country input-output tables and a five-yearly
production of EU multi-country supply, use and input-output tables. The output of the
project will support studies on competitiveness, growth, productivity, employment and
international trade, and assessment of the position of the European Union and the euro
area in the world.



Further harmonization of data on trade of goods and services will benefit from the
ongoing study of discrepancies between national accounts, balance of payments
statistics, and international trade in goods and services statistics. The largest gaps are
observed in data on imports and exports of goods reported in the international trade
statistics compared with the national accounts and balance of payments. Eurostat and
the ECB are working on resolving discrepancies (e.g., to include illegal activities in the
balance of payments data).

3.
Significant progress has been made in government finance statistics (GFS) to
enhance economic and fiscal governance. Annual and quarterly ESA 2010-based GFS time
series are available for all countries. The revisions to government deficit and debt levels due to
the introduction of the ESA 2010 standard occurred in October 2014, largely due to
reclassification of units in the general government sector. Progress has also been made in the
national publication of monthly fiscal data based on public accounts, as required by the
Enhanced Economic Governance Package (so called “Six Pack”). Further, in February 2015 and in
the context of “Six Pack”, Eurostat published for the first time the data on contingent liabilities
and non-performing loans of the government. The contingent liabilities included government
guarantees, liabilities related to public-private partnerships recorded off-balance sheet of
government, and liabilities of government controlled entities classified outside general
government (public corporations). Work is underway to encourage member states to improve
comparability of data across countries. Technical work is also ongoing to harmonize and
modernize public sector accounting standards by moving to accruals based accounting in the
context of the EPSAS (European Public Sector Accounting Standards) project.
4.
The effect of the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) on GFS remains
uncertain. Eurostat is awaiting details on the operational arrangements and the pipeline of
transactions, in particular, whether additional contributions will be made to EFSI by individual
member states. It is possible that EFSI transactions will be added to government deficits,
although this impact will be excluded by the European Commission for the purposes of the
Excessive Deficit Procedure, in line with their communication on flexibility in the beginning of
2015.

5.
Ongoing efforts aim to enhance the statistics for the Macroeconomic Imbalances
Procedure (MIP). The ESS and the ESCB cooperate closely to assure the quality of MIP-relevant
statistics. The main challenge is the availability of historical time series of necessary length based
on the new statistical standards. This is addressed by statistical estimation methods in some
cases. Eurostat, in cooperation with the ECB, is also developing a quality monitoring mechanism
for data required for the MIP. A report on the quality of data is due to be published in the
second half of 2015.
6.
The ECB is working on several projects to enhance over time the availability and
quality of statistics on the basis of new granular databases.


Money Market Statistical Reporting (MMSR). An ECB Regulation (ECB/2014/48) adopted in
November 2014 will require credit institutions to report daily their individual transactions
relating to various segments of the money market as from April 2016 with full reporting
commencing in July 2016. In particular, the transaction-by-transaction data collection will
comprise: (i) daily unsecured borrowing transactions with maturity up to and including
one year as well as interbank lending; (ii) daily secured lending and borrowing
transactions data; and (iii) daily Foreign Exchange Swaps (FX Swaps) transactions and
Overnight Index Swaps transactions denominated in euro (volume and rates). To ensure
standardization, a common set of Reporting Instructions have been developed which are
fully compliant with the ISO 20022 standard. Some aggregated indicators based on the
different markets will be released at a later stage to the general public.



Securities holdings statistics. Securities holdings statistics are being collected since end
2013. The data contain quarterly security-by-security information on holdings of
individual securities by institutional sectors, collected after 70 days from euro area (and
some other EU) national central banks and enriched with reference issuer and securities
information by the Centralized Securities Database (CSDB). Additionally, a second module
comprises security-by-security information on the holdings by some individual euro area
banking groups identified as important for the stability and functioning of the financial
system in the euro area. From 2016 the timeliness of the data collection will be enhanced
to 55 days. The granularity of the data provides a vast range of breakdowns on both the
issuer and holder sides, which are not available in other statistics. For instance, the
holdings of government debt can now be monitored together with residual or original
breakdown or even on an individual bond level (e.g., recently issued bonds).



Insurance corporations’ statistics. An ECB Regulation (ECB/2014/50) adopted in November
2014 will require insurance corporations to report quarterly their balance sheets from
May 2016, referring to data as at 2016Q1. The granularity and the expected quality of
these data will be comparable to balance sheet statistics of other types of financial
institutions collected under ECB Regulations, such as MFIs and investment funds. In
addition, annual data on premiums, claims and commissions will be reported. To limit the
reporting burden, the national central banks may use harmonized European supervisory
reports (“Solvency II”) to compile the statistics. The new statistics will be released for the
first time towards the end of 2016. They will replace the current, non-harmonized ECB
insurance corporations’ statistics, which will continue to be compiled until reference
period 2016Q2.



Harmonized granular credit data. This initiative aims to establish a long term framework
governing the collection of harmonized granular credit and credit risk data to support
many tasks of the ECB (and the ESCB), in particular monetary policy analysis and
operations, risk management, financial stability surveillance and macro-prudential policy.
Information will be provided by the Central Credit Registers, maintained by the NCBs or
similar granular statistical databases. First reporting is foreseen to take place in early
2018 focusing on credit granted to non-financial and financial corporations, and general
government.

7.
In 2014 the ECB set up the necessary structures and processes for collecting
statistics relating to supervisory tasks. A dedicated Supervisory Statistics Division was
established within the ECB’s Directorate General Statistics. The division’s work covers the
governance framework for the management of data from all supervised groups and individual
institutions, including the coordination, receipt, quality management and reconciliation of these
supervisory data. The entry into force of the EBA’s Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) on
supervisory reporting significantly increased the amount of comparable information. This
framework now includes additional data on forbearance and non-performing loans (with uniform
definitions), asset encumbrance, liquidity and leverage. In addition, the ECB published a decision
to remove identified supervisory data gaps, mainly related to financial information under national
accounting rules, rolling out from end-2015. Data collection follows a “sequential approach”
whereby banks submit their data to national supervisors, who then report to the ECB who in turn
disseminate selected data to stakeholders.
8.
Various components of the Survey on SME Access to Finance were reviewed. The
most recent survey included an ad hoc set of questions on collateral requirements, while the
regular questionnaire was enriched with additional questions on export intensity, interest rates
and sources of financing such as leasing and non-bank loans. The sample size was increased and
over 11,000 enterprises were interviewed in the euro area in the most recent survey round. In
cooperation with the European Commission, a larger version of the survey with an extended
questionnaire covering all countries in the European Union as well as neighboring countries, has
been conducted since 2013 on an annual basis (previously on a biennial basis). The next large
survey will be conducted between September and October 2015 and the results will be published
on 1st December 2015.
9.
The ECB supported the launch in November 2014 of the Special Data Dissemination
Standard plus, the third and highest tier of the IMF’s Data Standards Initiatives. Seven of
the eight countries in the first cluster of adherents to the Fund’s initiative were EU Member

The IMF Executive Board decided on December 22nd 20145 to change the interest
rate for the euro component of the SDR interest basket. The new rate is the three-month
spot rate derived from a yield curve based on euro area central government bonds with a rating
of AA and above, published daily by the ECB. It replaced the three-month Eurepo rate, following
the discontinuation of the Eurepo rate as of 31 December 2014.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 45

Statement by the Staff Representative on the Euro Area
July 24, 2015

This statement provides information that has become available since the issuance of the staff
report. The information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
The situation in Greece has been evolving rapidly. Since the issuance of the staff report, the
Greek parliament passed a package of reforms as the basis for starting negotiations on a new
ESM program. National parliaments in several euro area countries have endorsed these
reforms. With the approval of bridge financing by the European Council, Greece met a July
repayment to the ECB and cleared its arrears to the Fund. And the ECB last week increased
its cap on emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) to Greek banks.
Market developments have been broadly positive, returning asset prices to the levels prior to
the recent turbulence. Spreads on 10-year European sovereign bonds relative to the German
Bund have declined, while European equities—led by bank stocks—have gained. The
10-year German Bund yield has also fallen to under 0.8 percent, reflecting expectations of
continued sovereign asset purchases by the ECB. The euro is trading more than 3 percent
lower relative to the U.S. dollar, partly reflecting expectations of earlier U.S. policy rate
normalization.
The market reaction to both the initial deterioration and the subsequent improvement
suggests that new policy instruments such as QE, as well as a stronger banking union have
helped limit contagion. Nonetheless, further episodes of significant uncertainty and volatility
arising from the situation in Greece cannot be ruled out. As noted in the staff report,
policymakers should stand ready to deploy, and if necessary adapt, the full arsenal of
available instruments to manage spillovers. Beyond the near term, steps should be taken to
strengthen the monetary union and European firewalls. Fully severing bank-sovereign links
would require a common deposit insurance scheme with a fiscal backstop, a larger and fully
funded Single Resolution Fund, and easier access to direct bank recapitalization from the
ESM. Such additional risk-sharing should be supported by a stronger fiscal and structural
governance framework.

Statement by Menno Snel, Executive Director, on the Euro Area
July 24, 2015
In my capacity as President of EURIMF, I submit this Buff statement on the Article IV
consultation with the euro area. It reflects the common view of the Member States of the
euro area and the relevant European Union institutions in their respective fields of
competence.
The authorities of the euro area Member States and EU institutions are grateful for open
and fruitful consultations with staff and for their constructive policy advice.
The authorities are in broad agreement with staff findings and recommendations at the
current juncture and the focus on medium-term growth challenges. A reinforced policy
response to address the growth weakness is essential. Such a policy response needs to
address in a comprehensive way both demand and supply side factors and should focus
on the implementation of structural reforms, responsible and growth-friendly fiscal
policy, and stronger investment via the European Investment Plan. In particular,
structural reforms are needed not only to support the recovery in the short term and tackle
the legacies of the crisis in terms of high debt levels but also to boost medium-term
growth prospects, ensure social sustainability and decrease inequality.
Economic outlook, inflation and risks
The authorities broadly share staff's view on economic prospects. Supported by a number
of structural reforms and tailwinds, the economic recovery has been strengthening and is
expected to gain further momentum in 2015-16.
In the first quarter, real GDP increased by 0.4 percent (quarter-on-quarter), following an
expansion of the same size in the fourth quarter of 2014 and thereby registering the
highest 6-month growth rate since mid-2011. The favourable development reflects the
positive growth impact of a number of tailwinds, which include low oil prices, a lower
external value of the euro, and increased policy support, including the ECB’s nonstandard monetary policy measures. Moreover, the cyclical recovery is supported by
more durable factors such as the fruits of previously implemented reforms, in the context
of a broadly neutral fiscal stance. Looking ahead, tailwinds should remain strong enough
to mitigate the impact of a slightly weaker global growth outlook than earlier expected,
less dynamic global trade, and a possible future rebound in oil prices. According to the
Commission services' Spring 2015 forecast, real GDP should grow by 1.5 percent in 2015
and by 1.9 percent in 2016, with all domestic GDP components making positive
contributions in both years. This outlook is also broadly in line with staff's forecast,
which appears to remain slightly less optimistic for 2016 despite an upward revision in
the WEO update of 9 July. This is mainly due to a more pessimistic view on the staff’s
side on the rebound in investment in 2016. Accelerating economic activity should allow
for further improvements in labour market conditions, from which private consumption
will benefit. Increased demand and somewhat lower balance-sheet adjustment needs
should support greater investment, helping the economic recovery to become more
sustainable. Moreover, the Investment Plan for Europe should impact next year, lifting

both public and private investment. Exports too should benefit from the lagged
competitive impulse stemming from the depreciation of the euro. Finally, GDP growth
should continue benefitting from previously-implemented reforms and the lower fiscal
drag. The strength in GDP growth will, however, continue to be restrained for some time
by the impact of some adverse factors. These include high unemployment rates and still
on-going deleveraging needs in some countries as well as geopolitical tensions.
After inflation dynamics weakened at the turn of the year, dragging inflation below zero,
HICP inflation has moved up in the second quarter 2015. According to the Commission
services' Spring 2015 forecast, inflation should come in at 0.1 percent in 2015 and move
up to 1.5 percent in 2016 as the impact of the fall in oil prices fades, economic slack
diminishes, and the depreciation of the euro raises import prices. The staff's outlook for a
more moderate increase in inflation appears to reflect mainly the expected slower closing
of the output gap.
The staff’s assessment highlights that risks to the growth outlook are now more balanced
than in recent years, but refrains from assessing the overall balance. The authorities
regard this process as having brought overall risks by the time of their forecast releases
already into a broadly balanced position. Deflation risks have declined in response to the
ECB’s non-standard monetary policy and risks to the inflation outlook appear now
balanced.
The authorities share staff’s view that timely and effective policy responses are essential
to mitigate the near-term risks stemming from uncertainty surrounding Greece. While
direct spillovers through financial links are generally limited, the increased uncertainty
can have impact through indirect channels. The Member States as well as EU institutions
are determined to use all the available tools to address the possible spillovers to the rest
of the euro area. The implementation of proposals to strengthen the Economic and
Monetary Union, as set out in the June Five Presidents Report, will be important to
enhance the solidity and successful performance of the euro area as a currency union.
Supporting macro policies to boost demand


Monetary policy
The ECB’s monetary policy remains very supportive to the economic recovery. It
contributes to economic growth, a reduction in economic slack, and money and credit
expansion. The positive effects in financial markets are passed through to the cost and
availability of credit for firms and households. Combined monthly purchases under the
expanded asset purchase programme, amounting to €60 billion on average, are intended
to run until end-September 2016, and in any case until the ECB’s Governing Council
sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its aim of achieving
inflation rates below, but close to, 2 percent over the medium term. The ECB closely
monitors the situation in financial markets as well as its potential implications for the
monetary policy stance and for the outlook for price stability. If any factors were to lead
to an unwarranted tightening of monetary policy, or if the outlook for price stability were
to materially change, the ECB would respond to such a situation by using all the

instruments available within its mandate. To reap the full benefits of the latest monetary
policy measures, the contribution of other policy areas is decisive.


Financial stability
The authorities concur with the IMF's findings that over the past months financial
markets and institutions in Europe have overall further stabilised. The impact of revised
financial regulation in the EU and the start of operations of the SSM have been important
contributing elements to this development. The main risks to financial stability stem from
the eventuality of an abrupt reversal of global risk premia and weak profitability
prospects for banks and insurers. Furthermore, despite progress over recent years,
balance sheets of some financial institutions and some of their non-financial clients,
private or public, remain much leveraged. Non-bank financial institutions also deserve
close monitoring in order to defuse any emerging stability risk emanating from their part.



Fiscal policy
On the fiscal policy side, the authorities broadly agree with the Fund's assessment that the
current fiscal stance for the euro area is appropriate. Fiscal policies should reflect the
economic conditions and sustainability risks at Member State level, while ensuring a
good co-ordination of economic policies. One of the key policy challenges facing the
euro area is to reduce government debt by pursuing fiscal responsibility. Thanks to the
consolidation efforts of the past years, the euro area fiscal situation has improved but the
coordination of fiscal policies remains sub-optimal. A number of euro area Member
States still need to continue with fiscal adjustment to bring down very high levels of debt.
Other countries have more room for manoeuvre and could use it to encourage domestic
demand, with a particular emphasis on investment; along with structural reforms this
would support domestic growth and the euro area as a whole. Euro area Member States
will continue to closely monitor and discuss the aggregate fiscal situation of the euro area
including the fiscal stance. Furthermore, more efforts will be made to prioritise
investment and raise the quality of public expenditure as fiscal strategies are not yet
sufficiently growth-friendly. On the revenue side, despite increased coordination in the
Eurogroup, there is further scope for improving the efficiency of tax systems and
reducing the tax wedge on labour. On the expenditure side, more focus is needed on
public investment, backed by sound cost-benefit analysis, and other public expenditure
with strong and positive growth effects. Spending reviews have emphasised the need for
efficiency gains in public administration. Well-functioning national fiscal frameworks
will support this process.
The flexibility embedded in the Stability and Growth Pact rules allows Member States to
facilitate structural reforms and investment, while following the commonly agreed rules.
The Commission Communication on the use of the flexibility within the existing rules,
published in January 2015, provides clarifications on the way public investment and
structural reforms will be assessed under SGP rules. Contrary to what could be
understood from the staff’s report, it did not introduce any new elements concerning oneoffs. As stated in the January Communication, the eligibility conditions required to

benefit from the investment and/or the structural reform clause aim at safeguarding
against unsustainable deviations from MTOs. A distinction has to be made between the
two clauses as the investment clause is linked to the condition that the Member State
concerned is forecast to be in "economic bad times", while this condition does not apply
to the structural reform clause. These eligibility conditions do not prevent Member States
from using their fiscal capacity to engage in structural reform and investment. First, wellfinanced structural reforms and investments are more than encouraged and fully
compatible with the SGP. Second, ensuring that deviations from MTOs are only
temporary is a necessary condition for long-term fiscal sustainability, which in turn
guarantees future fiscal capacity of the Member State to invest and engage in structural
reforms.
On the windfall from lower interest payments, the authorities agree that notably countries
with high debt should use windfalls gains to make further progress to consolidate public
finances, while countries with low debt which are at or above their MTOs could use
windfalls to support structural reforms and increase public investment.


The Investment Plan for Europe
The authorities welcome staff's positive assessment of the Investment Plan for Europe in
general and of the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) in particular. As for
the EFSI, the authorities agree that careful project selection and swift implementation
will indeed be key to the initiative's success. At the EU level, all elements have been put
in place in order to ensure both. Importantly, projects will be selected by a committee of
independent experts, strictly on the basis of a project's merit. This governance structure,
complemented by a large but exhaustive list of strategic investments areas (e.g. energy,
infrastructure, resource efficiency) ensures that a good balance is found between a
market-based initiative and the rationale for public intervention. Importantly, several EU
Member States have already committed significant sums to contribute to the financing of
EFSI-supported projects, confirming the strong support for this approach and for
investment in general. As staff correctly points out, the EFSI's activities will need to be
complemented by further improvements of the EU's business environment going forward.
In addition to the EFSI, the so-called Third Pillar of the Investment Plan involves taking
actions both at EU and country level to unlock the full potential of investment in Europe
by removing barriers to investment and reinforcing the single market. Improving the
regulatory framework will contribute to its greater transparency and predictability, which
are of crucial importance in particular for long-term and large-scale investments such as
in infrastructure and cross-border investment. Among the priorities of the 2015 work
programme, the authorities and the EU Institutions are committed to develop the Capital
Market Union, to further deepen the Single Market for goods and services, to develop a
truly connected Digital Single Market and to make the most of the Single Market in
energy (Energy Union) and transport. This comes in addition to pursuing an enhanced
implementation of existing Internal Market rules, which is a shared responsibility of the
EU and the Member States.

Stronger bank balance sheet repair to support lending
The authorities would like to recall the efforts undertaken in the last years to strengthen
the banking sector, and highlight the landmark importance of the Comprehensive
Assessment completed since the last year’s consultation, prior to the entry into force of
the SSM. In a context of moderate growth and crisis legacies, they broadly concur with
staff’s views on the need to continue repairing bank balance sheets. Indeed, balance
sheets of many financial institutions, companies and households continue to be stretched.
Non-performing loans (NPLs) of banks remain very high particularly in some countries,
and have further risen in some cases. Addressing these high NPLs is a necessary, though
not sufficient, condition to support lending to the private sector and, thereby, growth and
jobs. Some of the euro area Member States, have already acquired good experience in
significantly and rather rapidly reducing NPLs, for example by setting up Asset
Management Companies.
The authorities would have to further explore how the incentives framework can be
strong enough for banks to address their NPLs and how solutions could be found,
considering also the applicable EU rules on state aids and on bank resolution (BRRD).
As rightly pointed out by the staff’s report, the legal, institutional and market framework
could also usefully be revisited in many Member States in order to support further and
quicker balance sheet repair of banks. This includes foreclosure and bankruptcy laws and
judicial procedures, markets for distressed loans and tax rules, as well as strengthened
prudential supervision. Progress on these fronts is being made in several Member States.
Regarding the Capital Market Union, the authorities would like to point out that
following the publication of the Commission’s Green Paper, an action plan is under
preparation. The objective is to set a single market for capital aimed at cost efficiency,
enhanced competition and diversification of funding sources. The emphasis has been put
in particular on: (1) SMEs, which are likely to be the most constrained by the absence of
a well-developed and integrated capital market, and (2) on the need to carefully
recalibrate the regulatory framework to enhance investment and access to finance. This is
badly needed to improve market-based risk sharing in the euro area and make our
economy more resilient to shocks.
Structural Reforms to boost productivity, employment and investment
In terms of structural reforms, the authorities agree that targeted and country-specific
policy action is needed. Structural reforms, both in labour and product markets, will play
a key role in the current context, not only to foster investment and boost employment and
potential growth, but also to support the rebalancing process by facilitating the
reallocation of resources between sectors, helping to regain competitiveness and
improving the business environment in several euro area Member States. While there are
encouraging signs showing that structural reforms are starting to bear fruit, the need to
accelerate structural reforms has been further stressed by the Commission in its May
2015 surveillance package in the context of the European Semester. With regard to this,

the Council has adopted country-specific recommendations (CSR) that provide countryspecific policy advice to the Member States.
Relevant reforms at national level cover a wide set of measures that aim to improve the
functioning of labour and product markets and the business environment by removing
barriers to financing and launching of investment projects, such as inefficient taxation
system, low transparency and efficiency of the public administration, barriers to access to
finance both for SMEs and for long-term projects, as well as more specific barriers to
investment in infrastructure (in energy, transport and broadband). Reinforcing the Single
Market will allow firms to operate on a bigger scale, thereby enhancing their capacity to
innovate, invest, become more productive and create jobs. Efforts to further deepen the
single market, notably for services, the digital economy and energy will play an
important role in upholding the reform momentum. The authorities strongly believe that
the ongoing recovery provides a window of opportunity to implement reforms that will
lift the economy on a more solid medium-term growth path.
Better economic governance in the euro area
Regarding governance issues, the authorities agree that there is need to reflect on how to
improve and streamline the surveillance system and, furthermore, complete the euro area
architecture. The Report on “Completing Europe’s Economic and Monetary Union”,
published in June under the personal authority of the Five Presidents, a result of
numerous consultations between the authorities and the EU Institutions, sets the stage for
the next steps on better economic governance in the euro area. It specifically recommends
accelerating the completion of the Banking Union and reinforce Europe's governance
framework to enhance convergence, competitiveness and stability.
The Five Presidents Report also mentioned the concept of benchmarking as an avenue to
pursue stronger economic convergence within the Economic and Monetary Union.
Regarding the use of outcome-based benchmarks for euro area-wide priorities in
structural reforms, as recommended in the staff assessment, the authorities would like to
signal that the approach would need to be studied further. On the one hand, outcomebased benchmarks could increase the specificity of the reform agenda, and improve
transparency and accountability in the application of the current framework. On the other
hand, identifying appropriate outcome-based benchmarks and finding indicators that meet
the requirements in terms of measurability and timeliness and also sufficiently correlate
with the final outcome desired by policymakers could be difficult.
