IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Haiti
On May 18, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the 2015 Article IV consultation1 with Haiti.
In December 2014, Haiti completed an arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF),
which helped to support economic growth and maintain macroeconomic stability after the 2010
earthquake. A drought that affected agricultural output slowed GDP growth to 2.7 percent in
FY2014 (from 4.2 percent in FY2013), but inflation remained in the mid-single digits. The
overall fiscal deficit of the central government remained high, in part due to one-off investment
related to the Sandy storm. International reserves remained appropriate at about 5 months of
imports.
The implementation of structural reforms to support growth underpins the medium-term outlook,
which is nonetheless subject to downside risks. GDP growth in FY2015 is expected to be
between 2–3 percent, and to increase to 3–4 percent in the medium term. Inflation is projected to
remain in the mid-single digits, and gross international reserves to be equivalent to between
4–5 months of imports, thanks to a prudent policy mix. Risks are mainly associated with a
rebound in international oil prices, a stop in external financing from Venezuela, and weather
events.
Executive Board Assessment2
Directors commended the authorities for maintaining macroeconomic stability in the aftermath
of the 2010 earthquake—noting positive growth, moderate inflation, adequate international
reserves, and an improvement in Haiti’s debt assessment. Nevertheless, growth remains
insufficient to reduce poverty significantly, and vulnerabilities remain against the backdrop of a
challenging domestic and external environment. Directors agreed that the authorities’ new
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

program appropriately focuses on entrenching macroeconomic stability, and ambitious structural
reforms to enhance competitiveness, spur inclusive growth and strengthen policy buffers. They
stressed that strong ownership and well-coordinated donor support will be important for the
success of the program.
Directors welcomed the approval of a revised FY2015 budget consistent with reducing the
deficit of the non-financial public sector to about 2½ percent of GDP over the medium term, in
line with debt sustainability and program objectives. They supported the front-loaded fiscal
consolidation, and noted that the adoption of an automatic fuel price mechanism and measures to
improve the performance of the electricity sector will help contain fiscal risks, and create space
for increased priority social and investment spending. They stressed the importance of mitigating
the impact of the reforms on the poor and vulnerable. Going forward, Directors encouraged the
authorities to follow through on reforms to improve public financial management, including the
implementation of the Treasury Single Account; and to strengthen tax administration and
collection; and budgetary transparency.
Directors encouraged the authorities to maintain a tight monetary stance, as needed, until the
fiscal deficit is reduced, and to be ready to increase exchange rate flexibility, in order to preserve
adequate international reserve buffers and anchor inflationary expectations. A number of
Directors expressed concern that, if downside risks materialize, meeting the target for Net
International Reserves could be challenging. Directors took note of the contingency measures
that may need to be implemented in such case. Directors also encouraged the authorities to
strengthen the monetary policy framework, through improvements in reserve management and
the functioning of the foreign exchange market.
Directors noted that the banking sector remains well-capitalized and profitable, while calling for
continued vigilance against financial sector risks. They also stressed the importance of sustained
efforts to further develop financial intermediation and inclusion. In this regard, they welcomed
adoption of the new financial inclusion strategy, and encouraged the authorities to enact pending
laws on financial cooperatives and microfinance institutions.
Directors supported the program’s emphasis on structural reforms designed to lift Haiti’s growth
potential and enhance its competitiveness. Priorities include: improvements to property rights,
credit access and labor productivity; streamlining business regulations; and infrastructure
development—most notably by strengthening the governance and performance of the electricity
sector.
Directors encouraged the authorities to improve the quality of the economic data, with technical
assistance from the Fund and other donors.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Approves Three-Year US$69.7 Million Under ECF for Haiti
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Monday approved a threeyear SDR 49.14 million (about US$69.7 million, 60 percent of quota) arrangement under the
Extended Credit Facility (ECF) for Haiti. The approval enables the immediate disbursement
of an amount equivalent to SDR 7.02 million (about US$10 million), while the remaining
amount will be phased over the duration of the arrangement, subject to semi-annual program
reviews.
The authorities’ ECF-supported program aims to raise Haiti’s growth potential and reduce
vulnerabilities to shocks, while entrenching macroeconomic stability.
Following the Executive Board’s discussion on Haiti, Mr. Min Zhu, Deputy Managing
Director, and Acting Chair, made the following statement:
“Haiti’s pursuit of macroeconomic stability in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake is
commendable—growth has been positive, inflation has remained moderate, and international
reserve levels adequate. Going forward, continued efforts are needed to support sustained and
inclusive growth, strengthen institutions and the policy framework, and maintain adequate
buffers to absorb shocks.
“The new three-year program supported by the Fund’s Extended Credit Facility (ECF) seeks
to entrench macroeconomic stability, improve competitiveness to spur inclusive growth, and
preserve buffers, through streamlined policies that have full country ownership. Donor
support ensures the full financing of the program.
“The program targets a reduction of the non-financial public sector deficit from 7.5 percent
in FY2014 to 3.25 percent of GDP in FY2015 and 2.5 percent in the medium term to
preserve sustainability. Lower oil prices will facilitate fiscal consolidation (allowing the
government to raise fuel taxes and lower electricity subsidies), while preserving pro-poor
spending. The adoption of an automatic fuel pricing mechanism will safeguard fuel taxes if
oil prices rebound.

2

“The program aims to preserve price stability. Accordingly, the monetary policy stance will
remain tight as needed until fiscal consolidation proceeds to anchor exchange rate
expectations. The policy mix seeks to keep international reserves at an appropriate level to
ensure adequate buffers.
“The program’s structural reform agenda focuses on strengthening competitiveness to foster
growth. It tackles deep-seated problems in the electricity sector; supports the authorities’
efforts to strengthen property rights; and includes actions to increase policy effectiveness
through reforms in tax administration, tax policy and public financial management, as well as
improvements in the monetary framework and economic statistics.”
ANNEX
Recent Economic Developments
In December 2014, Haiti completed the arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility
(ECF), which helped support positive economic growth and maintain macroeconomic
stability after the 2010 earthquake. However, while per capita growth has been positive, it
has been insufficient to significantly reduce poverty. Fiscal and external deficits rose to high
levels, increasing Haiti’s vulnerabilities. Due partly to a difficult socio-political environment,
progress on structural reform was limited.
Main Program Objectives
The program aims at entrenching macroeconomic stability and at deepening structural
reforms, to support sustained and shared growth. The program seeks to maintain buffers in
the form of foreign reserves and bank deposits to reduce Haiti’s vulnerability to shocks, and
to avoid stop-and-go policies. Real GDP is projected to growth by 3-4 percent over the
medium term helped by the implementation of structural and institutional reforms addressing
bottlenecks to growth and job creation, including improvements in the business environment
and property rights, financial inclusion, and access to available and cheap electricity.
Inflation is expected to be contained in the mid-single digits, reflecting prudent fiscal and
monetary policies, while gross international reserves would cover more than 4.5 months of
imports.
Fiscal policy aims at placing public debt on a sustainable path and preserving buffers against
downside risks. It targets a reduction in the deficit of the non financial public sector to 2.5
percent of GDP in the medium term, while preserving poverty-reducing spending. Fiscal
consolidation will result from the elimination of regressive fuel subsidies, the adjustment of
investment spending to sustainable levels, and the reduction of quasi-fiscal losses in the
electricity sector. In this regard, the revised FY2015 budget includes a strong fiscal
adjustment that takes advantage of the low international oil prices. To prevent a reemergence
of fuel subsidies if international prices rebound, the authorities have adopted an automatic
pricing mechanism for petroleum products, which will reflect international oil prices into
domestic fuel prices, while protecting the most vulnerable.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION AND
REQUEST FOR A THREE-YEAR ARRANGEMENT UNDER THE
EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITY

KEY ISSUES
Background. Haiti’s recently completed arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF)
helped to maintain macroeconomic stability after the 2010 earthquake. While Haiti has seen
four consecutive years of growth, reducing poverty requires higher and sustained growth rates.
Article IV Discussions. Discussions focused on strategies to improve Haiti’s growth potential
and external competiveness, as well as how to leverage the current period of low international
oil prices to reduce Haiti’s vulnerabilities, particularly in the energy sector. These challenges
must be overcome in order to sustain strong economic growth and achieve progress in poverty
reduction.
The Proposed Program. The authorities’ economic program, anchored on the Strategic Plan
for the Development of Haiti (PSDH), aims to entrench stability through a front-loaded fiscal
adjustment, deepen institutional reform, mitigate vulnerabilities, and support growth and
employment. QPCs now include a limit on the deficit of the non-financial public sector.
Structural benchmarks focus on reducing subsidies, improving PFM and expenditure
effectiveness, and creating an enabling environment for growth. The program focuses on:

Lowering fiscal deficits while preserving poverty-reducing spending. This would crowd in
private credit, preserve buffers, and support the use of the exchange rate as a nominal anchor.

Removing bottlenecks to growth and job creation with improvements in the business
environment and property rights, and access to cheaper and reliable electricity.

Improving the policy framework by addressing governance issues, strengthening
budgetary transparency, the public investment management and the monetary policy
framework.
Request for an ECF Arrangement. The Haitian authorities request a three-year arrangement
under the ECF in an amount equivalent to SDR 49.14 million (60 percent of quota) in support of
their medium-term economic reform program.
Risks. Risks to the program include the complex political situation, which could delay
implementation of reforms, a rebound in international petroleum prices, a sudden stop in
external financing from Venezuela, and weather events.

HAITI AND THE FUND, 2006–2014
Reflecting Haiti’s challenging environment over the past ten years, the two previous Fund-supported
arrangements focused on maintaining macroeconomic stability, rebuilding capacity and strengthening
the policy framework.
1.
Fund-supported programs with Haiti since 2006 focused on maintaining
macroeconomic stability and supporting growth and poverty reduction in a difficult
environment. Haiti’s 2006 program took place in the aftermath of a period of severe political
instability, and the 2010 ECF arrangement was approved after a devastating earthquake. Reform
efforts were supported by debt relief under the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC),
the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), in 2009, and the Post Catastrophe Debt Relief Trust
(PCDR), in 2010. Given urgent reconstruction needs, the 2010-2014 Fund arrangement
accommodated an ambitious public investment agenda, and anti-poverty spending.
2.
In the 2012 Article IV discussions, the authorities were encouraged to maintain
macroeconomic stability while redoubling reform efforts to achieve sustained and inclusive
growth. Directors called for improved revenue administration to create fiscal space for pro-poor
and growth-enhancing spending, as well as public financial management reforms to improve the
quality of public spending. Directors stressed that strong and inclusive growth would require
structural reforms to improve competitiveness. They identified improving financial intermediation,
addressing infrastructure bottlenecks, notably in the electricity sector, and improving the business
environment as key reform priorities.
3.
The recent Ex-post assessment of Haiti’s longer-term program engagement (EPA)
highlighted both achievements and disappointments of Haiti’s previous Fund engagement.
The EPA noted that the authorities had been successful in maintaining macroeconomic stability.
Monetary policy contained inflation in the mid-single digits, and the authorities avoided excessive
exchange rate volatility while maintaining an appropriate reserve cushion. GDP growth, while
positive and favorable compared with Haiti’s recent history, was lower than projected and
insufficient to reduce poverty. Financed by concessional flows, fiscal and external deficits rose to
unsustainable levels, increasing Haiti’s vulnerabilities. Progress on structural reform was also mixed,
with ongoing problems at the state electricity utility (EDH), slower-than-projected progress in
adopting the Treasury Single Account (TSA), and legislative delays in modernizing the legal
framework for the financial sector. The EPA observed limited progress in improving Haiti’s business
climate, governance, and competitiveness.

CONTEXT: LOW GROWTH AMID CONTINUED
VULNERABILITY
Aid-financed reconstruction following the 2010 earthquake proceeded, but growth was lower than expected.
Fiscal deficits increased, mainly financed by Petrocaribe flows, which are decreasing sharply in FY2015.
Inflation remains contained, given moderate exchange rate depreciation. The political situation adds to
risks. Oil price decreases should be used to improve energy policies and reduce fiscal vulnerabilities.

a drought. Excluding the volatile agricultural sector, growth
has been steady at about 4 percent since FY2011, supported
by construction, industry and services. While Haiti has seen
progress in meeting its Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs, Box 1), per capita income growth since 2010 has not

governance, lack of competition and predatory business practices, inadequate policy frameworks,
weak donor coordination, vulnerability to natural disasters, inadequate infrastructure, and still-low
labor productivity. A difficult socio-political environment slowed implementation of structural
reforms.
6.
Fiscal and current account deficits widened with increased Petrocaribe flows and
diminished buffers. The central government deficit increased to 6–7 percent of GDP during
FY2013–FY2014, raising the current account deficit. Financing came from Petrocaribe inflows (which
averaged 4 percent of GDP during FY2009–FY2014), and by diminished fiscal and external buffers (in
the form of government deposits at the banking system and international reserves) during
FY2013–FY2014. External public debt (which had fallen to 9 percent of GDP in FY2011 following HIPC
completion point and the debt write-offs after the earthquake), rebounded to 21 percent of GDP in
FY2014, almost exclusively due to Venezuela-related Petrocaribe concessional financing. Domestic
public debt is around 4 percent in FY2014, reflecting shallow domestic financial markets.

Haiti has made progress towards achieving a number of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
The proportion of people living under extreme poverty dropped to about 25 percent, while the number of
underweight children under 5 years old was halved. Net enrollment in primary education grew from 47
percent in 1993 to 88 percent, attaining gender parity in primary and secondary education. Haiti also made
progress in health indicators. Infant and child mortality has decreased drastically since 1990, while access to
maternal healthcare improved and maternal mortality was reduced. Haiti has also contained the spread of
HIV/AIDS, and nearly 65 percent of households now have improved access to water (see table).

Despite progress, vast challenges remain, due to low capacity, insufficient resources and difficulties
to coordinate key stakeholders (including donors). Strengthening safety nets, while increasing spending
in health and education, remain key priorities and mobilizing donor support remains essential. Continued
migration from rural areas to urban centers creates challenges. Vulnerability to epidemics remains high. The
government’s goal is to reduce poverty and achieve free universal education through the implementation of
various social programs such as the Ede Pep (Help the People), and the PSUGO (Programme de Scolarisation
Universelle Gratuite et Obligatoire). The Strategic Plan for the Development of Haiti (PSDH) launched in May
2012, aims at speeding up poverty reduction and making Haiti an emerging country by 2030. These efforts
signal the country’s ongoing commitment beyond 2015.

that is subject to multiple and frequent shocks. See Selected Issues Paper “External Buffers and Competitiveness to

MEDIUM-TERM CHALLENGES: INCREASE GROWTH
AND PRESERVE BUFFERS TO ADDRESS RISKS
Article IV discussions focused on reforms and policies to: strengthen competitiveness to spur sustained
and inclusive growth in the context of lower external support; safeguard macroeconomic stability by
preserving fiscal and external buffers; and strengthen the policy framework to address vulnerabilities.

A. Structural Reforms for Sustained and Inclusive Economic Growth
9.
Sustained growth is essential for poverty reduction and social cohesion. Given the
tapering of aid, staff argued that the impetus to growth needs to come from structural reforms and
institutional strengthening. Lower oil prices, if sustained, will also support growth. Potential growth

Caribbean Community and Common Market,

region.6 Staff and the authorities agreed that the main constraints to competitiveness include:

6



Weak institutions. Weak property rights constrain the real estate market, foreign
investment, access to credit, and efficient agriculture (which provides the basic
livelihood to most Haitians).7 Predatory practices are widespread. Lack of transparency
in government contracting has resulted in, e.g., unfavorable conditions for electricity
supply, high electricity costs, and hidden costs in the structure of fuel pump prices
(Box 3).8 A still-large U.N. force continues to ensure security.



Domestic Politics. Political crises caused severe decreases in the level of per-capita
income during the last 30 years (Box 2). Accordingly, the yield for growth of
maintaining political peace would be significant.

See accompanying Selected Issues Paper “Opportunities and Challenges for Growth.”

Haiti is ranked 147th (out of 148 countries) in property rights in the World Economic Forum’s “Global
Competitiveness Index” for 2014.

Haiti is ranked 166th (out of 177 countries) in the 2014 “Corruption Perceptions Index” by Transparency
International.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

HAITI



Inadequate infrastructure. Port services and electricity supply are inefficient and
expensive, and road infrastructure is deficient to keep the country fully integrated. 9



The policy framework needs strengthening. Fiscal policy implementation is
constrained by the lack of an integrated framework. A number of small taxes result in
informational and operational costs to investors. Administrative formalities for
enterprise creation add costs.



Low labor productivity. Access to healthcare and technical education is limited,
restricting human capital formation, and social infrastructure is the worst in LAC. These
factors constrain investment.



Data quality. Data provision has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper
surveillance. Most affected are the national accounts and labor indicators. Fiscal and
external sector data are broadly adequate, but need improvements in coverage and
timeliness. Collection, production and distribution of economic data were seriously
affected by the 2010 earthquake. This deprives policy-makers and the private sector
alike of access to timely and accurate information about the economy, including
potential opportunities.

10.
Staff argued Haiti’s real effective exchange rate (REER) level is broadly appropriate,
but that further appreciation may constrain competitiveness, and thus, that the gourde
should remain flexible to respond to changes in fundamentals. The REER drifted slowly upwards
since 2010, as exchange rate depreciation has been moderate and inflation, while well-contained,
has been higher than in Haiti’s main trading partners. Staff analysis suggests that the moderate
upward movement in the REER reflects both strong aid and remittance inflows, as well as a
significant improvement in the net foreign asset position following substantial post-earthquake debt
relief.10 Haiti’s exchange system (a crawl-like arrrangement, with no significant restrictions for capital
movements) remains unchanged since the 2012 Article IV consultation.11
11.
Staff highlighted that Haiti’s low competitiveness would be best addressed by
removing structural bottlenecks to growth. These range from a lack of basic public services, a
cumbersome legal and regulatory environment, to political uncertainty and weak governance. The
authorities added that a sharp change in the nominal exchange rate would raise inflation and fuel
social pressures without appreciably improving competitiveness, and underscored the need to
diversify Haiti’s productive and export base.
9

Haiti is ranked 177th (out of 189 countries) on the World Bank’s “Doing Business” indicators for 2015. As pointed out
in an independent evaluation of the Doing Business survey (see www.worldbank.org/ieg/doingbusiness), care should
be exercised when interpreting these indicators given their, at times, subjective nature, limited coverage of business
constraints, and a small sample, which taken together tend to overstate the indicators' coverage and explanatory
power.

10

See Selected Issues Paper “External Buffers and Competitiveness to Absorb Shocks And Support Growth.”

11

Thus, as in the last Article IV consultation, Haiti’s system is free from restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions.

B. Preserving Macroeconomic Stability and Reducing Vulnerabilities
12.
Preserving macroeconomic stability is a prerequisite for growth. Staff and the
authorities agreed that a low and stable rate of inflation underpinned by moderate exchange rate
depreciation and a sustainable fiscal position should contribute to anchoring investors’ expectations.
They concurred that maintaining adequate financial buffers is essential to support Haiti’s resilience
in the face of shocks, and avoid stop-and-go growth dynamics.

(i) Rebuilding fiscal space and strengthening the quality of fiscal policy
13.
Staff and the authorities agreed on the need to cut the central government’s deficit to
preserve buffers. This is also needed given expected reductions in available concessional financing
between FY2014 and FY2018. External grants and Petrocaribe inflows are each projected to decline
by 2 percent of GDP (as earthquake rebuilding winds down and on lower oil prices, respectively).
Staff argued that in view of the limited domestic financing prospects, the need to preserve fiscal
buffers (in the form of deposits at the banking sector), and to contain fiscal risks, the central
government deficit should be reduced from 6¼ percent of GDP in FY2014 to about 2 percent GDP
in FY2018. Haiti’s risk of debt distress has improved on the back of expected fiscal consolidation, but
importantly, is based on a projection of significantly lower oil prices in the medium term. A rebound
in oil prices, however, could result in the risk of debt distress to become high again (see Debt
Sustainability Analysis, DSA).12 The authorities agreed on the need to cut the deficit to preserve
macroeconomic stability, but underlined the need for donors to support the adjustment by keeping
a steady flow of budgetary and project grants. Staff stressed that lower fiscal deficits will allow a
gradual loosening of monetary policy and crowd in bank credit to the private sector.
14.
Staff and the authorities also agreed on the importance of reining in EDH’s deficit. The
decrease in international oil prices reduces EDH’s deficit by 0.5 percent of GDP in FY2015, given
lower generation costs, and unchanged tariffs. The authorities explained that the latter will be
adjusted only after an analysis of their structure. They further explained that EDH management
presented a revised FY2015 budget with an action plan to increase cash recovery based on
improved billing and collection from larger clients. The Ministry of Public Works (which oversees
EDH) has selected Electricité de France (EDF) to develop a master plan for the sector, with World
Bank financing.
15.
Domestic revenue should be increased. Staff noted that Haiti’s revenue-to-GDP ratio is
low by regional standards, in part due to forgone fuel tax revenues. Staff urged the authorities to
take advantage of the decline in international oil prices to eliminate remaining fuel subsidies, which
should yield 1.5–1.6 percent of GDP in FY2015. The authorities agreed, and highlighted that they

12

The DSA also shows that Haiti’s external debt profile remains vulnerable to shocks to borrowing conditions and the
exchange rate, while shocks to growth have a negative impact on public debt. The cost of a sudden stop of
Petrocaribe financing would be lower than previously assessed provided oil prices evolve as projected.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

HAITI

had resisted pressures for large decreases in pump fuel prices. Staff further argued that multi-year
investment in improving revenue administration (notably by strengthening the large and medium
tax payers’ offices and the unit in charge of NGOs and exempted entities), should allow domestic
revenue to increase to 15.5 percent of GDP by FY2019. Staff stressed that the elimination of several
low-yield taxes will improve clarity of the tax code, and that work towards VAT implementation and
a new mining code should continue. The authorities noted that work in these areas is ongoing, with
help from donors, including the IMF.
16.
Staff and the authorities concurred on the need to strengthen the fiscal policy
framework with a view to improving the quality and composition of public spending.
Strengthening the public investment framework (including the preparation, evaluation, and
monitoring of projects) will decrease ineffective spending. Advancing the implementation of the
Treasury Single Account (TSA) will improve cash and debt management and control over fiscal
policy. The authorities explained that they have made significant progress in both areas with help by
the World Bank and the IMF. Staff urged the authorities to develop a more targeted and sustainable
social safety net. Eliminating blanket subsidies and reorienting them to poverty-reducing outlays
(such as education and health) will build social cohesion and improve human capital. 13 The decrease
of transfers to EDH should create fiscal space for priority expenditures, including on health,
education, and a fully-staffed national police, in view of the expected decrease in MINUSTAH forces.
The authorities agreed that the decrease in EDH transfers will create space for priority expenditure
including for the national police, health expenditures, and education spending under the PSUGO

public transportation.
17.
Staff urged the authorities to strengthen fiscal transparency. Staff stressed that budget
documents should report special accounts and programs, civil service pensions and future pension
liabilities, earmarked resources for municipalities, financial transactions with SOEs (including
contingent liabilities) and all Petrocaribe-funded transactions. 14 The authorities explained that only
central government–related transactions can be included in the national budget, and that all
Petrocaribe-funded transactions (with the exception of those related to EDH) are already included in
the budget.

(ii) Strengthening the monetary policy framework and the soundness of
the financial sector
18.
Staff and the authorities concurred that monetary policy should be geared at keeping
a low and stable inflation rate. Given high pass-through rates, this will require both moderate
exchange rate depreciation, and well-anchored exchange rate depreciation expectations. This is only
possible if the REER is close to equilibrium, and if the expected path for the fiscal deficit is consistent
with keeping international reserves at 4–5 months of prospective imports (i.e., sufficient for credible

market intervention). 15 Staff stressed that foreign exchange market intervention should also reduce
excess volatility. Staff argued that if fiscal consolidation falters, the BRH should allow for more
exchange rate flexibility, as the depletion of buffers can negatively impact expectations and reduce
the room to react in the face of shocks. Staff cautioned that unanchored expectations may result in a
decrease in gourde demand amid increasing volatility and higher dollarization. Strengthening the
communication of monetary policy decisions will assist in managing expectations.
19.
Staff urged the BRH to keep the stance of monetary policy tight until the fiscal deficit
is reduced. High legal reserve requirements have reduced excess reserves, strengthening the
transmission from open market operations (OMOs) to credit growth. Using OMOs for any further
tightening should then be preferred to further increases in legal reserve requirements as this will
help improving the functioning of the interbank money market and strengthening the transmission
mechanism. BRH authorities indicated that this is indeed the instrument that it was used to tighten
the monetary stance since mid-2014. Staff also encouraged the BRH to consider using 5-year
government bonds acquired at end-FY2014 when conducting OMOs. Staff urged the BRH to avoid
the use of exceptions in the computation of reserve

Staff noted that there is room to further improve BRH operations. Reserve management
needs strengthening, in line with the 2011 safeguards recommendations and IMF technical
assistance. Developing a deeper foreign exchange market would improve monetary policy
effectiveness, as would an enhanced framework for foreign exchange intervention. Timely access to
information would help improve real-time monetary policy decision-making. The authorities
welcomed IMF technical assistance on reserve management, stressing that revised investment
guidelines and a more appropriate benchmark could help achieve the BRH’s objective of securing a
positive real return on its reserve portfolio without compromising capital preservation and liquidity
objectives. They also highlighted the efforts to continue developing the interbank foreign exchange
market to reduce unnecessary exchange rate volatility.

Box 2. Haiti: GDP Growth Projections under the ECF arrangement
Average per-capita GDP growth in Haiti in the past three decades has been negative. Per capita GDP
growth in the thirty years through 2014 was -1 percent. This situates Haiti in the bottom 5th percentile when
compared with a range of country groups (including countries of all levels of development, low-income
countries (LICs), and non-resource rich LICs, see Table). This compares with a median per capita GDP growth
rate of about 1.4 percent for all LICs and 1.2 percent for non-resource rich LICs.1
Political instability, weather and terms of trade shocks produced a number of stop-and-go growth
episodes. Although both headline and per-capita GDP growth were positive during non-crisis years, this
performance did not offset the negative impact on per-capita income levels, after political crisis. While
natural disasters continue to affect Haiti (as agriculture is about 20 percent of GDP), GDP per capita has
recovered after those. Standard growth accounting exercises suggest that total factor productivity (TFP)
growth was somewhat positive in non-crisis years, but extremely negative during crisis years (see Chart).
The macroeconomic framework of the ECF-supported program is underpinned by ambitious, yet
achievable, per capita GDP growth rates. Concretely,

Accordingly, baseline GDP growth rates are the result of

to still-high public investment), and a low (but positive) TFP contribution. Stronger progress in structural
reforms could yield larger increases in TFP. Relatively large TFP increases have been observed in LICs that
significantly improved their policy performance.

The banking sector remains well-capitalized and profitable, but some sectors may
come under pressure as the post-earthquake relief effort winds down. Staff noted that
commercial bank credit remains concentrated mainly in commerce and non-tradable sectors. In
particular, the service sector expanded after the earthquake (including hotels and restaurants, mainly
in the capital Port-au-Prince) to respond to the increased demand that originated in the
international relief effort. As this effort winds down, demand may decrease and thus the service
sector may come under pressure. In this regard, staff recommended the implementation of periodic
stress testing to spot risks. The authorities noted that financial soundness is safeguarded through
periodic on-site and off-site inspections, but would consider stress tests. They explained that they
have allowed banks to renegotiate loans to non-tradable sectors to provide time for such sectors to
adjust to the demand plateau. Staff cautioned that the use of such renegotiations should be
monitored, to assess the effect on capital ratios, and that banks should be ready to withhold
dividends or inject new capital if needed. BRH authorities concurred. The authorities stressed that
the adoption (in late 2013) of the anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism
(AML/CFT) law addressed a number of the recommendations by the Caribbean Financial Action Task
Force (CFATF), but cautioned that remaining reforms (including reforms to the penal code) will need
parliament approval.
22.
Staff argued that low access to credit is a constraint to growth. Staff argued that deeper
financial intermediation would support inclusive growth. Intermediation can be increased by
strengthening property rights and competition among financial institutions. The authorities
highlighted their new financial inclusion strategy, developed in consultation with the World Bank,
and noted that recent reforms such as the establishment of a credit bureau will result in reliable
information about the credit-worthiness of individuals and businesses. The authorities explained that
they intend to resume efforts to enact pending laws on financial cooperatives and on microfinance
institutions, and stressed that data collection in this sector has improved.

A NEW ECF ARRANGEMENT: LIFTING BOTTLENECKS
TO GROWTH AND ENTRENCHING MACROECONOMIC
STABILITY
In line with the Ex-Post Assessment (EPA) recommendations and the medium-term challenges facing
Haiti identified in the Article IV discussions, the new program seeks to entrench macroeconomic
stability and promote inclusive growth and sustained poverty reduction, through streamlined policies
and actions that are fully owned by the authorities.
23.
The previous ECF-supported program aimed at accommodating post-earthquake
reconstruction spending, maintaining macroeconomic stability, and advancing structural
reforms. Facing enormous reconstruction challenges, the program made room for absorbing large
external flows, while keeping a moderate and stable rate of inflation. Reforms were mainly
addressed at improving the policy framework and rebuilding capacity.

24.
As post-earthquake assistance tapers off, the new ECF-supported program aims at
lifting bottlenecks to growth, strengthening the policy framework, entrenching
macroeconomic stability and preserving buffers to avoid stop-and-go growth dynamics.
Sustainable fiscal deficits will allow preserving external buffers equivalent to 4–5 months of
prospective imports, essential to absorb shocks that could derail growth. Adequate buffers will also
contribute to anchor expectations and keep inflation in the mid-single digits. PFM reforms will
strengthen the effectiveness of fiscal policy. Improving EDH’s performance will tackle a source of
vulnerability while improving competitiveness. Progress in implementing a reliable cadastre will
support investment and growth, while efforts at financial deepening should make growth more
inclusive.

A. Entrenching Macroeconomic Stability and Containing Risks
25.
The macroeconomic
framework of the ECF-supported
program is underpinned by
achievable GDP growth rates (MEFP
¶10–11). GDP growth is projected at
2–3 percent in FY2015, and should
pick up to 3–4 percent in the medium
term as structural reforms proceed
(Box 2). Growth will be underpinned
by remittance-driven consumption,
construction, a growing textile
industry, and will be supported by
lower oil prices. Inflation is projected
to remain in the mid-single digits,
due to a prudent policy mix. The
current account deficit is projected to
remain under 4 percent of GDP
through FY2017, reflecting lower oil
prices and fiscal consolidation.

Risks to the baseline GDP growth projections are tilted to the downside.


Domestic politics. The complex political situation poses challenges for policy
implementation, and for anchoring expectations.



Oil prices. The decline in oil prices is a positive terms of trade shock; oil prices remain,
however, highly volatile. The risk of a stop in Petrocaribe financing has increased, and
this could result in lower GDP growth of about 1 percentage point.



Donor fatigue. Aid inflows are decreasing as earthquake rebuilding winds down.
Slower aid flows (including due to political stress) are a downside risk.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

HAITI



Weather events. Weather shocks and natural disasters are responsible for stop-and-go
dynamics and combined with low response capacity and institutional weaknesses
prevent the accumulation of capital. Agriculture (over 20 percent of GDP), is particularly
vulnerable to weather events.



U.S. growth. The U.S. is Haiti’s largest export market and the main source of
remittances (20 percent of GDP). Higher U.S. growth constitutes an upside risk.

Some wages were previously classified under transfers.



The program for FY2015. In March 2015, the central government adopted (as a prior
action) a revised FY2015 budget consistent with a deficit of 2.7 percent of GDP, that
includes allocations for elections and street lighting, a (warranted) reclassification of
current transfers into wages, and a reduction of capital spending towards more
sustainable levels, in line with the large decline in Petrocaribe financing. Central
Government revenue will increase to 14.7 percent of GDP, given the elimination of fuel
subsidies and the lock-in of windfall revenue from the declining oil prices. Grants will
decline by 0.4 percent of GDP (with budget support expected from the IDB and the
European Union). Current spending will remain broadly stable, as wage bill increases (of
1 percent of GDP, given the reclassification of transfers and increases for teachers and
the national police), will be offset by reductions in transfers, including to the electricity
sector. Investment will decline, as one-off post-Sandy emergency spending concludes
and only ongoing projects receive budgetary financing. In addition, EDH’s board
adopted (as a prior action) a revised budget for FY2015 with savings of about
0.7 percent of GDP. Savings will come from reductions in production costs, a more
rational utilization of available supply, and improvements in billing and collection at
unchanged tariffs.



The program for FY2016–FY2018. The FY2016 budgets for the central government
and EDH will be adopted before end-September 2015 in line with an NFPS deficit of

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

HAITI

2.3 percent of GDP (structural benchmark). Savings will mainly come from additional
efforts at rationalizing domestically-financed investment and additional gains from EDH
reforms. The NFPS deficit will decline to 2.2 percent of GDP by FY2018 (Central
Government deficit of 2 percent and EDH deficit -after transfers- of 0.2 percent). To
control current spending, net recruitments are only expected in the social and security
sectors. Wages will not be indexed, and increases will not surpass inflation.


Risk Management. A disruption of Petrocaribe flows would create a financing gap of
about 1 percent of GDP in FY2015 and of 2 percent of GDP in FY2016 relative to
program projections. Additional donor financing and temporary drawdown of deposits
and reserves could offset half of the gap this and next fiscal year. The authorities
explained that no new Petrocaribe-financed projects will be initiated, and that they have
identified projects that can be implemented more slowly should the need arise. Thus, in
case of a stop, the authorities stressed that the spending pace will be adjusted to
absorb the shock. The authorities argued that the adoption (as a prior action), and the
implementation before end-FY2015 (as a continuous structural benchmark) of an
automatic mechanism for oil products to reflect international prices should contain
fiscal risks derived from a rebound in international oil prices (Box 3).

28.
The monetary program under the ECF-supported program is geared at achieving a
moderate and stable inflation while preserving a credible reserve buffer (MEFP ¶13–14). The
program will target international reserves at 4–5 months of prospective imports and ensure no
monetary financing of the fiscal deficit.


The program for FY2015. After a decline in NIR of about US$100 million during the
first half of FY2015 (as the BRH accommodated the payment of debt to government
suppliers at end-FY2014, but also due to increased dollar hoarding by the private sector
responding to the political cycle), NIR are programmed to decline by at most
US$50 million in the second half of FY2015. The additional decrease will come from the
use of government deposits to partially absorb the strong decline in Petrocaribe flows,
but also from an expected increase in deposit dollarization until the election cycle
concludes. Given the importance of a credible reserve buffer to anchor expectations,
increased exchange rate flexibility will be needed to meet the NIR target in case
exchange rate pressures are higher than expected.

Box 3. Haiti: An Automatic Pricing Mechanism
Fuel prices in Haiti are similar to those in Caribbean and Sub Saharan African countries. Retail prices at
end-2014 were somewhat higher than the average for Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), developing Asia,
and the (heavily subsidized) prices in the Middle East and North Africa, but significantly lower than the average
for advanced economies (see chart). The small gap that existed with the LAC average was, however, closed after
pump price decreases last February.
The price structure for fuel products suffers from some shortcomings including a lack of transparency.
The base imported prices used in the price structure are not those in invoices paid by importers (based on
Platt’s), but rather the “Caribbean posting” quotes, a benchmark that includes insurance and other costs in
addition to the base price for refined oil products. This results in the double counting of some costs within the
price structure. The gap between actual import prices and the “Caribbean posting” quotes is positive, and has
increased since April 2014 (see chart). This gap is transferred to private sector importers, including for payment
of storage costs which are not explicitly shown in the price structure.1 These transfers have increased in the last
12 months.

The authorities will implement an automatic pricing mechanism (APM) to protect fiscal revenues from
fluctuations in international oil prices. Fuel prices were fixed during March 2011–October 2014. The price
freeze implied that taxes were adjusted to keep pump prices fixed. As international oil prices increased (and the
gourde depreciated), implicit fuel taxes declined and the gap with fuel prices in the region increased (e.g., in
June 2014, pump prices in Haiti were, on average, about 30 percent lower than in the Dominican Republic,
where retail prices move broadly in tandem with international prices). In the context of the ECF, the authorities
committed to implementing an APM before the end of FY2015. This will ensure that international prices are
passed-through into domestic retail prices, preserving fiscal revenues and providing the right signal for resource
allocation. It will also depoliticize fuel price adjustments and anchor expectations about the causes of price
changes. The APM will include a smoothing mechanism to prevent sharp increases in domestic prices in
response to international price hikes. This mechanism will allow for additional (forgone) revenues of up to
G 1 billion (0.2 percent of GDP). However, international prices will be fully passed-through (upwards or
downwards), whenever additional (forgone) revenues reach G 1 billion in absolute terms. The authorities also
committed to revise the price structure so it reflects actual imported prices and all costs in the value chain.
The authorities are also planning to implement well targeted mitigating measures. This is in line with best
practice. In this regard, in a number of countries the elimination of fuel subsidies was accompanied by the
introduction of a social tariff for public transportation (e.g. in the Dominican Republic, Paraguay, Nicaragua and
Panama). The authorities have requested assistance from the World Bank to design such a system. The planned
fiscal cost of this direct subsidy (0.2–0.3 percent of GDP) is minor when compared with the cost of blanket
subsidies in FY2014 (about 2 percent).
1/ The importers are in charge of storing the products they contract through private companies. Installed storage capacity is
estimated at 365,000 barrels, which is the equivalent of three weeks of national consumption.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

HAITI



The program for FY2016–FY2017. As the fiscal adjustment proceeds and the electoral
cycle comes to an end, NIR are programmed to rebound as dollarization is gradually
reduced and dollar hoarding declines. Over the medium-term, fiscal consolidation will
permit a gradual loosening of monetary policy and a crowding in of private sector
credit, without unwarranted pressures on international reserves. Monetary financing of
the government will be limited to a drawdown of Post-Catastrophe Debt Relief (PCDR)
resources. This will ensure that international reserves and government deposits at the
BRH are at levels appropriate to serve as cushions against a possible disruption in
Petrocaribe and other shocks.

B. Structural Reforms to Support Growth and the Policy Framework
29.
Structural reforms will focus on removing constraints to growth and completing fiscal
and financial sector reforms under way. Actions will be focused and streamlined, in line with EPA
recommendations. Their timing will be guided by capacity constraints and the ongoing TA agenda.
30.
Growth and social cohesion (MEFP ¶17–22). Actions will target lifting basic constraints to
growth in areas of IMF expertise.

17



Energy sector. Strengthening EDH’s financial position will reduce fiscal risks and allow
a gradual increase of supply. Accordingly, the main stakeholders in the electricity sector
are preparing a work program to be reflected in a protocol for the sector (structural
benchmark).17 The protocol includes provisions to improve governance, strengthen
performance, provide timely information for decision-making, and consolidate crossarrears.18 The authorities will audit the largest clients to boost billing and collection
(structural benchmark). The adoption and implementation of an automatic pricing
mechanism for domestic fuel products (to reflect international prices) will improve
efficiency and prevent blanket subsidies (prior action and continuous structural
benchmark).19



Property rights. Strengthening property rights will boost Haiti’s growth potential.
Transferable property rights will support private domestic and foreign investment,
facilitate access to credit by allowing the use of land as collateral, and can be a valuable
input to broadening the tax base. A modern cadastre system would improve Haiti’s
resilience to natural disasters, as stronger property rights would encourage investments
in structural improvements. In line with their ongoing work-program, the interministerial commission on land management will prepare an action plan for

This effort is supported by the World Bank and the IDB.

18

While IPPs have a creditor position vis-à-vis EDH,for the provision of electricity, the central government has a
creditor position vis-à-vis IPPs for the provision of fuel. Consolidating these arrears will bring clarity to the financial
position of the sector’s stakeholders.

19

Efficiency will also increase due to the gradual harmonization of custom duties across products.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

HAITI

FY2016–FY2017 to strengthen the legal framework and functioning of the cadastre
(structural benchmark).20


Access to credit. A fully-functioning credit bureau will help strengthen access to credit
by providing a tool to assess creditworthiness. Regular reporting by financial
institutions to the bureau is a crucial first step, but the authorities should allow
potential first-time borrowers to build a credit history by incorporating other indicators
of creditworthiness into the database, such as proof of utilities payment. The non-bank
financial sector (insurance companies, cooperatives, and microfinance) should be
further developed, as should new financial instruments such as leasing. 21



Poverty Reduction. The authorities will build on the progress in the MDG framework
by targeting consistent increases in domestically-financed spending on education,
health, and agriculture (indicative target).



Data quality. In the near term, the authorities will prioritize the introduction of an
overall quarterly economic index to serve as a leading indicator of GDP growth
(currently presented only on a yearly basis). With technical assistance from the IMF and
from France, the authorities will revamp national accounts, including the change of the
base year. The authorities have also completed a household survey, the results of which
will be crucial in improving estimates of poverty and poverty reduction as well on the
labor force. The authorities will also address data gaps in the external accounts, and will
request IMF technical assistance to this end.

31.
Fiscal Reforms (MEFP ¶23–27). Actions were drawn from the Public Finance Reform Strategy
adopted last year, and will focus on strengthening tax policy and administration, improving public
financial management, enhancing expenditure effectiveness, and creating an enabling environment
for the private sector.


Tax policy. A working group in charge of producing a draft of the tax code will be
appointed by end-July 2015 (structural benchmark). This group will also assess the
elimination of a number of small taxes with low yield and high costs, and the adoption
of a mining code and of a full-fledged VAT system. The IMF will provide technical
assistance in analyzing tax expenditures



Tax administration. Actions will focus on restructuring and deepening taxpayer
segmentation. Registration and audit of new potential taxpayers (identified with IMF
support), the transfer of files of medium taxpayers from the LTO and local tax offices to

the MTO (structural benchmark), and strengthening the unit in charge of NGOs and
exempted entities will increase compliance. Strengthening IT tax management will
improve country-wide monitoring of tax payer filings. Reforms at customs
administration will contain tax exemptions, the fight against smuggling and the
communication of information from the Automated System for Customs Data
(ASYCUDA) to the tax department for auditing purposes (structural benchmark)


Public financial management. Work on the TSA will continue, including the
conversion of spending accounts into Treasury sub-accounts and of specific revenue
accounts into secondary accounts; and the establishment of all remaining accounting
centers by end-September 2015 (structural benchmark). To this end, the government
has implemented the terms of a December 2014 memorandum placing all public
accounts at the BRH under the control of public accountants, a measure also to be
applied by the state-owned bank BNC (prior action). Actions to strengthen cash and
debt management will complement this work. The authorities will make their best effort
so that the draft laws on the reorganization of the ministry of finance and on public
debt are adopted following the election of a new parliament. To ensure respect of the
budgetary process, the government has tightened modalities for the clearance of offbudget commitments (continuous structural benchmark). Improving the effectiveness
of public investment will help upgrade infrastructure and reduce costs for the private
sector. In the medium-term, the expansion of the TSA to the rest of the NFPS will help
improve the coverage of public sector finances.

32.
Monetary and financial sector reforms (MEFP ¶28–31). The ECF-supported program
targets regulatory and supervisory enhancements and reforms to improve the monetary policy
framework, promote financing deepening, and support inclusive growth.


Reserve management. Actions to improve the BRH’s reserve management framework
will include better documentation of reserve management decisions and better
alignment of portfolio management decisions to internal guidelines, in line with IMF
technical assistance recommendations. The authorities will prepare periodic reports on
the liquidity of gross reserves, and will quantify the BRH’s three goals in managing its
reserve portfolio (capital preservation, liquidity, and return). The authorities will refine
the investment guidelines and benchmarks agreed with external managers to ensure
conformity with the BRH’s objectives.



Foreign exchange market. Actions in this area will include improving the reporting of
transactions, beginning single-price foreign exchange auctions, setting up an electronic
platform for FX transactions, and establishing an interbank market for foreign exchange
with an increased number of participants.



Safeguards. Actions will be geared at strengthening the investment committee’s
autonomy from investment operations, appointing a compliance officer to provide

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

HAITI

independent oversight of foreign reserves policy and investment guidelines, and
achieving full adoption of IFRS.22


Banking supervision and AML/CFT. The authorities will request IMF technical
assistance on stress testing, with a view of implementing them on a regular basis to
identify risks. The authorities will implement remaining CFTAF recommendations on
AML/CFT, and implement the 2012 Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standard, with a
view to improve governance and address tax evasion.

C. Program Modalities and Access
33.
It is proposed that Haiti’s program be supported by an arrangement under the Fund’s
Extended Credit Facility (ECF). Staff proposes a 3-year arrangement with access of 60 percent of
quota divided in seven equal tranches, with disbursements subject to semi-annual reviews with test
dates in March and September.23 Proposed access would ensure that international reserves remain
close to their appropriate value for a country exposed to large and frequent shocks like Haiti. Debt
service to the Fund would remain manageable. Staff considers Fund support essential for the
successful implementation of Haiti’s economic program, including because of its catalytic effect on
the provision of budget support from multilateral donors, thus ensuring that the program is fully
financed. As set out in the protocol for the electricity sector, the authorities are making good faith
efforts in resolving EDH’s arrears.
34.
Performance will be monitored through quantitative performance criteria and
indicative targets (MEFP ¶32). Performance criteria will include: (i) a ceiling on net central bank
credit to the non-financial public sector; (ii) a ceiling on net domestic assets of the central bank;
(iii) a floor on net international reserves of the central bank; (iv) a ceiling on the deficit of the nonfinancial public sector; and (v) a ceiling on domestic financing of the central government.
Continuous performance criteria will include: zero ceilings on (i) the accumulation of public sector
external arrears; and (ii) the contracting or guaranteeing of non-concessional debt. An indicative
floor will be set for domestically-financed poverty-reducing expenditure.
35.
Staff recommends the establishment of a committee dedicated to monitoring
implementation of reforms under the ECF-supported program. The authorities decided that the
Secretary of State for Finance lead this committee; that it include representatives from the BRH, EDH,
and Budget, Treasury and Economic Studies Directorates at the Ministry of Finance; and that it work
closely with the Fund Resident Representative. This should result in better communication between
the Fund and the authorities, and ensure that consultations are undertaken in matters related to the
ECF-supported program.

22

IMF safeguards policy requires an update safeguards assessment to be completed no later than the first review
under the new ECF arrangement.

23

This reflects Haiti’s fiscal year (October –September).

STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
Since the 2012 Article IV Consultation, Haiti has continued to successfully maintain
macroeconomic stability. The authorities have navigated the surge, and subsequent decline, in
financial flows following the devastating earthquake, and have carried out significant reconstruction
while maintaining buffers and avoiding high inflation. International reserves remain appropriate, and
the country has seen the longest stretch of growth in per capita income since the mid-1980s.
37.
Raising Haiti’s growth rate requires deep-seated structural reforms to improve
competitiveness. While Haiti’s recent growth record is positive when compared with its recent
history, it has fallen short of expectations and is insufficient to rapidly reduce poverty. Raising Haiti’s
growth rate (to 3 – 4 percent in the medium term) will require addressing structural bottlenecks to
growth and job creation with improvements in the business environment and property rights, and
access to cheaper and reliable electricity. The development of secure and transferable land property
rights through a functioning cadastre system is a key reform that would support investment and
unlock financing. Financial inclusion should be pursued, including via a credit bureau and the
promotion of credit cooperatives and microfinance institutions.
38.
The appropriate policy mix for FY2015 includes a fiscal adjustment and an unchanged
monetary policy stance. The fiscal deficit (that rose to 6–7 percent of GDP over the past two years),
needs to be reined in to about 3¼ percent of GDP, in part due to the strong decline in Petrocaribe
flows, and the need to preserve buffers. The authorities have appropriately taken advantage of the
decrease in oil prices to eliminate foregone revenues related with fuel taxes, while the adoption of
an automatic price mechanism for oil products should address the fiscal risks associated with a
rebound of oil prices. While part of the necessary adjustment reflects a return to sustainable levels
of investment spending and improvements in revenue collection, the poor performance of the
electricity sector must be addressed, as it has been a key driver of fiscal imbalances. The monetary
policy stance is appropriately tight, and should remain unchanged until fiscal consolidation
proceeds. Fiscal consolidation will support the use of the exchange rate as a nominal anchor. The
central bank should be prepared to increase exchange rate flexibility to ensure that international
reserve buffers remain appropriate if fiscal consolidation falters.
39.
The policy framework needs further improvement. The electoral impasse has delayed the
legislative reform agenda, and clearing the backlog of draft laws should be a top priority after a new
parliament is elected later this year. Public financial management should continue to be improved,
including via the final establishment of a TSA. Enhancing budgetary transparency should also be a
key priority, and the central bank should continue to develop its reserve management framework
and improve the functioning of the foreign exchange market. Improving the quality of economic
data is essential, given serious shortcomings that hamper surveillance.
40.
The new ECF-supported program seeks to entrench macroeconomic stability, address
sources of vulnerabilities, and promote growth. These objectives will be achieved through
streamlined policies and actions that are fully owned by the authorities. They have the commitment

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

HAITI

and capacity to implement the proposed set of policies aimed at correcting external imbalances and
enabling repayment to the Fund. 24 In this regard, the program seeks to address the main sources of
vulnerability identified by the Ex-Post Assessment (EPA), and also highlighted in the Article IV
discussions.
41.
The ECF-supported program will be geared at ensuring fiscal sustainability, while
preserving poverty-reducing spending. The revised budget for FY2015 is an appropriate response
to existing constraints and preserves fiscal buffers, which are essential to face unanticipated shocks.
The deficit target (of around 2½ percent of GDP) through the medium-term is consistent with
ensuring fiscal sustainability. By targeting the deficit of the non-financial public sector, the ECFsupported program appropriately covers all sources of fiscal vulnerability, in particular the stateowned electricity utility (EDH). The program seeks to lock-in the fiscal gains created by the current
low oil price environment. In this regard, the adoption of an automatic fuel pricing mechanism will
help protect revenue against oil price shocks. The design of a targeted social tariff for public
transport will mitigate the impact of fuel price volatility on the population.
42.
The new program will support the authorities’ efforts to ensure that inflation remains
moderate and stable, and inflation expectations well-anchored. The BRH will keep the stance of
monetary policy tight, as needed, until the fiscal deficit is reduced, and will avoid the use of
exceptions in the computation of reserve requirements. Increasing exchange rate flexibility is
warranted to maintain adequate international reserves while ensuring that the real exchange rate is
close to equilibrium. Fiscal consolidation and improved communication on monetary policy should
help in managing expectations.
43.
Structural reforms under the program aim at supporting sustained economic growth
and reducing Haiti’s vulnerabilities, in line with Article IV and EPA recommendations.
Reducing fuel subsidies and improving tax administration will provide needed fiscal space for
spending in education and health, while PFM reforms, particularly the implementation of the TSA,
will strengthen the framework for fiscal policy. Increasing the effectiveness of public investment will
help improve infrastructure and reduce costs for the private sector. Gradual progress with a land
cadastre will unlock investment and improve investor perceptions. While initial steps at reining in
the financial situation of EDH (including through the signing of a protocol for the sector) are
welcome, the work with other development partners (including the World Bank and IDB) to improve
billing and collection should be deepened. A financially viable electricity sector will attract
investment, and result in increases in supply and lower generation costs. The positive spillovers to
productivity, reduction of vulnerabilities, and poverty reduction would be substantial.
44.
Staff supports the authorities’ request for Fund assistance under the ECF in an amount
equivalent to 60 percent of quota. The ECF will contribute to maintaining an appropriate level of
international reserves, and thus to anchoring expectations. The front loaded fiscal adjustment and

Accordingly, the proposed ECF meets the UCT conditionality standard, as required by Fund policy.

the implementation of prior actions are indicative of the authorities’ determination to maintain
macroeconomic stability and mitigate existing risks.

It is proposed that the next Article IV Consultation with Haiti take place on the
24-month cycle, subject to the decision on consultation cycles.25

Appendix I. Letter of Intent
May 4, 2015

Mme. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C.
Mme. Managing Director:

1.
Over the past five years, Haiti has implemented macroeconomic policies that have helped
maintain macroeconomic stability while recovering from the impact of the 2010 earthquake and
advance key structural reforms. These policies were supported by an arrangement under the
IMF’s Extended Credit Facility (ECF). We are now determined to move to a new phase, reinforcing
these gains while undertaking new efforts to boost Haiti’s growth potential and significantly
increase the living standards of the Haitian people. Our ultimate goal is to transform Haiti into
an emerging economy by 2030, which will require entrenching macroeconomic stability while
improving Haiti’s infrastructure and boosting foreign and domestic private investment. We
believe that the policies implemented to date and the program outlined in the attached
memorandum provide a sound basis for our request for a new ECF arrangement.
2.
The new program (May 2015–May 2018) for which we are requesting support under a
new ECF will provide a macroeconomic anchor and a framework for necessary medium-term
reforms. The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) outlines the
first-year and medium-term objectives of our program. We are determined to further strengthen
domestic revenue to sustain domestic investment in the face of declining external assistance and
to increase the effectiveness of poverty-reducing expenditures. We will also continue to
strengthen public financial management, building on the establishment of the Treasury Single
Account, while addressing bottlenecks to private investment and higher growth, notably in the
electricity sector.
3.
The three-year period covered by the program offers a unique opportunity to reinforce
the gains Haiti has made since the earthquake and to pursue new reforms to deliver sustained
and inclusive growth over the medium-term. Doing so would facilitate rapid progress in the
fight against poverty. Our program thus redirects resources previously devoted to fuel subsidies
to protecting the most vulnerable, and supporting productive investment. We also plan a wide
range of measures to boost Haiti’s growth potential, from land tenure reform to promoting
domestic industry.
4.
As the recent Ex Post Assessment of Longer-Term Fund Engagement in Haiti highlights,
there is consensus within Haitian society on the need to maintain macroeconomic stability and to

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

45

HAITI

implement necessary reforms to promote better governance and strong and sustainable growth.
In this regard, we will continue to work with our international partners. In particular, the
authorities believe that implementing a new IMF-supported program will demonstrate Haiti’s
commitment to sound economic policies.
5.
In order to facilitate the implementation of our program and reduce remaining balance
of payments vulnerabilities, the Government of Haiti requests assistance under the IMF’s ECF in
an amount equivalent to SDR 49.14 million, or 60 percent of quota, to be disbursed in seven
equal tranches over three years. Approval of this request would result in an immediate
disbursement of SDR 7.02 million. A first review of the program would be completed no later
than December 31, 2015, and a second review by June 30, 2016.
6.
We believe that the policies set forth in the attached MEFP are sufficient to achieve the
goals set forth in our program, but we stand ready to undertake further measures as needed. We
will consult with the Fund on the adoption of such measures, and in advance of any revision to
the policies contained in the MEFP, in accordance with the Fund’s policies. In particular, the
authorities and Fund staff will discuss (including during program reviews), on any unexpected
developments that could affect the economic program to jointly analyze their impact and best
courses of action, without compromising the program’s objectives. We intend to provide timely
information necessary for monitoring economic developments and the implementation of
policies defined in the program, as agreed under the attached Technical Memorandum of
Understanding, or upon request.

Sincerely yours,
/s/

Governor, Central Bank of Haiti

Attachment 1. Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies for
2015–2018
Introduction
1.
Following the devastating earthquake of 2010, the government of Haiti implemented in
2010–2014 an economic and financial program supported by the IMF under the Extend Credit
Facility (ECF). Policies taken over the past several years, together with support from Haiti’s
development partners, helped assure macroeconomic stability, advance key structural reforms,
and pursue the objectives of our Poverty Reduction Strategy (the Strategic Plan for the
Development of Haiti, PSDH). To consolidate this progress and to address remaining obstacles to
strong and sustained growth, the government has prepared a new medium-term economic
program for 2015–2018.
2.
This Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) presents recent
developments and performance as well as economic and structural policies of Haiti’s mediumterm program for which we are requesting IMF support under a new three-year ECF
arrangement.
3.
Under the new ECF-supported program, the government’s overarching objective is to
boost Haiti’s long-term growth potential, allowing for continuous progress in poverty reduction.
In addition to maintaining macroeconomic stability, this will require addressing barriers to
domestic and foreign investment, supporting private sector development, and raising adequate
domestic revenue while improving public financial management. In face of declining aid, a
broader tax base and an efficient execution of public spending help address Haiti’s crucial
infrastructure gaps and as well as its pressing social spending needs. We recognize that the
electricity sector in particular has been both a key bottleneck to growth and a significant fiscal
drain, and will prioritize reducing its deficit and improving its performance under the new ECFsupported program.
Taking Stock of the Last ECF arrangement
4.
Haiti’s previous arrangement with the Fund was approved in the context of a catastrophic
earthquake that caused massive loss of life and economic damage. However, the earthquake
also triggered a huge increase in aid flows, as well as debt relief from Haiti’s international
partners, including from the IMF under the Post-Catastrophe Debt Relief (PCDR) Trust.
5.
The key achievement under the previous program was maintaining macroeconomic
stability and a return to growth despite severe shocks, including a cholera epidemic and the
impact of Hurricane Sandy. Fuelled by reconstruction spending and a surge in remittances from
Haitians living abroad, growth has been steady since 2011. Inflation was contained in the midsingle digits, aided by a prudent monetary policy that limited exchange rate volatility and
increased reserve buffers. Taking advantage of technical assistance from the IMF and other

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

47

HAITI

partners, there was also progress on structural reforms, notably in revenue administration and in
completing the first steps towards a Treasury Single Account (TSA).
6.
Nevertheless, there is much that remains to be done. Economic growth, while higher than
in Haiti’s recent history, was significantly lower than projected and insufficient to rapidly reduce
poverty. Public investment was also lower than projected, and remained dependent on foreign
grants and Petrocaribe financing. The fiscal deficit in FY2013 and FY2014 increased to
unsustainable levels, in particular due to onerous energy subsidies that cost US$ 350–450 million
per year. These were driven by pump prices that were fixed in nominal gourde terms from March
2011 until October 2014, and by large transfers to the loss-making Electricité d’Haïti (EDH).
External public debt rebounded and exceeded 20 percent of GDP by end FY2014. Finally, while
monetary policy was successful in anchoring inflation expectations, access to credit remains low
and concentrated in a few sectors.
7.
Progress on the structural reform was steady but slow, given capacity and other
constraints. Large (LTO) and medium (MTO) taxpayer offices were established, but tax
compliance and enforcement should be further improved to broaden the tax base. There were
some delays in proceeding towards adoption of the TSA, but the basic infrastructure was
established in FY2014, and the accounting centers were made operational for the largest
ministries. Other structural reforms, including in tax policy, financial sector regulation, and on
public debt management proceeded only slowly.
Recent Economic Developments
8.
Haiti achieved its fourth consecutive year of real per capita growth in FY2014. Growth
was lower than expected at about 2.7 percent versus 4.2 percent in FY2013, due in large part to a
drought in some areas of the country. Excluding the volatile agricultural sector growth, growth
has been steady at about 4 percent in recent years, supported by construction, industry and
services. Inflation continued to be well-contained, ending FY2014 at 5.3 percent despite lower
agricultural production. The current account deficit was still large at over 6 percent of GDP in
FY2014, but financing from Venezuela under the Petrocaribe Agreement helped Haiti preserve an
adequate reserve buffer.
9.
The fiscal deficit in FY2014 was unsustainably high, with the energy sector contributing
around US$ 450 million to a deficit that exceeded 7 percent of GDP. Wage increases to teachers
and the police will have a full-year effect in FY2015. Investment increased to historic highs, in
particular due to capital spending related to Hurricane Sandy. The fiscal deficit was financed
mainly by Petrocaribe resources, and a larger-than programmed drawdown on government
deposits, as the domestic market for treasury bills remains shallow. Monetary policy remained
focused on maintaining price stability and adequate international reserve buffers. The gourde
depreciated moderately during FY2014, helping keep inflation expectations anchored, despite
reduced intervention in the exchange rate market. However, private sector credit growth
decelerated to 11.2 percent during FY 2014, with credit in gourdes increasing only by 5.2 percent,
reflecting more binding liquidity constraints but also barriers to broader access to credit.

Macroeconomic Framework for FY2015–FY2018
10.
Economic growth (as measured by GDP) is projected to remain in the 2–3 percent range
in FY2015, on a slowdown in public and private investment, although remittances would continue
to support domestic consumption. Risks are on the downside given ongoing weakness in
agricultural production. Inflation is projected to remain in the mid-single digits in FY2015, as
prudent monetary policy, helped by a decrease in the fiscal deficit, should ensure moderate
exchange rate depreciation. The fall in international oil prices should contribute to contain
inflation, despite continued weakness in domestic agricultural production. For FY2016–FY2018,
GDP growth is expected to average about 3.5 percent, while inflation is projected to remain in
the mid-single digits.
11.
The external current account deficit should decline to the 3 percent of GDP range in
FY2015, given the positive impact of international oil price declines in the oil bill. Financing of the
current account deficit, however, would likewise decrease as Petrocaribe flows (which are tied to
the oil bill) will fall by more than US$200 million. For FY2016–FY2018, the current account deficit
is expected to widen somewhat towards 4 percent of GDP, as international oil prices are
expected to gradually increase in the medium-term.
12.
The revised budget for FY2015 will significantly reduce the fiscal deficit. The deficit of the
non-financial public sector (NFPS, program definition) should decrease to about 3.2 percent of
GDP (from 7.4 percent of GDP in FY2014). Petroleum-taxes will add 1.5 percent of GDP more to
revenues, as fuel subsidies are eliminated, while improvement in tax and customs administration
should help enhance fiscal revenues. Accordingly, domestic revenues should reach 14.7 percent
of GDP (2.2 percent of GDP more than in FY2014). Public spending is projected to decline relative
to FY2014. The wage bill (for teachers and police) will increase, while spending on goods and
services will reflect the cost of elections. Transfers to the electricity sector will be contained.
Capital spending will decrease to 10.9 percent of GDP, a more sustainable level. Financing from
Petrocaribe will fall sharply, and thus, budget financing will mainly come from domestic sources,
including drawing down government deposits. Budget support from the IDB and the European
Union is expected at US$70 million, and the authorities have requested budget support from the
World Bank. The NFPS deficit for FY2016-FY2018 will be further reduced (to 2.3 percent of GDP
on average), so to ensure that public debt remains sustainable. The ECF-supported program
includes adjusters to ensure fiscal and external debt sustainability in case of changes in expected
external financing.
13.
Monetary policy in FY2015 remains focused on containing inflation in the mid-single
digits. Exchange rate pressures increased somewhat early in the fiscal year following a decision to
allow certain Treasury bonds placed in the banking system to count towards reserve
requirements. This loosening in the monetary policy stance occurred together with a strong
reduction in the fiscal deficit, allowing banks to moderately expand credit to the private sector.
During FY2016–FY2018, the BRH will continue focused in its core mission of anchoring inflation
expectations while maintaining an adequate level of foreign reserves. The BRH is aware that Haiti
will continue to be exposed to a wide range of risks, ranging from a decrease in external
financing to a reversal in the terms of trade, and thus it is crucial to maintain a comfortable

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

49

HAITI

reserve cushion of around 5 months of imports. The BRH will intervene to smooth exchange rate
movements originated in temporary factors. The authorities stress that continued budget
support from Haiti’s development partners is essential to keep exchange rate depreciation
expectations well-anchored.
14.
The central bank is working to improve the transmission of monetary policy. To this end,
the BRH is analyzing the possibility of issuing dollar-indexed bills directly to the public to absorb
liquidity and to reduce foreign-exchange market pressures; the BRH is aware that issuing such
bills is only possible in a context where the fiscal deficit is sustainable. The monetary authorities
also are committed to reduce obstacles to financial inclusion, including through the operation of
a new credit bureau to better document borrower creditworthiness.
Economic and Financial Policies for FY2015-FY2018
15.
The PSDH and its three-year investment program will serve as a reference for economic
and financial policies. The PSDH intends to transform Haiti into an emerging country by 2030,
and is based on four pillars. The first is a territorial refoundation, which involves making better
use of, and protection of, Haiti’s land. Land management, urban planning, electrification, and
environmental protection all fall within this pillar. The second pillar is economic refoundation,
which targets policies intended to spur foreign and domestic investment in Haiti’s most
competitive sectors, particularly manufacturing and tourism, but also in the agricultural sector, in
order to spur formal employment. The third pillar of social refoundation targets modern health
and education networks accessible to all Haitians, as well as policies of social inclusion and
gender equality. The final pillar, institutional refoundation, foresees an overhaul of the legal
framework as well as boosting public administration, an independent judiciary, and decentralized
government entities.
16.
The authorities’ challenge for the coming years is two-fold: first, to achieve fiscal
sustainability while maintaining the ability to meet urgent spending needs; and second, to unlock
Haiti’s growth potential and reduce extreme poverty. To meet this dual challenge, the
government intends to implement a program that: (i) removes bottlenecks to growth; (ii)
strengthens the framework for fiscal policy; and (iii) implements financial and monetary reforms
to improve the policy framework and facilitate access to credit.

A.

Removing Bottlenecks to Growth

17.
While Haiti has achieved four consecutive years of economic growth during the previous
Fund-supported arrangement, it has not been sufficient to rapidly reduce poverty. Going
forward, strong and sustained growth will require deep-seated structural reforms, particularly
given ongoing declines in aid flows. As the PSDH establishes, growth-supporting policies must
be economically, environmentally, and socially sustainable.
18.
To help ensure that growth is inclusive, and to combat extreme poverty, the government
will continue to prioritize social expenditures in its budget process and will look to streamline the
categories covered under poverty-reducing expenditures. An appropriate level of social
expenditures would also promote economic growth by developing a human capital through a

50

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

HAITI

more educated workforce, improve efficiencies at many small farms, and boost productivity by
expanding access to healthcare.
19.
Improving infrastructure, in particular the operation of the electricity sector, and
expanding access to credit, are fundamental to enhancing Haiti’s growth potential. Strengthening
the regulatory framework of the energy sector should result in better governance and increased
transparency and attract investment to the sector. Other reforms, notably improving the
efficiency and reducing the cost of port services, would likewise spur growth.
20.
Strengthening property rights, including through the establishment of a modern
cadastre, would produce enormous growth dividends. Securing transferable property rights
would increase incentives to private domestic and foreign investment, which are now often
delayed by uncertainties and disputes over ownership of the underlying land. The impact would
be felt across the entire economy, from facilitating the construction of new factories to
promoting more efficient farming techniques. The ability to use land as collateral would also
greatly facilitate access to credit, which is now effectively denied to the large majority of Haitians,
and would promote the development of a mortgage market. A modern cadastre system would
improve Haiti’s resilience to natural disasters, as stronger property rights would encourage
investments in structural improvements. Accordingly, the inter-ministerial commission on land
management will share with IMF staff by end-February 2016 an agreed action plan for
FY2016–FY2017 to strengthen the legal framework and functioning of the cadastre (structural
benchmark).
21.
Promoting formal sector employment is a key goal of the program, as formal jobs are
likely to be better paid and offer greater opportunities than those in the informal sector
(including in commerce and agriculture) which currently employs most Haitians. The PSDH
identifies two sectors in particular, manufacturing and tourism, as being aligned with Haiti’s
comparative advantages. The trade preferences offered by the United States under the
HELP/HOPE Acts offer Haiti unparalleled access to the U.S. textile market, and the government
will both encourage development of this sector and work to ensure that these preferences are
extended. The tourism sector also holds great potential, due both to Haiti’s beautiful location in
the heart of the Caribbean but also due to the natural warmth and friendliness of its people.
Attracting more visitors will require steady improvements in infrastructure and security, both of
which would be served by a broader revenue base and by improving the quality of public
expenditures.
22.
Many experienced and dedicated civil servants lost their lives in the 2010 earthquake,
which proved to be a major blow in the collection and distribution of economic data. This has an
impact on growth not only because it deprives policy-makers access to timely and accurate
information about the state and direction of the economy, but because private sector actors are
less likely to be able to identify and act on potential economic opportunities. We therefore
commit to work with the Fund and other technical assistance partners to improve the quality of
the national, labor, and external accounts over the course of the program. Key short-term
objectives include the introduction a headline economic activity indicator to serve as a reliable

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

51

HAITI

leading indicator for economic growth, and to modernize the national accounts, including by
updating the base year.

B.

Strengthening the Framework for Fiscal Policy

23.
We will implement sustainable fiscal policies and maintain buffers to cushion against
potential shocks. Fiscal sustainability is crucial to macroeconomic stability, as excessive deficits
stoke exchange rate depreciation pressures and higher inflation, while crowding out credit to the
private sector, reducing Haiti’s growth potential. Haiti’s vulnerability to a wide range of shocks,
including a potential reduction of external financing flows or a rebound in international oil prices,
require the maintenance of buffers, including in the form of international reserves and
government deposits in the banking sector as insurance against downside risks. According, we
adopted a revised budget for the central government for FY2015 consistent with a deficit of at
most G13.5 billion (prior action). Lower fiscal deficits would also allow a gradual loosening of
monetary policy and crowd in private sector credit. Particular efforts will be made to target
quality expenditures with high impact on growth and poverty reduction. The authorities trust
that the international community will provide additional financial support for the implementation
of high return investments, which are essential to achieve a balanced growth path. The stronger
fiscal position will be accompanied by a strengthening of public financial management as we are
determined to implementing a wide range of reforms in this area, drawing on the Public Finance
Reform Strategy adopted in 2013. The clearance of obligations arising from off-budget CG
commitments will be made only after a thorough analysis of supporting documentation and
proper budgeting (continuous structural benchmark).
24.
Achieving fiscal sustainability will require preventing a reemergence of fuel price
subsidies. In this regard the government has adopted an automatic fuel price adjustment
mechanism by end-April (prior action), which will begin implementation as of end-June 2015 as
described in paragraphs 34 and 36 of the TMU (structural benchmark). The automatic
mechanism, based on international practices, will help protect public finances. Accordingly, the
implementation of this mechanism will be complemented by direct subsidies to public
transportation (at a cost of about 0.3 percent of GDP), that will allow to smooth the effect of fuel
price volatility on urban public transportation tariffs. In addition, the authorities are drafting a
new regulatory framework for the fuel sector, which reviews the price structure for refined
products at the pump, in order for them to reflect actual imported CIF prices.
25.
Fiscal sustainability will also require a substantial improvement in EDH finances. For this
reason the ECF-supported program will have a target for the deficit of the NFPS, which includes
EDH. Reducing EDH’s deficit will require a significant improvement in billing and collection, as
well as increasing the efficiency in energy production, which should contribute to reducing high
generation costs. For this purpose, the Prime Minister, the Minister of Public Works, the Minister
of Finance, EDH, and other stakeholders will sign before end-June 2015 a protocol for the
electricity sector that lays out the obligations of different stakeholders in achieving the targeted
improvement in the sector’s performance (structural benchmark). The protocol includes
provisions with respect to the revision of electricity tariffs, penalties for non-payment, the
elimination of cross-arrears, the review of contracts with Independent Power Producers (IPPs),

52

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

HAITI

and the increase in transparency, in particular through the finalization of an audit of EDH, as well
as better data production and diffusion to allow for better monitoring. In particular for FY2015,
the combination of lower international oil prices and the adoption of measures targeting an
increase in the cash recovery index (CRI) of about 4 percentage points, will allow adoption of a
revised EDH budget with savings of at least G3.4 billion that will reduce the deficit (before
transfers) from 2.5 percent of GDP to 1.7 percent of GDP (prior action). For the coming months,
the EDH will implement actions agreed on in the reform protocol, including completing the audit
of the 200 largest clients, having a first analysis of EDH tariff determination and penalties for
non-payment, and updating an action plan for 2016-2018 (structural benchmark for end-March
2016).
26.
Increasing domestic revenue is another key element to strengthening Haiti’s fiscal
position. Haiti’s current system performance needs to be enhanced both in revenue collection
and in improving tax compliance by removing cumbersome small taxes with low yield and high
costs (“taxes de nuisance”). Accordingly, the government will establish a formal working group
by July 2015 (structural benchmark) to draft a new tax code that will revise and put all tax laws
into a general tax code and eliminate a number of taxes de nuisance. The working group will
produce a preliminary draft of the tax code by end-July 2016. The working group will also
prepare the adoption of a mining code, a full-fledged VAT system, and the modernization of the
income tax. To improve tax administration, the LTO and local tax offices will complete the
transfer of all medium taxpayer files to the MTO by end-August 2015 (structural benchmark). As
gaps in coverage of the LTO and MTO can be readily discovered by identifying large importers
that are not covered by these tax offices, the government will implement a program to ensure
tax compliance by importers with an annual turnover of over G10 million who are not currently
covered by the LTO/MTO by end-April 2016 (structural benchmark). In the medium term, the
government will finalize the tax code, complete a study on tax expenditures, adopt a mining
code, reform the income tax and introduce a full-fledged VAT system, all of which are key
element of a modern tax system.
27.
We remaining committed to a further strengthening of public financial management and
the quality of public expenditures. Further progress towards the TSA, to be established by endFY2015, is essential. To this end, the government will implement the terms of a protocol signed
by the MEF and the BRH on the TSA as well as the MEF decision of December 18, 2014 placing all
public accounts at the BRH under the control of public accounts, and the BRH has ensured its
application by the state-owned bank BNC as described in paragraph 35 of the TMU (prior action).
Four new accounting centers were installed in March, namely Accounting Center Economic
Sector III, Accounting Center Economic Sector IV, Accounting Center Political Sector I, and
Accounting Center Political Sector II. All remaining accounting centers will be established and
operational by end-September 2015 (structural benchmark). In the medium-term, the TSA will
be expanded to include the accounts of autonomous agencies, public enterprises, and donor
accounts. To improve the effectiveness of public investment, the government will implement
relevant recommendations of the World Bank study completed in September 2014, and will draw
on the experience of countries in the regions.

Monetary and Financial Reforms

28.
Credit to the private sector remains low, acting as a key obstacle to economic growth and
inclusion. We intend to boost financial intermediation by strengthening property rights
(including via a land cadastre) as well as by encouraging greater competition among financial
institutions. We will pursue enactment of pending laws on financial cooperatives and
microfinance institutions, and will promote the use of the recently-established credit bureau,
which by improving information flows will broaden access to credit.
29.
The government intends to further strengthen financial sector supervision to better
control systemic risks and enhance the anti-money laundering and combating the financing of
terrorism (AML/CFT) framework. We will conduct periodic stress tests of the banking sector,
based on technical assistance from the Monetary and Capital Markets Department (MCM), and
develop the surveillance and regulatory framework for cooperatives and microfinance
institutions, in line with the recently adopted strategy for financial inclusion. The latter will
require improving data collection and distribution of key indicators on the website of the central
bank. To enhance the AML/CFT framework, the government will adopt the Financial Intelligence
Unit (UCREF) Bill, the new Penal and Criminal Investigation Codes in line with the Caribbean
Financial Action Task Force (CFATF) action plan implementing the AML/CFT framework. As part
of our efforts to pursue a deepening of the financial sector, we will pursue the adoption of the
draft law on insurance companies.
30.
We also prioritize improvements in the monetary policy framework and the operations of
the BRH, which would help transmit more effectively policy decisions onto the real economy,
reduce volatility, increase transparency, and guard against tail risks. To develop the foreign
exchange market, we will implement 2011 MCM recommendations to improve its functioning.
This will target a unification of the FX intervention process while reducing its frequency to
promote the development of a deeper interbank market for foreign exchange.
31.
We remain committed to structural reforms to strengthen monetary policy and financial
transparency. The BRH received (in May) IMF technical assistance on the functioning of the
foreign exchange market resulting in recommendations for improving the reporting of
transactions. The IMF also provided advice (in August) on strengthening foreign reserve
management; the BRH established a work program incorporating the mission’s
recommendations. We continue to implement the recommendations of the 2010 Safeguards
assessment follow-up mission, and in this regard, the FY2013 BRH financial statements were
published in November 2014. We are committed to strengthening the autonomy of the
investment committee, and are appointing a compliance officer to monitor foreign reserves
management as well as a full adoption of IFRS accounting standards.
Program Monitoring
32.
The government intends to take all the necessary measures agreed in the context of the
ECF-supported program, as indicated in Tables 1 and 2 of this Memorandum. A committee
dedicated to program monitoring, chaired by the State Secretary of Finance, with participation of
representatives of the BRH, EDH, as well as relevant units of the Ministry of Finance (including the

54

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

HAITI

Economic Studies, Budget and Treasury Directorates), has been set up. The program will be
monitored based on performance criteria as of end-March and end-September, continuous
performance criteria, indicative targets as of end-June and December, as well as structural
benchmarks. Performance criteria and indicative targets are defined in the technical
memorandum of understanding (TMU, Attachment 2), which also defines the scope and
frequency of data to be reported for program monitoring purposes.

Attachment II. Technical Memorandum of Understanding
1.
This technical memorandum of understanding (TMU) defines quantitative performance
criteria (QPCs), indicative targets (ITs), prior actions (PAs), and structural benchmarks (SBs) for Haiti’s
program supported by the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement from 2015–18. It also
establishes the framework for monitoring the implementation of such a program. Unless otherwise
specified, all QPCs and ITs will be evaluated in terms of cumulative flows from end-September 2014,
as specified in Table 1 of the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP).

Definitions
2.
Central Government (CG). Unless otherwise indicated, the CG refers to the central
administration of Haiti and excludes local administrations (municipalities), the central bank (BRH)
and other public financial institutions, autonomous state organizations and state-owned enterprises
(SOEs). CG expenditures are financed by domestic taxes and other levies and by foreign donors
through, inter alia, foreign grants, ministerial accounts (comptes-courants) and foreign public debt
(including Petrocaribe). All transactions financed with Petrocaribe-flows (as reported by Bureau de
Monétisation des Programmes d'Aide au Développement, BMPAD) constitute, for the purpose of the
ECF, CG operations.
3.
Special Funds and Programs. These include the Road Fund (Fonds d’Entretien Routier, FER)
and resources mobilized to finance the PSUGO program in addition to Treasury transfers. For the
purpose of the ECF, resources levied to finance FER and PSUGO will be recorded as revenues, with
total expenses differing from revenues through variation of deposits recorded within CG deposits at
the BRH.
4.
Electricité d’Haïti (EDH). An SOE that produces, transmits, and distributes electricity. Flows
between EDH and the CG include (i) CG transfers (including through sales taxes collected on
electricity consumption and not devolved to the CG, and budgetary transfers); (ii) transfers financed
with Petrocaribe resources for the operation of a tri-national electricity generation company (PBM);
(iii) the payment of letters of credit in favor of independent power producers (IPPs) by debiting CG
deposits at the BRH to cancel unpaid generation bills by EDH; (iv) the accumulation of financial
claims by the CG for fuel purchases by IPPs, which are a counterpart of EDH arrears for unpaid
generation bills. For the purpose of the ECF arrangement (i) and (ii) are recorded under operations
“above the line”, while (iii) and (iv) are recorded under financing items “below the line”.
5.
Non-financial public sector (NFPS). The NFPS includes the central government, special
funds and programs (defined in paragraph 3), non-budgetary autonomous organizations, local
governments and SOEs (enterprises and agencies in which the government holds a controlling stake
of more than 50 percent of the shares, including EDH, defined in paragraph 4), but excluding the
BRH and state-owned commercial banks.
6.

58

The public sector (PS). The PS comprises the NFPS and the BRH.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

HAITI

7.
Net BRH credit to the NFPS. It is defined as the difference between BRH assets and
liabilities vis-à-vis the NFPS (Créances nettes sur le secteur public) according to Table 10R. This
includes net BRH credit vis-à-vis the CG; and, net BRH credit vis-à-vis the rest of the NFPS.
8.
Domestic arrears of the CG. They are defined as expenditures accepted by the Treasury
that are unpaid. Domestic arrears of the CG exclude unpaid off-budget government commitments.
9.
Unpaid off-budget CG commitments. These refer to obligations arising outside the
budget process (originating in ministries or other public agencies), that may result in contingent
claims on central government resources.
10.
Net domestic financing (NDF) of the CG. It is defined as the sum of (i) net central bank
credit to the CG (see paragraph 7); (ii) net credit from domestic commercial banks (as reported in
Table 20R), which includes changes in CG deposits and the net issuance of treasury bills and other
CG securities to commercial banks; and (iii) net non-bank credit to the CG, which includes net
issuance of Treasury bills and other CG securities to non-banks, the change in net creditor position
of the CG vis-à-vis the electricity sector (including IPPs and EDH), other CG claims and debts vis-àvis nonbank institutions (including the change in net checks issued and not cashed, suppliers’ credit,
and the payment of judicial sentences), and the net change in domestic arrears of CG (paragraph 8).
11.
Net external financing (NEF) of the CG. It is defined as the sum of (i) new external loan
disbursements (including financing under Petrocaribe as well as loans from other external partners,
but excluding the IMF); (ii) external loan amortizations; and (iii) the net change in external arrears.

EDH’s deficit after CG transfers. For the purpose of the program, EDH revenues include all
cash income related to the distribution of electricity (recettes d’energie and recettes diverses), as well
as CG transfers (subventions, including those financed with budgetary and Petrocaribe resources,
including retained taxes). EDH expenditures include: (i) current spending (dépenses d’exploitation)
corresponding to the fiscal year (i.e., excluding the cancelation of arrears with IPPs); these include,
current electricity bills by IPPs and PBM, fuel, administration, wages, and maintenance; and,
(ii) capital spending. Revenues and expenditures correspond to the fiscal year under consideration;
any changes in claims or debts from previous fiscal years will be recorded below the line (as

Poverty-Reducing Expenditure of the CG. It is measured as the sum of the domesticallyfinanced expenditure by the Ministries of Health, Education and Agriculture.
16.
Debt. For the purposes of the performance criteria, the definition of debt is set out in
Executive Board Decision No.6230-(79/140), Point 9, as revised on August 31, 2009
(Decision No. 14416-09/91) : Debt will be understood to mean a current, i.e., not contingent, liability,
created under a contractual arrangement through the provision of value in the form of assets
(including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make one or more payments in
the form of assets (including currency) or services, according to a specific schedule; these payments
will discharge the obligor of the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the contract.
Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones being loans1, suppliers’ credits2, and leases.3
Under the definition of debt set out above, arrears, penalties, and judicially-awarded damages
arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual obligation that constitutes debt are
debt.
17.
Debt guarantees by the PS. For the purposes of the performance criteria on the
contracting or guaranteeing of nonconcessional external debt, a public sector debt guarantee

1

Loans are advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the basis of an undertaking that the obligor will
repay the funds in the future (including deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans, and buyers' credits) and
temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans, under which the obligor is required to
repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as
repurchase agreements and official swap arrangements).
2
Suppliers’ credits are contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer payments until sometime after the
date on which the goods are delivered or services are provided.
3

Leases are arrangements under which property is provided that the lessee has the right to use for one or more
specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter than the total expected service life of the property, while the lessor
retains the title to the property. For the purpose of this guideline, the debt is the present value (at the inception of
the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the period of the agreement, excluding those payments
necessary for the operation, repair, or maintenance of the property.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

HAITI

means an explicit legal obligation to service a debt in the event of non-payment by the borrower
(through payment in cash or in kind).
18.
Debt concessionality. For the purposes of the ECF, an external debt is considered
concessional if it includes a grant element of at least 35 percent.4
19.
External debt. It is defined as debt contracted or serviced with and to non-residents. It
excludes debt issued domestically by the PS and held by non-residents.
20.
Arrears on external debt. They include all debt-service obligations (principal and interest)
on loans contracted or guaranteed by the PS that are due but not paid on the due date as set out in
the loan contract; they exclude those arising from obligations being renegotiated with external
creditors and (or) those that are litigious.
21.
Program exchange rate. The program exchange rate for FY2015 and FY2016 is 47 gourdes
per dollar.
22.
Gross international reserves (GIR) of the BRH. Reserve assets are those external assets
that are readily available to and controlled by monetary authorities for meeting balance of payments
financing needs, for intervention in exchange markets to affect the currency exchange rate, and for
other related purposes (such as maintaining confidence in the currency and the economy, and
serving as a basis for foreign borrowing). Reserve assets must be foreign currency assets and assets
that actually exist. Potential assets are excluded. Underlying the concept of reserve assets are the
notions of “control,” and “availability for use,” by the monetary authorities. For further details, please
refer to the IMF’s sixth edition of the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position
Manual and the Guidelines for a Data Template: International Reserves and Foreign Currency
Liquidity.5 GIR as reported by the BRH in Table 10R should conform to this definition. Swaps in
foreign currency with domestic financial institutions and pledged or otherwise encumbered reserve
assets are excluded from GIR.
23.
Net international reserves (NIR) of the BRH. They are defined as BRH’s gross foreign
exchange assets (comprising monetary gold, all claims on nonresidents, Special Drawing Rights –
SDR- holdings, and BRH claims in foreign currency on domestic financial institutions); minus, gross
short-term reserve-related liabilities, minus, foreign currency deposits of commercial banks at the
BRH (Dépôts à vue en dollars U.S. et en Euros des BCM à la BRH, and the CAM transfer); all from
Table 10R (Table 3).

Monetary Base. It is defined, for the purpose of the ECF, as the stock of currency in
circulation outside commercial banks; plus, Gourde sight deposits of commercial banks (Dépôts a
vue en gourdes des BCM a la BRH); plus, cash-in-vault of commercial banks (Encaisses des BCM), all
from Table 10R.
25.
Net Domestic Assets (NDA) of the BRH. It is defined as the stock of currency in
circulation (see paragraph 24); minus, NIR (in U.S. dollars, paragraph 23) converted into Gourdes at
the program exchange rate (paragraph 21).

Quantitative Performance Criteria (QPCs)
26.
The QPCs for 2015-16 include ceilings on: the change in net BRH credit to the NFPS
(paragraph 7); the change in the NDA of the BRH (paragraph 25); the change in NDF of the CG
(paragraph 10); and, the deficit of the NFPS (paragraph 13). They also include a zero ceiling for
accumulation of arrears on external public debt, to be evaluated continuously; a zero ceiling on the
new contracting or guaranteeing by the public sector of non-concessional external debt; and a floor
on the change in the NIR of the BRH.
27.
The government undertakes not to contract or guarantee any non-concessional external
debt beyond the ceilings identified in MEFP Table 1. These performance criteria apply to external
debt as defined in paragraphs 16 and 19, with concessionality being defined in paragraph 18. This
QPC also applies to any private debt guaranteed by the government that constitutes a contingent
government liability as defined in paragraph 17. Excluded from the ceiling are short-term importrelated credits, rescheduling arrangements, borrowing from the Fund, non-resident purchases of
treasury bills, and gourde-denominated BRH bills that are indexed to the exchange rate. This
commitment is a performance criterion, to be observed continuously.

Adjustment
28.
The ceilings on the change in net BRH credit to the NFPS, the change in the NDA of the BRH,
the change in NDF of the CG, and the deficit of the NFPS will be adjusted upwards, and the floor on
the change in the NIR of the BRH will be adjusted downwards, if budget support grants are lower
than programmed, as shown in Table 2. This adjustor will be applied provided the deviations are
temporary and only reflect delays in the disbursements of programmed, already identified, amounts.

62

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

HAITI

The adjustor will not be applied if the deviations are not temporary. Staff and the authorities will
consult with donors to determine whether any deviations (in the timing of disbursements and in
amounts) can be considered temporary. Staff will consider that deviations are temporary if amounts
are to be disbursed within the fiscal year, or during the first quarter of the following fiscal year, at
the latest.
29.
The ceiling on NDF of the CG will be adjusted upwards if NEF of the CG is lower than
programmed, as shown in Table 1. This adjustment will be capped at US$10 million.
30.
The deficit of the NFPS will be adjusted upwards, if NEF of the CG is higher than
programmed, as shown in Table 1. This adjustment will be capped at US$20 million. If NEF of the CG
is higher than programmed by more than US$20 million, NDF to the CG will be adjusted downwards
by the difference between the additional external financing and US$20 million.
Indicative Targets (ITs) and Memorandum Items
31.
The only IT in the program is a floor on poverty-reducing expenditures of the CG measured
on a cumulative yearly basis. The quantitative performance criteria table will include, as
memorandum, the cumulative change in the stock of GIR.
Prior Actions (PAs)
32.
Adoption of a revised budget for the central government for FY2015. The government
will adopt a revised budget consistent with a deficit for the NFPS of at most G13.5 billion.
33.
Adoption of a revised budget for EDH for FY2015. The Board of EDH will adopt a revised
budget for FY2015 will be consistent with savings of at least G3.4 billion during FY2015.
34.
Adoption of an automatic price mechanism for refined oil products (i.e., gasoline 95,
diesel, and kerosene products). The prior action will be the publication (in the official gazette or a
newspaper of large circulation) of Circulaire interministeriel portant application d’une décision
adoptée par le Premier Ministre (the “Circular”) stating the following elements (i) the law of 1995
establishing the automatic price mechanism will be applied from end-June 2015 at the latest;
(ii) beginning from end-June 2015, after each shipment, the Ministry of Finance (MEF) will publish (in
a newspaper of large circulation) the theoretical price structure for each product, the price structure
in application, and the theoretical value for stock of the stabilization margin; and (iii) the application
of points (i) and (ii) above will begin before end-June 2015 if the value of the stabilization margin
decreases below G -1 billion (minus G 1 billion); in such a case, pump prices will be increased so the
value of the stabilization margin never decreases below G -1 billion. The same criterion will apply
from end-June 2015 onwards: pump prices will be adjusted upwards so to avoid at all times that the
value of the stabilization margin decreases below G -1 billion. In case the value of the stabilization
margin surpasses G 1 billion (plus G 1 billion), pump prices could be adjusted downwards. The
theoretical value of the

staff the effective import prices, and commit to revise the price structure to include effective import
prices instead of “Caribbean posting” quotations as soon as possible.
35.
Treasury Single Account (TSA) and accounting centers. As part of the transformation of
current accounts opened with BRH in the name of the central administration into sub-accounts, the
MEF and the BRH signed a protocol (in December 2014) to advance this process with minimum
delay. Prior actions related with the implementation of this protocol include: (i) The Treasury will
send to the BRH the technical specifications to be developed and the BRH will produce a pilot IT
solution for accounting centers under “Economic Sector I" (its generalization to all accounting
centers will be made in stages); (ii) The MEF and BRH will regroup government accounts at the BRH,
with a view of identifying dormant accounts that will be closed and accounts that will be
transformed in TSA sub-accounts. The MEF will analyze the government accounts that are still open
in commercial banks (state-owned and private) with a view of closing them or passing them under
MEF control.6 Prior actions associated with the decision by the MEF adopted on December 18, 2014
include: (i) the MEF will ensure that all accounts open at the BRH and the BNC (Banque Nationale de
Crédit) are under the control of a public accountant; and (ii) the BRH will allow the public
accountants access to the accounts that are under their respective responsibility. The prior action
associated with a memorandum of understanding signed in March 2015 between the BRH and BNC
includes: (i) tax revenues collected by the BNC on behalf of the Tax department (DGI) and the
customs department (AGD) will begin to be transferred to the central treasury account within
48 hours. The prior action related with the implementation of accounting centers includes: (i) five
new accounting centers will be installed, namely Accounting Center Economic Sector III; Accounting
Center Economic Sector IV; Accounting Center Political Sector I; Accounting Center Political Sector II;
and Central Accounting Center.
Structural Benchmarks (SBs)
36.
Automatic Fuel Price Adjustment Mechanism. The implementation of the automatic price
mechanism as discussed in paragraph 34 will be a structural benchmark to be observed
continuously. The automatic fuel price adjustment mechanism will begin implementation by endJune 2015, at the latest, unless the stabilization margin decreases below G -1 billion, as explained in
paragraph 34. In such a case, pump prices will be adjusted upwards so the stabilization margin is at
all times above G -1 billion. Implementation of the mechanism will be monitored through the
calculation of the value for the stock of the stabilization margin (on a monthly basis) as described in
paragraph 34.
37.
Payment of unpaid off-budget CG commitments. If at any point during the life of the
program, unpaid off-budget expenditures give rise to claims on the central government, the ministry
of finance, before recognizing them as debts, will (i) analyze the supporting documentation to
establish the appropriateness of their nature (as effective public spending); (ii) before such
commitments are cleared, they will be incorporated in the budget, through a revision. This structural
6

This is in line with the objective to consolidate all accounts opened with BRH and BNC, entailing the reduction of
the number of sub-accounts to 3 by ministry (all entities): 2 sub-accounts for current and investment expenditure and
one sub-account for own revenues, and the closing inactive accounts.

64

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

HAITI

benchmark will be observed continuously. Monitoring of this structural benchmark will require the
Ministry of Finance to report to IMF staff (on a monthly basis) the stock and composition of offbudget CG commitments that arrive at the Treasury.
38.
Signature of protocol for the reform of EDH. The Prime Minister, the Minister of Public
Works, the Minister of Finance, EDH, and other stakeholders will sign a protocol (by end-June 2015,
at the latest) that lays out the obligations of different stakeholders in achieving the targeted
improvement in the sector’s performance. The protocol will include provisions with respect the
revision of electricity tariffs, penalties for non-payment, the elimination of cross-arrears, the review
of contracts with IPPs, and the increase in transparency, in particular through the finalization of an
audit of EDH, as well as better data production and diffusion to allow for better monitoring.
39.
Establish a working group for strengthening tax policy. The government will establish a
working group (under the reform unit) by end-July 2015 for drafting the tax code that will put all tax
laws into a general tax code and to eliminate a large number of small taxes (“taxes de nuisance”)
with low yield and high administrative costs. The working group will produce the preliminary draft
by end-July 2016.
40.
Strengthening the medium taxpayers’ office (MTO). The large taxpayers’ office (LTO) as
well as local tax offices will complete the transfer of all medium-size tax payer files to the MTO.
These actions will be completed by end-August 2015.
41.
NFPS Deficit for FY2016. The Central Government and EDH will adopt budgets for FY2016
consistent with a deficit for the NFPS of 2.3 percent of GDP in line with the program. These actions
will be completed by end-September 2015.
42.
Establishment of remaining accounting centers. To ensure rapidity and efficiency of
controls on the implementation of investment projects, accounting centers 1 and 2 of the economic
sector were split into four accounting centers (Accounting Centers Economic Sector –ACES I, II, III,
and IV). All established accounting centers are operational since the first half of FY2014. As part of
the strengthening of management capabilities, a training plan for public accountants and budget
administrators is planned for the month of April 2015. The authorities will implement an interfacing
the information systems of revenues collection (TAX-solution and SYDONIA) with the accounting
system (GL) in line with the already established timetable. The plan to set up other accounting
centers continues in line with the already established timetable. This action will be completed by
end-September 2015.
43.
Establishing a modern cadastre and property rights system. The government has
established an inter-ministerial commission on land management. With donor assistance, the
commission is conducting an inventory of the cadastre on a pilot basis in a number of municipalities.
The commission will transmit an action plan for FY2016-FY2017 to strengthen the legal framework
and functioning of the cadastre in Haiti by no later than end-February 2016.
44.
Audit of 200 largest EDH active clients. In line with the agreed protocol, EDH will, before
end-March 2016, complete the audit of the 200 largest clients, and have a first analysis of EDH tariff
determination and penalties for non-payment, and updated action plan for FY2016–FY2018.

45.
Implement a program to ensure compliance of importers with an annual turnover
above G10 million but who are not currently covered by LTO/MTO (End-April 2016). On a
regular basis, the Customs Department (AGD) will communicate to the Tax Department (DGI)
information on import activities generated by ASYCUDA so that the DGI can identify new large
taxpayers and ensure that they are properly covered by tax administration.
46.
Information concerning the implementation of measures constituting structural benchmarks
will be reported to the IMF staff no later than two weeks after their scheduled implementation date.
Data Provision for Program Monitoring
47.
To facilitate program monitoring, the government will report the information indicated in

1/ The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative
likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between
10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of
discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Exchange Rate Arrangement and Exchange Restrictions:
Haiti’s currency is the gourde. The de jure exchange rate regime is floating. The de facto exchange
rate arrangement has been classified as a crawl-like arrangement since April 2008, except for a short
period of post-earthquake disruption in the exchange rate market from January through February of
2010, during which time the gourde was classified as an other managed arrangement. Haiti has
accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system free
of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.
Safeguards Assessment:
An update safeguards assessment was concluded in January 2011. The assessment noted that
despite the serious setback resulting from the earthquake, elements of the safeguards framework
within the central bank remain in place. However, the safeguards assessment also concluded that
new vulnerabilities emerged, particularly, in the areas of governance, external audit and reserves
management. In order to address these vulnerabilities, the safeguards assessment recommended
rotation of the external auditors, as well the adoption of a formal selection policy in the area of
external audit. The assessment recommended the adoption of a global reserves management policy
and guidelines, to cover both reserves managed internally as well as reserves managed externally.
Other recommendations aim to strengthen the oversight bodies including through the
reconstitution of the Investment Committee, and the appointment of an independent Compliance
Officer. An update assessment will be required before the first review under the new ECF
arrangement.
Article IV Consultations:
The last Article IV consultation was concluded on March 11, 2013 (IMF Country Report No. (13/90).
Consultations were held in Port-au-Prince Dublin during January 20–27, 2014. The IMF team
comprised Mr. Boileau Loko (head), Abdelrahmi Bessaha, Olga Sulla, Alain Brousseau (all WHD), and
Elva Bova (FAD). Jacques Bouhga-Hagbe, the resident representative, assisted the mission. Ms.
Ketleen Florestal from the Executive Director’s office participated in the discussions. The mission met
with Prime Minister Lamothe, Minister of Economy and Finance Jean Marie, Minister of Commerce
and Industry Laleau, Minister of Agriculture Jacques, Minister Delegate in charge of Human Rights
and the Fight against Poverty Auguste, Governor Castle, and senior financial and economic officials.
The mission also met with representatives of the donor and diplomatic community and the private
sector. Article IV consultations with Haiti are on the 24-month cycle.
Technical Assistance:
Haiti has received the following IMF technical assistance missions since November 2012:1

JOINT WORLD BANK-IMF WORK PROGRAM, 2015–16
The IMF country team coordinated closely with the World Bank during the Article IV
consultation mission and staff visit, with World Bank staff participating actively in all
discussions. The teams were led by Mr. Raju Singh (Lead Economist and Program Leader, World
Bank) and Mr. Gabriel Di Bella (IMF Mission Chief for Haiti).
The teams agreed that while Haiti should be commended for maintaining macroeconomic
stability, deep-seated structural reforms are needed to raise Haiti’s growth rate and ensure
steady progress in poverty reduction. The teams agreed that electricity should be a top reform
priority, both because the sector’s large fiscal costs crowd out other public spending and because
poor and unreliable electricity service constitutes a key obstacle to economic development.
Together with the electricity utility and responsible government ministries, the teams coordinated
closely in the incorporation of electricity sector issues into the ECF arrangement, and will continue to
do so over the course of the program.
The teams also jointly developed the debt sustainability analysis (See Debt Sustainability
Analysis). They agreed that the recent fall in international fuel prices drove the improvement in
Haiti’s projected debt sustainability as compared with the previous DSA, and is thus vulnerable to a
sudden reversal. The results therefore underscored the need for an automatic fuel price mechanism,
together with targeted mitigating measures, to guard against the risk of a rebound in prices while
protecting the most vulnerable. Both the Bank and the Fund have been active in providing technical
assistance in this area.

RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of March 2015)
As Haiti’s largest multilateral donor, with an uninterrupted presence for 50 years, the IDB has
a strong commitment to the people and Government of Haiti. Consequently, the IDB has
mobilized unprecedented financial and human resources to respond to the multiple needs of the
country after the earthquake of January 12th, 2010. In the aftermath of the shock, the Bank engaged
extensively with the Government and other donors in humanitarian relief efforts, reconstruction and
rehabilitation activities, as well as the delivery of basic social services.
The Bank also assumed additional responsibilities beyond the financing of key recovery and
development investments, including support for sector-wide plans and active roles in the design
and implementation of the earthquake recovery institutional mechanisms such as the Haiti
Reconstruction Fund (HRF), for which it acts as one of three Partner Entities.
The Bank is uniquely positioned to support the Government’s Action Plan for National
Recovery and Reconstruction. In order to identify priority sectors and focus its resources, the Bank
and the GOH carried out a comprehensive sector analysis of its project pipeline, past experience and
areas of comparative advantage, relationships with key GOH and other international and Haitian
stakeholders, as well as the Bank’s comparative strength and reputation with respect to other
donors.

A. Key Developments Since the Earthquake
In the months following the earthquake, the IDB Board of Governors also agreed to cancel
Haiti’s outstanding debt with the Bank, which at US$479 million constituted about 40% of the
Government’s external liabilities. The IDB Governors also agreed to convert the undisbursed
portion of loans, totaling some US$186 million into grants, thereby freeing up public resources for
critical investments. These decisions were preceded by the 2009 E-HIPC/MDRI initiative when the
IDB granted some US$511 million in debt relief, clearing the way for the Government to undertake
vital public investments.
The Bank also pledged to provide Haiti more than US$2.3 billion in new grants for the
2010–20 period to fund its recovery efforts and long-term development plans. This decision
sealed the Bank’s long-term commitment with Haiti’s reconstruction plan. These resources will
finance investments vital for Haiti’s post-earthquake recovery, to tackle extreme poverty and
inequality, and to establish the platform for long term economic growth as well as institutional and
social development.
On the basis of an analysis of the most critical areas of support for recovery and development,
as well as consultations with the GOH, the Bank focuses its projects on six sector

STATISTICAL ISSUES
A. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance. Most
affected are the national accounts and labor indicators. Fiscal and external sector data are
broadly adequate, but need improvements in coverage and timeliness.
National Accounts and Real Sector Data. The Haitian statistical system was severely impacted
by the January 2010 earthquake. Since the earthquake Haiti has only published preliminary
estimates of the national accounts and no longer publishes final results. Another issue is the
1986/1987 base year of constant price GDP data, which does not adequately capture the
structural shifts in the economy since then. The Fund continues to provide technical assistance in
this area in coordination with other TA providers, aiming at moving the base year from 1986/87
to 2012 and improving compilation methods. Other shortcomings include incomplete and
untimely reporting on performance in the agricultural sector, and the lack over an overall
quarterly economic indicator that could be used to estimate quarterly GDP.
Price and Labor Statistics. CPI is compiled by the Haitian Institute of Statistics on information
based on a 2000 household survey structure, using 2004 as the reference year. The index follows
a Laspeyres methodology and comprises 287 products. The statistical institute also produces
estimates of inflation of local and imported goods, but these are not consistent with the headline
survey, preventing an accurate estimation of the contributions to overall inflation from local and
imported goods. No labor statistics are published.
Government Finance Statistics. Staff receive data from the Ministry of Finance in the form of a
monthly “Table of Government Financial Operations” (TOFE) for program monitoring and
surveillance. Data presentation is broadly adequate but has weaknesses including limited
coverage, high aggregation, misclassifications, the non-reporting of major categories such as net
lending, financing and Petrocaribe-related operations, and incomplete information on debt
service. There is a need to improve the timeliness of publication of the accounts of autonomous
agencies and public enterprises, particularly the electricity utility EDH, to establish the accounts
of the nonfinancial public sector. The reporting of budgetary expenditures, especially on
ministerial discretionary accounts, should be improved to increase transparency. The authorities
are encouraged to establish a plan for migrating to the GFSM 2001/2014 framework for
compiling fiscal statistics.
Monetary and Financial Statistics. The monthly accounts of the balance sheets of the central
bank and the consolidated banking sector are broadly adequate for surveillance. However, there
are some inconsistencies between the central bank and commercial bank accounts. There is also
a need to expand institutional coverage of financial institutions to include credit unions and
cooperatives into the survey of depository corporations, and to improve the timeliness of
reported data to the Fund.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

HAITI

Financial Sector Surveillance. With regard to financial soundness indicators (FSIs), Haiti
currently does not report data to the Fund for dissemination on the Fund website.
External Sector Statistics. Balance of payments data is broadly adequate for surveillance but
suffers from some deficiencies in scope, source data, and timeliness. Large errors and omissions,
as well as gaps between the data reported by Haiti and its partners indicate incomplete coverage
of current and financial account transactions. Special attention should be given to customs data
coverage and classification of post-earthquake official and private flows, as well as recording of
the external assets and liabilities of the private sector. CARTAC is ready to facilitate any TA upon
the authorities’ request.
B. Data Standards and Quality
Haiti participates in the Fund’s General Data
Dissemination System.

No data ROSC is available.

C. Reporting to STA
Haiti currently does not report monthly or annual fiscal data to STA for publication in the
International Financial Statistics (IFS) or in the Government Finance Statistics Year (GFSY),
respectively. Haiti reports annual IIP and quarterly balance of payments to STA, although these
suffer from a lack of consistency.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND REQUEST FOR A THREE-YEAR ARRANGEMENT UNDER
THE EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITY—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
ANALYSIS

May 6, 2015

Approved By
Adrienne. Cheasty,
Bob Traa (IMF) and
John Panzer (IDA)

Prepared by the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank

This Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) was prepared in accordance with the revised joint
Bank-Fund debt sustainability framework (DSF) for low-income countries (LICs).1 Haiti’s
risk of debt distress has improved from high to moderate on the back of significantly lower
oil prices and some fiscal consolidation. However, the balance of risks is still to the
downside, and a rebound in oil prices would result in an increase in the likelihood of debt
distress and the risk of external debt distress would become high again.2 The country’s
main challenge continues to be ensuring macro stability while protecting social and
investment spending needed for social cohesion and growth. Policies under the baseline
scenario assume improved energy policies that allow to broadly lock-in the fiscal gains
associated with lower oil prices. The country’s external debt profile is vulnerable to
changes in oil prices, borrowing conditions and the exchange rate; moreover, a decline in
the rate of growth would have a negative impact on public debt. The cost of a sudden stop
of Petrocaribe inflows would be lower than previously assessed (EBS/14/33) provided oil
prices continue to be at lower levels. However, given the extreme sensitivity of Haiti’s debt
to shocks, improvements in the risk of debt distress implied by this DSA should be
interpreted with great caution. It is essential that Haiti maintain prudent macroeconomic
policies, strengthen debt management and public financial management, and deepen
structural reforms to boost exports and growth.

World Bank and IMF (2009). “Review of Some Aspects of the Low-Income Country Debt Sustainability
Framework.” (IDA/SecM2009-0397; SM/09/216; BUFF/09/146); World Bank and IMF (2012), “Revisiting the
Debt Sustainability Framework for Low Income Countries,” (SM/12/10). In line with the guidance note, “a
change in the external risk rating or in the assessment of the overall risk of debt distress since the previous
DSA would warrant a full DSA”. Accordingly, this full DSA was prepared jointly by IMF and World Bank staffs.
2

Thresholds are set according to the country’s CPIA ranking. Haiti is classified as a weak performer based on
its three-year 2011-13 average score of 2.88 in the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment
(CPIA) framework. For weak performers (defined as those with three-year average CPIA ratings below 3.25), the
indicative thresholds for external debt sustainability are PV debt-to-GDP ratio of 30 percent and 27 percent
when remittances are included; PV debt-to-exports ratio of 100 percent and 80 percent when remittances are
included, PV debt-to-revenue ratio of 200 percent, debt service-to-exports ratio of 15 percent and 12 percent
with remittances; and debt service-to-revenue ratio of 25 percent.

HAITI

Background
1.
At end-2014, Haiti’s stock of public sector debt amounted to US$2,279 million,
(24.8 percent of GDP), composed almost exclusively by external debt on concessional terms (Text
Table 1). External debt amounted to US$1,825 million, of which US$136 million corresponded to
multilateral debt, and US$1,690 million to bilateral debt, mainly to Venezuela (US$1,574 million of
Petrocaribe debt). Domestic public debt was about US$230 million, mostly in the form of treasury bills
largely held by commercial banks and about US$45 million is a publicly guaranteed debt to a commercial
bank contracted by the state-owned electricity company EDH (Electricité d’Haïti).
2.
Other outstanding creditor and debtor positions with the private sector appear in favor of
the public sector. The non-financial public sector remains a net creditor to the consolidated banking
system, mainly reflecting Petrocaribe and other deposits at commercial banks (about US$228 million at
end-2014). In addition, the public sector maintains a debtor position vis-à-vis independent power
producers (IPPs), for arrears accumulated by EDH for about US$350 million; in turn the IPPs have
accumulating arrears to the central government (US$200 million at end-2014), for the provision of fuel.

A. Macroeconomic Outlook, 2015–35
3.
Haiti’s main challenge is to balance
the need for a gradual fiscal adjustment
with large social and investment needs. A
stronger-than-warranted fiscal adjustment
may result in a better debt profile at the cost
of lower GDP growth and slower progress in
addressing social needs. Conversely, too large
a primary deficit could compromise
macroeconomic stability. In particular, the
baseline scenario is based on the following
assumptions:

Fiscal projections include an upfront fiscal consolidation, as the positive fiscal impact of
lower oil prices is locked in. Domestic revenues of the central government increase to about
18.4 percent of GDP by 2035 (from 12.5 percent in 2014), while foreign grants will gradually
decrease to about 2 percent of GDP (from 6.5 percent of GDP in 2014). Primary expenditure

HAITI

(including EDH’s deficit) is projected to decline from 27.8 percent of GDP in 2014 to
21.1 percent in 2035, with capital expenditure (domestically and externally financed)
stabilizing at 10 percent of GDP by 2035, reflecting lower Petrocaribe financing. This would
involve an adjustment in the non-financial public sector (NFPS) primary balance of about
6 percentage points of GDP during the projection period. The primary deficit in 2035 (about
0.6 percent of GDP) would be consistent with a decreasing debt ratio. For the external
outlook, projections consider a significant improvement of the trade deficit (from
32.8 percent of GDP in 2014 to 13.5 percent in 2035), in large part due to lower oil prices,
and gradually increasing FDI (from 1.1 percent of GDP in 2014 to 3.7 percent in 2035). The
projections further assume Petrocaribe debt inflows will decrease significantly, given the
reduced oil bill (from 11.1 percent of GDP in 2014 to 8.2 percent in 2010 (the end of the
WEO projection period). As the country develops, transfers (both official and remittances)
would decline gradually, from 26.3 percent of GDP in 2014 to 11.2 percent in 2035.
4.
Gross financing needs will be covered by a combination of external and domestic debt.
Gross financing needs are projected to average about 3.3 percent of GDP per year, which will be financed
by external debt flows (about 3.0 percent of GDP) and the rest by domestic debt (and deposit withdrawals
in 2015–17). The DSA assumes that external borrowing would be almost evenly split between Petrocaribe
flows and additional external bilateral borrowing at concessional terms. Domestic borrowing would
comprise only treasury bills with 1–5 year maturities, and 8.8 percent interest rate (in US$ terms). For
2015–17, withdrawals of balances of the PCDR account are also projected, for a total amount of 1.6 percent
of GDP.3

The baseline scenario assumes that the country will be able to secure the concessional financing needed to smooth
out the adjustment of the primary deficit over several years, and that structural reforms proceed, but slowly.

5.
The DSA projects that public debt will grow from about 25 percent of GDP in 2014 to
39 percent of GDP in 2035. In turn, external debt will grow from around 21.4 percent of GDP in 2014 to
30.5 percent of GDP in 2035. External debt accumulation would be lower than in the previous DSA, as
Petrocaribe inflows will be lower on the back of a decreased oil bill.; the grant element of new borrowing
would increase slightly from 36 percent to 38 percent due to greater resort to multilateral financing. (Tables
1 to 3).
The main differences in the medium-term macroeconomic assumptions with respect to the
previous DSA are as follow (Text Table 2),


GDP growth was marked down slightly in view of recent performance; the positive impulse
to growth from lower oil prices was assumed to be broadly offset by the effect on growth of
a more challenging socio-political environment. Inflation would be broadly unchanged as
lower oil prices are only marginal passed on to consumers.



Government revenues are projected to be larger on the back of the elimination in 2015 of
foregone revenues linked with fuel taxes.



Export growth would follow a similar trajectory as in the previous DSA, given the HELP and
HOPE initiatives, which provide advantageous conditions for apparel exports to the U.S.
Imports, however, were revised down significantly given decreased oil prices, but non-oil
imports are similar, reflecting the country’s needs to rebuild infrastructure, as well as Haiti’s
status as a net food importer.



Remittances continue to be significant in the short-to-medium terms (19.8 percent of GDP in
2014, almost double all goods exports) and are projected to decline to 9.4 percent of GDP in
2035, similar to the previous DSA.

B. Debt Sustainability Outlook, 2015–35
6.
Haiti’s risk of external debt distress improved from high to moderate. The more favorable
assessment reflects lower oil prices (with significant fiscal impact), as well as consolidation efforts initiated
by the Haitian authorities in early 2015. No debt threshold would be breached under the baseline scenario
(Fig.1). Caution is however essential in interpreting these results. First, while the debt service-to-exports and
the debt service-to-revenue ratios under the baseline scenario would not breach the respective thresholds
during the projection period, they are on an upward trend. Second, a permanent increase in oil prices (of
50 percent) would result in the breach of most thresholds, and a return to a situation of high debt distress
(see section C). Under the previous LIC-DSA, the ratios of PV of debt to GDP, to exports and to revenue
would be breached by 2021–2022; the ratio of debt service to revenue was a boarder case, and the ratio of
debt service to exports, while below the threshold during the projection period, was on an upward trend.
7.
Haiti’s external position is vulnerable to changes in borrowing terms and to higher
exchange rate depreciation. Haiti’s external debt remains vulnerable to shocks, particularly on borrowing
terms. An increase by 200 bps in the interest rate over the entire projection period would cause the
thresholds for the PV of debt –to-exports ratio and the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio to be breached starting
from FY2028 (Tables 3b). In addition, while the debt service-to-exports and the debt service-to-revenue
ratios would not breach the respective threshold during the projection period, they would be on an upward

trend under terms and depreciation shocks, respectively. Higher oil prices would result in increased stress,
as described below.
8.
Public sector debt indicators continue to be vulnerable to growth and policy shocks. Under
the baseline scenario, the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio would remain below the threshold (Table 2). Shocks to
growth and the primary balance would result in unsustainably high public debt indicators. The threshold
for the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio would be exceeded by FY2028.

C. Increased Stress Scenarios
A ‘Sudden Stop’ of Petrocaribe Inflows
9.
The likelihood of a stop of Petrocaribe flows increased since the last DSA. Significantly lower
oil prices have worsened Venezuela’s (already very tight) financing constrains. As a result, the likelihood of
change in financing terms, or an outright stop, of Petrocaribe financing has become more likely.
10.
A stop of Petrocaribe flows would lead, in the short-term, to fiscal adjustment and lower
GDP growth. A sudden stop of Petrocaribe flows starting in FY2016 would impact investment spending
and the financing of the electricity sector, negatively affecting growth. The shock to growth would bring
domestic tax revenues below the baseline. The impact on the economy would be cushioned by a decrease
in domestic revenues, some drawdown of government deposits (including Petrocaribe deposits), a
reduction in international reserves, and additional bilateral assistance.
11.
The impact on the economy would be lower than previously assessed given lower oil prices.
The decline in oil prices causes an automatic decrease in Petrocaribe financing (as the latter depends on
the size of the oil bill), even if Petrocaribe continues. The lower financing flows compared with the last DSA
(1.3 percent of GDP on average in 2015-17), will be more than offset by the improvement in the oil bill
(3.3 percent of GDP on average during 2015-17). The effect of a stop of residual Petrocaribe flows
(2.0 percent on average during 2015-17), is expected to subtract about 1 percent point from growth in
FY2016–FY2017, as the authorities would be compelled to curtail Petrocaribe-financed capital expenditures
and transfers to the electricity sector.
12.
The stock of public debt would remain broadly unchanged and the risk of external debt
distress would remain moderate. Debt ratios would deteriorate slightly in the aftermath of the shock,
given lower GDP growth, and some REER depreciation. However, the lower Petrocaribe flows would force a
somewhat faster fiscal consolidation, and thus, debt ratios would be broadly unchanged with respect to the
baseline at the end of the projection period.
A Rebound of Oil Prices
13.
Higher oil prices would result in increased external debt distress. A permanent increase in oil
prices by 50 percent in 2016 would complicate policy implementation, and would result in decreases in
GDP growth and in fiscal pressures, in particular through the impact of the higher prices on electricity
generation and thus, on EDH’s deficit. Under this scenario, the debt stock would increase to above
50 percent of GDP by 2035.

14.
The stock of external debt would increase significantly and the risk of external debt distress
would become high. The ratios of PV of debt to GDP, to exports and to revenue would be breached by
2020–2021; the ratios of debt service to revenue and to exports, while below the respective thresholds
during the projection period, would be on an upward trend. Moreover Haiti’s debt would remain
vulnerable to terms and depreciation shocks.

D. Conclusions
15.

The updated DSA suggests that Haiti’s risk of debt distress improved, but that it could
deteriorate should growth fall short or oil prices rebound. The debt is also vulnerable to shocks to
growth, borrowing terms and the exchange rate. A sudden stop of Petrocaribe financing would negatively
impact growth and bring about a REER depreciation, worsening temporarily public debt ratios. However,
the impact of a stop of these flows is much weaker than previously assessed, given that lower oil prices act
as the main buffer to absorb the shock. An increase in oil prices would result in increased debt stress and
the risk of external debt distress would become high again. This suggests caution in interpreting the
observed improvement in Haiti’s debt distress, as it is very likely that a significant portion of the current oil
price decrease will prove to be temporary. Against this backdrop, the lower oil prices provide a unique
opportunity to switch to good energy policies, which will lock in fiscal and efficiency gains. The
implementation of structural reforms (including improving the effectiveness of public investment) is
necessary to push up growth above its historical norm, and close to the average for LICs, as assumed in the
DSA. As highlighted in the previous DSA, it remains crucial that Haiti maintains prudent macroeconomic
policies; strengthens the effectiveness of public investment, debt management, and PFM more generally,
improves the sustainability of the electricity sector, and continues the implementation of structural reforms
to improve the investment climate, in order to boost exports and growth.

16.
The authorities broadly concurred with the main findings of the DSA. Staff and the authorities
discussed the main assumptions and conclusions of the updated DSA, as well as main risks affecting
surrounding the baseline. The authorities agreed with the need to increase the yield on growth of public
investment, and more generally to contain the primary deficit of the non-financial public sector, in view of
the financing risks. They agreed on the need to speed up the implementation of reforms, but highlighted
that a number of constraints (including the complexity of some reforms, or lengthy discussions originated
in the presence of vested interests) have slowed down the process.4

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Statement by Paulo Nogueira Batista, Executive Director for Haiti,
Oliveira Lima, Alternate Executive Director,
and Ketleen Florestal, Advisor to the Executive Director
May 18, 2015
1.
On behalf of our authorities, we would like to thank management and staff for the
continued engagement with Haiti.
Recent Developments
2.
At the time of the Executive Board’s discussion of the eighth review of the last
Extended Credit Facility (ECF) this past December, the Government of Haiti had already
indicated that it would want a successor arrangement with the Fund and specified the priority
areas for the new program. Negotiations with staff were initiated in March 2015, less than
two months after a new Government took office. Concurrently, the authorities were
confronted with significant challenges, including the shrinking budget funding from
PetroCaribe, given its link to petroleum prices that had fallen rapidly. Repeated strikes were
called from different sectors. Some of those, convened by unions in the transportation sector
to press the Government to reduce petroleum prices at the pump, became violent and
complicated the social and economic situation.
3.
The Haitian authorities continued to press ahead with politically-sensitive reforms,
despite the fact that 2015 is an electoral year with elections on all levels –including
presidential. The reforms seek to enhance the transparency and efficiency of public
expenditure management, in particular with the full implementation of the single treasury
account, to improve the performance of the electricity sector and to phase-out fuel subsidies.
The authorities’ commitment to fiscal sustainability was exemplified by the completion of
two key prior actions: (i) the adoption of an automatic price mechanism for refined oil
products with regular price adjustments starting in June 2015; and (ii) the adoption by the
board of the public electricity company (Electricité d’Haiti – EDH) of a revised budget with
substantial programmed savings.
4.
The Government’s program lays the basis for a significant transformation of the
Haitian economy by enhancing its growth potential and reducing its vulnerability to external
shocks. Key program targets are to remove bottlenecks to growth and strengthen the fiscal
policy framework. The authorities are also committed to pursue tax and fiscal administration
reforms as a way to build sustainable fiscal conditions. The authorities’ reform package is
ambitious and comprehensive. Besides phasing out untargeted fuel price subsidies and
upgrading the performance of EDH, the program seeks to improve tax compliance and
collection, to strengthen the legal framework and the functioning of the cadastre, and to
enhance access to credit.
Electricity Sector Reforms
5.
The authorities consider that there is a small window of opportunity to jumpstart the
reforms in the electricity sector, with the support of the IMF and several donors. As stated in

2
the MEFP, the electricity sector has been both a key bottleneck to growth and a significant
fiscal drain. The staff report and the selected issues paper have underscored how the weak
performance of the electricity sector is affecting several aspects of economic life and social
well-being. The sources of losses and inefficiencies at EDH are also highlighted. These
include onerous contracts with independent power producers and, until recently, weak
coordination among donors and within public entities.
6.
Our authorities wish to reiterate their determination to achieve a complete overhaul in
the electricity sector. However, as staff indicated, the reforms jeopardize vested interests and
the authorities know they will continue to face strong resistance both domestically and
externally. They are confident that with political will and domestic ownership positive results
can be achieved. The authorities also look forward to better coordination among donors and
an enhanced level of accountability by domestic and external stakeholders.
7.
As for the pricing of petroleum at the pump, the authorities are committed to
depoliticize the system and to ensure that subsidies are better targeted. The Government has
sought technical support from the World Bank to design a program that would shelter the
vulnerable segments of the population from significant price increases in public
transportation.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
8.
The Haitian authorities place great emphasis on adhering to their commitments under
the ECF program with the Fund. Because of that, they have expressed concerns regarding the
performance criterion (PC) on net international reserves (NIRs). The concerns of the Haitian
authorities are reinforced by the rapid increase in petroleum prices since the close of
negotiations about six weeks ago, from US$50 to US$65 per barrel; by expectations of an
increase in food imports due to a recent drought; and by the prospects of a decrease in travel
inflows linked to uncertainties related to the upcoming elections.
9.
The authorities are also concerned about the limit the adjusters may impose on their
capacity to take advantage of additional external support. The program takes into account
assistance that was confirmed at the time of negotiation and sets up caps to the amount of
additional external financing that can be freely used. Beyond those caps, external financing
will entail a reduction in the amount of net domestic financing to the central government
allowed in the program.
On the debt sustainability analysis
10.
According to staff’s assessment, Haiti is considered this year to be at moderate risk of
debt distress. However, staff warns that the change in classification from high to moderate is
mostly due to the fall in oil prices and ensuing improvement in the terms of trade. Hence,
staff recommends caution as the oil price decrease could be temporary. Our authorities share
the view that continued prudence is warranted in contracting debt. However, they find staff’s
considerations on the DSA unbalanced, because the potential upside risk from the increased

3
economic activity in the United States, which would impact Haiti particularly through
remittances, does not seem to have been considered.
Conclusions
11.
The Fund should support the authorities’ efforts to undertake difficult reforms in an
electoral year. At the time of the last Board discussion, Directors advised that future Fund
engagements with Haiti be guided by the recommendations of the Ex Post Assessment of
Longer-Term Program Engagement, including the need for a more realistic policy framework
and greater ownership. As we have underlined on several occasions, full domestic ownership
of an arrangement with the IMF requires that the authorities remain in the driver’s seat while
the Fund helps them marshal support for the program.
12.
Haiti is a country in a fragile situation, member of the g7+ grouping. We believe that
this is one of the instances in which the Fund could showcase its willingness to cater
appropriately to the needs of this segment of the membership. With the reduction of
PetroCaribe flows expected to be of about 50 percent, there is also a pressing need to develop
innovative lending mechanisms that would ease the current financing constraints and allow
Haiti to invest in a better future.
