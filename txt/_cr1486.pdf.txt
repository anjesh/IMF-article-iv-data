STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND THE SEVENTH AND EIGHTH REVIEWS UNDER THE
STAND-BY ARRANGEMENT AND REQUEST FOR WAIVERS OF
APPLICABILITY AND NONOBSERVANCE OF PERFORMANCE
CRITERION

KEY ISSUES
Stand-By Arrangement (SBA): the 36-month SBA for SDR 52.51 million (590 percent of
quota) was approved July 27, 2011. The fifth and sixth reviews were completed July 24,
2013.
Context and program performance: The economy is recovering from a four-year
contraction through 2012, and prospects are positive, although risks remain. All fiscal
program targets were met with a large margin through end-September 2013. However,
the continuous performance criterion on external arrears was missed. The amounts were
minor and quickly repaid. The authorities have taken measures to prevent this recurrence.
The implementation of structural reforms was slow with most end-December
benchmarks delayed by capacity constraints, challenges in technical assistance and
changing priorities.
Article IV: The last Article IV consultation was concluded on July 27, 2011. Current
discussions focused on strategies to secure sustainable growth through enhancing
tourism, developing cost-effective alternative energy sources, and improving the
business environment. Developing a stable macroeconomic framework conducive to
growth and investment is a critical element of the strategy, including a sustainable
medium-term fiscal path, use of exceptional revenues to build buffers against exogenous
shocks, and strengthened safeguards for the financial system.
Review: The authorities’ commitment to their program is reflected in the 2014 budget,
and their plans to save the bulk of the Citizenship-by-Investment (CBI) application fees.
Understandings were reached on a new timetable for the implementation of most of the
structural benchmarks within the remaining program period, and a prior action on
operational guidelines to facilitate land sales related to the debt restructuring.
Exchange regime: St. Kitts and Nevis is part of the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union
and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions. It has accepted the obligations of Article
VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4.

CONTEXT: ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND FISCAL
CONSOLIDATION
Considerable progress has been achieved under the three-year Stand-By Arrangement (SBA).1
Firm signs of a recovery were present in the first nine months of 2013 after a four-year
contraction. The fiscal position has improved significantly as a result of adjustment and reforms,
as well as considerable growth in non-tax revenue. There has been substantial progress in
reducing public debt through debt restructuring. The financial sector has remained resilient and
the external position has improved.
1.
Economic activity in 2013 is recovering, with a pickup in tourism and construction.
Following a prolonged slowdown, with GDP declining by a cumulative 10 percent in 2009–2012,
economic growth is projected to be 1.7 percent in 2013 although the recovery in Nevis is weaker.
This reflects a recovery in tourism and construction, the latter fueled by the large inflows under the
Citizenship by Investment (CBI) program, other FDI projects, and Sugar Industry Diversification
Foundation (SIDF) (Box 1). 2 A decline in the manufacturing sector with the loss of an important
bottling license for two international brands and the temporary closure of a major electronics plant
due to mechanical problems, and a fall in the communication sector, have moderated the recovery.
CPI inflation has remained low at 0.4 percent at end-December (y/y).
2.
The external position has significantly strengthened. A recovery in tourism receipts and
strong CBI fees, together with weak imports reflecting sluggish demand through 2012 have
narrowed the current account deficit, from over 20 percent of GDP prior to 2011 to about 12 percent
in 2012 and 8½ percent in 2013. The stronger current account balance together with capital inflows
led to an accumulation of international reserves since the start of the SBA, from 5-months-ofimports to over 8 months at end-November 2013 (6 months excluding IMF disbursements).
3.
The fiscal position of the central government has further strengthened, with continued
strong CBI fee receipts and sustained budgetary discipline. Under the three-year SBA, the fiscal
balance has improved from a deficit of 7.8 percent of GDP in 2010 to a projected surplus of
10.6 percent of GDP in 2013, and the primary balance strengthened from a deficit of 0.8 percent to a
surplus of 15.5 percent of GDP. The largest contributor to the adjustment has been the sharp
increase in CBI fee receipts, from 2.3 percent of GDP in 2010 to an estimated 13 percent of GDP in
2013. Moreover, in line with the program, the implementation of the VAT boosted tax revenue in
2011 while hiring and the wage bill were frozen since 2010. Other expenditures have also been
contained, while capital spending declined from 6.8 percent in 2010 to 4.7 percent in 2013.
1

The 36-month SBA was approved on July 27, 2011 for SDR 52.51 million (590 percent of quota), and
SDR 47.37 million have been disbursed to date.
2

The SIDF is an autonomous entity, which was created in 2006 after the closure of the St. Kitts Sugar Manufacturing
Corporation to support, develop and diversify the economy. All of its funding comes from the CBI program.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. KITTS AND NEVIS

Substantial progress has been made in reducing public debt, with the debt-to-GDP ratio projected
to decline from 164 percent of GDP in 2010 to 105 percent of GDP in 2013 as a result of debt
restructuring, with the debt-for-land swap with domestic creditors finalized in June 2013.
4.
Private sector credit, after stagnating since 2012, is now declining notwithstanding
ample bank liquidity. The banking system remains the strongest in the region, relatively well
capitalized and with ample liquidity. Deposits—which remain banks’ primary source of funding—
have grown, dominated by CBI inflows. Nonetheless, banks’ NPLs rose from 6.6 percent at end-2011
to 10.5 percent at end-September 2013, notably due to removing government loans from total
loans following the debt-for-land swap. Despite the emerging recovery, credit to the private sector,
which had been flat through 2012, contracted by 2.6 percent (y/y) through end-November 2013
reflecting banks’ concerns about higher NPLs, reluctance to increase their exposure to tourism, and
the fact that the recovery has been mostly financed by FDI or CBI inflows. Capitalization, well above
the regulatory benchmark, and profits were somewhat adversely impacted by the growing NPLs and
the reduction in interest earned on government loans after the debt restructuring.

5.
The supervision of the non-bank financial institutions has strengthened. The Financial
Services Regulatory Commission (FSRC) assumed responsibility for credit unions in 2012. 3 Its
implementation of a new supervisory framework based on the PEARLS prudential rating has led to
an increase in credit unions NPLs from 10 percent at end-2012 to 21 percent at end-September
2013.4 At the same time, credit unions’ assets grew by 11 percent (y/y) in September 2013.
6.
The government remains challenged in Parliament because of the outstanding motion
of no confidence. In early 2013, two members of the government joined the opposition party,
which had tabled a motion of no confidence in December 2012. The High Court is addressing

whether the motion can take precedence over other items of the legislative agenda while the
opposition limited its participation in Parliament. The 2014 budget of St. Kitts and Nevis was
approved on December 11, 2013. The Concerned Citizens Movement (CCM), affiliated with the
federal opposition party, won the January 2013 election in Nevis. In line with the Constitution,
elections are due by June 2015.5

PROGRAM PERFORMANCE
7.
Fiscal performance under the SBA remains strong. The fiscal targets have been met for
end-June 2013 and end-September 2013, the latter in part due to ample CBI receipts, which more
than offset some overruns in current outlays—including the granting of a thirteenth month wage
after the three-year nominal wage freeze—and an accelerated execution of the investment budget.
Tax revenue was aligned with program expectations at end-September 2013, partly due to buoyant
receipts from taxes related to real estate transactions. The budgetary surplus at end-June 2013 was
EC$126 million, and at end-September EC$175 million, more than twice the adjusted program
targets. The primary surpluses at end-June and end-September also amply exceeded their adjusted
targets.

8.
All other performance criteria have been met through end-September 2013, except for
the continuous ceiling on the accumulation of external arrears. The Development Bank of St.
Kitts and Nevis (DBSKN) accumulated temporary and minor arrears of EC$1.6 million (0.08 percent of
GDP) to the European Investment Bank (EIB) in September 2013, which were cleared at end-October
2013. This resulted from the DBSKN’s temporarily tight cash flow situation compounded by
coordination gaps with the central government. The DBSKN is addressing this situation by
tightening administrative procedures and establishing a fund for the pre-payment of debt service.
The Nevis Island Administration (NIA) also accumulated small arrears to the CDB (of EC$0.3 million

or 0.01 percent of GDP) after normal operations were impeded by the fire destruction of its Treasury
building three days before payment was due, destroying paper records and damaging the data
server. The NIA promptly alerted the CDB of the impending delay and shortly thereafter repaid the
outstanding amount.
9.
Despite the improving consolidated fiscal position, the NIA has been facing financing
pressures and temporarily incurred domestic arrears on its bond. The NIA EC$20 million
Treasury Bill issued on the Regional Government Securities Market (RGSM)—due on June 20, 2013—
could not be rolled over without a federal government guarantee, which was routinely provided in
the past. The temporary default gave rise to domestic arrears, but did not breach the program
ceiling on the accumulation of domestic arrears (Country Report No. 14/49, Technical Memorandum
of Understanding, ¶13) since the authorities entered into negotiations to settle the arrears
immediately. The issue was resolved with an NIA offer to exchange the Treasury Bill against a new
Treasury Bill yielding ½ percentage point higher interest, which was accepted by most of the debt
holders at end-July.
10.
Progress on structural reforms has slowed, reflecting capacity constraints, technical
assistance challenges and changes in priorities.


The authorities met the structural benchmark on establishing and operationalizing the
Inland Revenue Department (IRD) unit dedicated to program design, planning and monitoring
at end-September 2013. They also met the structural benchmark on updating the quarterly
stress tests of banks based on end-June 2013 and end-September 2013 data.



However, administrative and capacity bottlenecks factored into the delay in the
implementation of the regulations of the 2011 Civil Service Act (structural benchmark for endJuly 2013) and the submission of the Customs Law to Parliament (structural benchmark for endDecember 2013). Both measures had to be resubmitted following revisions. These actions are
now expected to be completed by end-June 2014 and end-May 2014, respectively.



Challenges with securing continuous technical assistance hampered progress in finalizing
implementing regulations to the Procurement and Contract (Administration) Act and developing
a proxy means testing for the eligibility criteria for the planned consolidated cash transfer
program (structural benchmarks for end-December 2013). The former requires technical
assistance from the World Bank, which has faced issue with funding. The authorities are
intensifying efforts to secure the required financial support to complete the measure. The latter,
which was being implemented with the assistance of UNICEF, was delayed by an unforeseen
change in the consulting staff and funding constrains. A new consultant is being identified to be
funded by a budgetary allocation and the project completion is planned by end-2014.



The authorities have postponed the draft proposal for a comprehensive pension reform
(structural benchmark for end-June 2013 (Country Report No. 14/49 ¶9)) to integrate it with the
regional initiative on pension reforms, launched by the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU).

OUTLOOK: RECOVERY WITH DOWNSIDE RISKS
11.
The outlook is positive with growth expected to reach its potential over the medium term.
Growth in 2014 is expected to accelerate to 2.7 percent, and continue to lead the ECCU countries, on the
basis of the ongoing recovery in tourism—supported by an increase in air lift—and construction, the
latter being fueled by CBI inflows and other new FDI and SIDF projects.6 The trend is expected to
continue and somewhat strengthen, contingent on the recovery envisaged in key external tourism
markets, sustained expansion of airline and hotel room capacity—the latter based on current
construction activity, new projects supported by CBI inflows and the SIDF, and a rebound of consumer
and business confidence.7 After being subdued in 2013 and 2014, inflation is expected to pick up slightly
with the rebounding domestic demand. The current account deficit is projected to widen in 2014, based
on a conservative assumption regarding CBI receipts. Without CBI receipts, the current account deficit
would remain broadly unchanged in 2014 relative to 2013.

6

Average growth during 1980-2012 was 3.9 percent.

7

CBI inflows are difficult to forecast. The medium-term framework is based on the authorities’ projections of CBI
applications fees falling sharply in 2014 to their 2011 share of GDP, reflected in their budget, and slowly declining
thereafter. Nevertheless, preliminary information suggested that inflows in the first few weeks in 2014 are continuing
at their 2013 level.

12.
Risks to this projection are broadly balanced (Annex 1). Real GDP growth in St. Kitts and
Nevis is closely related to economic developments in the U.S., and current uncertainty regarding U.S.
fiscal policy and the volatility in emerging market economies pose a definite risk. Other factors that
could undermine the recovery include the protracted parliamentary challenge that may adversely
impact the business climate, a sudden rapid diminution of inflows related to the CBI program—
including because of changes in the visa-free access for citizens of St. Kitts and Nevis—and natural
disasters. At the same time, the large inflows under the CBI program could continue at their current
rapid pace, increasing government revenues, creating additional fiscal space, and leading to higher
growth through increased investment. Such inflow would need to be managed to avoid potential
overheating. The authorities are keenly aware of their vulnerability to exogenous shocks, including
natural disasters. They note that they are now in a much stronger position to deal with such shocks,
based on their improved financial balances, the accumulation of some precautionary balances, and
their conservative treatment of CBI inflows.

MAIN THEMES OF THE ARTICLE IV DISCUSSION
The critical challenge facing St. Kitts and Nevis as it is recovering from the deep contraction of the
past four years and emerging from the fiscal and debt crisis is to secure sustainable growth. The
authorities’ strategy is based on reinvigorating tourism, developing sustainable energy sources
and strengthening the business environment. A robust and stable macroeconomic framework
conducive to growth and investment are critical elements of the strategy. This includes
implementing a sustainable medium-term fiscal path, building buffers against exogenous shocks,
and strengthening safeguards for the financial system.

A. Improving Tools for Growth
13.
The authorities are placing high priority on enhancing the GDP contribution of
tourism, the mainstay of the economy. They have made significant progress in increasing airlift
capacity to complement the increase in new hotel rooms that is already taking place and will
continue with the support of new FDI projects and the CBI real estate option.8 In addition, the new
tourism master strategy, to be finalized April 2014, reflects extensive consultation with main
stakeholders.9 It aims to develop more diversified source markets; raise the value-added of tourism
through upgraded hotel, infrastructure, and tapping into the yachting market; and increase
backward linkages. Staff recommended that the strategy also clearly identify infrastructure
shortcomings, establish guidelines for real estate development, address bottleneck in approving
high-end tourism projects under the CBI program, update institutional arrangements, and clarify the
resource requirements needed to achieve the agreed upon goals. Along with staff, the authorities
recognized the need to strengthen their statistical capacities, as an important input for tourism
policy design, and plan to develop new surveys. They stressed that the estimated growth
contribution from the stay-over tourists is underestimated since it does not factor in the change in
tourists’ country of origin (fewer tourists from the Caribbean and more from the United States) since
the global crisis, with the latter spending considerably more.
14.
The high cost of energy is reported as the most important challenge facing the private
sector in St. Kitts and Nevis, as in the rest of the Caribbean. The 2014 budget reflects the
authorities’ goal to transition to alternative sources of energy over the medium-term and their
support for the development of solar, geothermal, wind and waste-to-energy projects. To that
effect, the authorities grant tax concessions for the production of solar energy and customs duties
exemptions for the import of renewable energy and energy-efficient technologies. In partnership

high cost, the SIDF is temporarily subsidizing households’ electricity consumption (on a sliding scale
based on use and according to a three-year program expiring in 2015) and covers the customs
service charge on petroleum imports through a subsidy to the electricity company SKELEC. Staff
commended the authorities for their foresight in fostering the development of alternative sources of
energy, but cautioned on the need to monitor costs, including foregone tax revenue. In addition, it
recommended that the energy subsidies should be more targeted and be included in the budget,
rather than being provided by the SIDF.
15.
The authorities are moving quickly to improve the investment climate. According to the
2013 Doing Business Survey, the business climate rank of St. Kitts and Nevis is 96 out of
185 countries and 5th out of the 6 ECCU countries. Key areas identified for improvements are
resolving insolvency, reducing lengthy processes for paying taxes and a relatively high effective
profit tax, accessing credit, and registering property. Important steps have already been taken to
address the first two concerns, the adoption of the new Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act in 2013 and
the reduction of the

development; contribution of tourism to growth; government operations to make it more userfriendly for the private sector; framework to develop Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs); and
logistics and connectivity.
17.
The SIDF offers scope to support growth and stimulate economic activity. It currently
supports a host of programs ranging from airlift capacity, wages for on-the job-training programs,
and facilitating financing construction of both low-cost housing and luxury tourism developments.
Staff recommended that SIDF funding should be limited to productive investment that would
support growth and development, and it should not be providing subsidies which should be part of
the government budget. Moreover, the SIDF investment should be phased to ensure that its
activities do not lead to overheating, nor compete with the domestic banking system in the
provision of credit to commercial enterprises. Further, enhanced transparency regarding operating
guidelines and the project selection process, and in publishing SIDF financial statements, not
available after 2011, would provide additional safeguards for its operations. In this context, staff
recommended that the SIDF financial statement be made available with the government’s budget.
The authorities observed that the SIDF was an important motor of the economy and a key tool for
its development. They noted that their investment aimed to support a recovery in the context of the
prolonged decline and recession. They do not see SIDF activities as competing with the banking
sector, but as collaborating with the banks. They clarified that audited financial statements of the
SIDF for 2012 and 2013 would be published online by end-2014, after the asset valuation of their
investments is fully completed. Moreover, they are considering options to further improve its longterm sustainability.

B. Ensuring Medium-Term Fiscal Sustainability
18.
The staff emphasized the importance of continuing to implement a prudent and
sustainable fiscal framework that would not be reliant on high CBI inflows. Such a strategy
would be anchored in achieving the authorities’ public debt target of 60 percent of GDP by 2020
while using for budgetary purposes only a conservative amount of CBI receipts. The staff presented
a medium-term framework, consistent with the 2014 budget (Box 3) and the government’s debt
objective, and modest CBI inflows. The main underlying assumption are improvement of tax
administration and a modest widening of the tax base leading to an increase of revenues of about
1 percentage point relative to 2013; a wage bill increase consistent with the 2014 budget with
growth in subsequent years slightly below nominal GDP based on implementing civil service reform;
and constrained spending on goods and services. The framework illustrates that the authorities
could achieve their objective without undue reliance on CBI inflows, while at the same time
accommodating higher capital outlays. The authorities recognized the risk associated with undue
reliance on CBI receipts for budgetary purposes, and are continuing with the implementation of the
reforms initiated under their adjustment program that would be consistent with the proposed
medium-term fiscal framework. Indeed, they underscored that the budget is consistent with their
plans to continue to save the bulk of the CBI receipts.
19.
The authorities agreed that enhancing tax revenue must remain a priority. Receipts
from the VAT, after the first full year of its implementation in 2011, have remained disappointingly
12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. KITTS AND NEVIS

low, and total tax revenues have not yet recovered to their pre-crisis level since the sectors leading
the economic recovery have benefited from transitional VAT and customs duties exemptions. The
focus should be on:


Continuing to reform the revenue administration. The authorities plan to fully integrate the
operations of the VAT Unit and other units of the Inland Revenue Department into a functionbased administration that includes audit, enforcement, collections and refunds, providing a
critical platform for a comprehensive compliance and enforcement strategy for the VAT and the
corporate income tax.



Broadening the tax base through streamlining tax incentives (Box 2). The substantial
budgetary costs of incentives suggest an urgent need for their review and the development of a
strategy to substantially reduce them.

20.
The authorities plan to continue improving public finance management. Better
expenditure control together with an improved process of prioritization of outlays will enable further
savings on budgetary resources while delivering the public services and investment in infrastructure
needed to sustain growth. Measures include:


Civil Service reform. Following the relatively sizable increase in the wage bill in 2013 and 2014,
it is critical to proceed with the ongoing audit of the public service to streamline the civil service
and to move towards a more performance-based remuneration system. Staff cautioned that the
recent wage increases and the expansion in the wage bill to support new government initiatives
could rapidly undermine the hard earned gains over the past few years to moderate the size of
the wage bill, and underscored the need to move quickly with these reforms.



Targeting of the social safety net. The authorities see their conditional cash transfer pilot
program as a catalyst for improved targeting of all social programs, which will provide a basis to
consolidate all existing social programs offered across ministries.



Public financial management reforms. Following the full application of the Procurement Act,
the next steps should include adoption of International Public Sector Accounting Standards
(IPSAS), development of improved performance indicators to support fiscal discipline, and
strengthening internal and external budgetary audit capacities.11



Oversight of public entities and a stronger financial position. A key priority is to strengthen
the capacity of public enterprises to meet their reporting requirements under the Finance
Administration Act. Building on the recent granting of enforcement powers to the Government
Entities Oversight Board, it is particularly important that the Board intensifies its monitoring of
these entities and engages them on their business plans. In that regard, it would also be needed

11

These recommendations are in line with Sandeep, S. et al. (2012) “St. Kitts and Nevis: Proposal for SEMCAR Public
Financial Management, Technical Assistance and Related ICT Capacity Building 2012–13”, FAD, World Bank, SEMCAR,
October 2012.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

ST. KITTS AND NEVIS

to extend the Procurement Act provisions to public entities. The new management of the
electricity company (SKELEC) should prioritize improving the recovery of receipts.


The Social Security System. The government should review the parametric reform and other
recommendations proposed in the recent actuarial review of the Social Security Board, assess
the scope for their integration with the new health and unemployment insurance schemes, and
develop a timetable for their implementation.

21.
Developing a framework to manage PPPs and limit contingent fiscal liabilities is key to
using public funds efficiently and avoiding accumulating debt through indirect channels.
Establishing an overarching legal framework for PPPs would enhance the Ministry of Finance’s
control over budgetary commitments to PPP projects and help contain future contingent
government obligations. The authorities requested technical assistance to better understand the
scope of the proposed reform.
22.
Notwithstanding the significant decline in public debt following restructuring, it
remains very high and vulnerable to exogenous shocks. With continued fiscal discipline, debt is
projected to reach 66 percent of GDP by 2018, on track to achieving the ECCU region-wide target of
60 percent by 2020. This is predicated on the authorities’ commitment to maintaining fiscal
prudence and on the continuation of the economic recovery. However, should fiscal policy be
relaxed, or growth be significantly weaker, the debt would decline considerably more slowly.
Moreover, the country is very vulnerable to natural disasters. A combined shock that entails weaker
growth, higher interest rates, and larger primary balances, could see the debt-to-GDP ratio rise to
110 percent of GDP by 2018 (Annex III).

C.

Building Buffers and Providing for Critical Investments

23.
The authorities recognize that the large CBI proceeds provide a unique opportunity to
amass buffers and create fiscal space for important infrastructure investment. They are also
aware of the special challenges in terms of financial integrity and international security associated
with the program, and continue to ensure that strong safeguards are observed. Noting St. Kitts and
Nevis’ high vulnerability to exogenous shocks, the staff urged the authorities to use the exceptional
CBI inflows to build buffers and consider developing a framework, including specific norm, to save
excess CBI receipts in a stabilization fund, similarly to resource funds established by resourceexporting countries. This would help prevent CBI revenues in excess of the historical norm (staff
suggest about 2 percent of GDP with an additional 0.5 percent of GDP to cover due diligence costs)
from being used to support recurrent expenditure and/or to finance routine capital spending. The
accumulated savings could be used to:


14

Reduce public debt, especially the costlier instruments, which would lower interest costs and
expand room to borrow in case of a shock. Indeed, in the current global economy, it may not be
possible for the government to obtain higher returns than their borrowing costs without bearing
unacceptable risk.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. KITTS AND NEVIS



Stabilize government finances by withdrawals to compensate for a revenue shortfall, support
economic activity, and/or meet unforeseen expenditure to address a natural disaster or other
events (e.g., recapitalizing a systemic financial institution). These savings could also be used to
finance large lumpy infrastructure projects, although such investment should be carefully timed
to avoid exacerbating cyclical trends.

The already accumulated savings, and robust future flows, may provide scope for the government to
explore both options and develop a consensus on the optimal strategy. The authorities were
receptive to these proposals, and wanted more assistance in developing guidelines. Indeed, they
noted that were already examining option to pay down debt, factoring in the impact of penalty
costs for prepayment and possible implications of collective action clauses. At the same time, they
were also looking at ways to support critical intervention in their economy to improve medium-term
growth prospects. The staff urged caution, to ensure that savings are not expended on
unsustainable projects.

D. Securing a Stable and Productive Financial System
24.
A healthy and stable financial system that can support private sector development is
critical for enhancing medium-term growth. While the St. Kitts and Nevis financial system
remains relatively strong following the financial crisis and the debt restructuring, continued efforts
are needed to monitor and strengthen the financial sector and reinforce the supervisory framework
for non-bank financial institutions. Updated stress tests based on end-September 2013 data
remained consistent with the previous assessment (Country Report No. 14/49, ¶4) and confirmed
that the banking system remains sufficiently capitalized and liquid to weather a host of shocks.
Despite the growing liquidity, the relative weaker banks remain vulnerable to a large liquidity shock.
Strong priority should be given to facilitating the banks’ plans to implement actions to return NPLs
to the prudential requirement of below 5 percent over the medium term. In this context, the current
protracted proceedings for realization of non-performing assets through the courts may be a
significant challenge for banks. The new Bankruptcy and Insolvency bill introduced in Parliament in
July 2013 is a step in the right direction. The agenda for updating ECCU foreclosure legislation
should also be accelerated. In addition, the impact of the debt/land swap on the banking system
will continue to warrant particular attention. In that regard, it is key to engage the process of selling
the lands on a timely basis while ensuring that the operational guidelines of the SPV are aligned
with best practices (prior action for the completion of the seventh and eight review), including with
respect to securing competitive sales prices. Fund and World Bank staff are collaborating toward a
regional approach to implement the ECCU’s comprehensive bank resolution strategy. Vigilance will
be needed to manage the potential spillovers from the challenges facing the other ECCU banks.
25.
The staff urged the continued implementation of the CARTAC/World Bank reform
program for strengthening the supervisory framework of the non-bank financial sector. The
focus should be on building capacity for on-site and off-site supervision and strengthening
reporting requirements. Moreover, swift issuance of the regulations supporting the FSRC Act would
enhance its supervisory powers and leverage the efforts by credit unions to raise their regulatory
capital to 10 percent by October 2014, in line with the Cooperative Societies Act. The FSRC should
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

ST. KITTS AND NEVIS

also maintain its close monitoring of the insurance industry. The adoption and implementation of
the Insurance and Private Pension Plan Act will strengthen the protection of insurance policy holders
and firms’ reporting requirements.

REVIEW AND POLICY ISSUES
The staff agreed on the 2014 fiscal program consistent with the authorities’ budget, and a revised
structural reform program for the remainder of the arrangement. The underlying objective is to
secure medium-term fiscal sustainability, continue on the downward debt trajectory, and
accelerate implementation of structural reforms critical for growth.
26.
Notwithstanding some spending overruns, the 2013 December program targets are
expected to be met with an ample margin. The main spending overruns are related to the extra
month of wages granted in September to civil servants and pensioners (about 0.7 percent of GDP),
additional increase in the wage bill reflecting some new government initiatives, the transfer of the
cost of due diligence for the CBI to budget (also reflected in higher CBI fees), the higher cost of
government electricity consumption following the installation of meters by SKELEC, and professional
fees for the debt restructuring. Tax revenues are expected to be broadly aligned with program
targets. The large CBI inflows suggest that the government will have no difficulty meeting the endDecember 2013 fiscal performance criteria.
27.
The 2014 fiscal program is consistent with the medium-term strategy to reduce debtto-GDP to 60 percent by 2020. It is built on significantly lower CBI receipts than in 2013, further
mobilization of revenues, wage increases announced in the budget as well some additional wage
cost associated with new government initiatives, containment of other current expenditures, and
higher capital spending. Moreover, the authorities are committed to saving part of the CBI receipts,
and as an indication of this commitment, they agreed on an adjustor for changes in CBI receipts
relative to the amount in the budget. The primary surplus target for 2014 under the program is

Net of these factors, the primary surplus would have been about 0.7 percent of GDP stronger than in
2013.
29.
Underlying the 2014 fiscal program are policy commitments to continue with public
sector reforms. These include:


Step up revenue reform. The government implemented the Large and Medium Taxpayers Unit
in early 2014, and is assigning a high priority to audit operations. They also intend to strengthen
the post-clearance enforcement of the Customs and Excise Department (CED) and fully
harmonize and modernize all procedures. It is fully integrating the operations of the VAT Unit
and other units of the IRD into a function-based administration. The CED has developed risk
management practices and will integrate these into the ASYCUDA World system planned for
implementation in 2014. The government is also taking steps to limit tax exemptions and is
allowing the transitional VAT exemptions to expire, as scheduled for end-2013.



Commitment to a viable wage bill for 2014 and the medium-term debt sustainability. The
2014 budget, introduced on December 10, provides for wage bill increases of 4, 3 and 3 percent
over 2014–2016, together with incremental increases equivalent to about 2 percent of the wage
bill each year. The budget also provided some additional increase in hiring for implementing
new government initiatives. The government plans to proceed with the civil service reform over
the medium term, including the wage bill audit. Based on these reforms, the share of the wage
bill in GDP is projected to modestly decline over the next few years.

30.
The authorities are committed to completing the debt restructuring. The bulk of the
debt/land swap was completed, and the remaining swap (representing 11 percent of GDP) is
planned for this year. In addition, the authorities plan to issue in the coming days operational
guidelines for the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), aligned with best international practices (prior
action), in order to launch land sales. The NIA also expects to finalize its agreement on a debt/land
swap with the St. Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla National Bank. This will yield immediate budgetary savings on
interest costs and fees for debt advisors. The authorities continue with their negotiations with nonParis Club creditors.
31.
The authorities are pressing forward with their program of structural reforms.
Submitting the new Customs Law to Parliament is necessary to strengthen the CED’s authority to
conduct post-clearance audits. The authorities are committed to do so by end-May 2014. Moreover,
implementing the regulations to the Civil Service Act is a key step towards creating a more efficient
civil service by enhancing accountability of civil servants including with specifying procedures for
12

With the debt/land swap, the government’s interest bill fell in line with the amount of debt swapped for land; at
the same time, the government is committed to pay a dividend of 3.5 percent to the banks on the unsold lands held
by the SPV. This payment is classified as a transfer.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

ST. KITTS AND NEVIS

disciplinary actions. Completing this action by end-June 2014 will send a strong signal that the
agenda for civil service reform is progressing. Going forward, having provided the required funding
in the 2014 budget, the authorities intend to finalize the proxy means-test for cash transfers by end2014. This important feature of social safety net reform would transform the mode of attribution of
social transfers into a comprehensive rules-based system. Meanwhile, the authorities are targeting
implementation of a pilot program for conditional cash transfers by end-June 2014 and conducting
a host of other structural reforms that will improve their business environment and macro fiscal
management.
32.
The authorities are requesting waivers of non-observance for the continuous
performance criterion on external arrears and of applicability for the end-December
performance criteria. There were two instances of minor and temporary accumulation of external
arrears that were quickly repaid. One of these instances resulted from unforeseen circumstances
beyond the authorities’ control and the authorities adopted measures to prevent a recurrence of the
second type of situation. While the controlling performance criteria for the seventh and eighth
review are end-December, the authorities are seeking a waiver of applicability due to unavailability
of data to assess them.
33.
The authorities are requesting that the ninth and tenth reviews be combined and the
purchase available after March 15, 2014, currently associated with the ninth review, be
rephased to be made available after June 15, 2014. This reflects the delay that have already taken
place in completing the seventh and eight reviews, with the missions delayed from September 2013
to January 2014 that followed staff turnover and the authorities’ request for accommodation for
budget preparations. The authorities have indicated that in view of the strong improvement in the
public finances and the strengthening of the external position, they intend to treat the Stand-By
Arrangement as precautionary for the remainder of the program period, and they do not plan to
request to purchase the remaining amounts under the arrangement. This is part of their plan to
review how to use the additional resources to accelerate debt reduction.
34.
Capacity to repay the Fund is adequate and risk remains manageable. Repayment to the
Fund will peak in 2015 and 2016 and will reach 10 and 10.9 percent of revenues and grants, and
10.6 and 11.2 percent of exports of goods and services in these years (Table 8). This is somewhat
less than anticipated at the time of the request for an the arrangement where the debt services on
GRA credit was projected to be 11.7 percent of central government revenues in both years and
about 11.8 and 11.6 percent of exports of goods and service (Country Report No. 11/270). In percent
of imputed reserves, the planned debt service to the Fund is half of that envisaged at the time of the
request for a Fund arrangement, 10.3 and 12.1 percent compared to 22.3 and 24 percent. In view of
the improved fiscal and external position, the capacity to repay the Fund has improved since the
program was approved and the risk is manageable.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
Considerable progress has been achieved under the three year arrangement. Growth
has resumed after four years of decline and stagnation, reflecting a recovery in tourism and a strong
pick up in construction associated with the CBI program and other tourism-related investments.
Inflation has abated following the introduction of the VAT. The external position has significantly
strengthened, due to the recovery in tourism receipts and strong CBI fees, as well as increased
capital inflows, which have contributed to the increase in international reserves since the start of the
SBA. The outlook is positive, with growth expected to accelerate in 2014, and reach its potential over
the medium term based on the continued recovery in tourism and construction, the latter being
fueled by CBI inflows and other new FDI projects.
36.
The strengthening in the fiscal position has surpassed expectations. The improved fiscal
performance reflects both policy efforts and the large increase in CBI receipts. The authorities took
significant steps to improve public finances, including implementing the VAT and strengthening the
tax and custom administrations. At the same time, there was substantial increase in revenues
associated with the CBI program. Nonetheless, the authorities contained spending, including with a
freeze in general hiring and the nominal wage bill through end-August 2013. The staff commends
the authorities for their prudence with the greater-than-anticipated CBI revenues and the
accumulation of fiscal buffers.
37.
Public debt was successfully reduced, to an estimated 105 percent of GDP in 2013
from 164 percent in 2010. This is the result of external debt restructuring and a debt-for-land swap
with commercial banks. Public debt is on track to decline to the ECCU region-wide target of
60 percent of GDP by 2020, predicated on the authorities’ commitment to maintaining fiscal
prudence and continue with reforms, and a sustained economic recovery. Staff cautions that the
target may not be met should fiscal policy be relaxed or if growth weakens.
38.
Major reforms have been undertaken in the context of the program although the pace
of implementation has slowed. The authorities have made considerable progress towards
strengthening public financial management, including the amendment of legislation to
strengthening the oversight of public enterprises, the adopting of a medium-term expenditure
framework and a medium-term debt management strategy, improving revenue administration, and
moving forward with a plan for civil service reform, a new Procurement Act, and reforming the social
safety net. Nevertheless, capacity constraints and other issues have recently slowed the pace of
implementation. Staff urged the authorities to re-invigorated the implementation of reform agenda.
The remaining measures in the program would yield further fiscal savings, and a more efficient and
productive public sector that could better support a more dynamic private sector.
39.
Notwithstanding substantially improved external and domestic balances,
vulnerabilities and risks remain. St. Kitts and Nevis, like the rest of the ECCU countries, are highly
dependent on development in the U.S. and advanced economies. The risk stemming from the global
economy remains relatively high, and the implication for tourism, the mainstay of the economy, is

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

ST. KITTS AND NEVIS

similarly elevated. This is compounded by the uncertainty related to the CBI program, and
vulnerability to natural disaster. At the same time, in the near term, there may also be some upside
risk related to the CBI inflows, which may continue at their current rapid pace. While the reduction in
the debt-to-GDP ratio has been significant, the debt remains high, and highly vulnerable to external
shocks.
40.
The priority going forward must continue to center on growth, bolstering
competitiveness and improving employment opportunities. The modest performance of tourism
reflects competitiveness and growth challenges. The government aims to increase tourism by more
targeted marketing, fostering expansion of airlift and hotel capacities, and improving infrastructure.
It also aims to reduce energy cost by supporting the development of alternative energy sources.
Critical reforms to improve the investment climate are also being planned. The staff commends
these initiatives. The authorities will need to ensure that these measures are cost-effective and yield
the expected results, and be ready to review the strategy as needed.
41.
A critical element of the growth strategy is a sustainable medium-term
macroeconomic framework and continued progress with debt reduction. Stronger fiscal
balances and lower debt will reduce vulnerability together with the risk of sharp adjustment and
public sector retrenchment, and will provide for adequate resources for continued infrastructure
maintenance and improvements. Staff commends the authorities’ plans to save a large portion of
CBI receipts for precautionary purposes and reducing public debt and supports their efforts to
manage the CBI program carefully. Continued fiscal reform to improve tax revenues and contain
expansion of current spending, in particular, the wage bill, is the strongest safeguard against future
exogenous shocks. In this regard, the staff urges the authorities to exert more restraint in granting
future wage increases and in public sector hiring, and to continue with their efforts to strengthen tax
administration, reduce tax exemptions, and proceed with the Public Financial Management reforms.
42.
A stable financial system, which can play its appropriate role in providing credit to the
private sector, is also critical in supporting continued growth. The commercial banks have
remained resilient, notwithstanding the depth of the economic decline and the impact of the debt
restructuring. Nevertheless, the near term poses some challenge for banks’ profit and capital and
progress in reducing their NPLs, as planned, will be key to ensure that they retain their relatively
sound position. The new supervisory framework for credit unions has led to an increase in their
capitalization, but continued efforts will be needed, including a strengthening of FSRC’s sanctioning
powers to ensure further consolidation of credit unions’ balance sheets. Close monitoring of
developments in the financial sector of the other ECCU economies will be needed to minimize
potential for contagion. While linkages would appear to be minimal, continued vigilance and
readiness for prompt action are needed.
43.
Staff supports the request for the completion of the seventh and eight review under
the Stand-By Arrangement, the granting of waivers, and the rephasing of the last two
purchases. The requests for waivers are related to the nonobservance of the performance criterion
on the accumulation of external arrears on government and government-guaranteed debt, and
waivers for the applicability for end-December 2013 performance criteria. The staff support these
request as the authorities continue to demonstrate their commitment to achieving the objectives of
the SBA, including to save the bulk of the proceeds from the CBI application fees, reinforced by the

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. KITTS AND NEVIS

inclusion of an adjustor on these receipts. The authorities have also reaffirmed their commitment to
completing most of the structural reforms under the program. The temporary reoccurrences of
arrears are regrettable, but new measures are being taken by the Development Bank of St. Kitts and
Nevis to avoid such occurrences. Further, preliminary data suggest that the end-December 2013
performance criteria were met. The staff supports the authorities’ intention to combine the
remaining reviews and treat the program as precautionary.
44.
The next Article IV consultation is expected to take place on a 24-month cycle, in
accordance with the Board decision on Article IV consultation cycles as applied to countries
with a Fund arrangement.

Box 1. Macroeconomic Linkages of the Citizenship-by-Investment Program
Inflows under the Citizenship-by-Investment (CBI) program have sharply grown beginning in 2010.1
The St. Kitts and Nevis program, established in 1984, is one of the oldest of its kind in the world. New
programs are being introduced in several countries, including in Antigua and Barbuda and Grenada.2 Their
recent popularity appears to be fueled by wealthy clients from emerging economies and the Middle East
searching for a safe haven as well as ease of worldwide travel.
CBI brings three different types of

CBI inflows have had a significant impact on the
country’s fiscal performance. Fees are recorded as
non tax revenue and account for an increasingly large
share of budgetary revenue, from about 1 percent of
total revenues in 2007 to 22 percent in 2012, and an
estimated 37 percent in 2013. Revenues were further
increased by investment proceeds from SIDF about
1.1 percent of GDP during 2010–2012, also recorded
under non-tax revenue. In addition, the SIDF also
provides capital grants to the budget.

funding to various economic and social programs. These include subsidies for electricity consumers, and
grants to tourism, agriculture, and education sectors, as well as support for training program and other
social activities. In addition, the SIDF is funding mortgage lending and small business loans through the
banking system, and investing in bonds and equities in public and private entities.4 The SIDF holds its
undisbursed assets, estimated at about EC$105 million at end 2011 in the domestic banking system.

Box 2. Tax Incentives in St. Kitts and Nevis
While the estimated revenue forgone from tax incentives has declined since 2009, it remained significant in
2012, at 6 percent of GDP and 30 percent of tax revenue.
In addition to being costly, tax incentives may be poorly targeted measures as they do not necessarily
benefit the sector for which they were initially intended given shortcomings in tax administration. Tourism
represented one-half of the share of the estimated revenue forgone, while the share of incentives to industry
was relatively small.

Authority to grant tax incentives is highly decentralized, which may cause their proliferation. There are a host
of tax incentives available in St. Kitts and Nevis, offered under different laws (the Fiscal Incentives Act, the
Small Business Development Act, the Income Tax Act, the Stamp Act for Special Development Areas, the
Special Resort Development Act, the VAT Act, the Hotels Aid Act, and the Duty Free Shop Act). Furthermore,
many incentives are available at the discretion of the Minister of Tourism or other Cabinet ministers.
Broadening the tax base by reducing tax incentives would yield sizeable revenue and/or permit lower tax
rates, which would stimulate growth. The government’s initiative to limit concessions to EC$100 million
(4.7 percent of GDP) in 2014 is an important first step. The staff recommended developing a comprehensive
strategy which would include preparing a full tax expenditure budget for the 2015 budget and further
curtailing tax holidays. Centralizing the power to grant and manage tax incentives in the Ministry of Finance
and moving from discretionary to rules-based concessions system would help contain them.

Box 3. Main Features of the 2014 Budget of St. Kitts and Nevis
The 2014 Budgets1 signal the authorities’ intention to continue the fiscal consolidation effort, with a
moderate increase in tax revenue, conservative projections for receipts from the CBI (8.3 percentage points
below CBI earnings for 2013), and a further decline in current outlays (as a percent of GDP).
The budget addresses the major strategic challenges in support of sustainable economic growth. The
guiding principles are:
Expansion of expenditure must be moderate and measured in line with the growth of tax revenues.




The use of the surplus resources generated by the CBI program will be heavily biased towards
investment spending to improve the country’s productive capacity.

The implementation of the structural reform agenda will be accelerated and includes continuation
of the public financial management program, business climate enhancement, pension reform, public sector
modernization and the re-engineering of the social service delivery system.

Fiscal Measures:
a.

b.
c.

d.
e.

Contain the increase in the wage bill and civil service pensions to 4 percent in 2014 and 3 percent
in 2015 and 2016, and an incremental adjustment of 2 percent of the wage bill each year. This
measure is also accompanied by a commitment to a formal review of the wage bill every 3 years.
Future increment payments are to be linked to productivity.
Review the system for administering tax concessions with the objective of employing a more
consistent methodology for estimating revenues foregone and their impact.
Implement the first phase of the universal health care scheme, which will focus on providing
insurance coverage to the uninsured and vulnerable sections of the population at an estimated
cost of EC$5 million.
Provide unemployment benefit as partial income replacement to Social Security contributors who
are temporarily unemployed and actively seeking employment.
Upgrade the computer technology at both the Customs and Excise Department and Inland
Revenue Department to further facilitate e-business.

Major Projects/Initiatives:
a.
b.

c.
d.
e.

Complete upgrade of the South East Peninsula road.
Enhance berthing infrastructure at the cargo pier to accommodate larger cruise ships and
undertake the construction of a second pier at the cruise ship facility. The pier is estimated to cost
in the region of US$31 million.
Restructure the Statistical Department into an independent statistics agency.
Construct three hundred homes powered by solar panels, in partnership with the SIDF.
Construct 100 affordable-homes under the housing development program in Nevis.

Policy Response

Unresolved parliamentary challenges in St.
Kitts. A protracted parliamentary challenge may
reduce business confidence and adversely impact
private domestic and foreign investment.

Medium

High

Continue with fiscal consolidation, save the bulk
of CBI receipts and further prioritize public
investment according to expected impact on
growth.

Fiscal policy shock in the United States.
A protracted failure to agree on a credible plan to
ensure fiscal sustainability could lead to a
sustained loss in confidence increasing the
sovereign risk premium and bond yields, which
would depress US economic activity, with harmful
spillovers for growth in St. Kitts and Nevis.

Low

High

Safeguard the fiscal position by intensifying
efforts in revenue administration and rationalizing
current expenditure while prioritizing growthenhancing infrastructure investment. Build
precautionary balances by saving the bulk of CBI
receipts. Form contingency plans for additional
measures.

Natural disasters. As in the rest of the Caribbean,
natural disasters are occurring more frequently,
resulting in substantial damage to infrastructure
and entailing large reconstruction costs.

Medium
to High

High

Formulate adequate budgetary provisions for
disaster mitigation. Coordinate with the World
Bank to build resilience to climate change.

Financial contagion from other countries in the
region. Banking difficulties experienced in other
countries of the region would impact banks in St.
Kitts and Nevis through a contagion effect rather
than via interbank linkages, which remain relatively
weak.

Medium

Medium
to High

Coordinate with the ECCU to strengthen banking
supervision and regulation procedures and form
contingency plans for the event of severe
financial stress, including drawing on the
resources from the Banking Sector Reserve Fund.

End visa-free access to St. Kitts and Nevis
citizens to Canada and Schengen countries.
A change in foreign countries’ policy decisions
pertaining to visitors from St. Kitts and Nevis can
abruptly reduce the number of applicants to the
CBI program and related inflows to the budget and
the SIDF. It would also reduce FDI in real estate.

Medium

High

Implement adequate safeguards to minimize risks
related to financial integrity and international
safety. Reduce reliance on CBI revenues for
government spending; build precautionary
balances by saving the bulk of CBI receipts; devise
a financial strategy to ensure the medium-term
viability of the SIDF and articulate a more
diversified strategy for the development of real
estate projects.

Slow pace of land sales in the context of the
debt/land swap. The St. Kitts and Nevis
indigenous banks would suffer a loss of income in
the event of sluggish land sales, impacting their
capitalization over the medium-term and capacity
to extend credit to the private sector.

Medium
to High

Medium

Coordinate with the ECCU to form contingency
plans in the event of severe financial stress.

Sharp slowdown in China. Sharply reduced
returns on investment, bankruptcies, and large
financial losses could reduce the number of
Chinese applicants to the CBI program.

Medium

High

Reduce reliance on CBI revenues for government
spending; build precautionary balances by saving
the bulk of CBI receipts; devise a financial

Annex II. St. Kitts and Nevis: External Sector Assessment
The relatively weak performance of tourism over the past several years points to
competitiveness and growth challenges. The real effective exchange rate (REER) may also be
overvalued.
1.

The CGER-type analysis presents
mixed results, but suggests that the
REER may be elevated.




The equilibrium real exchange rate
(ERER) indicates that the REER has
appreciated from its equilibrium
since 2011, but remains within the
10 percent confidence interval.1

The macro-balance (MB) approach suggests a
considerable overvaluation based on the high
current account deficits. This reflects in part the
high import content of FDI. Net of FDIassociated imports, the implied overvaluation
would be less.

The coefficients are derived from a large sample, and suggest that an increase in government spending would be
consistent with a more appreciated equilibrium exchange rate, since a greater portion would be spent on nontradable goods, everything else equal. However, this framework is not well suited for small open economies with high
propensity to import.

The external sustainability (ES) methodology
points to some degree of undervaluation. The
significant growth in capital transfers in recent
years renders the current account balance
sustainable and indicates that it can
accommodate an even larger current account
deficit. However, this reflects the high inflows

Stay-over arrivals to St. Kitts and Nevis show some recovery in 2013 but they are still
underperforming compared to other tourism-dependent economies. The seasonally
adjusted series shows the twin island’s share of stay-over visitors to the ECCU declining since
early 2006, and deteriorating following Hurricane Omar in 2008 which destroyed one of the
largest hotels in the country. There has been some upturn in the trend since the financial
crisis. Moreover, there has been a change in composition of tourist arrivals; with a decline in
the share of tourist from the region. This suggests that although there are a smaller number
of arrivals, the average spending is higher. Cruise ship arrivals have grown rapidly since
2008, notwithstanding the financial crisis.

The quality and quantity of hotel stock are low relative to other ECCU countries. This is being
addressed with the construction of approximately 350 additional rooms, in part financed by
investment under the CBI program, and by major upgrades planned for two large hotels.
Completion of these projects will boost the sector’s competitiveness.

The new reserve adequacy metric cannot be constructed for St. Kitts and Nevis due to data limitations.

3

Government’s increasing deposits in the banking system, together with the reserves position would help buffer St.
Kitts and Nevis against a potential interruption or change in its agreement with Petro Caribe on the financing of
petroleum imports. Moreover, the St. Kitts and Nevis Petro Caribe Company established a “sinking fund” in 2012
which is financed by the accumulated savings from a portion of the Petro Caribe arrangement.
4

Individual economies within a currency union, like all other economies, can be subject to balance of payments
shocks. As such they also require external buffers, even if they have no currency to defend. However, with a common
central bank (ECCB) holding an adequate level of reserves and ensuring adequate liquidity within the union, there
may be less need for individual members to cover their reserve needs through their own reserves.

Annex III. Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)
Substantial progress has been made in reducing public debt from 164 percent of GDP in 2010 to
a projected 105 percent in 2013, primarily through debt restructuring and fiscal adjustments.
Notwithstanding progress to date, public debt remains high. Under the baseline scenario, public
debt is projected to continue to decline to 60 percent of GDP by 2020 with continued fiscal
discipline, further fiscal reform, and a recovery in economic growth. Gross financing needs remain
very high over the medium term. Further, the analysis suggests that St. Kitts and Nevis’ public
debt is highly vulnerable to growth and natural disaster shocks.

A. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis1
1.
Exogenous events and deteriorating fiscal primary balances led to a dramatic rise in
the public debt over a very short period. During 1997–2005, debt climbed by an average of
12.3 percent of GDP a year, of which 10.2 percentage points were due to events and other shocks
and 4.1 percentage points were due to the worsening of fiscal primary balances (excluding grants),
while the net effect of interest payments and output growth tempered the accumulation by
1.2 percentage points. 2 By 2010, the public debt-to-GDP ratio reached 164 percent of GDP, one of
the highest in the world, with interest costs of 24.7 percent of fiscal revenues. Central government
debt accounted for 80 percent of total public sector debt. The remainder of this analysis focuses on
total public sector debt.

To address this critical situation, the authorities implemented a strong fiscal
adjustment program in mid-2010 combined with a debt restructuring strategy. The debt
restructuring strategy comprised three elements:

(1) Bondholders and external commercial creditors had their debt instruments exchanged for
new instruments, which saw them take significant haircuts averaging 65 percent in NPV
terms.
(2) Domestic banks, which held about 31 percent of government total debt in 2010, acquired
government lands that had been used to secure the loans. The government also pledged to
identify and transfer additional lands to cover unsecured government debt held by the
banks.
(3) The government rescheduled external debt with Paris Club and other bilateral creditors,
lowering the interest rates and extending the amortization payments.
The remaining debt, mainly Treasury bills and obligations to multilateral organizations including the
CDB, was not part of the restructuring package.
3.
The debt restructuring is nearly complete, with the debt projected to decline to
105 percent of GDP by end-2013. Domestic debt is projected to fall from 114.4 percent of GDP in
2010 to 62.4 percent in 2013, reflecting mainly the debt-land swap with commercial banks. External
debt is projected to fall more moderately from 49.5 percent in 2010 to 42.5 percent of GDP primarily
because of the debt exchange with bondholders and external commercial creditors. Over 2012–20,
external amortization and interest are envisaged to be cumulatively reduced by an annual average
of 1 percent and 0.2 percent of GDP respectively

Medium-Term Debt Sustainability Analysis
4.
The baseline scenario is predicated on the authorities’ continued fiscal prudence and
economic recovery. Assumptions are as follows:


Debt restructuring: agreements are reached with the remaining official bilateral creditors in
line with the Paris Club terms (3.5 percent of GDP); and additional lands are transferred to
extinguish the remaining domestic debt identified in the debt-for-land swap agreement
(11.5 percent of GDP).3 4



Growth and Inflation: Over the medium-term, real economic activity reaches its potential rate
of 3 percent while inflation reverts to its historical average rate of 2.5 percent.



Fiscal Balance: The primary fiscal surplus of the public sector is estimated to moderate to
3.6 percent by 2018, premised on moderate CBI inflows (of 3 percent of GDP).

5.
Notwithstanding the substantial progress with debt restructuring, the heat map and
fan charts show that risks to debt sustainability remain high. Although the debt is on a
downward trajectory, both the debt and the gross financing needs exceed the benchmark for
emerging market economies and will do so for some time. Moreover, under the various stress tests,
debt declines considerably slower than in the baseline scenario, particularly under the real GDP
growth shock. The debt profile is also subject to high risks from external financing requirements, as
a result of high current account deficits. The fan charts show the possible evolution of the debt-toGDP ratio over the medium term, based on both a symmetric and an asymmetric distribution of
risks. The asymmetric fan chart (where only negative shocks to growth and the exchange rate are
considered) shows that debt would approach 120 percent of GDP by 2018 if economic conditions
were to significantly deteriorate.
6.
The projection bias evident in the baseline macro assumptions can be explained by
one-off historic factors. The past forecasts of real GDP growth underestimated the severity of the
global financial crisis impact on tourism in ECCU countries. In addition, there are significant forecast
errors for the primary balance in 2011 and 2012 (underestimating the primary surplus) because the
vast increase in CBI inflows was unanticipated. The inflation forecast errors are comparable to that of
other countries with Fund-supported programs, although the projection for 2011 overestimated the
impact of the introduction of the VAT.
7.
CBI inflows distort the measure of the average cyclically adjusted primary balance
(CAPB) in the forecast period. The estimated change in the cyclically adjusted primary surplus
3

This debt is related to public enterprise debt and therefore does not feature as exceptional financing for the central
government.

4

The public gross financing needs reflected in the heat map (Figure 4), and as shown in Figures 6, 7 and 8 for
2013-14 do not include debt cancellation from the debt-land swap with domestic banks.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

43

ST. KITTS AND NEVIS

from 2014 to 2017, a decline of 1.8 percent of GDP, is at the lower end of the distribution of
adjustments historically achieved by advanced and emerging economies with debt greater than
60 percent of GDP. However, the average CAPB for the period 2012–2014 is in the top quartile of the
distribution, reflecting large CBI inflows during 2012–13, which were mostly saved. The primary
balance required to stabilize debt at the 2018 level (66 percent of GDP) is -1.1 percent of GDP, lower
than the 3.6 primary surpluses in the medium-term fiscal framework. The constant primary balance
scenario show a very rapid but unrealistic decline in debt, reflecting the very high primary balance in
2013 of 17.3 percent, which is the result of high CBI inflows which are not projected to continue at
their current pace.
8.
Under the baseline scenario the debt-to-GDP ratio converges to 66 percent of GDP by
2018 but remains sensitive to shocks, especially if a combination of them were to materialize.


Under a growth shock that lowers output by 4.5 percentage points (1 standard deviation of
growth over the past 10 years) relative to that projected in 2014 and 2015 and lower
inflation by 1.2 percentage points in each year, debt would peak at 102.6 percent in 2015,
17.4 points higher than in the baseline.



A sustained interest rate shock of 568 bps (difference between the maximum and average
rates over the last 10 years) would slow down the rate of debt decline in the medium term,
so that by 2018 the debt-to-GDP ratio is 4.3 points higher compared with the baseline.



A primary balance shock of 5.2 percentage points over 2014–15 (½ standard deviations of
the historical 10-year average) results in the debt-to-GDP ratio being 4.5 percentage points
higher in 2018 relative to the baseline.



A combined macro-fiscal shock of all of the above would lead to debt peaking at
113.3 percent of GDP in 2015, 28.1 percentage points higher than under the baseline, and
declining gradually to 96.9 percent of GDP by 2018.



A natural disaster shock occurring in 2014 that results in real GDP growth declining by 3 and
2 percentage points in 2014 and 2015 compared to the baseline, and a deterioration in the
primary balance of 5, 4, and 2 percent of GDP in 2014, 2015 and 2016 respectively, would
slow the decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio to 80.0 percent by 2018, 14.4 points above the
baseline.



A contingent liability shock related to the debt/land swap, which would require the
recapitalization of banks up to required prudential limits would slow the gross public debt
trajectory to 75.7 percent of GDP by 2018 and increases gross financing needs to
26.7 percent of GDP. 5

9.
St. Kitts and Nevis external public debt is projected to decline over the medium term,
but remains vulnerable to a deterioration in the current account balance. St. Kitts and Nevis’
external debt is expected to remain on a downward trend over the medium term reflecting the
external debt restructuring and repayment to the Fund, falling to below 20 percent of GDP by 2018.
In addition to the lower debt service resulting from the external debt restructuring, solid FDI inflows
would help finance the current account deficit. Stress tests indicate that external debt would
continue to decline under interest rate, growth, real depreciation and combined shocks. Although its
level is still lower than the 2013 level, debt stays relatively high under the current account shock
scenario, suggesting that some external adjustment would be necessary to bring the debt path back
to a downward trend under the shock.

regional CAR prudential requirement of 8 percent would be EC$253 million or 10 percent of GDP.

yellow if country value is between the lower and upper risk-assessment benchmarks. If data are unavailable or indicator is not relevant, cell is white.
Lower and upper risk-assessment benchmarks are: 200 and 600 basis points for bond spreads; 5 and 15 percent of GDP for external financing requirement; 0.5 and 1
percent for change in the share of short-term debt; 15 and 45 percent for the public debt held by non-residents; and 20 and 60 percent for the share of foreign-currency
denominated debt.
4/ St Kitts and Nevis is not rated by the credit rating agencies, and no bond spread information is available
5/ External financing requirement is defined as the sum of current account deficit, amortization of medium and long-term total external debt, and short-term total external
debt at the end of previous period.

1/ Plotted distribution includes program countries, percentile rank refers to all countries.
2/ Projections made in the spring WEO vintage of the preceding year. St Kitts and Nevis does not have historic WEO forecasts for either primary balance
or expenditure/revenues/interest expenditure between 2005 and 2010, as a result the forecast errors are not available.
3/ Not applicable for St. Kitts and Nevis as there has not been a 3-year positive output gap.
4/ Data cover annual obervations from 1990 to 2011 for advanced and emerging economies with debt greater than 60 percent of GDP. Percent of sample on vertical axis. Realism assessment conducted over forecasts from 2014.

1/ Public sector is defined as consolidated public sector, including 14 public enterprises.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ The public gross financing needs do not include debt cancellation from the debt-land swap operation.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period. The residual negative effect on debt
creating flows in 2012, 2013 and 2014 includes the impact of the debt restructuring on the stock of debt.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Annex IV. Main Recommendations from the 2011 Article IV
Consultation and Follow Up
1.
The Executive Board completed the 2011 Article IV consultation on July 27, 2011
together with the request for a Three-year Stand-By Arrangement. Executive Directors noted
then that a gradual recovery was underway after a two-year recession. They also observed that the
unsustainably high public debt-to-GDP ratio presented a significant challenge that called for
decisive actions. They supported the three-pronged reform agenda based on fiscal consolidation, a
comprehensive debt restructuring and further strengthening of the financial sector, including the
oversight of the non-bank financial institutions.
2.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ adjustment program of fiscal consolidation
including the VAT, an increase in electricity tariffs and the freezing of the wage bill. Directors
remarked that the real exchange rate was somewhat overvalued and stressed the importance of
addressing this situation by fully implementing the authorities’ structural reform agenda.
3.
Since then, the recovery took longer to materialize than expected, having only begun
in 2013 while inflation abated in 2012, after the first full year of the VAT implementation. The
fiscal position has substantially improved, from a deficit of 7.8 percent of GDP in 2010 to a projected
surplus of 10.6 percent of GDP in 2013, reflecting policy efforts and substantial non-tax revenue,
from the Citizenship by Investment (CBI) program vastly exceeding expectations in 2013. The
authorities have taken the following policy actions:


The nominal wage bill freeze was maintained from 2010 until September 2013, when the
government awarded the thirteenth month wage. Other spending was also contained, and
capital spending was reduced.



Electricity tariffs have remained unchanged since February 2011. The electricity company—
corporatized in August 2011—has received a subsidy from the Sugar Industry Diversification
Foundation (SIDF) to help cover the costs of this tariff freeze.



The restructuring of public debt was launched with a debt exchange with external
commercial creditors, a rescheduling of external debt with Paris Club creditors, and a swap
of government-owned land for the public debt held by domestic banks completed, reducing
public debt from 164 percent of GDP in 2010 to a projected 105 percent of GDP in 2013.



The Financial Services Regulatory Commission (FSRC) assumed responsibility for credit
unions in 2012. It is implementing a new supervisory framework based on the PEARLS
prudential rating.



To improve the medium-term structure of the budget, there were reforms to boost revenue
and streamline expenditure. These included: an extensive program to reform revenue
administration; rationalization of the LPG subsidy, development of a plan for civil service
reform, measures to reform the social safety net, adoption of a medium-term fiscal
framework and an explicit medium-term debt management strategy. Furthermore,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

53

ST. KITTS AND NEVIS

Parliament approved the Procurement Act in October 2012 and provisions strengthening the
enforcement authority of the Government Entities Oversight Board in July 2013.


54

Competitiveness remains a challenge. The government is taking steps to strengthen the
tourism sector, including by adding airlift capacity and enhancing the tourism infrastructure.
It is investing in alternative energy sources to reduce energy cost in the long-term, and it is
implementing reforms to improve the business climate. Measures in that regard include the
reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35 to 33 percent in 2013.

Appendix I. Letter of Intent
Basseterre, St. Kitts
March 4, 2014
Ms. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington DC, 20431

Dear Ms. Lagarde:
We have progressed a long way towards meeting the original goals of our home grown economic
program, to restore fiscal sustainability, finalize a debt restructuring to address the debt overhang
and put debt on a sustainable downward trajectory and strengthen the financial sector, despite a
challenging economic environment. We have reduced our debt burden and made it more
sustainable through debt restructuring and fiscal consolidation, thereby lowering the debt-to-GDP
ratio to about 105 percent at end-2013 from 154 percent at end-2011. We have implemented
various reforms that improved the public finances and strengthened the resilience of the financial
sector. Consequently, the economy is now in a better position to support the resumption of growth.
Economic activity advanced by 1.7 percent in 2013, the first year of positive growth in the last five
years, driven by continuing improvements in the performance of the tourism sector and increased
construction activity.
The Government of St. Kitts and Nevis reaffirms its commitment to the success of its home-grown
medium-term reform program (supported by the Fund’s Stand-By Arrangement (SBA)), which will
benefit the people of St. Kitts and Nevis. Since the SBA was approved in July 2011, we have been
determined to further our reform agenda and successfully implement our policies. This is reflected in
having met our fiscal targets for end-June 2013 and end-September 2013 and other quantitative
performance criteria with the exception of the continuous one on the accumulation of external
arrears, which have since been repaid. We are near completion of our debt restructuring exercise.
The bulk debt-for-land swap with domestic creditors was finalized in June 2013 and the
management company responsible for selling the land assets in St. Kitts is now operational. We
welcome your continued strong support for these initiatives.
In the attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) and the Technical
Memorandum of Understanding (TMU), we present our plans through 2014 to achieve the
objectives of our program supported by the IMF. Based on the strength of these policies, and given
our performance under the program and our continued commitment, we request the completion of
the seventh and eighth review, a waiver of non-observance of performance criterion on the nonaccumulation of central government or government guaranteed external arrears, and a waiver of

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

55

ST. KITTS AND NEVIS

applicability for the end-December 2013 performance criteria. Due to the delay in completing the
seventh and eighth review following scheduling issues related to IMF personnel changes and the
preparation of the 2014 budget, we request that the ninth and tenth reviews be combined and that
the purchase associated with the ninth review be rephased. To reflect the new timeline of reviews,
the availability date for the combined ninth and tenth disbursement is proposed to be set to the
availability date previously set for the tenth disbursement, as shown in Table 1.
In view of the strong improvement in our public finances and our external position, the Government
of St. Kitts and Nevis intends to treat the remainder of the Stand-By Arrangement as precautionary
and does not plan to request purchases of the remaining amounts available under the arrangement.
We are confident that our policy commitments will support the achievement of our program
objectives. However, we need to remain vigilant to downside risks of lower-than expected growth in
the global economy and are prepared to address them through policy actions. We stand ready to
take additional corrective actions that would be needed to address these risks if they materialize. We
will continue to consult with the Fund on the adoption of such actions in advance of necessary
revision of policies contained in this letter and the attached Memorandum, in accordance with the
IMF’s policies.
The Government authorizes the IMF to make public the contents of this letter, the attached MEFP
and TMU, and the Staff Report to clearly communicate our policies and to signal the seriousness of
our commitment to the program to the people of St. Kitts and Nevis and to the international
community.
Sincerely,
/s/
Rt. Hon. Dr. Denzil Douglas
Prime Minister and Minister of Finance
St. Kitts and Nevis

ST. KITTS AND NEVIS

Attachment I. Memorandum of Economic and Financial
Policies
1.
St. Kitts and Nevis has made substantial progress in executing its economic recovery
program supported by the IMF Stand-By Arrangement (SBA). As the program enters the final phase,
the focus continues to be on putting public finances on a sustainable trajectory, finalizing a
comprehensive debt restructuring, further strengthening the financial system, and implementing
reforms to underpin sustained growth. This Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP)
updates these policies in the context of the seventh and eighth reviews under the SBA.

Recent Economic Developments
2.
Firm signs of a recovery were present in the first nine months of 2013 after a four-year
contraction, the fiscal position has improved significantly and debt restructuring has brought debt
down substantially. Notwithstanding the challenges associated with the prolonged global recession
and the debt restructuring, the financial system remains stable.


Growth and inflation. On the basis of indicators of real economic activity for the first nine
months of 2013, we expect growth for the year to be about 1.7 percent. Construction activity
is benefiting from the large inflows under the Citizenship by Investment (CBI) program,
tourism-related projects, and several projects funded by the Sugar Industry Diversification
Foundation (SIDF). Stay-over arrivals expanded by 2.7 percent (y/y), largely reflecting
improved airlift capacity and the recovery of its main source market, while cruise ship
passengers arrivals were up by 12.6 percent (Y/Y) through November. Inflation remained low
at 0.4 percent at end-December.



External sector. The current account deficit is projected to have further narrowed from
11.8 percent of GDP in 2012 to 8.5 percent of GDP in 2013. This reflects a modest recovery in
tourism receipts and strong inflows related to CBI fees. The capital and financial account
surplus in 2013 is recovering following the restructuring of external public debt in 2012 and
a sizable increase in FDI. These have been partially offset by the continued, albeit at a slower
pace, increase in commercial banks’ foreign assets. Overall, the imputed international
reserves are projected to increase by approximately EC$95 million in 2013 (covering about
8½ months of imports).



Banking Sector. Our banking system remains the strongest in the region, with ample
liquidity, and relatively high capital. Notwithstanding, private sector credit continues to fall.
Deposits—which remain banks’ primary source of funding— have grown, dominated by
inflows under the CBI program. Banks’ NPLs rose from 6.6 percent at end-2011 to
10.5 percent at end-September 2013, notably due to removing government loans from total
loans following the debt/land swap. Capitalization, while well above the regulatory
benchmark, and profits were somewhat adversely impacted by the growing NPLs and the
reduction in interest earned on government loans after the debt restructuring. There has
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

57

ST. KITTS AND NEVIS

been no request to access the Banking Sector Reserve Fund (BSRF) set up under the SBA to
date.


Debt restructuring. The debt restructuring exercise is almost complete and has so far
resulted in a significant reduction in the public debt, from 154 percent of GDP at end-2011
to a projected 105 percent of GDP at end-December 2013, based on preliminary data. In
addition to the debt exchange in April 2012 with external commercial creditors and
bondholders, we have concluded agreements with Paris Club creditors. In July 2013,
1,200 acres of land were transferred to the St. Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla National Bank Limited as
part of a debt-for-land swap agreement and resulted in a 27 percent of GDP reduction in the
debt stock. These operations reduced debt service to 4.8 percent of GDP in 2013 from
6.5 percent of GDP in 2011.

PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PROGRAM
3.
We have fulfilled our commitments under the program at end-June and end-September
2013 as detailed below. In this context, we request completion of the seventh and eighth program
reviews, and request a waiver of non observance of the continuous performance criterion on the
non-accumulation of central government or government guaranteed external arrears at September
2013 and at January 2014, which have since been repaid.

58



Fiscal performance. We have met our fiscal targets for end-June 2013 and end-September
2013, reflecting continued policy efforts and stronger-than-expected CBI receipts. The
buoyant CBI inflows have afforded the fiscal space to grant the 13th month wage following a
three-year nominal wage freeze and to step up capital outlays. At end-June 2013, the overall
fiscal balance (as measured from below the line) reached a surplus of EC$126 million, well
above the adjusted program floor of EC$28 million. Similarly, the primary surplus of
EC$171 million significantly exceeded the adjusted indicative program target of EC$60
million. These trends carried over to end-September 2013, resulting in an overall surplus of
EC$171 million, EC$80 million larger than the adjusted program floor, and a primary surplus
of EC$247 million, EC$83 million above the adjusted indicative program target. CBI inflows at
end-September 2013 exceeded the revised forecast by EC$116 million.



Other performance criteria. The ceilings on central government budget expenditure
arrears accumulation and the stock of external short-term debt have been met (Table 2).
Nevertheless, we have had some slippages with the observance of the performance criterion
on the accumulation of external arrears. The Development Bank of St. Kitts and Nevis
(DBSKN) accumulated arrears of EC$1.57 million (0.08 percent of GDP) to the European
Investment Bank (EIB) in September 2013, which were cleared on October 30, 2013, and the
NIA accumulated arrears of EC$0.29 million (0.01 percent of GDP) to the Caribbean
Development Bank (CDB) on January 20 2014, which were cleared on January 27, 2014. The
EIB arrears were the result of operational gaps, including coordination, and temporary cash
flow challenges. The DBSKN is tightening administrative procedures and establishing a fund

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. KITTS AND NEVIS

to pre-pay debt service to prevent future such occurrences of arrears. The arrears by the NIA
to the CDB occurred in the context of a fire that destroyed the Treasury building, including
all paper records, and damaged the data server three days before the due date. The NIA
notified the CDB of the damage on January 17, ahead of the January 20 due date, indicating
that they would be delayed on account of the fire and that they would make the payment as
soon as their capacity to do so is restored. The payment was made one week later. In
accordance with the commitments in the previous MEFP, the NIA has established a Fund to
support management of its debt obligations and assigned an additional staff member to
monitor them. We will further review and strengthen our procedures to prevent a recurrence
of arrears, including further strengthening of coordinating and monitoring processes
between the NIA and the Federal Government of St. Kitts and Nevis.


Structural benchmarks. We continue to implement our structural reform agenda, but
changing circumstances and a widening of reforms, together with capacity constraints have
caused delays.
 We met the structural benchmarks on establishing and operationalizing a unit dedicated
to program design, planning and monitoring in the Inland Revenue Department at endSeptember 2013, and updating the stress tests for banks, on a quarterly basis, based on
data for end-June 2013 and end-September 2013.
The implementation of the regulations of the 2011 Civil Service Act (structural benchmark
for end-July 2013) was delayed following a decision by the Committee of Permanent
Secretaries to redraft the regulations.
 The three structural benchmarks expected to be completed by end-December 2013 have
also been delayed as a result of gaps in the provision of technical assistance and
procedural shortcomings.
 Develop the method for the proxy means testing for the eligibility criteria of
the planned consolidated cash transfer program was delayed when the UNICEF
consultant was reassigned before completion of the project. A new consultant was
recently hired to continue the project funded by resources from the 2014 budget.
The proxy means test is now planned for completion by end-June 2014.
 Finalizing implementing regulations to the Procurement and Contract Act
requires additional technical assistance from the World Bank, which has to identify
the needed resources. The authorities also wish to explore the possibility of
accessing resources from the EU earmarked for the provision of technical assistance
by the IMF.
 Submission of the Customs Law to Parliament was delayed because of revisions,
which are required to be sent to Cabinet for approval. It will be sent for
Parliamentary approval by May 2014.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

59

ST. KITTS AND NEVIS

 Once more we have had to postpone completion of the draft proposal for a
comprehensive pension reform, initially scheduled for end-June 2013 in order to allow
further reflection on its integration with the ECCU regional initiative on pension reforms.
4.
We remain fully committed to continuing with our reform agenda. However, we will need
more time to implement reforms in order to harmonize measures with changing circumstance,
evolving objectives, and limited capacity.

POLICIES DURING 2014
5.
We expect the recovery of 2013 to strengthen in 2014. We are projecting real GDP to grow
by 2.8 percent based on a further pick up in construction activity, reflecting the strong CBI inflows,
FDI projects already in the pipeline, and continued improvements in tourism. Inflation is expected to
pick up slightly as the economy grows and domestic demand increases.
6.
We remain fully committed to the reform strategy and supporting policies outlined in our
previous MEFP (July, 2013). These are aimed to secure sustainability by focusing on reforms to
support growth and increase resilience to external shocks. On December 10, 2013, the National
Assembly of St. Kitts and Nevis approved the 2014 budget, which was in line with program
parameters, and on December 18, 2013, the Nevis Island Administration (NIA) also approved a
program-consistent budget. On the basis of these fiscal frameworks, we are confident that the
program’s fiscal targets will continue to be met.

A.

Fiscal Policy

7.
Our fiscal consolidation program will continue to be anchored by the objective of reaching a
debt-to-GDP ratio of 60 percent by 2020, while reducing fiscal vulnerabilities. For 2014, the fiscal
program will target an overall surplus of 1.6 percent of GDP and a primary balance of 4.6 percent of
GDP. These targets include a conservative projection for CBI receipts of 4.7 percent of GDP. Further,
we are committed to a medium-term fiscal path consistent with our debt service commitments that
will peak in 2015-2016 when we repay the IMF. To achieve our objective, the 2014 Budget has
announced a civil service wages and pensions increase over the next three years of 4, 3 and
3 percent beginning 2014, following the nominal wage freeze which was in effect since 2010.
Additionally, it was indicated in the 2014 Budget Address that the payment of increments to eligible
Civil Servants—also frozen since 2010— would be restored. These increments amount to
approximately 2 percent of the wage bill each year. Furthermore, we plan an additional moderate
increase in the public wage bill to accommodate new initiatives of the Government’s social reform
agenda which would require the development of human resources and the maintenance of
adequate staffing levels. These initiatives include the following:
i.
Implementation of the Agricultural Diversification Strategy to ensure food and nutrition
security of our people;

60

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. KITTS AND NEVIS

ii.
Enhancement of government information and communication services by installing and
commissioning a Government Wide Area Network (GWAN);
iii.
Improved access to reliable and affordable health services by the establishment of a
Hemodialysis Unit and the expansion of psychiatric services to ensure a healthy population;
iv.
Strengthening of national security through improved law enforcement, national defence and
prison services as well as intensifying the rehabilitation programme of the penal system to reduce
recidivism.
We plan to accumulate budget surpluses as precautionary balances to assist us with future debt
repayments, address exogenous shocks, and scale up public sector infrastructure investment in
future years.
8.
To achieve the fiscal targets we will continue to focus on enhancing tax revenues, while
improving the efficiency of public expenditures, with a focus on creating a macroeconomic
environment that promotes sustainable growth.

Revenue Enhancing Reforms:


Inland Revenue Department. The Inland Revenue Department’s (IRD) Strategic Planning
Unit will complete operation plans and performance indicators by end-May, 2014. To focus
on the most productive tax base and enhance our capacity to cross-check collections from
different taxes, we established a Large and Medium Taxpayers’ unit (LMTU). We plan to
revise legislation to fully implement our e-filing program at the IRD. We have intensified
enforcement of the obligation for beneficiaries of tax concessions to file annual income tax
returns and we are starting the process of amending our Income Tax Act accordingly in
order to improve control over potential abuses of tax incentives and VAT refunds. We will
complete the draft legislation for the harmonization of the Tax Administration Procedures
Act with the VAT Act to extend best practices in enforcement to taxes other than the VAT by
end-December 2014. Inter alia, this reform will support improved compliance and our
continuing efforts to improve tax administration by facilitating: (i) deployment of uniform tax
administration policies across all tax types; (ii) the application of the best practices of the
VAT system to the full range of taxes administered by the IRD and (iii) the planned adoption
of risk-based auditing systems. We have expanded our taxpayers’ services through the
provision of a one-stop-shop which combines VAT and Corporate Income Tax services. This
Unit is responsible for cleaning up the tax roll and spearheading our public outreach
campaign on tax reporting and compliance, which has thus far been a success.



Customs and Excise Department. We will strengthen post-clearance enforcement at the
Customs and Excise Department (CED) by submitting to Parliament the new Customs law by
end-May, 2014 and implementing it shortly after. We have started post-clearance audits and
implemented risk-management practices at the CED, including risk profiling in cargo
clearance procedures, and will integrate these procedures into the ASYCUDA World system

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

61

ST. KITTS AND NEVIS

by end September 2014. We expect the full implementation of ASYCUDA by end-September
2014. Our efforts to date have substantially reduced the average clearance time. We have
also tightened export controls at Customs through the implementation of the new regime
for export verification.

We remain committed to a thorough review of the system of customs duties and tax
exemptions (Country Report No. 13/42 MEFP¶7) to facilitate broadening the tax base through
streamlining tax incentives. Exemptions related to the transition period to the VAT ended on
December 31, 2013, and the 2014 budget revenue projections are premised on reducing exemptions
to not exceed EC$100 million. We will review the system for administering tax incentives in the
context of eliminating ad hoc incentives and exemptions. To this end, the Ministry of Finance will
collaborate with SKIPA, the CED and IRD to develop and implement a set of consistent
methodologies for the measurement of foregone revenue.

Expenditure Reforms
10.

62

We aim to moderate and improve the efficiency of public expenditure by:


Implementing our procurement procedures (Country Report No. 14/49 MEFP¶9). We will
renew efforts to obtain technical assistance to complete the Procurement Action Plan and
draft the implementing regulations for the Procurement and Contract Act by end-September
2014. Standard Bidding Documents will also be developed subsequently. As a result of the
delay, our plans to summarize and widely disseminate the scope of the Procurement and
Contract (Administration) Act, its regulations and the underlying strategic vision and
objectives will be delayed to end 2014.



Reforming the civil service. We are revising the draft operational implementing regulations
of the 2011 Civil Service Act and plan to resubmit the proposal to the Parliamentary Counsel
by end-September 2014 after further review. With the support of the World Bank, we are
moving forward with the Public Sector Modernization Project (PSMP) by undertaking a
functional review of four key ministries (Public Works, Health, Human Resources and
Education) which will serve as models for the rest of the public sector. We will also develop a
reliable public employment wage bill and payroll database by conducting a payroll audit. To
that effect, we have received a list of firms under consideration to conduct the audit, which
should be launched in August 2014. We expect the PSMP to be completed by end-2015.



Continue to strengthen our control over contingent liabilities. We remain committed to
adopting policies and actions to strengthen the financial position of public enterprises,
including reinforcing the requirement for statutory bodies to issue periodical financial
statements.



Refine our cost estimates of the Health Insurance Scheme. We are in the first phase of a
three-year implementation of the Health Insurance Scheme which is intended to widen the
citizenry’s access to affordable health care. We will start with the most vulnerable group of

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. KITTS AND NEVIS

the society, those that are already part of the social safety program, and ensure that they are
covered by June 2014. The total estimated cost of this initiative is EC$16 million and our
2014 budget includes an allocation of EC$ 7 million for the first phase.


We are moving forward with plans for introducing a full pass-through for LPG pricing.
We are implementing a strategy to renegotiate the pricing structure for the importation of
petroleum products in line with a Cabinet approved strategy (April 2013) to enhance the
competitiveness of the market for petroleum products. The renegotiation process has now
evolved into an ECCU region-wide coordinated initiative. A negotiating team has been
appointed and a negotiating brief is being prepared. These negotiations are expected to
result in lower import prices for LPG and white fuels (gasoline, diesel and kerosene) through
the adoption of a more transparent and efficient approach to the pricing of these fuels,
allowing us to reduce or eliminate the subsidy on the purchase of LPG and kerosene.

Social safety net

B.



We will continue with the reform of the National Social Protection system. We have
established an evaluation framework consistent with the Cabinet-approved National Social
Protection Strategy: Monitoring and Evaluation Framework. In this regard, we will launch a
pilot program by June 2014, centered on 21 families to facilitate the smooth implementation
of the monitoring and evaluation phase. We plan to finalize the proxy means test to widen
our coverage to 80 families by 2015, 140 families by 2016, and 200 by 2017.



The new Unemployment Benefit Scheme. The modified scheme aims to provide partial
income replacement to Social Security contributors who are temporarily unemployed and
actively seeking employment. It will be rolled out in 2014.



Pensions of civil servants. By end-September 2014, we intend to complete implementing
regulations for the Pension Act that was adopted at end-2012. (Country Report No. 14/49
MEFP¶9)

Debt Restructuring

11.
We will seek to conclude the debt restructuring exercise. We will operationalize the Special
Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to begin selling land. [We have issued the SPV’s operational guidelines and
aligned them with best international practices, including provisions that would ensure that the lands
are sold at competitive market prices. We have publicized these guidelines by issuing a press release
and posting them on our website (prior action)]. We will recruit a CEO for the SPV and complete its
staffing by end-March, 2014. We will establish a land database, list land prices, and register real
estate brokers by end-June, 2014. Our guiding principles will emphasize seeking competitive market
value for the SPVs’ assets and engaging in sales in a timely fashion. In addition, the NIA is to sign
the supplementary shareholders’ agreement.

C.

Financial Sector

12.
We are committed, together with the ECCB, to continue to safeguard the resilience of the
banking sector, a prerequisite for sustainable growth.
 The ECCB’s quarterly stress tests remain valuable monitoring tools. They indicate that one
bank would be vulnerable to a liquidity shock, but that the system is adequately
capitalized. Furthermore, two institutions provide deposits as a buffer. Finally, consistent
with the IMF’s safeguards policy requirement and current practice, we will continue to
maintain all foreign exchange balances at the ECCB.
 The ECCB and banks are implementing their plan to lower NPLs back to the prudential
requirement of 5 percent over the medium term.
 We are closely monitoring the effects of the debt/land swap on the banking sector and are
mindful of the importance of swiftly launching land sales by the Special Purpose Vehicle
(SPV).
 Improving the balance sheets of credit unions by continuing with on-site inspection under
the new supervisory framework, based on the PEARLS performance monitoring system).
On-site inspections of all four Credit Unions will be concluded by October 2014. We are
closely monitoring implementation of corrective action, including through progress
reports of non-compliant credit unions. In that regard, we will strengthen the FSRC’s
sanctioning power by issuing supporting regulations to the FSRC Act by end-June 2014.

D.

Growth and Labor Market Issues

13.
We are finalizing our Tourism Sector Strategy, based on promoting environmental
sustainability, sharper targeting of the high-end segment and diversifying our source markets; we
plan to develop greener infrastructure, building on the new solar energy projects implemented with
the assistance of Taiwan (POC) and developing backward linkages to our agriculture and crafts
sectors. We are directing our marketing campaigns at high-income households and expanding our
source markets to reduce dependence on the U.S. We are developing partnerships with new airlines
to significantly increasing airlift capacity to support the ongoing expansion in the number of tourist
rooms. We are near to concluding arrangements for a PPP to begin the construction of a second
cruise ship pier, which will be capable of accommodating two large cruise ships along with the
related tourism facilities (shopping area, craft market, and road infrastructure). We are launching
other projects that are aimed at increasing the range of amenities and services that support the
tourism sector. We expect these actions to support sustained growth over the medium-term by
raising the contribution of tourism to GDP.
14.
We are preparing an action plan to improve the business environment. Guided by the World
Bank Doing Business indicators, our priority is to improve processes for: resolving insolvency,
registering property, securing credit, paying taxes and enforcing contracts. We adopted in 2013 the
64

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. KITTS AND NEVIS

new Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act to strengthen the legal framework for insolvency, including
through the supervision of the administration of all estates.1 We are also facilitating the payment of
taxes by implementing e-services such as e-filing, e-payments and other revenue administration
reforms. We plan to articulate a comprehensive strategy in the second half of 2014 following
consultation with stakeholders, which will cost the reforms for inclusion in the budget.
15.
We are finalizing the legislation to improve working conditions, and continuing actions to
improve training of the work force. We plan to submit the new Labour Code to Parliament by the
end of June 2014. The code will strengthen the legal framework for occupational health and safety,
define labor termination rules and institute labour tribunals, in order to alleviate the existing backlog
in the courts. We will also rollout an Unemployment Benefit Scheme in the second half of 2014. The
purpose of the Scheme is to provide partial income replacement to Social Security contributors who
are temporarily unemployed and actively seeking employment. We continue to implement training
initiatives to improve the match between job seekers and employers.2

E.

Program Issues

16.
There is one prior action for the completion of this review: the issuing of operational
guidelines for the SPV in line with best practices.
17.
An adjustor was introduced for shortfalls/excess of CBI application fees in the budget. The
overall balance and the primary balance of the central government at end-March 2014 will be
adjusted by any difference in the outcome of the Citizenship by Investment fee receipts (¶ 10 in
TMU) relative to the program target.

This replaced the Bankruptcy Act of 1889.

Attachment II. Technical Memorandum of Understanding
1.
St. Kitts and Nevis’ performance under the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) will be assessed on
the basis of the quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets, as well as the structural
benchmarks. This Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) defines the variables set out in
Tables 2 and 3 of the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP). It also lays down the
reporting requirements to adequately monitor the program.
2.
For the purposes of the program, the exchange rate of the East Caribbean dollar (EC$) to the
U.S. dollar is set at EC$2.70 = US$1 and the exchange rate of the Euro to the U.S. dollar is set at
EUR1 = US$1.3. Foreign currency accounts denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and
the Euro, excluding SDRs, will be first valued in the U.S. dollar at actual end-of-period exchange
rates used by the ECCB to calculate the official exchange rates. SDR-denominated accounts will be
valued at the program exchange rate of U.S. dollar 1.6 per SDR.

Coverage
3.
For the purpose of the program, central government will cover all items included in the
government budgets of the Federation (both St. Kitts and Nevis).
4.
The nonfinancial public sector is defined as the total central government and nonfinancial
public enterprises. Public enterprises consist of the Development Bank of St. Kitts and Nevis,
Financial Services Regulatory Commission, Frigate Bay Development Corporation, La Vallee Greens
Ltd, National Housing Corporation, Nevis Air and Sea Port Authority, Nevis Cultural Development
Foundation, Nevis Electricity Corporation, Nevis Housing and Land Development Corporation, Nevis
Solid Waste Management Authority, Nevis Tourism Authority, St. Christopher and Nevis Solid Waste
Management Corporation, St. Christopher Tourism Authority, St. Kitts Urban Development
Corporation, St. Christopher Air and Sea Ports Authority, White Gate Development Corporation, and
ZIZ Broadcasting Corporation.
5.
External debt is defined as all debt owed to creditors residing outside of St. Kitts and Nevis,
while domestic debt covers all debt owed to residents of St. Kitts and Nevis. The latter covers all Tbills, including those held by creditors residing outside of St. Kitts and Nevis, and the bond issued at
the Regional Government Securities Market (RGSM).

Quantitative Performance Criteria
A.

Central Government’s Overall Deficit (PC)

6.
The central government overall balance will cover all of its revenue, grants, expenditure,
and transfers. Revenues will exclude any proceeds from the sale of public assets such as land, which
will be considered as financing below the line. Expenditures will exclude clearance of arrears, which
will be considered as financing below the line.
7.
The central government’s overall balance will be measured from the financing side as the
sum of the net domestic financing, net external financing, plus proceeds from the sale of public
assets, minus clearance of arrears.
8.

Net domestic financing of the central government is defined as the sum of:


net domestic bank financing as measured by the change in the domestic banking system
credit to the central government net of deposits, as reported by the consolidated balance
sheet of the monetary authorities and commercial banks, including special tranches from the
ECCB;



net nonbank financing as measured by the net changes in holdings of government securities
by nonbanks, and net borrowing from nonbank institutions;



the changes in the stock of domestic arrears of the central government defined as net
changes in unpaid checks issued, unprocessed claims, pending invoices, plus accrued
interest payments, and other forms of expenditures recorded above the line but not paid;



gross receipts from divestment defined as proceeds received from any privatization,
divestment, and sale of asset (land); and



any exceptional financing, including rescheduled principal and interest.

9.

70

Net external financing of the central government is defined as the sum of:


disbursements of project and non-project loans, including securitization;



proceeds from bonds issued abroad (with an original maturity of one year or greater);



net changes in short-term external debt (with an original maturity of less than one year),
excluding exceptional financing;



net changes in cash deposits held outside the domestic banking system;



any changes in arrears on external interest payments and other forms of external
expenditures recorded above the line but not paid;

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. KITTS AND NEVIS



any exceptional financing, including rescheduled principal and interest;
less:



10.

payments of principal on current maturities for bonds and loans on a due basis, including
any prepayment of external debt.
The floor on the overall balance of the central government will be adjusted as follows:



downward (i.e., a larger overall deficit target would apply) to the extent that budgetary
grants fall short of the programmed amounts by less than EC$3 million.



upward to the extent that budgetary grants exceed the annual amounts specified in the
program as indicated in table 1.

Stock of Central Government Short-Term External Debt (PC)

11.
The limit on short-term external debt applies to debt owed or guaranteed by the central
government of St. Kitts and Nevis, with an original maturity of up to and including one year.
Excluded from the limit are any rescheduling operations (including the deferral of interest on
commercial debt) and normal import-related credits. Normal import credit is understood to be a
self-liquidating operation where the proceeds from sales of imports are used to retire the debt. Debt
falling within the limit shall be valued in U.S. dollars at the time of the contract or guarantee
becomes effective.

C.

External Arrears of the Public Sector (PC)

12.
The non-accumulation of arrears to external creditors will be a continuous performance
criterion under the program. This performance criterion applies to arrears accumulated related to
debt contracted or guaranteed by central government. External payment arrears consist of external
debt service obligations (principal and interest) falling due after December 31, 2010 that have not

72

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. KITTS AND NEVIS

been paid at the time due, taking into account the grace periods specified in contractual
agreements. Arrears resulting from nonpayment of debt service for which a clearance framework has
been agreed or a rescheduling agreement is being sought are excluded from this definition.

D.

Budget Expenditure Arrears (PC)

13.
A ceiling is set on central government budget expenditure arrears, equal to the stock of such
arrears as at December 31, 2010 (Table 4). The ceiling applies to the increase in the sum of: (1) any
invoice that has been received by a spending agency from a supplier of goods, services, and capital
goods delivered and verified, and for which payment has not been made within the contractually
agreed period, or in the absence of a grace period, within 60 days; and (2) unpaid wages, pensions,
or transfers, pending for longer than 60 days to domestic or foreign residents, irrespective of the
currency denomination of the debt. Interest and amortization arrears on domestic debt resulting
from nonpayment of debt service for which a clearance framework has been agreed or a
rescheduling agreement is being sought are excluded from this ceiling. For ease of monitoring, all
debt issued on the Regional Government Securities Market (RGSM), irrespective of who holds it, will
be regarded as domestic debt.

Indicative Target on the Primary Balance of the Central Government
14.
The central government’s primary balance is defined as revenue and grants minus noninterest expenditures. As in the definition of the overall balance, revenue will exclude any proceeds
from the sale of public assets. Net lending is a non-interest expenditure item (negative net lending
is a revenue item). Interest expenditures include interest payments on outstanding arrears, as
defined above in sections IIC and IID (at their contractual rates) converted to a cash basis.
15.
The floor on the primary balance of the central government will be monitored from the
financing side as the sum of the net domestic financing, net external financing, proceeds from the
sale of public assets, plus domestic and external interest payments on a due basis.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

73

ST. KITTS AND NEVIS

16.

The floor on the primary balance of the central government will be adjusted as follows:


downward (i.e., a smaller primary surplus target would apply) to the extent that budgetary
grants fall short of the programmed amounts by less than EC$3 million.



upward to the extent that budgetary grants exceed the annual amounts specified in the
program as indicated in Table 1.



downward by the cumulative amount of up to EC$15 million spent to support the British
American Insurance Companies or CLICO resolutions as part of a regional solution—any
amounts spent in excess of this programmed contingency will need to be funded within the
program limit on the overall deficit.



downward to the extent that clearance of arrears exceed zero.



upward to the extent of exceptional financing achieved through debt restructuring.



upward to the extent of under-execution of non-grant financed capital expenditure relative
to the program targets as indicated in Table 2. For the purpose of the program revenue
financed capital expenditure refers to capital expenditure not financed by loans or grants.



upward to the extent that the Citizenship by Investment fee receipts exceed the amounts
specified in the program as indicated in Table 3.



downward to the extent that the Citizenship by Investment fee receipts fall short of the
amounts specified in the program as indicated in Table 3.

Exchange Arrangement
St. Kitts and Nevis is a member of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), which manages
monetary policy and the exchange system for its eight members. The common currency, the
Eastern Caribbean dollar, has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of EC$2.70 per U.S.
dollar since July 1976. The de jure regime is a currency board, which in practice the ECCB has
operated like a quasi-currency board, maintaining foreign exchange backing of its currency
and demand liabilities of close to 100 percent. St. Kitts and Nevis accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 in December 1984. The exchange system is free of restrictions
on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.
Safeguards Assessment
Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) is
subject to a full safeguards assessment on a four year cycle. The most recent assessment was
completed on April 16, 2012 and did not identify any significant safeguards risks. The
assessment made some recommendations to sustain and advance the ECCB's safeguards
framework going forward. The authorities broadly agreed with the recommendations and have
commenced implementation.
Last Article IV Consultation
The last Article IV staff report (IMF Country Report No. 11/270) was issued on July 20, 2011.
Board discussion took place on July 27, 2011. It is proposed that the next Article IV
consultation take place in 12 months.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of January 21, 2014)
The World Bank Group’s Management presented to its Board the Organization of the Eastern
Caribbean States (OECS) Regional Partnership Strategy (RPS) on June 8, 2010. The RPS covers the
five year period July 2009–June 2014. It sets forth the terms of engagement of the International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International Development Association (IDA)
and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) with the countries of the Eastern Caribbean, subregional organizations and other development partners in pursuit of the following strategic
objectives: (a) building resilience; and (b) enhancing competitiveness and stimulating growth over
the medium term.
To help build resilience in the OECS, the Bank Group is supporting interventions aimed at promoting
fiscal and debt sustainability, protecting and improving human capital—particularly social safety
nets, education and health—and strengthening climate resilience.
To help enhance competitiveness and stimulate sustainable growth, it focuses its support on two
critical areas: strengthening the countries’ domestic financial sectors and improving access to quality
services to create more competitive business environments. The Strategy provides urgent remedial
measures to address the crippling effects of the global and regional crises, while supporting key
policy reforms that establish a platform for growth in the medium term.
The program of support entails new commitments totaling up to about US$120 million on IBRD
terms for the six Bank Members of the OECS and up to US$73 million of IDA financing, for the four
OECS which are also eligible to IDA, namely: Dominica, Grenada, Saint Lucia and St. Vincent and the
Grenadines. St. Kitts and Nevis and Antigua and Barbuda are the only OECS eligible to IBRD-only
resources because of their high-income status. St. Kitts and Nevis graduated from access to IDA
resources in 1994.
A new OECS Regional Partnership Framework FY15-19 is currently under preparation and expected
to be presented to the World Bank Board in spring 2014.

A. Projects
St. Kitts and Nevis participates in one active World Bank’s Project-Enhanced Public Sector
Governance and Efficiency (IDF grant). This operation (US$ 415,000) is financed by a grant from the
Institutional Development Fund (IDF), a World Bank’s financing tool to enhance the delivery and
implementation of programs that will lead ultimately to better development results. The objective of
this project is to increase the quality of expenditures and public sector efficiency and promote a
fiscally sustainable and more equitable system of pay and employment which generates the right
incentives to improve public sector performance in St. Kitts and Nevis. This will be done through

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. KITTS AND NEVIS

building capacity at the Ministry of Finance by working with government teams to: (i) implement
measures to rapidly increase the efficiency of personnel expenditures; (ii) align human resource
needs and staffing in St. Kitts and Nevis public service through the implementation of
recommendations of functional reviews; and (iii) introduce pay classification and evaluations.
The government of St. Kitts and Nevis launched its national chapter of the Caribbean Growth Forum
(CGF) between February 25 and 27, 2013. The CGF is an initiative led by the World Bank, the InterAmerican Development Bank, and the Caribbean Development Bank, in collaboration with the
United Kingdom Agency for International Development (DFID) and the Canadian International
Development Agency (CIDA), to identify policies and initiatives aimed at inducing growth and
creating jobs in the Caribbean region through analytical work, knowledge exchange and inclusive
dialogue. The CGF can contribute to an enhanced and participatory policy dialogue (involving
private sector, CSOs, and other non-traditional stakeholders, such as youth and Diaspora) on key
challenges that affect economic growth, in a situation where fiscal space is limited and the need to
promote a more diversified knowledge-based economy is pressing. The CGF national chapters have
already been launched in 12 Caribbean countries, including all the six OECS countries. During the
CGF workshop in St. Kitts and Nevis, participants started discussions on issues and measures to
strengthen the investment climate, logistics and connectivity, and skills and productivity in St. Kitts
and Nevis. Key actions addressed included upgrading education, enhancing ICT, improving the
infrastructure services, and reducing electricity costs through exploring alternative energy sources.
Recent projects. There was one WB recent regional operation, the OECS Telecommunications and
ICT Development Project, which closed on Dec 31, 2011 for the benefit of St. Kitts and Nevis
(US$0.54 million), as well as Dominica (US$ 0.54 million); Grenada (US$ 0.27 million); St. Lucia
(US$ 0.27 million) and St. Vincent and the Grenadines (US$ 0.27 million). The project aimed at
improving the access, quality, and use of telecommunications and ICT services to achieve
socioeconomic development in the OECS. The project for St. Kitts and Nevis was aimed at
establishing a wireless network to provide connectivity to schools in support of a parallel initiative of
the Government that involved the provision of laptops to students. Given the nature of the project
where five member countries were involved, each country’s performance was overall positive. The
evidence that shows Governments’ satisfactory performance can be found in their support to
overcome the challenges encountered in finding adequate ICT providers and vendors.

B. Economic and Sector Work
The Bank has completed a series of analytical products relating to public expenditure, fiscal and
debt sustainability, growth and competitiveness, the financial sector, public sector management and
social protection. The ongoing dissemination of these reports represents a key instrument for policy
dialogue with the OECS governments, including St. Kitts and Nevis.
The Bank’s program in St. Kitts and Nevis is further supported by a comprehensive series of
analytical and advisory activities, including the following: “Towards a New Agenda for Growth” –
OECS growth and competitiveness study (2005); An OECS Skills Enhancement Policy Note (2006); a
Caribbean Air Transport Report (2006); a regional study on Crime, Violence, and Development:

RELATIONS WITH THE CARIBBEAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of December 31, 2013)
Over the years, Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) has supported the economic and social
development of St. Kitts and Nevis by providing financing for priority capital and technical
assistance (TA) projects. In addition, CDB has engaged in policy dialogue with the Government of St.
Kitts and Nevis. Generally, CDB’s involvement with SKN has been concerned with activities such as:
the formulation and implementation of macroeconomic, social and sectoral policies; development of
infrastructure to facilitate growth and economic diversification; direct and indirect lending to
agriculture and industry; and emergency disaster rehabilitation.
In December 2012, CDB approved a new assistance strategy for St. Kitts and Nevis for the period
2013-16, which focuses on establishing an enabling environment for sustained inclusive growth and
poverty reduction and strengthening resilience by securing social stability and improving
environmental sustainability. The indicative list of interventions contained in the assistance strategy
is expected to result in a lending programme of up to US$42.7 million over the strategy period.
At the end of December 2013, CDB had approved loans totaling US$171.74 million to SKN of which
US$19.89 million were undisbursed.
Major projects currently under implementation include following:
1. Second Power Project-consists of the installation of a generator of approximate size
2.5 megawatts (MW) and ancillary switchgear and the establishment of an operations facility at the
Nevis Electricity Company Limited (NEVLEC). The project will provide additional generating capacity
to satisfy electricity demand and to replace existing engines that have passed their useful life.
2. Student-Loan Scheme (Sixth Loan)-to assist the National Bank of St Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla in
financing loans to students attending local, regional and extra-regional institutions for programmes
in technical, vocational and academic studies.
3. National Disaster Management: Immediate Response Loan-Tropical Storm Otto-to contribute to
the rehabilitation of economic infrastructure damaged by Tropical Storm Otto. The Project consists
of the restoration of part of Basseterre Bay Road, the reconstruction of 200 meters of sea defense
wall and associated roadwork.
4. Nevis Water Supply Enhancement-to assist in improving the water-supply network capacity on the
island of Nevis. Under the project, approximately 20 kilometers of pipelines, two pumping stations
and storage capacity of 1.00 million gallons will be constructed. The project also provides for
capacity building and strengthening institutional arrangements for the delivery of water services.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance, although significant shortcomings in data
provision and data quality remain. St. Kitts and Nevis has been participating in the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS) since October 2000, and its metadata are posted on the Fund’s
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB).
Real Sector
There are a number of deficiencies in the real sector statistics. GDP data by type of expenditure are
not available at constant prices, while the data at current prices are not reliable due to weaknesses
in estimating gross capital formation. Private final consumption expenditure is estimated as a
residual. A new CPI was introduced in 2010, with new weights based on the 2000 household survey,
linking the old and new baskets back to 2006. Monthly CPI data are posted on the ECCB website
with a long lag. The ECCB also produces monthly data, and on tourism with a long lag, and tourism
expenditure. The assumed spending levels for types of tourists have not been updated recently.
Limited data are available on labor market developments.
Public Finances
Data on revenue, expenditure, and financing of the consolidated central government are made
available to Fund staff on request. Commendable progress has recently been made in improving the
quality and coverage of central government fiscal data, including on government and public
enterprise debt. Progress has been made reducing discrepancies between overall balance and
available financing in 2013. Works needs to be done in resolving the discrepancy in earlier years. It
would be important to produce a set of fully consolidated accounts for the central government on a
regular basis. Also, it would be beneficial to institute a mechanism for the regular reporting of
financial data on the rest of the public sector. The most recent data on the central government
published in the GFS Yearbook are for 2012. Public Finance data is recorded by the authorities on a
cash basis, and reported to the Fund in a Chart of Account broadly in line with that of the GFSM.
Balance of Payments and External Debt
ECCB provides imports and exports on a monthly basis, and estimates a full balance of payments on
an annual basis. The latest data published in IFS are for 2012. Most components of the financial
account need improvement. It would be useful to reconcile the data on the public sector investment
plan for external loans with the public external debt database. There are no data on private external
debt. The IMF Statistics Department undertook a mission on Balance of Payments Statistics in 2012
to work with the ECCB Authorities on meeting the requirements of the Balance of Payments and
International Investment Position Manual, sixth edition (BPM6).

Monetary and Financial Statistics
The 2003 money and banking statistics mission indicated that enhanced institutional coverage,
classification of financial instruments, and sectorization of economic units would facilitate
identification of credit flows to different sectors of the economy and compilation of monetary
aggregates. It recommended that the institutional coverage for other depository corporations be
expanded to include credit unions, finance companies, and building societies, which also accept
demand and other deposits. Further, the mission recommended broadening the coverage to include
insurance companies, pension funds, development banks, and offshore institutions and foundations.
In April 2007, a data ROSC mission assessed the monetary statistics with reference to the GDDS and
the Data Quality Assessment Framework (DQAF, July 2003). It indicated that the quality of the ECCB
and Eastern Caribbean Currency Union member countries’ monetary statistics has improved over
recent years, and the monetary statistics are broadly adequate for macroeconomic analysis and
policy design and monitoring. The mission identified shortcomings related to the institutional
coverage of the other depository corporations as data for mortgage companies, finance companies,
building societies, and credit unions—all of which accept deposits—are excluded. Also, accrued
interest is not incorporated in the value of the interest-bearing assets and liabilities, and valuation
adjustments are included in other liabilities. In addition, source data for the commercial banks do
not provide the disaggregation recommended in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual.
Monetary Statistics were modified, and since January 1, 2009, the definition of broad money
aggregates is revised to include the deposits of non-bank financial institutions and subsidiaries and
affiliates held at commercial banks.
The authorities report monetary data to the IMF on a monthly basis, with a time lag of about
3 months. The ECCB publically releases monetary survey data, and deposits, loans, and sector
distribution of credit alongside a Central Bank balance sheet and data on interest rates on a monthly
basis, again with a lag.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with St. Kitts and Nevis

On March 19, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
2014 Article IV consultation1 s with St. Kitts and Nevis. On the same day, the Board also
completed the seventh and eight review under a program supported by a 36-month Standby Arrangement (SBA), see: Press Release 14/xx
St. Kitts and Nevis is recovering from a four-year economic recession, occasioned by the
international financial crisis, the need to restore fiscal sustainability and restructure public
debt. For 2013, real GDP is estimated to have grown by 1.7 percent, based on a modest
recovery in tourism, and a strong pickup in construction related to the Citizenship by
Investment (CBI) program and other tourism-related projects. Inflation has declined
following the introduction of the VAT at end-2010 and the hike in electricity tariffs in early
2011 and remains low and stable. Robust CBI and rising tourism receipts are projected to
have narrowed the current account deficit from 21.4 percent of GDP in 2010 to 8.5 percent
of GDP in 2013, which have together with increased capital inflows, increased international
reserves. The commercial banks remain resilient despite the recession and the impact of
the debt restructuring.
The economy is expected to grow by 2.7 percent in 2014 and continue to strengthen over
the medium-term towards its potential growth rate of 3–3.5 percent. Tourism should
continue its recovery, supported by increased airlift capacity and new room capacity, while
CBI inflows and other projects are expected to continue to fuel construction.
The fiscal consolidation has progressed considerably, reflecting both concerted policy
efforts and continued strong CBI revenues which have mostly been saved. The overall
balance improved from a deficit of 7.8 percent of GDP in 2010 to an estimated surplus of
10.6 percent of GDP in 2013.Tax revenues stagnated in percent of GDP after an initial

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,

boost from introducing the VAT, while CBI revenues grew from 2.3 percent of GDP in 2010
to a projected 13 percent of GDP in 2013. Current expenditures were compressed through
a hiring and wage freeze since 2010, while the corporatization of the Electricity Company,
and interest reductions following the debt restructuring provided for further budgetary
savings. The stronger fiscal positions enabled the authorities to grant the thirteenth month
wage payment in 2013 and increase capital spending. Fiscal consolidation and debt
restructuring reduced the debt-to-GDP ratio from 164 percent in 2010 to around
105 percent in 2013, but the debt remains high and vulnerable to exogenous shocks.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities’ successful implementation of their
home-grown Fund-supported program. Growth has resumed after four years of contraction;
a significant fiscal adjustment has been achieved; and progress has been made in debt
restructuring. Directors underscored the importance of continued efforts to strengthen the
fiscal framework, reduce debt further, and implement growth-enhancing reforms. They
welcomed the authorities’ intention to treat the arrangement as precautionary for the
remainder of the program in view of the improved external position.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to continue fiscal consolidation to secure
medium-term fiscal sustainability. They supported further efforts to broaden the tax base,
strengthen tax administration, contain current outlays, and enhance public financial
management. They recommended greater restraint in future wage increases and public
sector hiring, and proceeding with civil service reform. Directors welcomed plans to save the
bulk of CBI receipts to build buffers and consider setting up a stabilization fund to support
public debt reduction and productive infrastructure projects. They called for vigilance to
prevent a recurrence of external arrears.
Directors underscored the importance of sustaining the pace of fiscal structural reforms.
They encouraged the authorities to move swiftly to implement regulations for the Civil
Service Act and the Procurement and Contract Act, develop proxy means testing for social
safety net programs, and submit the Customs Law to parliament. These measures are
needed for a more efficient and productive public sector that can support a dynamic private
sector. Directors looked forward to the finalization of debt restructuring negotiations with
remaining bilateral creditors.
Directors noted that the banking sector remains resilient and well capitalized. They
commended the progress in strengthening the supervisory framework for credit unions and

the increase in their capitalization, but noted the need to further consolidate their balance
sheets. Directors also stressed the importance of facilitating banks’ plans to reduce
nonperforming loans, and of launching land sales to buttress banks’ liquidity. Strong
oversight of the financial sector, in close collaboration with the Eastern Caribbean Central
Bank, should continue.
Directors agreed that the priority going forward is to enhance growth. They commended
efforts to boost the tourism sector and its contribution to GDP, plans to support investment
in alternative energy to reduce energy costs, and measures to strengthen the business and
investment climate. Vigilance to ensure that investments are yielding the expected results
and readiness to review the strategy, as needed, will be important.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
March 19, 2014

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

(Corrected) IMF Executive Board Completes Seventh and Eighth Reviews Under
Stand-by Arrangement for St. Kitts and Nevis and Approves US$3.43 Million
Disbursement
On March 19, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed the
seventh and eighth reviews of St. Kitts and Nevis’ economic performance under a program
supported by a 36-month Stand-by Arrangement (SBA). The completion of the review
enables the immediate disbursement of an amount equivalent to SDR 2.21 million (about
US$ 3.43 million). The authorities have decided to treat the arrangement as precautionary.
On the same day, the Board also concluded the 2014 Article IV consultation with St. Kitts
and Nevis, see PR xxx
In completing the reviews, the Executive Board approved the waiver of applicability for the
end-December 2013 performance criteria, for which data are not yet available and there is no
evidence that they were not observed. The Executive Board also approved the waiver of nonobservance of the continuous performance criterion on the ceiling of external arrears
accumulated on debt contracted or guaranteed by the central government as the nonobservance was minor and temporary. In addition, the Executive Board approved the rephasing of the undisbursed amounts over the remainder of the arrangement.
The SBA was originally approved on July 27, 2011 (see Press Release No.11/295), for an
amount equivalent to SDR 52.51 million (about US$81.55 million), or 590 percent of St.
Kitts and Nevis’ IMF quota.
Following the Executive Board’s discussion, Mr. Min Zhu, Deputy Managing Director and
Acting Chair, issued the following statement:
“The St. Kitts and Nevis authorities have continued to make commendable progress under
their home-grown Fund-supported program. Economic activity is picking up after a four-year
slump, inflation remains low, the financial sector is stable, and the fiscal and external
positions are improving. Significant progress has also been made to strengthen public
financial management.

“The 2014 budget aims to protect the gains under the program, continue the downward debtto-GDP trajectory, and advance the reform agenda. Achieving these objectives will require
sustained strict control of government spending and increased efforts to improve revenue
collection. The bulk of revenues from the Citizenship by Investment program should be
saved to build buffers, facilitate a faster decline in debt, and finance productive capital
projects. Containing public sector wage outlays and hiring will also be necessary.
“Debt has fallen considerably due to completion of a large part of the debt-land swap, but
remains high. Completing the agreement on the remaining debt-land swap should be a top
priority. New measures should ensure that external arrears do not recur.
“While there have been significant advances in structural reforms, greater effort will be
needed to implement the remaining planned reforms to generate further efficiencies in the
public sector and foster private sector growth. Priority should be given to measures to
enhance revenues by strengthening tax administration and limiting tax exemptions, and to
streamline public expenditure, including through civil service reform.
“The banking sector remains resilient. Together with the ECCB, the government should
continue its close monitoring of banks and their progress in reducing nonperforming loans.
The sale of lands involved in the debt-land swap should commence expeditiously to bolster
banks’ profitability. The authorities have taken welcome steps to strengthen the non-bank
financial institutions supervisory framework. Continued efforts in this area are needed to
support the stability of the financial system.”
