ITALY
Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2010 Article IV Consultation with Italy
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Marek Belka and Tamim Bayoumi
May 11, 2010
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Context: The global financial crisis has taken its toll on Italy’s economy, exacerbating its
long-standing structural weaknesses and causing the worst recession since WWII. Higher
public debt and lower potential output will be the long-term legacy of the recession. A
modest and fragile recovery based on external demand, restocking of inventories, and modest
government support is under way, but the high level of public debt could make Italy
susceptible to reversals in market sentiment.
Challenges: After more than a decade of anemic growth and a persistent inflation differential
with other Euro area countries, competitiveness needs to increase and structural bottlenecks
should be removed. While the recent fiscal deterioration has been relatively contained
compared to the euro area average, fiscal consolidation needs remain substantial, and market
risks have risen. Much needed structural reforms are still lagging.
Authorities’ views: The authorities were committed to containing the fiscal deficit to below
3 percent by 2012; they also considered the next three years a golden opportunity to
implement structural reforms. In particular, they believed that fiscal federalism would
facilitate sustained budgetary consolidation while improving the efficiency of public
services.

I. CONTEXT: THE GLOBAL CRISIS EXACERBATED PRE-EXISTING PROBLEMS
A. Before the Crisis (1999–2007)
1.
The global economic crisis hit an already
structurally weak Italian economy. Despite
growing employment, income growth had been
anemic due to stagnant productivity and declining
competitiveness over more than a decade.
2.
Italy has been steadily losing its market
share of world trade. Economic rigidities, along
with Italy’s specialization in products with relatively
low value added, contributed to a steady erosion of
competitiveness. Earnings growth outpaced labor
productivity, and Italy’s unit labor costs grew by
nearly 25 percent during 1999–2007. Italy’s market
share in world trade has declined significantly (and
by more than its euro area peers) since the mid
1990s.
3.
Italy’s public finances were fragile going
into the crisis. While government debt declined
gradually from 113¾ percent of GDP in 1999 to
103½ percent in 2007, interest savings and (partly
cyclical) revenue strength were offset by poor
spending control. As a result, the structural primary
balance deteriorated by some 2¾ percent of
potential GDP during this period, and the overall
deficit hovered around 3 percent of GDP.

In contrast, the Italian financial system entered the global crisis from a position
of comparative strength. In large part, this derived from the traditional bank-based nature of
the system, but also reflected previous consolidation, improved governance, and a sound
supervisory framework.

B. The Global Crisis (2008–2009)
Despite the comparatively resilient financial system and the lack of a domestic credit/housing
boom/bust, output fell sharply as trade and investment slumped.
Financial sector: resilient
5.
Banks proved resilient to the initial phase of the global financial crisis. The banks
benefited from a business model based on classical on-balance sheet lending-deposit activity,
and strong customer relationships. With adequate liquidity and the absence of asset bubbles
and toxic assets, this conservative business model sheltered Italian banks from the liquidity
crunch at the onset of the crisis. Unlike elsewhere, Italian banks did not need emergency
government intervention and recourse to ECB liquidity support schemes remained limited.
6.
The subsequent deterioration of the economy nevertheless weakened banks’
asset quality and profitability. Credit risk increased during the second half of 2008 and
deteriorated rapidly in 2009. Following the economic contraction, lending growth to the
private sector slowed sharply, profitability declined, and asset quality deteriorated. In 2009,
the stock of nonperforming loans increased by around 40 percent (from a low base) with
respect to the previous year. Loan loss provisions for the 5 largest banks (as a percentage of
pre-provision earnings) increased from about 30 percent in 2008 to about 56 percent in 2009,
which was in line with the European average.
7.
Banks increased capitalization in 2008–09, but their capital ratios still range
from weak to average compared with other countries in Europe. Capitalization had
weakened to just-adequate levels before the crisis. Since the crisis, banks were able to
recapitalize by raising capital from core shareholders, selling nonstrategic assets, and cutting
dividends (often to zero). Some banks also issued government-sponsored recapitalization
bonds. Despite recent strengthening in capitalization, Italian banks still display weaker Core
Tier1 ratios than their European peers. The comparison is more favorable if the leverage ratio
(defined as the ratio between assets and equity) is taken into consideration.

8.
Other financial institutions have also weathered the global financial crisis
relatively well. The Italian insurance industry was little exposed to the crisis, with issuer
defaults amounting to ½ percent of technical reserves. In 2009, premium revenues increased,
and in the first semester, the insurance sector recorded a profit. Most pension funds had
positive (albeit low) returns in 2009, often offsetting the losses recorded in 2008. The
profitability of asset management companies, investment firms, and financial companies fell,
but remained positive, in 2008.
Real Sector: adversely affected by the global crisis
9.
The global financial crisis affected the real economy mainly through trade,
credit, and confidence channels. The recession in Italy’s main trading partners led to a
sharp fall in exports. Financing conditions tightened and credit growth fell, both to
households and corporates, reflecting a combination of lower perceived borrower
creditworthiness and a fall in loan demand. Corporate leverage increased, bankruptcies rose,
and the profit share fell. Market indicators of expected corporate default spiked in 2009 and
still remain above pre-crisis levels. Despite strong household balance sheets, private
consumption declined significantly, reflecting rising unemployment and tighter consumer
credit, only marginally offset by the weak rise in government consumption. Gross fixed
investment and inventories also fell sharply, reflecting weak demand prospects and difficult
financing conditions.

debt) translated into one of the deepest output falls among large industrialized countries.
Despite the sharp output fall, inflation and wage growth remained above the euro area
average. Combined with falling productivity growth, this further worsened unit labor costs
and squeezed profit margins.

Unemployment increased, though
relatively mildly. Unemployment rose to
8.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009,
1.9 percentage points increase from end
2007, much lower than in most of its euro
area peers. While this partly reflects falling
participation, Italy, like Germany and
France, relied on temporary lay-off and work

Response to the crisis: supportive but modest
Financial sector
12.
The authorities helped the financial sector weather the crisis through a range of
measures. The government guaranteed the deposit insurance fund; several instruments were
established to improve bank liquidity, including a state guarantee for new bank liabilities, a
facility for swapping bank assets or bonds issued by banks for government securities and a
system for anonymous but collateralized interbank lending. The government also offered a
recapitalization scheme, although this was used by only four banks (for a total of €4.05
billion recapitalization bonds, or less than half the €10 billion that was made available). The
modest uptake of the scheme mainly reflected the conditionality as well as the recovery in
global financing conditions which was already underway when the scheme was launched.
13.
Government policies also focused on supporting credit to the private sector,
especially to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Besides exerting moral
suasion on financial institutions, a state-controlled financial institution (Cassa Depositi e
Prestiti, CDP) made funds available to banks that extend credit to SMEs, the existing
guarantee fund for SMEs has been strengthened, and the Ministry of the Finance is
overseeing a bank loan moratorium agreement between the banking association and the
employers’ federation, which has allowed the suspension of loan repayments for €9 billion
(0.6 percent of GDP). The government is also setting up a recapitalization fund for SMEs,
financed by the government, the CDP, the employers’ federation, and private banks.

Fiscal policy
14.
The high level of public debt constrained the government’s ability to implement
discretionary countercyclical fiscal policy. Italy’s stimulus package included facilitating
access to credit for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), a car scrapping program, a
one-off family bonus, and wage supplementation schemes. Overall, this was one of the
smallest stimulus packages among advanced G–20 countries, reflecting the limited fiscal
space available, the existence of large automatic stabilizers, and concerns that the market
might have reacted adversely to an expansionary fiscal stance.
Italy's real GDP loss has been one of the highest in the advanced G-20 countries, but the already
large size of the government appeared to be a dominant f actor f or the size of the f iscal stimulus.

The center-right government that came to power in May 2008 is likely to see out
its full term ending in 2013. The government retains a handsome majority, and its
popularity was confirmed by the outcomes of recent local elections.

government support. However, the recovery is likely to be moderate because: (1) the slow
rebound of Italy’s major trading partners and persistent competitiveness gap will limit the
scope for export growth; (2) the sustained rise in non-performing loans, enhanced lending
discrimination due to the continued decline in the perceived creditworthiness of borrowers,
and the need to rebuild capital in response to forthcoming new regulation are likely to
constrain credit supply; (3) rising and persistent unemployment will undermine private
consumption; and (4) firms will likely remain cautious on investment due to financing
constraints, low capacity utilization, and falling profitability. More generally, the recovery
will likely be hampered by many structural factors, including pervasive rigidities in product
and labor markets, stagnant productivity, as well as the burden of the public sector.

Inflation is expected to gradually increase in line with the recovery and rising
energy prices. Inflation rose sharply from 0.1 percent year-on-year in August 2009 to

and the differential with the euro area widened further, largely due to service prices, likely
reflecting weak domestic competition. Inflation is projected to rise to 1.4 percent in 2010 and
1.7 percent in 2011 owing to strengthening demand, and rising energy prices.

21.
A significant and permanent output loss will probably be the legacy of the global
financial crisis. After an initial rebound, growth is expected to slow over the medium term,
converging to potential. The level of output in 2015 is projected to be around 10 percent
lower than the pre-crisis historical trend (for 1990–2004), mainly reflecting (1) the sharp fall
in capital accumulation experienced during this recession, (2) higher structural
unemployment, (3) the deterioration in total factor productivity associated with the credit
slowdown and lack of incentives for industrial restructuring, and (4) weaker growth in
partner countries.
22.
The authorities believed that staff projections for potential output were too
pessimistic. They argued that Italy’s recession reflected only a severe external demand
shock. However, unlike some other countries, Italy did not suffer from asset bubbles, a
domestic financial crisis, or the prospect of lost or shrinking sectors. This could lead to a
quick rebound once external conditions improve. Staff stressed that, even though the crisis
may have had an external origin, it has likely lowered the potential growth of some of Italy’s
trading partners and could therefore have a permanent effect on foreign demand for Italian
goods and services. Staff also noted that prolonged demand shocks (of whatever source)
could have permanent adverse effects on idle labor and capital through hysteresis effects. The
authorities and staff concurred that considerable uncertainty surrounded post-crisis medium
term dynamics.
Risks and spillovers
23.
Risks are, on balance, tilted toward the downside in the near term and become
more negative in the long term. In the near term, there is an upside scenario where the
global recovery and the inventory cycle could gain more momentum. On the downside,
continued tight credit and falling profitability might further limit private investment, while
rising unemployment may restrain consumption. There is also the danger of destabilizing
spillovers from regional financial market turbulence. In the longer term, there is a risk of
prolonged economic stagnation, resulting from the failure to address structural issues, leading
to rising structural unemployment and a deteriorating fiscal situation.
24.
Spillovers from market turbulence in Greece, Spain or Portugal are not unlikely
but have been limited so far. Italian sovereign bond spreads over bunds have declined from
their peak in early 2009 and have so far been only marginally affected by recent regional
turbulence. Italy’s high debt-to-GDP ratio, the large gross financing (mostly debt rollover)
requirement (about 25 percent of GDP annually), and dismal growth performance could
make Italy susceptible to reversals in market sentiment. On the other hand, markets should
take comfort from Italy’s strong corporate and household balance sheets, the absence of a
housing bubble, the strength of its banking sector, its small competitiveness gap, its relatively
favorable net foreign asset position and its traditionally high private savings. However,
market sentiment could turn sharply negative if the government does not specify sufficiently
promptly detailed plans to reduce the fiscal deficit according to its medium-term plan.

III. THE POLICY AGENDA: RENEWING THE REFORM MOMENTUM TO FOSTER SUSTAINED
GROWTH
25.
The downside risks could be mitigated if Italy were to embark on a program of
comprehensive reforms in order to raise its longer-term growth potential. Although
significant reforms have been undertaken in recent years, much more is needed—especially
after the recent global crisis—to significantly improve longer-term economic performance.
This calls for tackling with greater vigor the long-standing problems of poor productivity and
fiscal weakness. Such a strategy would also help financial markets differentiate between Italy
and other highly indebted advanced countries. International experience shows that the
implementation of such reforms require determined political leadership over many years and
can take considerable time to bear fruit.
26.
Other countries have overcome similar challenges from very difficult starting
positions with comprehensive policy packages. Canada, Australia, United Kingdom, New
Zealand, Ireland, and the Netherlands all undertook path-breaking fiscal and structural
reforms in the 1980s and 1990s in the wake of severe recessions. Indeed, Italy itself
significantly cut its debt, liberalized its labor market and reformed its pension system during
this same period. Empirical evidence suggests that recoveries from economic crises can often
serve as an opportunity for reform. Broad-based support can be harnessed through such
institutions as the independent commissions to set the agenda (France’s Attali Commission
and Australia’s Productivity Commission) or monitor public finances (Sweden’s Fiscal
Policy Council), and pacts with social partners (the Netherlands’ Wassenaar agreements).

15
A. Fiscal Sector: Deep Expenditure-Based Consolidation Required
Short- and medium-term outlook
27.
The 2010 budget targets a deficit
of 5.0 percent of GDP, representing a
small reduction with respect to the
outturn for 2009. This targeted
improvement in the deficit reflects the
phasing out of some 2009 one-off outlays,
and implementation of the expenditure
rationalization measures. The budget also
includes a few stimulus measures equivalent
to 0.4 percent of GDP, to be covered mainly
by some revenue collection postponed from
2009.
28.
The government plans to reduce
the deficit to below 3 percent of GDP by
2012. The plan, which is outlined in the
January 2010 Stability Program Update,
envisions a reduction of the deficit below
3 percent of GDP one year earlier than for
most of other Excessive Deficit Procedure
(EDP)-subject countries (due to its high debt
and relatively modest deficit). This will
require a fiscal consolidation of over
1 percent of GDP in 2011–12 compared to
that based on existing legislation. The
authorities have not yet specified the
measures through which fiscal consolidation
will be achieved.

29.

The government’s fiscal adjustment strategy raises some concerns:



Realism of consolidation plans. Reducing the deficit to about 2¾ percent of GDP by
2012 would require cuts in primary current spending of 2 percent every year over the
period in real terms, even assuming GDP growth of 2 percent in 2011–12. This
compares with increases in such spending averaging 2 percent a year over the last
decade. Moreover, the plan relies on very optimistic assumptions on spending
efficiency, combating tax evasion, unspecified saving in local governments deriving
from fiscal federalism, and one-off measures.

16


The planned consolidation is not
ambitious enough. Meeting the minimum
requirement under the Stability and Growth
Pact (an annual structural adjustment, net
of one-offs, of ½ percent of GDP) in 2010–
12, would still not deliver the medium-term
objective (MTO) of structural balance by
the end of the period. Moreover, debt
service costs rise continuously, and the
debt ratio would likely remain well above
100 percent of GDP a decade from now,
with potentially further negative
implications on growth.

1/ Assumes primary balance path in 2010 –12 in line with
the authorities' policy scenario (Stability Programme
Update, Jan 2010; and Nota di Aggiornamento 2010–12);
primary balance is assumed to stay constant after 2013.



Withdrawal of stimulus. The plan
assumes that the existing anti-crisis measures will largely expire by 2012. However,
as unemployment rate is still rising and will persist a while, there may continue to be
a need for income and employment support.



Weaknesses in the budget process. Plans to have a more streamlined and targeted
budget have proven difficult to implement, with amendments and new extensions of
existing provisions having quickly followed the just-approved budget.



Tax amnesty. The recent tax amnesty,
despite its announced success in terms of
volumes of repatriated capital, could
decrease already low tax compliance while
the impact of accompanying measures to
deter future tax evasion is yet to be seen.
Unlike recent initiatives in other countries
that focused on disclosure, Italy’s amnesty
provides full anonymity to the taxpayer,
immunity against further administrative or
criminal investigations, and allows the
regularization of funds held abroad in
connection with tax evasion in return for
paying a relatively low final tax.

The tax compliance gap with euro area average
has been widening in recent years.

30.
The staff’s medium-term scenario is less optimistic than the authorities’
(Figure 4). The overall deficit in 2010 is projected to remain at about the same level as in
2009, and only slowly declines in following years. Less sanguine assumptions about
expenditure savings (especially on current spending), together with different macroeconomic
assumptions after 2010, explain most of the difference. While the structural primary balance
would stabilize at about 1¼ percent of GDP over the medium term, rising interest and
pension cost will make structural consolidation difficult, and the debt ratio could increase to
about 125 percent of GDP by the end of the projection period.

17
31.
Local governments have some exposure to derivative products. The use of
derivates by local authorities has been banned on a temporary basis since 2008 while new
and more stringent legislation is being prepared, and recently a special parliamentary
commission found the problem to be limited in scale. Even though a comprehensive
assessment of all fiscal risks arising from exposure to derivatives at the local level is not
available, Bank of Italy’s data suggest that potential losses from such instruments contracted
with Italian banks could be of the order of €1–2 billion (0.1 percent of GDP) in total, and
thereby manageable from a macroeconomic perspective.
32.
The authorities reiterated the commitment to reducing the deficit to below
3 percent of GDP by 2012 and to further consolidation in the longer term. They agreed
that assumptions on growth may be optimistic but pointed out that corrective measures could
be taken if necessary.

Longer-term outlook
33.
Official longer-term fiscal projections seem relatively favorable compared to
those of euro area peers. Although Italy had the highest pre-crisis debt ratio in the euro
area, it is projected to have the lowest debt ratio in the euro area in 2060 (206 percent of GDP
versus an average of 422 percent of GDP), according to the 2009 Sustainability Report of the
European Commission (EC). Similarly, various long-term fiscal sustainability analyses place
Italy among the countries with the lowest sustainability gap. This positive outlook is largely
due to the projected stabilization of pension spending despite the rapidly aging population, as
a result of a series of past pension reforms with future implications. Pension spending,
however, will still remain among the highest in the world.

These results, however, hinge on a number of optimistic assumptions. The
projections, while based on the commonly applied EC assumptions, assume a long-term
average labor productivity growth of over 1.6 percent, well above the stagnant growth rate
experienced in the past decade. They are also based on the key assumption that the pension
reform would be fully implemented, including periodic revisions of the conversion
coefficients and the maintenance of the contributory principle. Moreover, the remaining
reform is heavily back-loaded, with about two thirds of the adjustments in benefits expected
to take place after 2020 compared to only about half of the adjustment after 2020 for reforms
in other advanced economies. The sharp fall in the replacement ratio, from 67 percent in
2007 to 49 percent in 2060, could be politically challenging. Further risks would likely arise
from the growing use of flexible labor market arrangements which reduce the pension
revenues and result in lower pension benefits.

Stronger medium-term fiscal consolidation and increased growth will be
necessary to ensure fiscal sustainability. Without a fiscal effort additional to what is
envisaged, the debt ratio would become unsustainable in a low growth scenario (with real
GDP growth of about 0.8 percent over the long term). In a scenario with somewhat higher
growth (1.1 percent), an adjustment effort generating a structural improvement equivalent to
about 2¼ percent of GDP over 2010–12 (against the authorities’ envisaged 1¾ percent of
GDP, of which about 1¼ percent of GDP is yet to be identified) would be necessary to
broadly stabilize the debt ratio over the long run. Additional savings from age-related
expenditure (equivalent to cutting nominal pensions by 5 percent over the long term) would
still be needed to bring debt ratio to 60 percent.

36.
The pension system should be adjusted to build buffers and to distribute the
fiscal burden of reform more equally across generations. Pension reform should proceed
as planned, but additional reforms should be considered to ensure long-term sustainability,
including revisiting the current high replacement rates and increasing the age of retirement
age. In this context, the enactment of the recently legislated indexation of the retirement age
to changes in life expectancy, though starting from 2015, could be brought forward, possibly
saving as much as 0.3–0.7 percent of GDP a year over the medium term. A more
front-loaded adjustment effort would also help balance the intergenerational distribution of
the fiscal burden arising from past pension reforms.
37.
The authorities considered the pension system sustainable but were open to the
idea of bringing forward the already scheduled increase in the retirement age.

22
38.
Fiscal consolidation should be based on rationalizing current spending. The
authorities’ plans concerning the reduction in personnel costs (mainly via slowing the
turnover in public employment), and containing the growth of intermediate consumption of
ministries and of healthcare spending (particularly, on pharmaceuticals) should be fully
implemented. Consolidation should also include strict adherence to budget targets, including
minimizing new spending initiatives outside the budget process, a commitment to save any
revenue overperformance, and implementing the recommendations of the recently completed
expenditure reviews. On the revenue side, the already high labor income tax-wedge would
limit feasibility for tax rate increases, but there remains scope for broadening the tax base.
One-off revenue measures should generally be avoided.

The authorities saw fiscal federalism as the key priority to achieve fiscal
consolidation, improve the quality of public spending, and revive the South. Imposing
tougher budget constraints and moving away from the culture of soft, centrally-financed
budgets is seen as sine qua non for the establishment of fiscal discipline at local level while
fostering development in southern regions. The authorities were aware that fiscal federalism
in other countries had often been associated with an increase in fiscal expenditures overall,
but expressed their determination to ensure a fiscally-prudent fiscal federalism in Italy.

23
Box 1. Recent Fiscal Framework Reforms
Budget reform. The 2009 Accounting and Public Finance law (Legge di contabilità e finanza
pubblica) marks a first step in bringing Italy’s public financial management in line with best
international practices. Its focus on harmonizing accounting systems, strengthening
expenditure control and monitoring, and enhancing performance orientation of the budget is
welcome. But the reform falls short on resolving some key issues such the establishment of a
strict top-down budgeting process, the adoption of binding medium-term expenditure ceilings,
the use of a credible current-policy baseline, the introduction of long-term scenarios, the
(further) enhancement of transparency, and the strengthening of independent scrutiny of
forecasts and policies. The law also envisages a move, over three years, toward a cash concept
in budgeting (though informed by accrual-based accounting) but its pilot-based
implementation implies uncertainties as to the outcome of this proposal.
Fiscal federalism. In May 2009, the Parliament adopted a Delegation Law outlining the main
principles of fiscal federalism. The law stipulates that fiscal federalism must be consistent
with Italy's commitments under the Stability and Growth Pact and gives the government the
authority to issue main implementation decrees by May 2011. In addition, it states the general
principle that standard costs, fiscal discipline, and accounting uniformity will be important
features. The key principles of harmonization of public sector budgets are expected to be
defined by mid-May 2010 but the work of the technical commission is still lagging, and only a
decree on transferring public property to local authorities (federalismo demaniale) has been
introduced. The bulk of reform implementation measures, including determination of standard
costs, subnational revenue assignments, and the size and sharing of the equalization fund will
be adopted by May 2011.

B. Financial Sector: Mitigating Vulnerabilities
41.
Going forward, Italian banks will benefit from improved macroeconomic
conditions, but vulnerabilities will remain. In line with the projected output recovery,
revenues are expected to increase moderately, due to a low rate of lending growth, a limited
rise in interest rates, and some positive contribution from commission income. A more
favorable environment for corporates and households is expected to slow the pace of
deterioration in credit quality. However, given the still fragile economy, and the lag between
economic recovery and improvement in asset quality, banks will continue to face a high level
of credit risk for the next two years. For the two largest banks, further deterioration of credit
risk in central and Eastern Europe could add to earnings pressure.

24
Box 2. Scenario Analysis of the Banking Sector
According to a scenario analysis run by staff, the five largest banks would not be able to
generate sufficient profits to significantly strengthen capital ratios. The Base Scenario
takes into consideration a macroeconomic outlook in line with IMF estimates of a 2010 GDP
growth of 0.8 percent, and 1.2 percent in 2011. As a result, loans are expected to grow by
1–3 percent in 2010–11, revenues by 1–3 percent, loan loss provisions to further increase by
6-9 percent in 2010, before falling by 3–0 percent in 2011. Under such assumptions,
cumulated loan loss provisions in the 2010–2011 periods would be one third higher than in the
2008–2009 periods. Earnings would slightly improve in 2010 and in 2011, but would continue
to remain significantly lower than before the crisis. Assuming a dividend distribution of the
order of 10-30 percent of earnings, aggregated Core Tier1 ratio would rise in the 2010–11
period by less than 0.5 percentage points by 2011. The capital shortfall with respect to an
8 percentage Core Tier1 level would on average progressively close by 2011, although with
significant bank by bank convergence differences.
In a more severe scenario with a more sluggish economic recovery and a weaker
corporate landscape, earnings would shrink further and capital ratios would deteriorate.
The Severe Scenario takes into consideration a harsh macroeconomic outlook, with GDP
declining by -1.7 percent in 2010 and by -1.3 percent in 2011 (or a cumulative 2.5 percentage
points lower than in the Base Scenario). Under this scenario, loans would remain flat, revenue
growth would be negative, and loan loss provisions could increase by some 18-22 percent, in
both 2010 and 2011. The cumulated loan losses would be 65 percent higher than in 2008-09.
Such scenario would generate a significant erosion of profitability. On an aggregated level, the
Core Tier1 ratio would deteriorate to below the 7 percent mark, for several banks.

42.
Efforts to strengthen banks’ recapitalization should thus continue. Banks, which
will already have a hard time raising capital under existing guidelines (see Box 2), will also
need to comply with a new regulatory framework that will call for more and higher quality
capital. The impact of the new capital rules on Italian banks should be manageable, given the
stringent requirements already applied by the Bank of Italy with regard to capital deductions
and to hybrid capital limits. However, given the still moderate outlook for profitability, it will
be difficult to significantly reinforce capital through earnings retention, even assuming low
dividend distributions. Banks should thus be encouraged, on a case by case basis, to continue
to dispose of non strategic assets and raise capital from the market, as market conditions
improve. In particular, banks that took advantage of the recapitalization bonds will need to
prepare an alternative recapitalization strategy as the interest rate on these securities rises
sharply in three years.
43.
The authorities should guide the domestic banking system towards the prompt
adoption of the latest recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision. Although implementation of the proposals will take time, Italian banks should
begin to adapt their capital strategies around the new regulatory framework, and the
authorities should quickly adopt the new international rules, as soon as possible after they are
defined.

25
44.
Consideration should be given to loosening the current tax rules on the
deductibility of loan write-downs. These rules are stricter than those in force in other major
European countries, and while the existing fiscal treatment of loan losses has the advantage
of creating substantial deferred tax assets that currently can be included in banks’ regulatory
capital, this will not be allowed under forthcoming new regulations. Such action would also
help support earnings, recapitalization, and lending in the face of increasing non performing
loans.
45.
Government sponsored loan guarantees to support SMEs were appropriate in
the circumstances, but an exit strategy should be planned. Measures to support credit to
the SMEs are justified in view of the sharp recession and credit drought, especially given the
very large size of the SMEs sector in Italy. However, recourse to government guarantees
should be temporary and appropriately priced. Nor should government support to firms
prevent needed restructuring. Some improvements to the existing bankruptcy regime could
be useful to help rehabilitate distressed, but creditworthy, firms and the speedy liquidation of
non viable enterprises. For example, consideration could be given to the enhancement of the
mechanism to support prompt provision of new financing to enterprises during the
restructuring period in line with international best practices. The current eligibility criteria for
bankruptcy trustees could also to be reexamined to better promote the appointment of
trustees with firm management and restructuring skills.
46.
The authorities concurred with the staff on the need for further capital
strengthening of banks. They saw this as necessary, in view of the forthcoming changes in
international regulation and increasing loan loss provisions. The authorities also expressed
concerns that banks could be too conservative in their lending practice, which could hinder
the credit rebound and the recovery.
C. Renewing the Structural Reform Momentum
47.
Persistent low productivity growth in Italy has deep structural causes. The main
structural factors are: (1) policy and regulatory rigidities limiting competition and hindering
the business environment; (2) low efficiency, linked to the preponderance of small and
medium-sized enterprises typically unable to exploit fully economies of scale; (3) limited
process and product innovation, hindered by labor market rigidities; (4) outdated
specialization patterns, given a production structure (especially in manufacturing) based on
traditional low skill products; and (5) relatively poor human capital.
Although some structural reforms have been undertaken in recent years, further
48.
progress is needed. The government has, inter alia: (1) passed the local public services bill;
(2) began abolishing obsolete legislation; (3) strengthened the transparency and
accountability of public administration management; (4) implemented a law instituting
competition assessments and regulatory impact analysis; and (5) incorporated the Antitrust
Authority’s recommendations in a competition bill to be discussed by Parliament annually.
Given the electoral cycle and the urgent need to reinvigorate growth, the next three years
represent a unique opportunity to push forward the reform agenda.

26
49.
Further reforms are necessary to remove impediments to competition and
reduce the high cost of doing business in Italy. The second package of the 2007 structural
reform reduced regulatory barriers in retail trade, retail banking, insurance and professional
services. Further measures are needed to reduce state ownership in business activities in key
network sectors, including electricity, gas, postal services, and transport, limit local
government involvement in enterprises providing local services, eliminate entry barriers to
professional services, continue deregulation the energy market, strengthen the enforcement of
the rule of law, and enhance the role of competition bodies in formulating policy.
50.
The EU Services Directive should
be implemented without further delay. In
adherence with the EU Service Directive, the
government is currently in the process of
reviewing all existing regulations on service
activities at the central, regional, and local
level to ensure consistency of existing
regulation on service activities at all
government levels with the EU legislation.
While the review at the central government
level has been completed and is in the final
stage of the preparation of amendments,
regions are lagging.

51.
Despite substantial improvements over the past decade, labor market
performance still lags behind that in other European economies. Significant labor market
reforms over the past decade have improved employment, labor force participation, and
unemployment rates, but Italy’s (measured) employment-to-population ratio continues to
remain among the lowest in the euro area. In addition, unemployed workers still take a long
time to find work—nearly 50 percent of the unemployed have been out of work for more

27
than one year, substantially above the euro area average. While the deregulation of fixed-and
part-term contracts in recent years has improved labor market flexibility, it has also resulted
in more “atypical” employment, contributed to stagnant labor productivity, and exposed
workers to increased employment risk without commensurate improvements in the social
safety net.
52.
A second generation of labor market reforms is needed. Italy’s social safety net is
generous for some worker groups, but virtually nonexistent for (most) others; the extent of
employment protection varies substantially across worker groups; and the aggregate wage
distribution is highly compressed. The existing wage bargaining system exacerbates these
disparities: nationally bargained wages are less binding in the North, but too high for South,
and the lack of a broad social safety net, particularly for those in the South, prevents
sufficient spatial mobility. The public sector should take the lead in decentralizing wage
bargaining arrangements, taking into account regional differences in productivity and cost of
living. In this respect, a program to enhance transparency and productivity-related rewards in
the public administration has been introduced, although significant effects on wage
negotiations to be seen.
53.
The authorities pointed out that many reforms especially in the labor market
had already taken place, though with unequal effects across the country. At the same
time, the authorities saw the next three year—during which no elections are scheduled—as a
golden opportunity to proceed with growth-enhancing reforms. The authorities indicated that
government would announce decisive reforms in the next few months, especially in the area
of fiscal federalism and tax policy.

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
54.
Although the worst effects of the global financial crisis on Italy’s economy have
mostly passed, key vulnerabilities remain. The high private savings rate, low private
indebtedness, and the resilience of the financial sector are important elements of strength.
However, the elevated level of public debt and the disappointing growth performance could
make Italy vulnerable to future external shocks. The ongoing regional market turbulence
could also be destabilizing. Public debt management has been conducted prudently, by
lengthening the debt maturity and building buffers. These efforts should help strengthen the
government’s financial position. But they cannot be a substitute for a sustained fiscal
consolidation.
55.
The overarching goals should be to maintain fiscal discipline, reduce the burden
of public debt, and raise the economy’s long-term growth rate. Although the fiscal stance
was appropriate during the crisis given the very high level of public debt to GDP ratio,
efforts must now swiftly be made to reduce the fiscal deficit in a sustainable way. Public debt
needs to be put back on a declining path. Policies to reinvigorate growth should focus on
removing structural bottlenecks, improving the quality of public services, and strengthening
the financial sector.
56.
Staff endorses the authorities’ fiscal targets of reducing the deficit to below
3 percent by 2012. However, it cautions that the planned fiscal adjustment is based on the
optimistic assumption of a strong and sustained recovery, full implementation of the earlier
envisaged consolidation plans, and additional measures that have yet to be announced. Close
monitoring of sub-national public finances should be maintained. Consideration should be
given to advancing the pace of fiscal consolidation if market turbulence continues.
57.
Staff concurs with the authorities’ objective of an expenditure-based fiscal
consolidation. Containment of the public sector wage bill should be a key element of the
consolidation strategy. The progressive reduction of public employment should continue,
and a firm control of public wages is needed, especially at the local government level. The
2009 Accounting and Public Finance law marks a step in bringing Italy’s public financial
management in line with best international practices, and could help in the consolidation
effort, but effective implementation is crucial.
58.
The tax burden is high and weighs disproportionally on salaried and retired
workers. When the expenditure-based consolidation is firmly underway, the authorities
should consider a tax reform with the view to reducing the tax wedge while increasing tax
compliance. This reform should decrease the cost of labor and increase the employment rate,
which continues to be one of the lowest in Europe. Ad-hoc revenue measures which could be
detrimental to tax compliance in the long term should be avoided.
59.
Fiscal consolidation must be a key guiding principle in the implementation of the
federalism. The authorities see fiscal federalism as an opportunity to strengthen fiscal
responsibility at all levels of government. However, international experience shows that

30
implementation of fiscal federalism is often associated with fiscal expansion. The
government should consider offsetting measures if the reform is to result in higher costs. In
addition, the authorities will need to strike the right balance between regional autonomy and
transfers across regions in the context of large local income disparities.
60.
Italy has implemented bold pension reforms, which have significantly improved
the sustainability of the pension system. However, the remaining adjustment in benefits is
back-loaded and long-term sustainability projections are based on optimistic assumptions
about economic growth. These factors raise questions about intergenerational equity.
Therefore, the authorities should consider bringing forward the already scheduled increase in
the retirement age. Efforts to develop private pension schemes should also be intensified.
61.
Italian banks should increase their capitalization, as recommended by the Bank
of Italy. Banks will face a number of challenges over the medium term. Owing to the weak
economy, they will continue to encounter a high level of credit risk, low lending growth, and
significantly lower profitability than before the crisis. Furthermore, the international
regulatory rules will be tightened in several respects, including capital requirements. Banks
should be encouraged to dispose of non-strategic assets, retain earnings, and raise capital
from the market. Consideration could also be given to relaxing the current tax rules on the
deductibility of loan write-downs, which are stricter than in other major European countries,
also in light of the possible new capital regulation on deferred tax credits.
62.
The next few years offer an important opportunity to pursue an ambitious
program of structural reforms. The global crisis has further exposed the structural
weaknesses of the economy, underscoring the urgency of structural reform. Progress in the
structural reform agenda will be the key to unleash Italy’s growth potential. This will require
multi-faceted reforms to enhance competition, raise productivity, and reduce the high cost of
doing business in Italy. Such reforms could include enhancing the efficiency of public
services, improving the quality of public investment and infrastructure, streamlining
bureaucratic requirements, reforming civil justice and accelerating legal processes, and
strengthening enforcement of the rule of law. The EU Services Directive should be
implemented without further delay to ensure the consistency of existing regulations on
service activities at all government levels with the Directive.
63.
Labor market performance still lags behind that in other European economies.
Previous reforms have helped to reduce unemployment. Nevertheless, Italy's employment
rate still remains among the lowest in Europe, productivity is lagging, and the labor market is
split between highly protected workers with permanent contracts and ill-protected temporary
workers. This gap needs to be bridged by making permanent contracts more flexible and
temporary workers more protected while simplifying the labor market legislation. A second
generation of labor market reforms is also needed to strengthen the link between wages and
productivity, allow wages to better respond to regional differences, and foster adequate
spatial mobility.

It is proposed that the next Article IV Consultation be held on the regular
12-month cycle.

ANALYTICAL ANNEX I: ITALY’S FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY REVISITED1
Despite unfavorable demographic trends, high public debt, and generous pensions, Italy’s
longer-term fiscal outlook appears to be benign compared to euro area peers. This outlook,
however, is not without challenges and risks. Ensuring fiscal sustainability would require
economic growth much stronger than in the past decade, bold fiscal adjustment over the
medium term, and full implementation of the planned pension reform as well as further
reforms to improve intergenerational equity.
I. INTRODUCTION
Fiscal sustainability will be largely driven by demographic trends. The old-age
dependency ratio is projected to double in EU countries in 2010–2060: for every person over
65 there will be only two working-age persons instead of the current four (the balance
between inactive elderly and the employed population is even less favorable). Ageing is
projected to affect both economic growth and public expenditure. Its impact, combined with
post-crisis weak budgetary position, makes the long-term fiscal situation in Europe
unsustainable in the absence of reforms (EC, 2009a). With unchanged policies, average EU
public debt would be more than 400 percent of GDP in 2060, with about half of the required
adjustment to ensure sustainability just offsetting the impact of ageing costs.

In Italy, the increase in age-related expenditures appears to be relatively contained,
primarily owing to the expected impact of pension reforms already enacted. Between
2007 and 2060, total age-related government expenditure is projected to increase by about
5 percentage points of GDP for the EU, but only by 1.6 percentage points of GDP for Italy—

Consequently, Italy fares relatively well in terms of the standard indicators of fiscal
sustainability. The authorities’ January 2010 Stability Programme Update projects a steady
decline in the public debt ratio to below 40 percent of GDP by 2060 and an absence of
sustainability gaps based on the standard indicators (for details on the latter, see EC, 2006).
The 2009 Sustainability Report by the European Commission suggests that sustainability
gaps exist in Italy, but these are the smallest in the euro area (EC, 2009a). Even with some
upward adjustments to age-related costs, Balassone and others (2010) find that Italy would
achieve the lowest debt and deficit ratios in 2060 and with smallest sustainability gaps.
This Annex examines the factors behind the relatively favorable long-term fiscal
prospects for Italy. It identifies the factors driving the positive long-term outlook,
particularly pension reform. It assesses the challenges and risks surrounding these outcomes,
including the risk of reversal of the reforms and the weight of the adjustment put in future
generations of workers. Finally, it discusses alternative illustrative scenarios and provides
suggestions to ensure fiscal sustainability.

2

These estimates use the baseline scenario from EC (2009b); but even in the less optimistic scenario, in which
health cost increases are more in line with historical trends, Italy would still have one of the lowest age-related
expenditure among the advanced EU countries.

II. CURRENT FISCAL ENVIRONMENT AND PENSION REFORMS
A. The State of Public Finances in Italy
The financial crisis worsened Italy’s already fragile fiscal position and exacerbated the
structural weaknesses of the budget. Public debt reached 115.8 percent of GDP in 2009—
second only to Japan among advanced G-20 countries. The deficit doubled, despite modest
stimulus measures and large one-off revenue receipts. Recent efforts to introduce more
flexibility in the budget have helped ease slightly expenditure rigidities but the share of
non-discretionary primary spending in GDP increased substantially, reaching 30½ percent of
GDP in 2009.4 The high tax burden, including relatively high taxes on wages, and persistent
problems with improving significantly the revenue-raising potential further constrain the
fiscal policy space.

Pension expenditure is relatively large but its growth rate has stabilized since 2000.5
With one-third of budgetary resources spent on pensions, Italy has the largest share of
pension expenditure in GDP among advanced economies. In addition to demographic
factors—one inactive person over 65 for every two employed 15–64—the high level of
pension spending reflects the relative generosity of the system. After several reforms,
however, the growth rate of real pension spending has stabilized at below 1½ percent per
year.

Other age-related expenditures, especially health spending, have been on the rise and
also show greater volatility. At about 7 percent of GDP, the level of public health spending
is near the euro area average. The decentralized nature of health services involves risks,
especially in the presence of “soft” budget constraints and negotiations of the health budget
(Patto per la salute) between the central and subnational governments (the latter provide
about 1/3 of total contributions to the health system). 6 Ongoing fiscal federalism reform
compounds the uncertainty in this area.

RGS (2009, 2010) lists several different definitions of pension expenditure depending on the specific social
benefit programs included in the calculation. In this annex, the MEF/RGS definition is used, as in the general
government fiscal accounts. MEF/RGS definition includes old-age, disability, and survivors (IVS) pensions and
old-age means tested transfers (social pensions and social allowances starting from 1995). This definition
excludes severance payments (TFR) by private and public employers (estimated at over 1¼ percent of GDP).
6
The financial position of the National Health Service (Servizio Sanitario Nazionale, SSN) has however
improved somewhat in recent years, with the deficit of €3.2 billion (0.2 percent of GDP) in 2008 expected to
have been covered by the regions.

B. Pension reforms in Italy
In many ways, the structure of the Italian pension system is broadly in line with pension
systems in other advanced G-20 countries. These systems generally offer a means-tested
pension benefit as the basic layer of retirement income accompanied by an earnings-related
mandatory component and voluntary occupational schemes (Appendix Table A2). Nearly all
of these systems index pensions to prices. Although Italy uses Notional Defined Contribution
Accounts—which directly link contributions to benefits— instead of the traditional Defined
Benefit structure of public pensions in all other advanced G-20, all these systems generally
use current workers’ contributions to pay for current pensions.
In Italy, however, public pensions play a larger role than in other advanced G-20
countries. The Italian system offers the highest average gross replacement rate (nearly
70 percent of average earnings) and has a relatively high payroll tax rate among the advanced
G-20. Even accounting for the already legislated reforms, Italy will still have the highest
replacement rate among these countries for many decades—only after 2055 France would
have a slightly higher replacement rate.

In the absence of the envisaged adjustments,
demographic pressures would increase outlays
substantially. In Italy, pension spending would
increase from 15¼ percent of GDP in 2010 to 24½
percent in 2050. Other advanced G-20 countries
face much less pressing fiscal demands due to
demographics, in large part because of their
smaller current pension expenditures.

challenges. The waves of reforms in 1990s and
2000s included a combination of measures to increase revenues and reduce the generosity of
benefits, including via increasing the age prerequisites to access pension (see Box 1). As a
result, the authorities’ latest estimates suggest that pension spending would decline from the
2008 level of 14¼ percent of GDP to about 13½ percent of GDP in 2060. Other advanced G20 countries have also adopted reforms to offset the changes in demographics.
The reform path has not been without setbacks. Over the years, discretionary adjustments
to the system have been introduced, some of which delayed or reversed the reform impact.
These included a five year delay (from 2005 to 2010) in reviewing the transformation
coefficients—an important component of the system that reduces benefits to reflect increases
in longevity. Also, increases in the early retirement age were partially delayed (and even
slightly lowered for those with 36 years of contributions). As a result of incremental changes,
the system continues to be very complex.
Despite these setbacks, the impetus for reform continues. The 2004 reform widened the
“exit windows” for claiming early retirement, effectively increasing the early retirement age
by up to 9–12 months. The 2007 reform responded to the delay in transformation coefficients
by increasing the frequency (from every 10 to every 3 years) of the adjustments and making
them administrative (the hearing of parliamentary committees, employers’ federation and
trade unions is no longer required). It also set a more rapid increase of the early retirement
age to 62 in 2013 instead of 2014, while a 2009 law linked the early retirement age to
increases in life expectancy starting in 2015.

43
Box 1. Highlights of the Italian Pension Reform
The 1992 reform cut net pension liabilities by about 25 percent. The main changes included:
increasing the retirement age from 60 (55) to 65 (60) for men (women); increasing reference earnings
from 5 to 10 years (lifetime earnings for younger workers); changing valorization to prices plus
1 percent; increasing contributing years from 15 to 20; and, most importantly, modifying indexation
from wages to prices. The 1995 reform adopted a Notional Defined Contribution system in which
pension benefits depend on lifetime contributions and GDP growth. The retirement age was set at
57 (with 5 years of contributions), with benefits adjusted depending on the age at which pensions are
first claimed. After first receipt, pensions grow with inflation. The 2004 reform raised the minimum
retirement age from 57 to 60 in 2008 to 62 in 2014 for those with a minimum of 35 years of
contributions, along with widening the “exit windows”. The 2007 reform smoothed the initial
increase in the retirement age (from 57 to 58 in 2008) but brought forward the increase to age
62 to 2013 (63 for the self-employed). Additionally, the minimum age requirement was reduced by a
year for those with 36 years of contributions. The above age requirements apply uniformly to all three
pension regimes (retributive, contributive, and mixed). A 2008 law allowed old age and seniority
pensions to be fully cumulated with labor income. In 2009, statutory retirement age of women in the
public sector (60 in 2009) was set to increase starting from 2010, to equalize it with age of men
(currently 65) by 2018, in response to the European Court of Justice sentence. Furthermore, the 2009
law introduced a five-year indexation mechanism linking the age retirement prerequisites to changes
in life expectancy starting in 2015 but implementation mechanisms are yet to be enacted by end-2014.

Contribution Years Required to Access
Pension Regardless of Age

Plans to develop private pension schemes, however, have not been very successful.
Starting January 1, 2007, severance-pay benefits are to be accumulated in funds outside
employers. The Trattamento di fine rapporto (TFR) is a mandatory benefit that employers
traditionally financed by book reserves on behalf of workers to be withdrawn as a lump-sum
upon retirement or separation. The default destination for future contributions is private
pension funds. Workers have the option to opt-out of private funds, in which case the TFR
contributions are held by special fund of the INPS (the National Social Security Institute) on
behalf of the Treasury. Progress in the development of TFR private funds, however, suffered
a setback following the financial crisis—open and closed funds had substantial financial
losses in 2008. This fueled an aversion to the risks of private funds. The funds recovered in
2009 but the early enthusiasm seems to have been lost. By December of 2009, about

44
5 million workers (only about 1/5 of the labor force) had subscribed to these funds. For the
remainder, the severance-pay contributions were transferred to the INPS or remained within
the firms.
III. RE-ASSESSING ITALY’S LONG-TERM FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY
A. Why Italy looks good and what are the challenges ahead
At first sight, long-term fiscal prospects
for Italy do not appear to raise serious
concerns. The authorities’ latest
projections, based on the envisaged policy
scenario (under the excessive deficit
procedure requirement of the Stability and
Growth Pact) of structural tightening of
about 1.8 percentage points of GDP in
2010–12 suggest that public finances are
on a long-term sustainable path. Debt
would steadily decline to below 40 percent
of GDP in 2060, deficit would remain well
within the 3 percent of GDP threshold,
and age-related spending would stabilize,
remaining below the euro area average.

However, this favorable outlook is subject to a number of challenges. First, under these
projections, labor productivity and real GDP growth would have to be well above the growth
rates evidenced in past decade. Second, near- to medium-term fiscal adjustment, including in
non age-related spending and pensions, has to take place as planned, at a minimum, and more
so if growth disappoints or there are slippages in medium-term fiscal consolidation. Third,
pressures from health and other age-relating spending should be contained.
Assumptions about future growth and its components are key. In the absence of further
broad structural reforms, the expected large increase in long-term productivity cannot be
readily assumed. Indeed, the authorities’ most recent revisions, which are used in the
subsequent analysis, have adjusted the labor productivity growth downwards. However, the
assumption that the relatively strong employment dynamics experienced in the past will
continue would seem to be at odds with the projected increase in the ratio of inactive elderly
to the economically active population.

Scenarios discussed below differ from the authorities’ macro-fiscal policy scenario in
several aspects. For the medium term, real GDP growth is assumed to be slower and
hump-shaped, reaching 1½ percent of GDP in 2012 (in contrast to the authorities’
2¼ percent) and declining to 1¼ percent by 2015. For the longer term, labor productivity
growth and employment growth are both assumed to be weaker than in the authorities’
scenario (itself following the common scenarios adopted in the context of the European
Commission and the Economic Policy Committee of age-related expenditure (AWG) work).
The authorities’ fiscal plans to scale back one-off crisis-related interventions in 2010 are
taken into account, along with most of the consolidation measures under the unchanged
legislation scenario. The scenarios without medium-term fiscal adjustment reflect the lack of
specific measures to support the authorities’ proposed policy scenario. The starting point (for
debt and structural primary balance) in the authorities’ above-mentioned long-term
sustainability projections presented in the latest Stability Programme Update is 2012,
whereas that in the following exercise is 2015. Lastly, expenditure on pensions, health
(‘reference scenario’) and long-term care is calibrated for respective macroeconomic
scenarios.7
Lower long-term growth and a lack of medium-term fiscal adjustment would render
fiscal situation unsustainable. The debt would reach 400 percent of GDP by 2060 in such
illustrative scenario. Assuming the authorities’ optimistic assumptions about long-term
growth developments, the debt ratio would reach over 200 percent of GDP (close to the
projection in the 2009 Sustainability Report).

Education spending is based on EC (2009b). The age-related expenditure projections incorporate the impact of
immigration, with the net flow of immigrants assumed at about 200,000 annually in the baseline scenario.
Increases in immigration would ease pension pressures in the near-term, but would not change the overall
picture substantially: according to the authorities, a 40,000 higher net flow of immigration from 2020 would
result in a reduction of about ½ percentage points of GDP in age-related spending by 2060, two-thirds of which
in pensions achieved mainly after 2040.

Both strong medium-term fiscal consolidation and increased growth are necessary for
fiscal sustainability but may still not be sufficient. The fiscal consolidation (1¾ percentage
points of GDP in 2010–2012) envisaged in the Stability Programme Update (SP) combined
with the authorities’ optimistic growth assumptions would put the debt on a declining path,
and deficit would remain broadly within the 3 percent of GDP threshold. However, even by
2060, the debt-to-GDP ratio would not reach the 60 percent level. Only together with
stronger fiscal consolidation—say, ½ percentage points of GDP over the SP effort in
2011–12 is assumed, via non-age related spending cuts, similar to the authorities’ approach
in SP—debt will eventually fall under 60 percent threshold (not reported on the chart).
Instead, under more realistic—average growth assumptions—even with the stronger fiscal
adjustment effort the debt dynamics would reverse, and sustainability concerns may
re-emerge. These illustrative findings are summarized in the table with the standard
sustainability indicators, pointing also to the importance of addressing age-related spending
pressures.

Some challenges, however, arise from the assumed evolution of age-related spending,
especially pensions. The baseline projections for pension expenditures offer a healthy
outlook for the sustainability of the pension system. However, two main challenges lay
ahead: first, uncertainty exists due to implementation risks and the sensitivity of some of the
assumptions; and second, issues of intergenerational equity remain due to the back-loading of
the remaining reform.
Although the authorities have responded to reversal attempts, implementation risks
remain. Recent attempts for reversal of the reforms—such as the delay in the update of the
transformation coefficient or the more gradual increase in the early retirement age—suggest
that the risks of implementation are important. The effects of these delays are not negligible:
initial pension benefits were reduced by between 6 and 8 percent for new beneficiaries
depending on age after the new coefficients were introduced in 2010. There is a risk that the
expected cuts in replacement rates could precipitate further attempts to delay the reform,
which could be perceived as the weak link of the reform efforts.
The projected decline in replacement rates points to a larger role for voluntary
pensions. The Italian pension system currently includes some sharp cuts in replacement
rates, especially for the very

pension funds. Encouragingly, despite the crisis, the number of subscribers to private pension
funds increased in 2009 (by about five percent); however the persistently small share of
young-age contributors is worrisome.
Other key assumptions might not materialize. A

key assumption is that the number of contributors to

however, might increase the incentive to stay in the

While pension reforms have improved the balance across generations, an important
burden still remains on future generations. Mainly by introducing price indexation of
benefits, the 1992 reform greatly reduced the burden on future generations of workers—net
pension liabilities were reduced by about 25 percent. However, intergenerational inequities
remain due to the slow transition implied by the reforms which grandfathered individuals
with at least 15 years of contributions in 1992 (18 years in 1995)—cohorts covered by the
old, more generous system are projected to get benefits until at least 2040. For instance, the
net present value of pensions for a current new born are about 75 percent of benefits of a 40year old and 50 percent of benefits of a 60-year old.8 The current divide in the labor market
between different types of labor arrangements could also exacerbate the intragenerational
inequities. Simple simulations show that the pension of a worker with a temporary contract in
the initial working years would be, other things equal, 30 percent lower than that of a worker
with an open-ended contract.9

Future adjustments in pensions are back-loaded.
In particular, future adjustments to pensions will kick
in more gradually in Italy than in other advanced G20 countries. Over the next 40 years, the overall
changes in pension outlays due to reform are larger in
Italy (a decline of 36.4 percent) than in other G-20
countries (a decline of 28.2 percent). However, the
remaining effects of the reform are heavily back-

loaded—about 2/3 of the adjustments are expected to happen after 2020 compared to only
about 1/2 of the adjustment after 2020 for the advanced G-20 countries.
Despite the reforms, replacement rates will continue to be among the highest in the
region for the next couple of decades. These sustained levels of replacement rates—
combined with the lack of incentives to delay retirement—will further defer the desired
macroeconomic effects of the pension reform and will also limit the role of the private sector
for retirement savings.
Although the reforms improved the long-term outlook, significant budgetary demands
will arise over the medium term. Official projections show that pension expenditures are
set to increase by nearly 1 percent of GDP between 2015 and 2040 (RGS, 2010)—the net
present value of this projected increase over 2015–2040 is about 8 percent of 2010 GDP. To
offset this projected increase, benefits would have to be cut by about 5 percent between 2015
and 2040 on top of the already legislated benefit adjustments or the retirement age could be
increased by one year (accompanied by a shift of the transformation coefficients for those in
the new system, to reflect lower benefits at each age of claiming).
The non-contributory component of pension
expenditures remains large. Despite the
contributory nature of the pension system, a
substantial share of expenditure continues to be
financed through general taxation (Gestione per
gli interventi assistenziali, GIAS). In 2008, these
expenditures, which arise from non-contributory
welfare pensions, accounted for about 15 percent
of the expenditures (2 percent of GDP). More
importantly, this level of spending has remained
virtually unchanged as a percent of GDP over the
last 20 years.

Overall, the pension reforms adopted over the years would—if implemented
faithfully—significantly reduce the costs associated with aging. The projected size of
pensions in relation to GDP has increased in recent years; the system still provides incentive
for early retirement and if, anything, the back-loading of the remaining adjustments may
strengthen incentives to exit the labor market before these adjustments take place;
intergenerational balance is still a key issue; and the strengthening of the second pillar
remains sluggish.
Importantly also, there are large uncertainties in the area of health spending. In this
area, the projected increase of the costs over time is much higher than for pensions—in the
baseline projections of the 2009 Ageing Report, health care spending in Italy is projected to
increase by 1.1 percent of GDP between 2007 and 2006 compared to a decline of 0.4 percent
for pensions. Furthermore, there is large uncertainty on these projections. Recent staff

50
estimates, using a scenario in which the changes in health spending are more in line with
historical trends, point to an increase in health spending of over 2½ percent of GDP between
2007 and 2060. The uncertainty of these projections is also notable in the authorities’
estimates which have been shifting upwards over time.

B. How Italy Can Ensure Long-term Fiscal Sustainability
The strategy to ensure long-term fiscal sustainability should be three-pronged: stronger
fiscal consolidation in the medium term combined with improved growth prospects should be
complemented with adjustments to the pension system and possibly to health expenditure.
For illustration, as a central scenario, a somewhat stronger fiscal adjustment (½ percentage
points of GDP in 2011–12 on top of the one envisaged by the authorities) and average growth
(based on an average long-run labor productivity growth of 1.2 percent) is used. In this
scenario, an adjustment in pension expenditure of a minimum 5 percent in nominal terms
would be needed to put public debt on a declining path and bring it to just about 60 percent
of GDP in the long run. Containing the growth in health spending toward the end of the
projection horizon may still be needed to tip the debt ratio down more decisively.

The high sensitivity of public debt to pension expenditures indicates that pension
reforms should go ahead as planned. The Italian pension reforms introduced notional
contribution accounts, with pension contributions revalued in line with the growth of the
economy. The system is also intended to offset changes in life expectancy by periodically
adjusting the factor that converts the notional accumulation into the initial benefit. All of
these have been steps in the right direction which help isolate pension expenditures from
adverse macroeconomic and demographic developments. Nonetheless, the reforms have
faced some headwinds from implementation delays. Given the large effects from deviations
in the projections of pension expenditures—a 5 percent permanent increase in pension would
put public debt on an unsustainable path—it is imperative that the reform continues as
planned.
Future pension reforms should focus on automatic adjustments to improve
intergenerational equity. One of the peculiar characteristic of the Italian system is that the
anchors to macro or demographic variables (such as the valorization of contributions or the
periodic revision of the transformation coefficient) affect future generations of retirees while
leaving the benefits of current retirees virtually unchanged.10 Future reforms would greatly
improve the balance of the burden of the reform by shifting at least part of the adjustment to
current pensioners. For example, bringing forward the already planned increase in the early
retirement age could yield savings of 0.3–0.7 percent of GDP per year (depending on the
assumption about the share of retirees who claim early retirement) in the medium term.11
Adjustment to pension benefits, however, should also ensure compliance with the
system. The long-term sustainability of the system depends largely on the need to ensure that
future generations of workers comply with the system. The use of notional defined
contribution provides incentives to participate in the system by directly linking contributions
to pensions. The prospect of lower replacement rates, especially for the very young, however,
could deter some workers from participating in the system. Additionally, the use of
temporary labor arrangements could also reduce the mass of contributions over time.
Efforts to develop private pension schemes should continue. Private pensions, which are
an important element of the retirement income systems of most advanced economies, are
notably unimportant in Italy. With the decrease role of public pensions in the future, it is
fundamental that private pensions continue to be developed. The expansion of these systems
should be supported by a sound regulatory framework and a careful assessment of the
capacity of the private sector to efficiently manage these schemes.

10

Once benefits are claimed, they are adjusted proportionally with inflation, with the proportion decreasing with
the size of the pension.
11
Other adjustments could include limiting price indexation of pensions to account for increases in life
expectancy or the change in the mass of contributors (as in Japan) or to freeze pensions to respond to long-term
actuarial imbalances (as in Canada).

52
IV. CONCLUSIONS
There are key challenges to Italy’s long-term fiscal prospects. The authorities’ projections
suggest a sustainable fiscal outlook, but they hinge on a number of optimistic assumptions,
including: a quick and robust rebound of growth in the medium term; high labor productivity
growth in the long run; fiscal consolidation in the tune of 1¾ percent of GDP in 2010–12
with underlying policy measures yet to be identified; and sanguine expectations about the
budgetary impact of ageing. The projections also assume the back-loading of the remaining
pension reform and face significant uncertainties about other age-related expenditure.
Pension reforms should go as planned, at a minimum, with further adjustments needed
to secure fiscal sustainability. It should be a priority to ensure that the reform does not
suffer further delays in its implementation—following the scheduled increases in the
retirement age, updating the coefficients in a timely and transparent way, and limiting the
discretionary adjustments in future revisions of the system. Furthermore, efforts should be
made to improve the balance of the adjustment efforts across generations, which is currently
tilted against future generations.
The impact of ongoing and future structural fiscal reforms should be assessed in the
context of their potential long-run implications for fiscal sustainability. This concerns
especially health spending and fiscal federalism reform, in general, as well as budget
reforms. While the outcomes of expected budgetary implications of these reforms are not
clear yet, the already ambitious fiscal strategy outlined above underscores the need to
implement such reforms in a cost-conscious manner.
In sum, to succeed, fiscal sustainability will require bold medium-term fiscal
consolidation and strong economic growth in the long run, supported by measures to
further ease the budgetary pressures from ageing.

Box 1A. Italy’s Long-Term Fiscal Outlook: Some Highlights in Numbers
 For every inactive person over 65, there were two employed persons 15–64 age in
2007; in 2060, the relation will be nine-to-ten, the highest in Europe.
 Public debt reached 115.8 percent of GDP in 2009, the second highest to Japan
among advanced G-20 countries.
 Public pensions consume 1/3 of budgetary resources or over 15 percent of GDP in
2009, the highest among advanced economies.
 In the absence of the envisaged pension reform, pension expenditure will increase to
24½ percent in 2050, much more than in other advanced G-20 countries.
 The waves of pension reform have helped improve the balance of fiscal adjustment
across generations, but the effects of the remaining reform are heavily back-loaded—
about 2/3 of the adjustments are expected to happen after 2020 (about 1/2 for the
advanced G-20 countries).
 The pension reform is not generationally fair—the net present value of pensions for a
current new born are about 75 percent of benefits of a 40-year old and 50 percent of
benefits of a 60-year old.
 With no fiscal consolidation in the medium term and lower than envisaged growth in
the long run, the public debt will reach over 400 percent of GDP in 2060.
 A 0.2 percentage point increase/decrease in average long-run labor productivity
growth translates, other things equal, into about 60 percentage points of GDP
decrease/increase in debt-to-GDP ratio in the no-fiscal adjustment scenario.
 ½ percentage points of GDP increase in the envisaged fiscal structural consolidation
in 2011–2012 will cumulate in the long run to about 35 percentage points of GDP
lower debt ratio in 2060.
 Average long-run growth of about 1.1 percent and fiscal adjustment of 2¼ percent of
GDP in the medium term would be needed to close the sustainability gap but at the
debt level close to that of 2010.
 Still, at least a 5 percent nominal cut in overall pension costs (or 0.8 percent of GDP)
on average will be needed to bring debt close to 60 percent of GDP by 2060.

ANALYTICAL ANNEX II: AFTER THE CRISIS: ASSESSING THE DAMAGE1
Italy’s deep-rooted structural problems resulted in an unsatisfactory productivity
performance and a dismal growth over the last 15 years. The global financial crisis has
exacerbated these long-standing weaknesses, taking a heavy toll on Italy’s economy. With
output back to its end-2001 level, Italy’s output losses associated with the crisis have been,
thus far, about 132 billion of 2000 euro (around 10 percent of precrisis 1998‒2004 real
GDP). About three quarters of these losses are estimated to be due to a shortfall in potential
output. Potential output is not expected to rebound to its precrisis trend over the medium
term, even though growth is projected to do so within the next two years. In the short-run, the
decline in output is mainly accounted for by a collapse in productivity; in the medium term,
employment and capital are also likely to be affected, with implications for the longer-term
growth and fiscal outlook.
I. INTRODUCTION
The financial crisis will likely have a long-lasting impact on Italy’s economic potential.
Indeed, innovation and investment opportunities may weaken because demand prospects are
likely to be poor and the real cost of borrowing remains high. In addition, some of the
increase in unemployment may be structural given that displaced workers will find it hard to
return to the labor market as industrial restructuring takes hold.
Against this backdrop, this annex assesses Italy’s medium-term output losses following
the crisis and their implications for the longer-term growth outlook and the fiscal
situation. It argues that Italy’s deep-rooted structural problems—giving rise to unsatisfactory
productivity growth—had weakened the Italian economy long before the financial crisis.
Using a variety of techniques, results suggest that output is not expected to rebound to its
precrisis trend over the medium term. Unless policy actions are taken, structural weaknesses
will continue to weigh on the Italian economy even when the recovery takes place.
II. PRODUCTIVITY: ITALY’S ACHILLES’ HEEL
Italy has suffered from chronically low economic growth, even before the global
financial crisis. Real GDP growth averaged 1.6 percent during the period 1995‒2007, down
from over 2 percent in the earlier decade (Figure 1).

Before the crisis, the Italian economy
underperformed most of its euro area peers. Over
the last decade, Italy’s GDP moved gradually away
from the EU15 benchmark, with average annual growth
almost one percentage point lower than the average
Correspondingly, Italy’s per capita income (measured

Italy’s dismal growth performance is largely due to poor productivity. Breaking down
GDP growth into labor, capital, and total factor productivity (TFP) contributions shows that
the Italian economy’s anemic growth is mostly explained by the declining TFP. In fact, TFP
contributions decreased substantially over the period 1995‒2005—a slowdown which was
pervasive across all sectors but especially pronounced in manufacturing and non-tradable
sectors. Besides, the reallocation of employment from sectors with higher productivity
(typically manufacturing) to sectors with lower productivity (typically services) would not be
large enough to justify a sizeable impact on the whole economy.2

By contrast, the contribution of labor growth has been positive over recent years. While
contribution of capital remained broadly stable, contribution of hours worked increased
significantly—also relatively to the EU15—thanks to extensive labor market reforms. Within
the labor factor, labor participation accounted for almost half of the annual GDP growth in
2001‒2007. The contribution of employment was also substantial, while that of average

hours worked was marginally negative. In addition, there was a strong contribution from
immigration.
The contrasting movements of labor and total factor productivity may be partly an
(unwanted) effect of sweeping labor market reforms. A significant trade-off between
employment and productivity can be observed since 1997. As firms responded to labor
market reforms by shifting to less capital-intensive production methods, a somewhat reduced
rate of capital deepening had to be expected. Moreover, regularization of the illegal
immigrant work force may have contributed to bringing to light irregular employment, which
had not previously been included in estimates, thereby depressing measured productivity
growth.
Some of the policy reforms implemented in Italy may have boosted employment per
capita but depressed productivity in the short run. Indeed, if labor demand does not shift
when labor market reforms occur, then labor supply shifts to the right along a given labor
demand curve, causing productivity to slow down as a result.3 This could have been the case
in Italy, following the changes in labor market legislation in favor of more flexibility.
Nevertheless, it is striking that the drop in the TFP growth since the mid-1990s has largely
offset the increase in labor supply following the reforms.
Protracted sluggishness in productivity growth may also conceal economic features,
including:

Relatively high tax ratios, deemed to have undercut Italy’s growth performance by
discouraging labor supply and investment;


A heavy regulatory burden in labor and product markets and bureaucratic red tape,
likely to have hampered competition and stifled incentives to invest;



A large share of small and medium-size enterprises, which might have hobbled
productivity growth by limiting the scope for economies of scale and technology
transfers.

Indeed, the presence of such rigidities—along with an industrial specialization in products
with relatively low value added—may also have contributed to Italy’s steady erosion of
competitiveness, as highlighted by the significant decline in Italy’s world market share in
world trade since the mid-1990s (even compared to its peers).
III. THE CRISIS: A NEW TOLL ON PRODUCTIVITY
The global financial crisis took a toll on Italy’s economy. The downturn in Italy started
earlier and has been deeper and longer-lasting than in most of its euro area peers. Output
contracted by 1.3 percent in 2008 and 5.0 percent in 2009. The recession in Italy’s main

trading partners led to a sharp fall in exports. Investment dropped more sharply than in earlier
recessions reflecting weak demand prospects, while inventories were cut. Despite strong
household balance sheets, private consumption also declined significantly, possibly reflecting
uncertainty, rising unemployment, and tighter consumer credit, and was only marginally
offset by the modest rise in government consumption.

crisis, output did not recover to its
precrisis trend (1983‒89), resulting in permanent loss in potential output growth in the long
run.5 The most distinguishing feature of this recession was the sharp deterioration of exports
(Italy’s traditional engine of growth. The globally synchronized nature of this recession led to
the largest historical contraction of Italian exports since the 1930s. As a result, investment
dropped sharper than experienced in earlier recessions. On the other hand, the profile of
decline in private consumption was similar, though more persistent.

Data is not available to examine the recovery to pre-crisis trend for other historical recessions.

Since the onset of the crisis, productivity has plummeted even further, exacerbating
Italy’s long-standing structural weaknesses (Table 1). As a result, unit labor costs have
soared and profitability has been further squeezed, worsening Italy’s already weak
competitive position. On the other hand, capital deepening has—thus far—been showing
strong resilience, while unemployment has been rising only modestly, largely due to
part-time work schemes and declining hours worked. Regrettably, the drop in TFP growth
over 2008‒09 has been so large it has offset most of the resilience in capital and—to a lesser
extent—employment.

IV. ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO DISENTANGLE TEMPORARY FROM PERMANENT LOSSES
It is very difficult to assess how much of the observed decline in output is associated
with a persistent (but temporary) demand shock versus supply factors. A sudden
collapse in activity could be the result of a severe and long-lasting demand shock or the
outcome of a structural change in the economy, such as an increase in natural rate of
unemployment or a sectoral reallocation of production factors. While the latter would
translate into a permanent loss in potential output, the former would translate into a
temporary increase in the size of the output gap.
The crisis has induced an unprecedented fall in output, which is likely to have broken
down previous economic relationships. While in normal times business cycle fluctuations
account for most of the output volatility; in times of crisis, structural changes may occur,
contributing substantially (and more than usual) to output movements.
Survey measures of capacity utilization and expected capacity constraints indicate that
the adverse demand shocks started in late 2008. There is evidence that financial conditions
had tightened before the collapse in capacity utilization at the onset of the crisis. However,
during 2009, demand collapsed and this limited production (Figure 3).

Several approaches have been used in this annex to assess the impact of the crisis on
potential output performance. None of them is deemed to be perfect or superior, but each
offers some insight into this difficult issue:

65
1.
Statistical approaches. They offer the advantage of using information from the past,
while being internally consistent, but the results may not be robust in periods of large
structural changes. Among these we consider:6
a)
b)

the univariate Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter,
and two multivariate unobserved component models:
i. a multivariate filter (MV), and
ii. a production function approach (PFA).

2.
Historical approach. Evidence from previous international crises is also considered.
Unlike some statistical methodologies, this approach does not impose any priori restrictions
on the analysis and can therefore offer an alternative more judgmental perspective.
Univariate two-sided filter
Despite its simplicity, the HP filter has a number of shortcomings. The HP filter only
uses the data for the series itself, hence ignoring other relevant economic information. It
extracts the trend component, balancing a good fit of actual series with the smoothness of the
trend. In addition, the results are not model-based and are prone to “end-point bias,” which
becomes a significant problem considering the substantial revisions of recent estimates
(Appendix I). Generally, the approach is useful for historical analysis but not well-suited for
forward looking analysis.
Estimates of potential output and potential labor productivity based on a two-sided
moving average smoothing procedure (the HP filter) point to a pre-existing weakness in
labor productivity trend growth (Figure 4). However, because of the “end-point” problem
intrinsic to the two-sided moving average smoothing procedure, trend measures based on
HP-filtering procedure generally prove unreliable, especially if a prolonged recession or a
structural break occurs at the end of the sample, as it was indeed the case with the outbreak
of the crisis.

6

While the HP filter imposes restrictions on the shape of the cyclical and trend component of real output, which
may not hold after the crisis, the two multivariate unobserved component models have the merit of extracting
long-term trends by exploiting additional information about short-run relationships, like the unemploymentinflation trade-off (in the case of the MV filter), or the productivity-capacity utilization relation (in the case of
the PFA). The analytical underpinnings of a multivariate filter and a production function approach with
unobserved stochastic components are reported in Appendix II and Appendix III, respectively.

A multivariate (MV) filter
14.25

A key advantage of the Multivariate
(MV) filter is that it incorporates both
recent data and long-term trends
(Appendix II). The approach uses a small
macroeconomic model to estimate the
empirical relationships between actual and
potential GDP, unemployment, core
inflation, and capacity utilization in
manufacturing. Note that this approach
assumes that the relationships between the
major economic variables were stable

despite the large shocks associated with the crisis. In this sense, the approach provides the
counterfactual of what would be the dynamics if this were a “normal” recession (i.e. a
recession for which only the size of the shock was large but without any structural break).
The MV filter estimates positive output gaps for 2005‒08. The results of this filter
contrast with the IMF’s historical estimates, suggesting that the potential output levels were
overestimated. Similarly, the model estimates negative output gap for 2009-2011, which are
smaller than current projections. While staff forecasts the output gap to close in 2015, the
model projects its closure by 2012. The projected real GDP level suggests an output loss of
about 14 percent relative to precrisis trend (1998‒2004) by 2015.
The output gap is estimated to have declined sharply in 2009, with gradual
improvements thereafter. Italy’s output gap is estimated to have troughed at about minus
2 percent in 1993 during the European Monetary System (EMS) crisis. Output subsequently
expanded; and in the years 2000‒07 the estimated output gap is mostly positive. With the
2008‒09 recession, the estimated gap shows a sharper drop, to a trough of about minus 2.5
percent. The model forecasts a negative output gap of minus 1.3 percent for 2010, which
gradually declines to minus 0.4 percent in 2011 before closing in 2012. The economy is
expected to converge to its steady state growth by 2012. The 2-standard-deviation confidence
band is about +/- 1 percent of the estimated potential growth for Italy. The behavior of
inflation is consistent with the model’s output gap dynamics. Italy’s core inflation declined
during periods with negative output gap, and rose during the years with positive gap.
The NAIRU is expected to rise moderately. The estimated NAIRU peaked in 1998, and
then gradually declined before climbing up toward the end of 2009. The decline during 2008
and beginning of 2009 is likely due to the discouraged worker effect and the falling
participation rates. The model,

68
The recoveries in output and utilization gaps are expected to move in tandem, while the
unemployment gap lags behind. The above figure portrays the dynamics of the estimated
gaps for output, unemployment rate, and capacity utilization. The unemployment gap is
influenced by the current and lagged output gap but has smaller cyclical fluctuations. The
smooth profile of the unemployment gap is associated with labor hoarding and the
“discouraged worker” effect during recessions. The utilization gap exhibits more volatility
with sharp declines during recessions. In particular, the utilization gap declined to in 1993
and to over 8 percent in 2009. Following the 2009 trough, the capacity utilization and the
output gaps rebound, closing by 2012. In contrast, the recovery of the unemployment gap
lags behind, closing by 2014.
There is a high degree of uncertainty around the forecast. While the multivariate filter
projects the output gap to close by 2012, there is a high degree of uncertainty around this
forecast with confidence bands widening to about 4 percentage points (-2 to +2 percent).
Figure 5 illustrates the estimated year-on-year potential output growth, and the historical and
projected real GDP growth. While the estimated growth of potential is correlated with actual
growth, the path of potential growth is rather smooth. As expected, fluctuations in output are
found to be mainly driven by demand shocks in the short-term and by movements in
potential output in the long-term.

A Production Function Approach
A production function approach (PFA) with unobserved stochastic components offers
another perspective on potential output (Appendix III). The rationale for this approach is
to estimate potential output from the trend levels of its structural determinants, such as
productivity and factor inputs.7

7

Using a production function, such trend levels are extracted by taking into account the relationships between
the cyclical components of output and unemployment, the link between cyclical productivity and cyclical hours
worked, as well as the impact of the business cycle on labor supply dynamics. Estimates are carried out using
real-time data and a Bayesian framework. In order to use sufficiently long quarterly frequency time series, a
PFA must usually rely on low-quality data on capital stocks and hours worked, raising issues on whether the
TFP component will be spuriously contaminated by measurement problems.

70
Estimates from PFA show that the major source of potential growth variation is
associated with changes in labor participation. The bulk of the permanent variation in
output is found to be driven by shifts in labor trends, namely labor participation and
employment. Conversely, cyclical variations in real GDP are mainly driven by (total factor)
productivity fluctuations..
While TFP is found to be highly pro-cyclical, the dynamics of its structural component
markedly diverge from those of potential output. Since the mid-1990s, TFP growth has
declined from one percent to zero. On the contrary, potential growth has risen from an annual
rate of 0.7 percent at the end of 1992‒93 recession to over 2 percent just before the current
slowdown—a growth rate analogous to that of the early 1990s. Finally, there seems to be a
constant wedge between the trend growth in labor and factor productivity, confirming the
idea that the rate of capital deepening has remained stable over time, at around 1 percent.
TFP and hours worked are strongly pro-cyclical. Both have dramatically plunged below
trend since 2002 and have become more pro-cyclical since 1999. The unemployment rate is
found to be significantly countercyclical and—consistently with previous model estimates—
to fall by about 0.04 percent as output rises 1 percent above potential. Interestingly, labor
participation is found to be broadly acyclical, whereas there is evidence of positive
comovements between average hours worked per employee, output, and productivity, once
structural shifts in factor trends have been identified. Implied output gap estimates tend to
exhibit higher volatility than corresponding estimates from the MV approach.8
The projected real GDP level suggests an output loss of about 11 percent relative to
precrisis trend (1998‒2004) by 2015. Potential output levels derived from the PFA are
found to be lower than currently implied by the staff’s projections, with the output gap
estimated to have troughed in 2009 at 2.6 percent. Potential output growth is likely to have
dropped by 2.7 percent in 2009, but is expected to increase to 0.4 percent in 2010 before
reaching its steady-state rate of 0.8 percent. The NAIRU is estimated to rise gradually, from
7.2 in 2009 to 7.9 percent by 2014, when the unemployment gap is also expected to be
reabsorbed (Table 2).

8

Because of the high volatility of the Solow residual, conditioning real-time output decomposition upon
indicators of demand pressures in product and labor market provides smoother estimates of potential growth
than unobserved component models relying on a production function approach.

Evidence from previous international episodes
Output performance in the aftermath of past financial crises can offer useful insights
into the medium-term recovery prospects. IMF (2009) studied the medium-term output
dynamics after financial crises over the past four decades across a wide range of countries.
This examined the impact of initial conditions on post-crisis medium-term output losses. The
initial conditions considered include those for output, investment, macroeconomic
imbalances, level of income and financial development, openness, external conditions, and
whether the financial crisis is accompanied by a currency crisis. Estimated OLS coefficients
in IMF (2009) are here applied to calculate the impact of the global financial crisis on Italy’s
medium term output level (Table 3).
Based on this approach, the medium-term output is estimated to decline by about 15
percent relative to the precrisis trend but some caveats should be noted. The mediumterm output is estimated to decline by about 15 percent relative to the precrisis trend, well
above the 10 percent average found for historical international financial crisis episodes in
IMF (2009). The result was driven by a high precrisis investment share of GDP, which was
found to be highly correlated with negative capital dynamics following historical
international financial crises. Indeed, evidence shows that countries with high precrisis
investment to GDP ratios during the three years preceding the crisis experienced large output
losses. Another key contributing factor is Italy’s large initial output loss during the
crisis—the variable most associated with medium-term output performance—confirming the
view that the permanent toll of the crisis on economic activity has been exacerbated by
Italy’s deep-rooted structural weaknesses. This finding suggests that postcrisis
macroeconomic policies could play a role in shaping medium-term dynamics—an issue
worth examining here.

(about 10 percent of precrisis 1998‒2004 real GDP).
Three quarters of these losses are estimated to be related to shortfalls in potential output. The
path of output level is not expected to rebound to its precrisis trend over the medium term,
even though growth is projected to do so within the next two years. In the short-run, the
decline in output growth is mainly accounted for by a collapse in productivity growth. Over
the medium term, productivity is likely to recover and contribute to potential output growth
by approximately 0.5 percent, while employment is deemed to suffer more enduring losses.
Similarly, capital accumulation is expected to remain weak over 2010 and, in the medium
term, to contribute to growth slightly less than used to. The estimated output loss by 2015
relative to precrisis trend (1998‒2004) ranges between 11 to 15 percent using different
methodologies.

Stronger fiscal adjustment will be required. The profile of potential output and the output
gap projected by the MV filter and the PFA implies that the fiscal structural deficits are
underestimated. Looking forward, there will be a need for a stronger adjustment effort than
the current projections entail, and for reforms to stimulate faster growth. With the forecasted
real GDP growth, the consolidation envisaged in the authorities’ latest Stability Program
would still not be sufficient to ensure a sustained reduction in public debt. With lower real
GDP growth over the medium-term, than currently projected, a stronger, expenditure-based,
adjustment effort would be needed to put debt on a declining path. A more front-loaded fiscal
adjustment would also help balance, to some extent, the highly unequal intergenerational
distribution of the long-term fiscal adjustment arising particularly from the current design of
the pension reform.

V. POLICY: LIMITING THE DAMAGE
Downside risks for a permanent loss in potential output growth in the long run remain,
especially if the global recovery stalls and financial conditions worsen, adversely
impacting investments and total factor productivity growth. As highlighted by evidence
from previous crisis episodes, downside risks to the output growth recovery reflect a sharper
than expected fall in TFP and capital accumulation during the recession as well as a declining
labor participation rate, mainly due to lack of incentives for industrial restructuring.
Policy can also limit the damage. Macroeconomic policies can shape medium-term
dynamics by reducing the permanent costs associated to the crisis. In Italy, for example, the
wage supplementation fund (Cassa Integrazione Guadagni) does involve on-the-job training
which could cushion the impact of the crisis on structural unemployment.
But which policy priorities? Applying the Lisbon Assessment Framework (LAF) may help
identify policy priorities and areas that could help strengthen medium-term TFP growth,
(Table 4). TFP growth is shown to be affected by a number of policies, notably in the areas
of R&D and innovation, education, product and capital market regulation, as well as a
number of labor market policies aiming at increasing working time and making work pay.

77
The overall LAF picture shows an improvement in reforms in the corresponding area over
2001‒2007 with respect to the EU 15.9
The European Economic Recovery Programme (EERP) also called for priority to be
given to structural policies. The EERP has called for these measures to be consistent with
long-term policy objectives such as those found in the Lisbon Strategy, the smooth
functioning of the Single Market, and facilitating a move towards a low-carbon economy.
The assessment published by the European Commission services (European Commission
2009), shows that Member States are largely undertaking policy responses in line with these
principles.
Despite the above-mentioned progresses, however, the impact on Italy’s productivity
and economic growth has been limited. This may suggest divergent conclusions: either the
effects of the implemented reforms are yet to be felt in Italy, or a lot more is needed for
reforms to produce visible results or—and this is also a possibility—reforms are not as
growth-inducing as the literature seems to suggest.
If growth cannot be resumed through structural reforms, sizeable fiscal adjustment will
be required. With lower real GDP growth over the medium-term than currently projected, a
stronger, expenditure-based, adjustment effort would be needed to put debt on a declining
path. This calls for a more ambitious fiscal consolidation starting now.

Appendix I. Features and Pitfalls of the HP Filter
The Hodrick-Prescott filter (HP, henceforth) is derived by minimizing the sum of squared
deviations of the log variable (e.g. y, in the case of GDP) from the estimated trend τ, subject
to a smoothness constraint that penalizes squared variations in the growth of the estimated
trend series. Thus, HP trend values are those that minimize:
T

  t       t 1   t    t   t 1  
2

2

t 1

The estimated trend variable τ is a function of λ and both past and future values of y. Higher
values of λ imply a large weight on smoothness in the estimated trend series (for very large
values the estimated trend series will converge to a linear time trend; as λ tends to zero, the
trend is coincident with the series). Apart from the arbitrary choice of the λ parameter (set to
the standard value 100*s2, where s denotes the frequency of the series), the decomposition of
cycle and trend estimated by an HP filter turns out to be inaccurate under two circumstances:




At the end of the sample—when the HP filter suffers from an in-sample phase shift
problem—as it needs to rely on future information about the series. The end-period
problem can be tackled by extending actual data out of the sample using the
information carried by the average historical growth rate or autoregressive forecast
models. However, if past growth rates are not reasonable proxies for future growth
patterns, this extension may lead to a bias at the end of the filtered series.
When cyclical fluctuations are highly persistent or when underlying trends are
subject to temporary stochastic shocks with greater variance than that of the business
cycle. Implicit in the choice of λ is, in fact, a strict assumption about the relative
importance of supply and demand shocks: e.g., trend fluctuations account for
2½ percent of cyclical fluctuations in quarterly data (or 1 percent in annual data).
Although, on average, such an estimate fits output data for industrial countries
reasonably well, over relatively short periods this may not be the case.

For both reasons, analyzing macroeconomic fluctuations regarding the on-going prolonged
slowdown using HP trends could prove to be misleading.

The model includes output, unemployment, and capacity utilization gaps. Equation (1)
defines the output gap y t as the log difference between actual GDP (Yt) and potential GDP
(Y ). The output gap is approximately measured as percent of potential output. The concept of
potential output used is the maximum amount of output that can be produced without
generating upward or downward pressures for inflation. Equation (2) defines the
unemployment gap u t as the difference between the equilibrium unemployment rate, or
NAIRU, (U ) and the actual unemployment rate (Ut). A positive unemployment gap indicates
excess demand for labor. In equation (3), the capacity utilization gap (ct) is the difference
between the actual manufacturing capacity utilization index (Ct) and its equilibrium level
(C ).
The model focuses on core inflation to best capture the relationship between excess
demand and inflation, avoiding the components of the CPI that change for exogenous
reasons. Equation (4) describes the inflation dynamics. The current core inflation is affected
by the level ( ) and the change
in the output gap. The output gap displays the
influence of excess demand on inflation. If the economy is producing above its potential, i.e.,
has a positive output gap, inflation will rise. The change in output gap embodies rigidities in

Similarly, equation (6) implies a relationship between capacity utilization gap, its lag, and
output gap. The evolution of equilibrium unemployment rate, NAIRU, is determined in
equation (7). The equilibrium unemployment U is influenced by its lag, transitory shocks
(
, persistent shocks (GU , the output gap, and difference between current equilibrium
unemployment and its steady state level in the long-run U . The specification would take
into consideration the persistence in unemployment. The persistent shocks follow an
autoregressive process illustrated in equation (8).
The potential output depends on changes in NAIRU and the underlying potential
growth trend. In equation (9), the coefficient for first difference of the NAIRU is set to
equal the labor share in a Cobb-Douglas production function (θ . The coefficient of the
long-run difference (19 quarters) of NAIRU is constrained to (1- ) so that in the log-run the
impact of a permanent changes in NAIRU are fully reflected in the potential output level.
The underlying potential growth trend (
follows serially correlated deviations from the
steady-state growth rate. The equilibrium capacity utilization C also follows a stochastic
process with transitory (εC and persistent (GC shocks. Equation (13) formulates the
perceived long-term inflation objective, taking into consideration revisions to previous period
expectations captured by (
). The historical data for the long-term inflation expectations
is obtained from Consensus Economics. In equation (14), the output gap is influenced by
monetary policy, while other factors encompassed by the stochastic term
.
The model is estimated using Bayesian technique. The sample period is 1992Q4 to
2009Q3. We assume a steady-state value of 0.61 for the labor share, 0.7 percent for output
growth, and 8.3 percent for the unemployment rate. Table 1 displays prior distributions and
estimated posterior distributions. The results are relatively robust as evidenced by the limited
sensitivity of the current quarter estimates to new data revisions (Table 2).

Annex II: Appendix III. A Production Function with Unobserved Stochastic
Components11
Output decomposition is further carried out within a production function framework.
The rationale is to derive potential output estimates from the trend levels of its structural
determinants, such as productivity and factor inputs. In considering a specification of the
technology which allows for variable capital utilization, we assume a quite flexible
production function:
Yt  At (Ct Lt )  (Ct K t )1 

(15)

Here, technology has the usual Cobb-Douglas representation with constant returns to
scale and perfect market competition.12 Hence,  is the labor share—measured by the cost
of labor services as a share of total costs—A represents total factor productivity, L denotes
total hours worked in the economy, K is the capital stock, and C is the unobserved degree of
capacity utilization—ranging over the interval (0,1]—both labor and capital are adjusted
for.13 Taking logs of both sides of equation (15)—here denoted by small caps—yields:

yt   a  c    lt  (1   )kt

(16)

All factor inputs in equation (16) can be additively decomposed into their (unobserved)
permanent (denoted by superscript star) and cyclical (denoted by superscript c)
components, with the exception of the capital stock, which is assumed to be fully permanent
and, hence, to contribute only to potential. While the permanent component of the Solow
residual ( a* ) is solely driven by technology, the transitory component of the Solow residual
( a c ) is likely to absorb all nontechnological effects to productivity as well as fluctuations in
the intensity of capital use. As such, the stationary component of the Solow residual is likely
to display more business cycle variability than strictly defined TFP. Algebrically:

11

This appendix draws on Sgherri (2004).
In the model we have in mind, all the non-technological effects (e.g., non-constant returns to scale, imperfect
competitions, and input reallocations) considered by Basu, Fernald, and Kimball (2004) and briefly discussed in
Section II, do not operate in the long run, so that over long horizons, productivity is solely driven by
technology. In particular, whenever a shock increases demand, the increase in production would mandate higher
output per firm and would lead to increases in profits. This would spur entry and drive per firm output and
profits down to zero. By the same token, in order for increasing returns to contribute to long-run productivity
growth, firms should expand their scale of operation, thereby reducing unit costs forever. This is impossible, as
scale economies would be reduced as new firms enter the market and per-firm output falls. Non-technological
effects would, however, operate over the short run and would therefore be part of the cyclical component of the
Solow residual.
13
Basu and Kimball (1997) show that if the sole cost of changing the workweek of capital is that workers need
to be compensated for working at night, then one can use a single proxy for changes in both effort and capital
utilization.
12

The log of total hours (l), in turn, can be additively decomposed into its determinants, e.g.,
working-age population (wpop), participation ratio (pr), the unemployment rate (u), and the
average number of hours per employee (h).14 These determinants can be also disentangled
into their own permanent and cyclical components, so that the permanent and cyclical labor
contributions can be written as:

l *  wpop  pr *  u*  h* ,
l c  pr c  u c  hc .

(18)

The intuition is that population dynamics are fully permanent, whereas labor force
participation, employment, and average working hours contain also cyclical information.
Combining identities (16)-(17)-(18) yields a multivariate UC model for output
decomposition. Specifically, the model consists of a measurement equation for real output:

yt   wpopt  (1   )kt  1 

(20)

where the reference cycle—an autoregressive process of second order  ( L ) that is here
constrained to be common across factor inputs—is assumed to be driven by fluctuations in
the industrial production index, ip. The four transitory components in vector ψ t —e.g., the
Solow residual, ac, the participation ratio, prc, the unemployment rate, uc, and the average
hours, hc—can in turn be expressed as linear combinations of current and lagged values of
the reference cycle, given the matrix of loading parameters, τ. Corresponding factor inputs

trends—denoted by vector μt —are assumed to follow random walk processes with
stochastic drifts—denoted by vector κ t . The growth rate of each factor trend can thus take a
different shape, depending on the value of the corresponding element in the matrix P. For
instance, if the first element in P is estimated to be insignificantly different from 1, then TFP
would be an integrated series of second order. Else, if 0<P1,1<1, the time-varying TFP growth
rate would converge back to a steady-state rate, 1* . ε tψ , v μt , and ωtκ denote the vectors of
shocks to the cyclical components, the factor trends, and the trend growth rates, respectively.
The shocks are assumed to follow independent identically distributed processes, with error
covariance matrices Σε , Σ v , and Σω , respectively. The dynamics of permanent and transitory
components depend on the nature of the shocks, that is, on the relative importance of supply
and demand shocks.15 This relative importance, which determines the smoothness of the trend
component, is the ratio of the variance of the cycle to the variance of the trend fluctuations. A
small ratio implies that shocks are mainly supply shocks, where trend inputs moves nearly
with observed data, and hence a small business cycle component is to be expected. On the
contrary, a larger weight on the smoothness of the trend means that shocks to the economy
are primarily shocks to aggregate demand.
Once the model (19)-(20) is cast in the state space form, the Kalman filter and the
associated smoothing algorithm enable maximum likelihood estimation of the model
parameters and signal extraction of the unobserved components, conditional upon a set
of initial parameters and the appropriate information set. More specifically, the basic filter
provides an estimate of the unobserved state vector conditional upon the information
available up to time t. The smoothing provides a more accurate estimate on the vector, by
using all the available information in the sample through time T. Under the assumptions of
model linearity and Gaussian disturbances, the conditional distribution of the observed
variables—e.g., real GDP and unemployment—is also Gaussian. As such, the sample
log-likelihood function can be maximized with respect to the unknown parameters of the
model and the set of parameters can be estimated using a maximum-likelihood estimator.
Iterating the basic filter starting from t=1 to T, while evaluating the log likelihood function
from observation +1 (where  is large enough) to T, minimizes the effects of some
arbitrarily chosen initial values on the log-likelihood value. On the other hand, the last
iteration of the basic filter provides the initial values for the smoothing.16

By construction, demand and supply shocks are assumed to be orthogonal.

ANALYTICAL ANNEX III: THE RECENT SLOWDOWN IN BANK CREDIT GROWTH: WHAT
ARE THE FACTS?1
In Italy bank credit growth has declined sharply in the past two years. This slowdown
coincided with the global crisis and the associated bank financing difficulties, a substantial
fall in private consumption and investment, and a significant deterioration in firms’
creditworthiness. This paper assesses whether the recent slowdown in bank lending was
driven by a drop in demand for credit, or by supply tightening due to lack of loanable funds
or to discrimination against riskier borrowers.2 First a comparison is made between the
current episode of lending slowdown and credit developments during the 1992‒93 recession,
as well as previous episodes of lending tightening. The results from recent bank and
enterprises surveys on credit demand and supply conditions are also discussed. Then a bank
loan supply and demand functions are estimated to detect any evidence of excess demand in
the credit market. Survey results and the econometric analysis suggest that in late 2008-early
2009 banks progressively tightened lending standards. Excess demand in the credit market
was particularly acute for a brief period, in early 2009, but there is little evidence of a
prolonged supply-driven “credit crunch” thereafter. Overall, the analysis suggests that
policy actions to sustain credit growth in Italy should rely on measures in support of
borrowers rather than lenders.
I.

INTRODUCTION

Since early 2008 bank lending tightened significantly in Italy, especially for the
corporate sector. Credit growth to the private sector slowed down sharply, starting in 2008,
from around 10 percent on an annual basis, to 0.1 percent in October 2009, and picked up
slightly again since November 2009. The slowdown in credit has been longer and harsher for
firms than for households. Annual loan growth to non financial corporations has been
negative since September 2009, while credit growth to households always remained positive
and bottomed out at the beginning of 2009.3 Within household credit, mortgage lending
growth initially fell more than consumer lending. Other large euro area countries have
experienced a similar sharp contraction in credit growth to firms, while in those economies
the slowdown in household lending has been more protracted than in Italy.

Data on households loans adjusted for the effects of securitization, however, indicate that credit growth
remained stagnant during 2009 and started to pick up again only at the end of last year.

The fall in bank credit growth has been more pronounced for large and medium sized
enterprises than for small firms. Loan growth to large and medium sized enterprises fell by
17 percentage points, from a record high of plus 14 percent average annual rate in 2007, to
minus 3.0 percent in October 2009. Credit growth to small firms fell by 8.3 percentage
points, from plus 6.5 percent average annual rate in 2007 to minus 1.8 percent in July 2009.
Despite the severe output contraction over the 2008‒09 period, so far the slowdown in
credit to the private sector has been somewhat milder than in the 1992‒93 recession. 4
Six quarters after the start of the recession, nominal annual lending growth to the private
sector has fallen by 8.0 percentage points, while in the corresponding period in the early
1990s, nominal annual credit growth had dropped by 14.5 percentage points. Also in real
4

A comparison with the 1974–75 recession is rather difficult, due to the impact of high inflation rates on
nominal and real credit growth at that time. Comparisons with more recent recession episodes could be
misleading, as in those cases the output contraction was much milder than in the current recession.

terms so far the slowdown in lending growth has been smaller than in the 1992‒93 recession.
While the size of the current credit growth slowdown is historically large it is not
unprecedented (Table 1).

II. WHY HAS BANK LENDING SLOWED DOWN?
Slow credit growth could be driven by weak lending supply, weak credit demand, or
both. The fact that the fall in credit growth has been more pronounced for firms than for
households is an indication that low demand and discrimination across borrowers with a
different risk profile might have played an important role in the lending slowdown. Indeed, if
banks had been unable to extend credit due to a limited availability of loanable funds, they
would have cut lending to all types of borrowers. This section tries to better understand the
factors behind the current loan growth slowdown. Given that credit tightening is more severe
for firms than for households, the focus is on the former, which accounts for about 50 percent
of total private sector credit.
Surveys of banks and enterprises suggest that tightening of lending standards and
lower loan demand have both contributed to the recent slowdown in credit growth, with
the slowdown in demand preceding the peak in credit standards tightening. The Bank of
Italy’s bank lending survey indicates that bank credit standards became increasingly tighter
in the second part of 2008 until early 2009, both for large firms and small and medium sized
enterprises (SMEs).5 The main factors bearing on credit standards appear to have been
expectations regarding economic activity, and specific firm and industry outlooks, while
capital costs and banks’ access to market financing seem to have mattered less (Figure 1).
The ISAE survey of manufacturing enterprises and the Bank of Italy-Sole 24 Ore survey of
firms in the industry and service sectors also suggest that access to bank credit (for all firms,
large or small) became more and more difficult from early 2008 to early 2009, and then
improved until September 2009 (with some deterioration afterwards). On the other hand,
according to the firm survey conducted by the ECB-EU Commission, the share of firms (of
any size) able to obtain all the financing requested decreased in second half of 2009.
However, while the supply of bank credit may have deteriorated, the demand for bank loans

seems also to have declined. The Bank of Italy’s bank lending surveys suggest that credit
demand from all firms progressively slowed down in 2007‒2008 and has been falling since
early 2009, albeit at a slower rate in Q4. 6 The drop in loan demand seems to have been
driven mainly by the fall in financing needs for business investment, whereas the financing
needs for debt restructuring have gone up sharply (Figure 2).

1/ Survey figures are reported as net percentage balances. The range of variation is between -1 and 1. A positive net percentage
balance indicates that a larger proportion of banks have tightened credit standards. A negative number would refer to a net easing of
credit standards. A positive figure related to the credit demand questions would indicate an increase in loan demand and viceversa.

In order to detect evidence of excess demand in the credit market, bank loan supply and
demand functions are estimated.7 Credit demand is modeled as a function of business and
consumer confidence indicators (as proxies for expected economic activity), lending rates,
and corporate bond yields (or the difference between the latter two), and corporate
6

Another Bank of Italy survey on a sample of 400 banks finds that the demand for credit increased in the
second part of 2009, after falling in the first six months. Consistently with these findings, according to the
ECB-EU Commission firm survey, 35.5 percent of the sampled firms applied for bank loans in the first part of
2009, while a slightly higher share (38 percent) applied in the second part of 2009.

bankruptcies. Credit supply is assumed to be driven by lending rates, the capital to asset ratio
(or the difference between the actual and desired capital to asset ratio) 8, liquidity ratio,
growth in demand deposits, the nonperforming loan ratio, and corporate bankruptcies—as a
measure of credit risk. Including variables such as bank liquidity, deposit, and capitalization
allows to test whether shortage of loanable funds and capital had an impact on credit supply.
According to the estimate results, loan demand is driven mainly by confidence indicators,
and bankruptcies growth. Loan supply mainly responds to changes in lending rates and
bankruptcies growth. The availability of capital and loanable funds do not appear to have
been a significant factor. This suggests that supply constraints might have played a limited
role in causing the lending slowdown. Interacting measures of loanable funds and capital
availability with a dummy for the pre crisis and crisis period does not change the results,
indicating that no major change in the loan supply function took place during the crisis
(Table 2). This might be due to the fact that, unlike other European banks, Italian banks did
not suffer from major losses.

The desired capital-asset ratio is assumed to be 8 percent.

lending rate. Lagged values of confidence indicators and the industrial production index growth are used as

The econometric results suggest that excess demand in the credit market was
particularly acute for a brief period, in early 2009, but there is little evidence of a
prolonged supply-driven “credit crunch”. The presence of a potential “credit crunch” is
assessed by evaluating whether the estimated excess demand (i.e., the difference between
estimated demand and estimated supply) is positive and large. Inspection of the estimated
excess demand suggests that loan demand was much lower than supply in late 2008, and that
lending supply constraints prevailed for a brief period in early 2009, which is consistent with
bank and firm survey results.9

Also Panetta and Signoretti (2010) find that supply restrictions have contributed to the decline in credit growth
for a limited amount, and only during the most acute phase of the crisis.

Another indication that excess demand for bank credit was significant at the beginning
of 2009 is given by data on corporate bonds issuance. Debt securities issues by nonfinancial firms peaked in early 2009 (a sign that firms were possibly substituting bank
borrowing with bond issuance), but declined afterwards, despite the fact that corporate bond
markets conditions improved in the second half of 2009.

III. POLICY ISSUES
The analysis suggests that policy actions to sustain credit growth in Italy should rely on
measures to support borrowers rather than lenders. Indeed, so far supply constraints
related to bank capitalization and liquidity conditions appear to have played only a limited
role in causing the lending slowdown. Loan supply growth has nevertheless been declining in
response to increasing credit risks—as proxied by corporate bankruptcies growth. Therefore,
actions to foster firms’ demand and creditworthiness would be the most appropriate.
The Italian authorities have implemented a number of measures to support borrowers,
especially SMEs. Different forms of loan guarantees have been introduced. The existing
guarantee fund for SMEs has been strengthened, including by increasing the maximum
guaranteed amount, and expanding the list of eligible beneficiaries. In 2009 guarantees
provided by the fund amounted to €8 billion (0.5 percent of GDP). The Cassa Depositi e
Prestiti (CDP, a state-controlled financial institution) has made available €8 billion
(0.5 percent of GDP) to banks that extend credit to SMEs, and SACE, the government-owned
institution providing guarantees for export credits has been allowed to guarantee up to 50
percent of the loans extended to SMEs with CDP’s funds. SACE has also been permitted to
prove an up to 50 percent guarantee on bank loan extended to firms using receivables from
the public administration as collateral. The government has requested banks that took
advantage of the recapitalization scheme to increase lending to SMEs. Furthermore, the
Ministry of Finance is overseeing a bank loan moratorium agreement between the banking
association and the employers’ federation, which has allowed the suspension of loan
repayments for €7 billion (0.5 percent of GDP). The government is also setting up an equity
fund for SMEs recapitalization, financed by the CDP and private banks.
Actions taken so far by the authorities to support credit to the SMEs seem in line with
those implemented in other advanced economies. Most OECD countries have tried to
alleviate the financing difficulties of SMEs by extending public guarantees on bank loans.10
In order to pressure banks to continue lending to enterprises, some countries, such as
Belgium and France, have also appointed a credit mediator, who, at regional and central
level, may intervene to ease difficulties and help solve divergences between enterprises and
banks.11 The UK has established the SMEs Lending Monitoring Panel. In the US, the
government is monitoring on a monthly basis the credit activities of banks that have been
rescued by public funding. Ireland has instituted a legally binding code of conduct for banks’
SMEs lending (OECD, 2009).

10

Government guarantee schemes for SME credit are expected to be an incentive for bank lending also because
according to Basel II the level of capital requirement for a publicly guaranteed credit line is very low or even
nil.
11
In a similar vein in Italy enterprises that find difficult access to credit have been given the possibility to
appeal to the local government representatives (the Prefetti), and ask for help in the negotiation with the bank.

97
Any form of directed lending should however be avoided, and actions to support
enterprises should be accompanied by corporate restructuring when needed. While it is
important to continue sustain credit access, especially for SMEs that have limited alternative
financing opportunities, government directed lending should be avoided as banks are better
equipped to assess loan riskiness, and to prevent potential quasi-fiscal costs. Also, recourse to
government guarantees should be temporary and appropriately priced. Policies in support of
enterprises should also include corporate restructuring, to boost borrowers’ creditworthiness,
foster a more efficient and profitable sector as well as enhance banking sector soundness. In
this context, the forthcoming private equity fund for SMEs could be a useful instrument to
strengthen their capital base.
While recent reforms have, to a certain extent, modernized Italy’s commercial
insolvency and restructuring legal framework, further improvements could help
facilitate the rescue and reorganization of viable enterprises as well as the speedy and
efficient liquidation of non viable firms. For example, consideration could be given to the
enhancement of the mechanisms to support prompt provision of new financing to enterprises
during the restructuring period, in line with international best practices. In addition, the
reorganization and debt restructuring frameworks could be improved, for instance by
clarifying the scope of the judicial review of the restructuring plans, and providing a more
detailed and predictable regime on out-of-court restructurings. The eligibility criteria for
bankruptcy trustees could be reexamined to promote the appointment of trustees with firm
management and restructuring skills. The liquidation procedures could be streamlined to
support a speedy exit of nonviable enterprises from the economy. Furthermore, a reform of
the judicial system to ensure the consistent, predictable and transparent implementation of
the legal framework could help make the insolvency regime more effective and efficient.
IV. CONCLUSION
While lending tightened significantly since 2008, especially for the corporate sector, so
far the slowdown in credit growth has been somewhat milder than in the 1992‒93
recession and is not unprecedented. Survey results and the econometric analysis suggest
that the lending slowdown was initially mainly driven by weak loan demand, and then (in
late 2008-early 2009) by the progressive tightening of lending standards applied by banks.
Excess demand in the credit market was particularly acute for a brief period, in early 2009,
but there is little evidence of a prolonged supply-driven “credit crunch”.
Although a modest recovery in bank lending is expected as growth resumes, risks
remain of additional tightening. In the coming months the availability of firms’ balance
sheet data for 2009 will likely result in worse assessments of borrowers’ creditworthiness,
and possibly enhanced lending discrimination. Also, credit quality may continue to
deteriorate even after the recovery has started, as in previous recession episodes, with
adverse implications for credit risk. Furthermore, the need to rebuild capital due to
forthcoming new regulation could have an unfavorable impact on the credit rebound in the
near future. Policies introduced so far to support lending growth appear to be broadly

98
appropriate and in line with those implemented in other advanced economies. Nonetheless,
direct public intervention in the credit market should be avoided, and the recourse to
government guarantees should be temporary and appropriately priced. Further actions to
support enterprises should be accompanied by corporate restructuring when needed.

ANALYTICAL ANNEX IV: RESISTING THE STORM, NAVIGATING THE RECOVERY: THE CASE
OF ITALIAN BANKS 1

Thanks to their conservative business profile, Italian banks weathered the global financial
meltdown relatively well and did not need emergency government interventions, unlike
elsewhere in Europe. However, banks suffered from weak asset quality, low lending growth,
and significantly lower profitability. They have been forced to strengthen capital to more
adequate levels. Going forward, Italian banks’ risk profile will benefit from improved
macroeconomic conditions, but high credit risk will limit their ability to significantly improve
earnings and capital. As the future global regulatory framework calls for higher
capitalization, Italian banks will need to continue to strengthen their capital base and to
improve their risk profiles.
I. IMPACT OF THE GLOBAL CRISIS ON THE ITALIAN BANKING SECTOR
A. Tackling the Global Crisis from a Position of Relative Strength
Italian banks entered the global crisis with sound risk profiles. Before 2008, they
improved risk management techniques, lowered credit risk, and ultimately strengthened their
profitability. Thanks also to the introduction of the Basel II framework, risk management
benefited from the adoption of objective credit scoring and analytical tools for risk modeling.
The largest banks introduced the role of Chief Risk Officer, who has the mandate to monitor
all risk components. Helped by a favorable business cycle, that reduced both corporate and
household insolvencies, credit risk lowered to historical minima. Thanks to domestic
consolidation, banks became more efficient through the rationalization of headquarters and
branch networks. Acquisitions of weaker players by stronger ones favored the spread of best
practices. Revenues benefited from a positive cycle, with increasing lending volumes,
positive inflows of assets under management, and contained cost growth.
Banks weathered the global financial meltdown relatively well. Thanks to low exposures
to complex financial products or toxic assets, domestic banks did not suffer from abrupt
securities mark-downs, as happened to several banks in other countries. A traditional
business model based on classical on-balance sheet lending-deposit activity, deep customer
relationships, and a central role of banks in the intermediation of most financial activities
sheltered Italian banks from pressures on investment banking and market funding. Credit
quality indicators, such as the stock of nonperforming loans, or the need for credit
provisioning, started to deteriorate only in the second half of 2008.
Unlike in some other European countries, there was no major real estate bubble. In the
ten years prior to the crisis, housing prices grew less than the European average. Household
indebtedness, while rising, remained lower than in several other advanced economies, and a

strong culture of saving is still predominant. Banks’ exposure to the real estate sector
continued to be contained, accounting for about 25 percent of banks’ loan book. The
household sector high creditworthiness offset the large number of insolvencies among small
and medium Enterprises (SMEs), to which banks have historically been greatly exposed.
Banks avoided risky lending practices, such as buy-to-let or high loan-to-values. Also, loan
growth, albeit sustained, was more limited than in other European countries, with the yearly
growth rate for customer loans rarely exceeding 15 percent in the last decade.
Liquidity remained adequate. When liquidity German y

even at the peak of the crisis, relying on strong links
with their customers. The stock of deposits continued to grow by 5 percent annually both in
2008 and 2009. Banks were also able to place significant amounts of bonds through their
retail network. Liquidity in large banks was somewhat weaker than in the rest of the banking
system, given their relatively higher dependence on wholesale funding.

B. Economic Deterioration Hits Asset Quality
The dramatic worsening of the economic conditions has weakened bank asset quality.
Credit risk increased during the second half of 2008, and continued to deteriorate in 2009, in
tandem with the worsening of the economy and the rise in corporate defaults. For the entire
banking system the gross nonperforming loans ratio deteriorated from 2.7 percent in 2008 to
3.6 percent in 2009 for the household sector and from 3.0 percent to 4.5 percent for the
corporate sector, with the nonperforming loans ratio to SMEs alone growing from 6.2 percent
to 7.4 percent.

each country.

The speed of credit deterioration was remarkable, but broadly in line with
developments elsewhere in Europe. For the five largest banks the stock of nonperforming
loans (NPLs) increased by 40 percent from 2008 to 2009 (see Box 1). Three-quarters of the
new flow of NPLs came from the corporate sector, and one-quarter from households, which
were increasingly hit by unemployment. Thanks to banks’ efforts to provision adequately for
the new inflows of NPLs, the coverage ratio (i.e., the amount of nonperforming loans
covered by loan loss provisions) remained broadly stable in 2009 compared to the previous
year, at about 55 percent.

105
BOX 1. Measuring the Impact of the Crisis: Asset Quality Deterioration in Italy and in Europe
A comparative analysis of 30 large European banks with the largest 5 Italians in the period from December
2008 to December 2009 shows that:
The gross stock of nonperforming loans, as a percentage of total loans (NPL ratio) deteriorated
significantly in the period of observation, both in Italy and abroad. The pace of deterioration was very
similar in Italy and abroad, with Italian banks reaching the same level of NPL ratio as the average large
European banks. For the largest five domestic banks, it increased on average from 3.2 percent in December
2008 to 4.7 percent one year later; in Europe, it deteriorated from an average of 2.4 percent to 4.0 percent in the
same period.
The coverage ratio (i.e., the amount of nonperforming loans covered by loan loss provisions) fell more
significantly in the rest of Europe than in Italy. The average ratio for Europe declined significantly from
75 percent to about 66 percent from December 2008 to December 2009. This reflected the very severe credit
quality deterioration that occurred in some European countries, and their inability to provision adequately for
the new flow on nonperforming loans. In Italy, banks kept loss reserves levels at about 55 percent of
nonperforming loans, provisioning enough to keep their coverage ratio broadly stable. Although the gap
between Italy and Europe has fallen significantly, credit reserves in the rest of Europe remain larger (in relation
to NPLs) than in Italy.
The provisions for loan losses as a percentage of pre-provision income (the so-called provisions to profits
ratio) increased significantly both in Italy and in Europe. For the five largest Italian banks the provisions to
profits ratio rose from 30 percent in 2008 to 56 percent in 2009. In Europe, the same ratio reached 60 percent,
from 34 percent in 2008. Both in Italy and Europe, this increase reflected the growing need to provision for
deteriorating loans, while large banks’ ability to generate pre-provision income remained solid, thanks to good
revenue generation.

106
In a few cases, the deterioration of credit risk reflected in part developments in foreign
loan portfolios. Total banking activity abroad was €150bn at year-end 2008, or just 5 percent
of the banking system loans. It was directed mainly to Eastern Europe (especially Croatia,
Hungary, Poland, and the Slovak Republic), Turkey, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine, and operated
by UniCredit and Intesa, whose lending outside of Italy account for about 11 percent and
7 percent of total loans, respectively. The contribution to risk from overseas exposure was
not, however, large, in view of the relatively low share of foreign lending in total banks’
activity.
C. Profitability Weakens
Net income worsened significantly, due to a spike in loan loss provisions linked to
deteriorating asset quality. For the largest

107
This is mainly explained by decreasing interest margins. Italian banks’ interest margins
tend to decline when interest rates go down, as occurred over the last two years. This is due
to a combination of assets with short duration, a high proportion of assets bearing variable
interest rates, and a high proportion of cheap customer deposits. As a result, interest margins
fell by 8 percent in 2009, compared to one year before. In contrast, interest margin in other
countries on average increased, reflecting different structures of assets, and also a higher
ability to apply higher pricing to customers. In Spain, for example, major banks recorded
increases of interest margins in the range of 7‒15 percent.
Italian banks were not able to take advantage of the large gains in equity, fixed income,
and commodities markets, given their low trading and investment banking activities.
Several large European banks operating in the investment banking arena (mainly Swiss, UK,
and German), boosted revenues thanks to very strong trading gains in 2009. This reflected,
among other things the rally in equity, fixed-income and commodity markets, lower
competition due to the exit or consolidation of some of the largest investment banks, and
cheap funding thanks to low interest rates.
D. Capital is Raised to More Adequate Levels
In the years before the crisis, Italian banks spent significant amount of capital in
acquisitions. Acquisitions were usually executed at hefty prices, incorporating significant
amounts of “goodwill.” The large domestic banks often doubled their size in the period
2004–2007. As an example, UniCredit purchased the German group HVB (with significant
presence in central and eastern Europe) and the Italian Capitalia; and Intesa created the
current Intesa SanPaolo group, via the merger with SanPaolo IMI.
Banks also distributed generous dividends to shareholders. The dividend payout ratio in
the years prior to the crisis (for the top five Italian banks) exceeded 50 percent, and in a few
cases topped as much as 70 percent. In some instances, banks resorted also to extraordinary
distributions (for example, Intesa SanPaolo and Banco Popolare).
Since the inception of the crisis, the capital strategy has radically changed. Under moral
suasion of the Bank of Italy, banks have launched capital strengthening initiatives, in the
form of capital increases, sales of nonstrategic assets, and issuance of recapitalization bonds.
UniCredit directly tapped the equity markets with a €4 billion issuance of shares; Intesa and
MPS began the sale of a number of assets, including branches. The dividend payout policy
was also sharply curtailed, with most banks not distributing any dividends on the 2008
earnings. Management of risk-weighted assets has also been an important lever to improve
capital ratios.

As a consequence of these actions, capital ratios have now strengthened to more
adequate levels. For the largest five banks, the average Tier1 ratio had dropped to
6.5 percent at end-2007, from 7.5 percent at end-2004. Following the capital strengthening
initiatives, the average Tier1 ratio then improved to above 8 percent at end-2009. Beyond the
largest five banks, the system displayed historically higher capitalization ratios, with Tier1
ratio at 7.7 percent at end-2007. After the capital strengthening initiatives of the large banks,
this gap between the large banks and the banking system has largely disappeared with the
Tier 1 ratio of the entire banking system having reached 8.2 percent in June 2009.
The trend towards strengthening capitalization has been in line with what observed in
the rest of Europe. Thanks to capital increases, government interventions, and efforts to
refocus attention on core businesses, all large banks in Europe have considerably
strengthened their capital ratios during 2009, responding to strong regulatory pressures to
hold more capital against risks. As of end-2009, Tier1 ratios rose above 10 percent for the
average of the largest 30 banks, from 8.6 percent one year before.
Comparison of capital levels with the rest of Europe gives a mixed ranking. Despite the
recent capital strengthening, Italian banks still display weaker Core Tier1 ratios than their
European peers, with the weighted average being 7.2 percent as of end-2009, versus 8.8
percent in Europe. However, the comparison is more favorable if the leverage ratio (or the
ratio between assets and equity) is taken into consideration. The difference derives from the
business mix in Italian banks being more based on lending activity than for other European
banks, which also have significant trading and investment arms. This produces a difference
in risk-weighted assets that tend to be higher for banks with more traditional business profiles
like the Italian.

The quality of capital compares well with the rest of Europe. With strict regulatory rules
that limit to 20 percent the inclusion of hybrid instruments into banks’ capital base, Italian
banks display good quality of capital. The same regulatory limit is higher in several
European countries, with the average limit being about 35 percent. Core Tier1 represented, at
end- 2009, an average 88 percent for the largest five banks, one of the highest levels in
Europe. Also, the regulatory prudential filters applied to computation of Tier1 capital are
quite conservative.
II. GOING FORWARD: SCENARIO ANALYSIS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS
A. Challenging Times Ahead
Italian banks should benefit from improved macroeconomic conditions, but
vulnerabilities will likely remain. In line with the projected output recovery, revenues are
expected to increase moderately, reflecting low lending growth, a limited rise in interest
rates, and some positive contribution from commission income. A more favorable
environment for corporates and households is expected to slow the pace of deterioration in
credit quality. However, given the still fragile economy, and the lag between economic
recovery and improvement in asset quality, banks will continue to face a high level of credit
risk for the next two years.
A scenario analysis run by staff on the five largest banks shows that, due to still high
loan write-downs, these banks would not generate sufficient profits to meaningfully
reinforce capital ratios. The Base Scenario takes into consideration a macroeconomic
outlook in line with IMF projections of GDP growth of 0.8 percent in 2010, and 1.2 percent
in 2011. As a result, loans are expected to grow by 1–3 percent in 2010–11, revenues by
1–3 percent, loan loss provisions to further increase by 6‒9 percent in 2010, and then fall by
3–0 percent in 2011. Under such assumptions, cumulated loan loss provisions in the
2010–2011 periods would be one-third higher than in the 2008–2009. Earnings would
slightly improve in 2010 and in 2011, but would continue to remain significantly lower than
in the pre-crisis period. Assuming a dividend distribution in the order of 10‒30 percent of

110
earnings, aggregated Core Tier1 ratio would rise in the 2010‒11 period by less than
0.5 percentage points by 2011. The capital shortfall with respect to an 8 percentage Core
Tier1 level would progressively close by 2011, although with significant discrepancies bank
by bank.

111
BOX 2. Methodology for Scenario Analysis
Staff performed a scenario analysis to measure the ability of large Italian banks to feed the economy with
adequate lending growth and in the meantime continue strengthen their capital ratios through earnings
retention. Banks included in the panel are UniCredit, Intesa SanPaolo, Banca Monte Paschi, Unione di
Banche Italiane, and Banco Popolare. Aggregated, they represent two-thirds of the banking system’s
assets, and almost 90 percent of profit generation. The scenario encompasses 2010 and 2011.
Starting point is, for each bank, the 2009 profit and loss and balance sheet data. Taking into consideration
IMF projections on GDP growth, staff derived two different scenarios: a Base Scenario, where GDP
growth is kept in line with IMF forecasts; and a more conservative one, called Severe Scenario, where
GDP growth is stressed to lower levels.
The main variables projected under both

The scenario provides, for each bank, an
estimate of net income that, assuming
certain earnings retention levels, feeds
into each bank’s existing capital base.

which allows to project risk-weighted assets.
Capital ratios (in terms of Core Tier1) are then calculated for 2010 and 2011, using the following formula:

where: CR= capital ratio; K= capital base; E=earnings; D=dividends distributed; RWA= risk-weighted
assets; G=growth coefficient.
A capital shortfall is then calculated, as the difference between the projected capital ratio, and certain
target levels for Core Tier1 (7, 8, and 9 percent). The Scenario Analysis is performed under the current
regulatory capital rules, and does not take into consideration forthcoming regulatory changes currently
under discussion.

Earnings retention alone would not be enough to improve capitalization to the required
levels. During 2008 and 2009, large banks raised their Core Tier1 ratios by injecting a
cumulated €15 billion of new capital trough capital increases, sales of nonstrategic assets, or
the subscription of recapitalization Bonds. The average Core Tier1 for the largest five banks
improved more than 100 basis points. The future projected improvements under the Base
Scenario, driven just by future earnings retention, would be much more modest, of the order
of a few tens of basis points per year in 2010 and 2011.
In a severe scenario with a more sluggish economic recovery and a weaker corporate
landscape, earnings would shrink further and capital ratios would deteriorate. The
Severe Scenario assumes a harsh macroeconomic outlook, with GDP shrinking by
1.7 percent in 2010 and by 1.3 percent in 2011 (or 2.5 percentage points lower than in the

112
Base Scenario). Under this scenario, loans would remain flat, revenues growth would be
negative, and loan loss provisions would increase by around 18-22 percent, in both 2010 and
2011. The cumulated loan losses would be 65 percent higher than in 2008-09. Such a
scenario would result in a significant erosion of profitability. On an aggregated level, the
Core Tier1 ratio would deteriorate to below the 7 percent mark for several banks.
Under both scenarios, the capitalization situation of individual banks would vary
considerably, however. The strongest bank would be about 25 percent better capitalized
than the weaker, with the strongest reaching a Core Tier1 ratio above 8 percent, while for the
weaker it would be lower than 7 percent in the Base scenario. The difference between the
weaker and the stronger capitalized banks would not materially change in the severe
scenario, but more banks would have a Core Tier1 ratio below 7 percent.
B. Ability to Feed Economic Recovery Will Remain Constrained
Reflecting the economic contraction, lending growth to the private sector has slowed
down significantly from about 10 percent in 2007 to close to 2 percent at end-2009.
Banks have become more selective in granting new credit, reflecting the perception of higher
counterparty risk. Banks may also be containing loan growth to reinforce capital ratios and to
deleverage. The demand for credit has also fallen, due to the sharp economic contraction.
Banks’ ability to increase lending and reinforce capital ratios will be significantly
weaker than in the pre-crisis period. Banks will continue to be constrained in their lending
strategy by lower earnings prospects on one side, and the necessity to further strengthen
capital on the other. Prior to the crisis, earning generation was strong enough to assure hefty
dividend payouts on one side, and enough earnings retention on the other. Staff expects that
in the coming years banks will need to keep dividends very low in order to assure lending
growth and, in the meantime, some growth of their capital ratios.

113
C. A New Tougher Regulatory Framework
Banks will also have to withstand the impact of a tougher regulatory framework.
Regulatory rules are currently being revised across the board on several aspects from the
definition of core capital to new, more stringent liquidity requirements. Future definition of
capital will be narrower than today’s, therefore lowering capital ratios other things being
equal (see Box 3).
BOX 3. The Future Regulatory Framework on Capital and its Impact in Italy and in Europe
In December 2009, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) announced a series of
measures that will directly impact the future level of banks capital as well as its measurement. The
BCBS objective is to raise the quality, consistency, and transparency of the regulatory capital base, by
overcoming the limitations of the current regulatory framework on capital. Ultimately, the Committee
aims at promoting more resilient banks as the foundation for sustainable economic growth. This
announcement comes on top of other critical reforms to the Basel II framework launched in July 2009,
which will raise capital requirements for the trading book and complex securitization exposures, a major
source of losses for many internationally active banks.
The new rules would lower current banks’ capital ratios, other things being equal. The BCBS states
the principle that the dominant form of Tier1 capital must be common shares and retained earnings. The
proposed new Basel framework would apply more conservative prudential filters, by deducting from the
computation of common equity items such as defined benefit pension assets; capital in insurance
subsidiaries; deferred tax assets; intangibles; negative available-for-sale reserves; and minority interests,
and minority participations. More deductions will mean lower capital ratios. Future issuances of
government-subscribed bonds will also be excluded from core capital.
Preliminary simulations for large banks indicate that impact of the new regulatory framework could
be significant. The BCBS proposal lays down general principles. The details will be discussed with local
regulators and the market at a later stage. It is very difficult at this stage to perform accurate simulations
on the future impact of the new regulation. A first (broad) simulation suggests that the impact for Italian
banks could overall be manageable and somewhat lower than in other countries, reflecting the fact that
their capital is of good quality and the regulatory prudential filters are already rather stringent. However,
on aggregate, Core Tier1 ratio would still decline by about 150 basis points, for the largest domestic
banks.
The BCBS will allow for a smooth transition to the new rules. The impact assessment will be carried
out in the first half of 2010. The fully calibrated set of standards will be developed by the end of 2010,
with the aim of implementation by end-2012. The Committee anticipated that it will put in place
appropriate phase-in measures and grandfathering arrangements for a sufficiently long period to ensure a
smooth transition to the new standards.

D. Further Capital Strengthening, Fast Adherence to Future Standards Need to be the
Priority
Banks are being called to respond to potentially conflicting forces. They have to
deleverage, raise the level and quality of capital, and extend credit to the private sector to
support economic recovery in a still uncertain world.
Against this background, and in line with what was recommended by the Bank of Italy,
efforts to strengthen capitalization should continue. On a case-by-case basis, capital will
need to be further reinforced to face a still challenging credit and earnings outlook, and to
support future economic growth. Given the still moderate outlook for profitability, it will be
difficult to significantly reinforce capital only through earnings retention, even assuming low
distribution of dividend levels. Therefore, banks should be encouraged to:



Limit the distribution of dividends.



Refocus on core businesses/geographies, disposing of nonstrategic assets if needed.



Issue new capital

Although there is still high uncertainty on the details of future capital regulation, the
authorities should guide the domestic banking system towards the prompt adoption of
the future framework. When the Basel II framework was introduced, Italian banks were
given a long time to comply with certain elements of the new regulation (e.g., the rule under
which credits become classified as past-due). Going forward, instead, Italian banks should be
encouraged to start adapt their capital strategies around the forthcoming new regulatory
framework, and to quickly adopt the new international rules on capital, as soon as they are
defined.
Along these lines, banks should be encouraged to adopt long-term strategies in terms of
core capital. In particular, banks that made use of government recapitalization bonds will
need to prepare an alternative recapitalizations strategy as the interest rate on these securities
rises sharply in 2013.
In the context of high credit risk, prompt recognition of nonperforming loans will be
essential in order to avoid legacy problems in the future. Reserve coverage should also be
maintained at an adequate level.
The Bank of Italy should consider publishing a by-annual stability review in line with
current practice in other countries in order to enhance the supervisory framework and to
raise awareness of the domestic banking system’s strengths and weaknesses.

ANNEX II. ITALY: STATISTICAL INFORMATION
Data provision is adequate for surveillance. Italy’s economic database is comprehensive and
of generally high quality. Italy has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard
(SDDS) and has posted the metadata on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
(DSBB). Data are provided to the Fund in a comprehensive manner (see attached table). The
authorities regularly publish a full range of economic and financial data, as well as a calendar
of dates for the main statistical releases. Italy is also subject to the statistical requirements
and timeliness and reporting standards of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB),
and has adopted the European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA95). The shift to chain-weighted
indices for national accounts has been largely completed over the course of 2006.
A Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC)—Data Module (Country
Report No. 02/234, 10/18/02) found Italy’s macroeconomic statistics to be of generally high
quality, but also identified some shortcomings that hindered an accurate and timely analysis
of economic and financial developments: (i) no statistical agency had the responsibility to
compile and disseminate a comprehensive statement of government finances, and a persistent
difference had emerged between the SGP-monitored fiscal deficit and the PSBR net of
privatization receipts (discussed in detail in the 2004 Staff Report); (ii) source data and/or
statistical techniques could be strengthened in several areas, most importantly, by raising
response rates on the enterprise surveys used in the national accounts and producer price
index, making price collection for the consumer price index more efficient, and improving
the coverage of cross-border financial transactions; (iii) balance of payments and government
finance statistics could be closer aligned with the internationally accepted methodological
guidelines on concepts and definitions, scope, classification and sectorization, and/or
valuation; and (iv) resources were under pressure in some parts of the National Institute of
Statistics (Istat) in the face of the statistical requirements of the EU and the Euro area.
Despite some improvements in the national accounts, changes in inventories are derived as a
residual and lumped together with the statistical discrepancy thus hampering the economic
analysis.
The Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes— Fiscal Transparency Module—
Update (Country Report No. 06/64, February 2006) found that some progress has been made
vis-à-vis the 2003 ROSC update, especially toward strengthening the integrity of data.
However, according to the report a few issues remain outstanding. First, the transparency and
timeliness of budget documents should be improved; for example, key details underlying
budgetary plans have typically been available only well after the draft budget itself,
hampering a proper the assessment of fiscal plans. Second, more information on financial
transactions between the government and public enterprises should be made available—this
would also help address the discrepancies in fiscal balances discussed above. Third, the
general lack of data on the operations of larger nonstate entities where the state is a
shareholder, such as the road company, should be addressed. Finally, as public private
partnerships gain ground from the current low base, these operations and associated
contingent liabilities should be transparently recorded, including in budget documentation;
and project evaluation should be strengthened across all levels of government. Also on fiscal
data, in recent years progress has been made in reconciling the discrepancy between the cash-

5
based net borrowing requirement and the accrual budget deficit, and, as a result, the
statistical discrepancy has decreased in recent years.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation
with Italy
On May 26, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Italy.1
Background
The global crisis affected Italy’s economy mainly through the trade, credit, and
confidence channels. The recession in the country’s main trading partners led to a sharp
fall in exports. Financing conditions tightened, and credit growth fell. Despite strong
household balance sheets, private consumption declined significantly, reflecting
uncertainty, and tighter consumer credit. Fixed investment and inventories also fell
sharply, reflecting weak demand prospects and difficult financing conditions. The drop in
aggregate demand, which was not offset by the comparatively limited fiscal response,
resulted in one of the largest output falls among large industrialized countries. However,
unemployment rose only modestly, in large part due to wage supplementation schemes
and falling participation. A modest and fragile recovery based on external demand,
restocking of inventories, and some government support is underway. Output contracted
by 5 percent in 2009 and is projected to increase by 0.8 percent in 2010.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions
with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and
financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and
policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for
discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing
Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this
summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in
summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
The large public debt and the fear of adverse market reactions limited the ability of the
government to implement countercyclical fiscal policy. Italy’s stimulus package was the
smallest among advanced G-20 countries. Nevertheless, the fiscal position deteriorated
sharply in 2009. The overall deficit has reached 5.3 percent of GDP in 2009, and public
debt increased to about 115.8 percent of GDP by end-2009. The fiscal deficit is
projected at 5.2 percent of GDP in 2010. On May 25, 2010, the Italian authorities
announced a package of fiscal measures purported to represent a cumulative adjustment
equivalent to 1.6 percent of GDP over 2011‒12.
The banking system weathered the global financial crisis relatively well, reflecting preexisting strengths, such as limited exposure to toxic assets, the absence of a property
bubble, retail-based business models, and a sound supervisory/regulatory framework.
Unlike elsewhere, Italian banks did not need emergency government intervention, and
recourse to ECB liquidity support schemes remained limited. However, the deterioration
of the economy weakened banks’ asset quality and profitability. Credit risk increased
during the second half of 2008 and in 2009. Following the economic contraction, lending
growth to the private sector slowed sharply, profitability declined, and asset quality
deteriorated. Banks increased capitalization in 2008–09, but their capital ratios still
range from weak to average compared with other countries in Europe. Banks will need
to raise more capital, also in view of forthcoming new regulations and probable increase
in non-performing loans.
Executive Board Assessment
The Executive Directors noted that despite the Italian economy’s elements of strength
such as high private savings, low private indebtedness, and a comparatively resilient
financial system, the global crisis had a severe impact on it. Directors commended the
authorities for their supportive response to the crisis. Fiscal policy was appropriately
tight and timely measures were taken to support the financial sector. The economy is set
for a gradual recovery but key weaknesses, including high public debt and low income
growth, remain. The overarching policy goals now should be to maintain fiscal discipline,
reduce the burden of public debt, and raise the economy’s long-term growth rate.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to reduce the fiscal deficit to below
3 percent by 2012. They strongly commended the fiscal package of measures
announced on May 25, which is aimed at achieving this objective. Containing the public
sector wage bill should remain a key element of the consolidation strategy and close
monitoring of sub-national public finances should be continued.
Directors noted the progress made in improving the fiscal framework, including adoption
of the 2009 Accounting and Public Finance law and called for further efforts in this area.
The new framework law on fiscal federalism would also have important implications for
public finances. Directors stressed that fiscal consolidation should be a key guiding

3
principle in the implementation of federalism. It will also be necessary to tackle longerterm fiscal challenges, including improving the efficiency of public expenditure.
Directors commended the authorities for the recent bold pension reforms, which have
significantly improved the sustainability of the pension system. Noting the back-loaded
element of the remaining adjustment in benefits, some Directors saw merit in bringing
forward the scheduled increase in the retirement age. Efforts to develop private pension
schemes should also be intensified.
Directors noted that the financial system had weathered the global crisis relatively well.
However, banks could face a number of challenges over the medium term because of
the weak economy, future international regulations requiring higher capital, and the
continued financial market turbulence in the euro area. Directors therefore
recommended that the authorities continue to encourage banks to strengthen capital.
Directors commended the authorities for the progress made in structural reforms but
stressed that a more ambitious program of reforms needed to be pursued to address
Italy’s structural weakness and raise its growth potential. These reforms should be
aimed at enhancing competition, boosting productivity, and reducing the high cost of
doing business. In this regard, reforming civil justice, accelerating legal processes, and
strengthening enforcement of the rule of law were considered critical. Labor market
reform would also be necessary to strengthen the link between wages and productivity,
allow wages to better respond to regional differences and foster adequate spatial
mobility of labor.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Italy
May 26, 2010
1.
This statement summarizes economic developments and policy actions in Italy since
the Staff Report (SM/10/127) was prepared. The additional information does not change the
thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Italy’s real GDP grew by 0.5 percent quarter-on-quarter (qoq) in the first
quarter of 2010. This growth was the strongest since 2007, more than the euro area average,
and broadly based across sectors, according to preliminary estimates from the Italian national
statistics agency (ISTAT). Industrial output on a seasonally adjusted basis grew 1.4 percent
qoq in the first quarter of 2010, compared to a 1.0 percent qoq rise in the last quarter of 2009.
3.
The Italian Ministry of Finance has revised down its forecasts for economic
growth. The official growth forecast is now closer the staff projections though still above the
consensus. Recent market turbulance has, however, increased the uncertainty of these growth
projections.

The 2010 Combined Report on the Economy and Public Finance, issued on
May 6, confirmed the authorities’ commitment under the Excessive Deficit Procedure
to achieve a deficit of 3.9 percent of GDP in 2011 and 2.7 percent of GDP in 2012.
Measures to achieve this are expected to be announced in due course.
6.
Financial markets continue to experience major turbulence. Markets appear to be
pressing for more fiscal adjustment from members of the euro area. The euro itself has
depreciated by 8 percent against the US dollar since the start of April. Italy’s main stock
index, meanwhile, has recorded a 16 percent decline, with banks’ equity prices suffering
particularly large losses. Sovereign 5-year CDS and 10 year government bond spreads have
widened comparatively modestly (by 23 and 36 bps, respectively) since April 1.

Statement by Arrigo Sadun, Executive Director for Italy
May 26, 2010
The Italian economy has been severely hit by the global crisis due to the collapse in
international trade, despite the limited impact on the financial sector. However, having hit the
bottom of the cycle by the middle of last year, the Italian economy is now recovering broadly
in line with the rest of Europe. GDP rebounded in the third quarter of 2009 and the recovery
appears to be back on track according to recent data.
1. Some Hidden Strengths of the Italian Economy
Notwithstanding some structural weaknesses and low growth rates, some sectors of the
economy, including the labor market and exports, have performed relatively well in the years
up to the crisis. Aggregate data often fail to capture accurately and in a timely fashion the
actual performances of the Italian industry, characterized by a large number of dynamic
small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). A growing amount of empirical evidence
suggests that the underlying trends in productivity and competitiveness during the past
decade have been substantially better than originally estimated. For example, new data
released by the Italian Statistical Office (ISTAT) last December show that total-factor
productivity (TFP) in the manufacturing sector grew by 1.2 percent per year from 2003 to
2007; quite a different picture from the staff assessment of “stagnant productivity and
declining competitiveness over more than a decade”.
Similarly, the real performance of Italian exports appears substantially better when nominal
data are deflated by appropriate prices rather than by National Accounts (NA) deflators that
are tainted by abnormal trends in average unit values. According to these estimates, Italy’s
exports (in volume) grew by an annual average of 4.6 percent from 2005 to 2008, instead of
the 2 percent calculated using NA data. This implies that, before the crisis, Italian exports
rose substantially more than the European average; indeed its performance was second only
to Germany’s, considered the term of reference for the entire region.
For several years before the global crisis, the growth of many advanced countries, which
relied heavily on excessive financial leveraging and a massive indebtedness in the private
sector, outstripped Italy’s modest but balanced growth rates; the burst of the bubble has recasted the performance of the Italian economy in a more favorable light. Furthermore, these
results have been achieved during a period of major shocks (the introduction of the euro, the
entry of China into the WTO, and the abrogation of the Multi-Fiber Agreement) that required
a massive restructuring of the Italian industry. As a result of these changes, a large number of
Italian firms have been able to upgrade the value added of their production; instead of
abandoning their traditional sectors of specialization, they have introduced innovative
products and strengthened the relationships with their client bases, an effective way to sustain
competition from lower cost producers. Instead of seeking greater volume market shares,
Italian firms prefer to strengthen their market power, focusing on specialized niches. This
strategy is quite different from that of large multinational corporations, but it is well-suited
for the small size of Italian firms and has proved quite effective to secure adequate profit
margins and employment.

2
The global crisis also revealed the soundness of the Italian financial sector that has been able
to withstand the negative effects of the turmoil much better than those of many other
advanced countries. The reasons for this resilience are quite clear: as staff indicates, the
exposure of the Italian banks to toxic assets is minor, banks have not suffered from excessive
leveraging and have maintained a prudent behavior. Funding is largely based on clients’
deposits and lending is characterized by close bank-customer relationships. As a result of the
limited exposure to the market turmoil, the government’s support to the financial sector has
been quite negligible.
2. Economic Outlook: from Recession to Recovery
In line with most other European countries, the recession in Italy ended in the second quarter
of 2009. After a brief pause in the closing months of last year, growth has resumed at a
relatively high rate; in the first quarter of this year, GDP grew by 2 percent on an annualized
basis. Near-term perspectives appear favorable, as available indicators such as industrial
production and surveys of business confidence point to solid growth in the months ahead.
Even assuming lower growth rates in the second half of this year, the target of a 1 percent
growth for the entire year appears comfortably within reach. For 2011, the new official
forecast contained in the Combined Report on Economy and Public Finance (RUEF) issued
at the beginning of May points to a GDP growth of 1.5 percent, broadly in line with the
IMF’s and the European Commission’s projections.
Far-reaching structural reforms introduced in previous years have substantially increased the
flexibility of the labor market. As a result, unemployment has declined steadily despite
relatively slow economic growth, reaching a low of 5.8 just before the global crisis. Despite
the sharp decline in output during the 2008-09 recession, unemployment increased
substantially less than in the neighboring countries, reaching 8.3 percent at the end of last
year. Temporary measures have been adopted to broaden the coverage of the employment
protection scheme (Casas Integration Guarani), preventing a more substantial loss in human
capital. Active labor market policies are also expected to foster employment growth.
The Italian economy has been affected by the global crisis mostly through the channel of
international trade and does not need to undergo sweeping structural changes of its real estate
nor financial sectors. Furthermore the debts levels in the private sector, and in particular
among households, are low by international standards. This leaves the Italian economy
relatively well-positioned to benefit from the recovery of the global economy and from the
rebound of world trade. The recent weakening of the euro vis-a-vis the US dollar and other
currencies has enhanced these opportunities in the near term.
3. Fiscal Policy
Despite the severity of the economic downturn in 2008-09, the authorities have resisted
pressures for adopting generalized countercyclical fiscal measures, allowing the automatic
fiscal stabilizers to play their role. Discretionary measures have been directed to protect the
incomes of the most vulnerable social groups and to sustain small- and medium-sized
enterprises. As a result of this prudent fiscal policy, the increase in the deficit was limited to

3
5.3 percent of GDP in 2009, a level substantially lower than most other advanced economies.
Similarly, the debt increase was limited to 9.7 percentage points, much less than in most G20
advanced countries.
The prudent stance of the fiscal policy, along with Italy’s strong corporate and household
balance sheets, and the high level of private saving as well as the relatively more favorable
perspectives for fiscal sustainability in the long term, explains why the recent financial
market turbulence in the region has so far had only a limited impact on the spreads of Italian
sovereign bonds. In order to achieve the medium-term fiscal targets and reduce the deficit
below 3 percent of GDP by 2012, the government will shortly unveil a comprehensive fiscal
package based on the containment of current expenditures. This plan should dispel any
lingering uncertainty about the authorities’ determination to achieve the fiscal goals agreed
with the European partners.
Fiscal federalism has its main goals in fiscal consolidation and improvements in the quality
of public spending, while reducing social and economic differences among regions. The
benefits of fiscal federalism will be felt mostly in the long term, while there are some risks
that the reforms might entail additional costs in the short term. As a result, the government is
committed to implementing the reform gradually and monitoring the situation closely.
The Accounting and Public Finance law, recently introduced, contributed to bring Italy’s
public financial management in line with best international practices. The introduction of a
new three-year budget process that underpins the medium-term fiscal strategy is the main
feature of the reform. Moreover, by harmonizing public accounting systems, the new
framework strengthens expenditure control and monitoring, and enhances the performance
orientation of the budget; it is expected to deliver increasing results over time.
4. Pensions and Other Structural Reforms
The analysis of long-term sustainability confirms that Italy is relatively well-placed among
advanced countries, notwithstanding the high level of debt. According to the IMF’s recently
published Fiscal Monitoring, Italy needs a fiscal consolidation of 4.1 percent of GDP in the
next ten years in order to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio to 60 percent by 2030. This relatively
modest requirement, which is less than half of what is required from other advanced
economies, is mostly owed to the effect of the pension reforms introduced years ago that
have moved the pension system from a defined benefit to a notional defined-contribution
scheme. Despite a rapidly ageing population, the stabilization of pension spending as a
percentage of GDP is the major achievement of the reform, as recognized in the report. These
projections are based on commonly agreed assumptions by all EU member States and
reported in the European Commission’s 2009 Ageing Report. Current Italian projections
acknowledge that the crisis would reduce medium-term growth by an average of 0.5 percent
compared to those projected by the 2009 Ageing Report for the years 2010-2020; from 2021
onwards the projections assume the convergence in labor productivity to the EU average.
With recent modifications, the pension reforms have increased the retirement age
substantially and, from 2015 onwards, the retirement age will be linked to life expectancy.
Moreover, the revisions of the conversion coefficients used to calculate benefits, which take

4
into account contributions and life expectancy, will be determined by an administrative and
automatic procedure to take place every three years instead of on the basis of a negotiation.
In addition, the authorities are ready to act promptly, as in the past, should the pension
expenditure trend derail from the envisaged path. Against this background, the concern
expressed in the report on the implementation of the measures, including the revisions in
coefficients and the maintenance of the contributory principle, is totally unfounded since
those provisions are already included in fully enacted laws.
The authorities are fully committed to pursuing an ambitious program of structural reforms to
increase productivity and foster potential growth. Enhancing the efficiency of public
services, improving the quality of public investments in infrastructure, and streamlining
bureaucratic requirements are among the top priorities. The implementation of the recently
approved fiscal federalism represents a key opportunity to move ahead in this domain. In
addition, the reform of the justice system will contribute to improving the civil justice,
accelerating legal processes, and strengthening the enforcement of rules, all of which will
contribute to create a more pro-business environment.
The labor market reforms introduced in the past decade have enhanced employment growth
and labor force participation. Furthermore, the new bargaining framework recently
introduced will facilitate a better alignment of wages to productivity developments. The
Italian authorities attach great importance to the swift implementation of this new scheme,
which is considered a key tool in bolstering employment, increasing competitiveness, and
enhancing potential growth.
5. The Financial Sector
Italian banks entered the global crisis from a position of comparative strength due to a
business model based on traditional lending-deposit activities and strong customer
relationships. The resiliency of Italian banks also reflected limited exposure to structured
financial products and less dependence on wholesale funding as well as previous sectoral
consolidation and improved governance. Moreover, a sound supervisory framework and
stricter application of prudential rules contributed to preserving the stability of Italian banks
even during the most acute phases of the global crisis.
As a result, in contrast with most banking systems in advanced countries, Italian banks were
able to better withstand the market turmoil with very contained government support. In fact,
at end-2009 the net direct cost of financial sector support was limited to 0.3 percent of GDP
(as opposed to an average of 2.7 percent for G-20 advanced economies)1, and recourse to
ECB liquidity support schemes remained limited.
The slowdown in lending since early 2008 was primarily demand-driven, as the empirical
evidence provided by staff in Annex III confirms that, while lending standards subsequently
tightened, credit supply was not constrained by the lack of capital and loanable funds. Of
course, the economic downturn triggered by the global crisis has affected bank balance sheets
through deterioration in asset quality, higher loan loss provisions, and reduced profitability.

5
The crisis has encouraged banks to launch capital-raising initiatives in the form of additional
capital from core shareholders, sales of nonstrategic assets, and cuts to dividends. Four banks
also issued government-sponsored recapitalization bonds for a total of less than half the
available amount (€10 billion).
As a result of these efforts, between end-2008 and December 2009, the core Tier 1 ratio of
the largest banking groups increased, on average, from 5.8 percent to 7.2 percent. The
comparison of capital levels should take into consideration the high quality of Italian banks’
capital (at end-2009 core Tier 1 represented, on average, close to 90 percent of Tier 1 capital
for the largest five banks, one of the highest levels in Europe) as well as their more
traditional business profiles than other European banks, as the latter may also have
significant trading and investment arms.
The authorities agree that recapitalization efforts should continue in light of the latest
recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the forthcoming
introduction of more stringent international regulatory standards.
