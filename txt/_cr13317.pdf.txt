STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
September 5, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context: The July 2011 secession of South Sudan led to the buildup of large economic
imbalances in Sudan. The authorities responded in June 2012 with a comprehensive
package of corrective measures, which laid the ground for a much-needed adjustment
process. The reform process was expected to continue in 2013, through a second
package of measures, which the authorities recently put together, but has yet to be
implemented. The March 2013 agreement with South Sudan on oil and security matters
is offering an opportunity to continue the adjustment process by implementing bold
reforms to address the post-secession challenges.
Outlook and risks: Risks are mainly to the downside and risks include domestic political
instability and volatile security conditions, notably tensions at the border with South
Sudan. Strong and steady implementation of reforms is crucial for improving
macroeconomic stability and enhancing medium-term growth prospects.
Focus of the Article IV discussions: Discussions focused on: (i) near-term policies for
restoring macroeconomic stability; and (ii) a medium-term strategy for rebuilding the
economy and implementing policies for sustained and inclusive growth, higher
employment, and poverty reduction.
Policy recommendations: Action is needed on the following fronts: (i) fiscal adjustment
grounded in a sound medium-term framework, including a gradual phase-out of fuel
and wheat subsidies, and strengthening of social safety nets thus making way for higher
quality spending; (ii) a tighter monetary stance to address high inflation and exchange
rate pressures; (iii) unification of the exchange rates and markets together with further
exchange rate flexibility; and (iv) further liberalization of the economy and improvement
in the business environment in order to boost private sector-led growth.
Staff-Monitored Program: Strong corrective policy measures to address the large
economic imbalances and reforming the economy are needed to serve as the basis for a
successor staff-monitored program.
Debt relief: Relief is predicated on reaching out to creditors, normalizing relations with
international financial institutions, and establishing a track record of cooperation with
the IMF on policies and payments.

CONTEXT
1.
The July 2011 secession of South Sudan led to a buildup of large economic imbalances
in Sudan. As a result of this permanent shock,

balances deteriorated (Text Table 1).
2.
The June 2012 package was so far the
authorities’ main policy response in the effort
to tackle the economic imbalances and
engineer a turnaround. Notwithstanding this
package, economic developments during 2012
remained weak reflecting half year implementation
of these measures. Furthermore, the interruption
of the reform process in the context of the 2013
budget somewhat disrupted the adjustment
process, as evidenced by the mixed performance
through the first half of this year. This slow start
brings again to the top of the policy agenda the
need for the authorities to take sustained and bold
policy actions to reestablish macroeconomic
stability, support the needed recovery, and create
the conditions for higher growth and poverty
reduction.

4.
The political situation remains uncertain. The forthcoming presidential elections in 2015,
and regional conflicts are fueling political uncertainty and complicating the economic policy-making
process. The unstable security situation at the border with South Sudan is, at the same time, shifting
the decision makers’ attention away from the economic sphere, and clouding economic prospects.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
A. Recent Developments
5.
Sudan’s economic performance in 2012 was unfavorable, despite the introduction in
June 2012 of a package of reforms (Table 1).3 Non-oil real GDP growth slowed to 4.6 percent,
reflecting a broad-based slowdown in economic activity. Inflation reached 44.4 percent at end-year,
largely driven by the monetization of the fiscal deficit and a weakening exchange rate. The gap
between the official and curb market exchange rates, despite dropping from a peak of almost
100 percent after the June 2012 depreciation, remained at about 20 percent by end-December. The
overall fiscal deficit peaked at 3.8 percent of GDP, mostly on account of a significant fall in oil
revenues in the aftermath of the secession (Table 3). The external current account deficit is
estimated to have reached 10.8 percent of GDP, reflecting the large drop in oil exports, and was
mainly financed by a combination of FDI, grants and loans from official sources (Table 2). Gross
international reserves, supported by loans and grants increased to 1.9 months of prospective
imports.

Economic conditions during the first half of 2013 remained weak despite some signs
of improvements (Text Table 4). The twelve-month consumer price inflation fell to 27.1 percent in
June as a result of a sharp drop in food prices (-18 percent) and housing (-14 percent).4 Fiscal
performance exceeded budget projections on account of an improvement in tax collection as well as
higher imports. Current spending was contained at

Overall, broad money recorded a modest growth
of 7.2 percent. Gross international reserves stood
at US$1.56 billion, a decline of US$134 million from end-December 2012.
7.
Financial sector indicators have improved slightly (Table 8). At June-2013, the capital
adequacy ratio increased to 14.9 percent. At the same time, bank liquidity increased to 39.8 percent,
and bank profitability was also on the rise since the beginning of the year. Data through endJune 2013 suggest that nonperforming loans (NPLs) have dropped to 10.4 percent from
11.8 percent at end-December 2012.

B. Outlook and Risks
8.
The outlook for 2013 will remain
difficult, absent a new package of corrective
measures (Text Table 5). Non-oil economic
growth is expected to slow to 2.3 percent on
account of a slowdown in industrial and service
activities and the shortage of foreign exchange.
Inflation is expected to decelerate somewhat but
will remain high at about 32 percent. However, the
fiscal deficit is projected to be contained at about
2 percent of GDP, mainly reflecting higher transit

fees and the transitional financial arrangement (TFA) inflows expected to take place during the
second half of the year. In contrast, the current account deficit is projected to widen to 11.9 percent
of GDP, reflecting a marked decline in gold exports and a slight increase in imports.
9.
Under current policies, Sudan’s medium-term outlook is unfavorable. Non-oil real GDP
growth would remain below potential at about 3 percent. Consumer price inflation is expected to
decline gradually, although it would still remain in the double-digits, reflecting continued
monetization of the deficit as well as the depreciation of the Sudanese pound.
10.
The outlook is subject to significant risks (Text Table 6). On the downside, domestic risks
dominate, including the protracted economic and political transition shaping up ahead of the 2015
presidential election, and unsettled regional civil conflicts, resulting in weaker growth and higher
inflation. Altogether, these risks are expected to slow economic policy formulation and delay the
adjustment process. Looking ahead, delays in reaching the HIPC Decision Point by September 2014
could activate the apportionment of Sudan’s external debt under the “zero option” arrangement
(see paragraph 48) and could create renewed tensions with South Sudan. Contentious relations with
major donors and creditors, weakening-prospects for debt relief, and deeper-than-expected
slowdown in emerging market countries pose additional risks on the external side. On the upside,
the implementation of the recent agreement with South Sudan on oil-related matters would lessen
the country’s fiscal and external constraints and facilitate the adjustment process.
The Authorities’ Views
11.
The authorities assessed the downside risks somewhat differently. They viewed the
domestic political risk rather on the low side. In contrast, they reckoned that the volatile domestic
social situation, as well as regional developments, are challenges for policy-making. They considered
that the current economic conditions are difficult and require further bold measures to address
macroeconomic imbalances. At the same time, they stressed that Sudan’s challenges are
complicated by delays in receiving debt relief, protracted economic sanctions, and a lack of
international support.



As called for under the recent
agreement, Sudan and South



Fiscal slippages will need to be
addressed through higher revenue
or spending cuts in non priority
areas. Monetary tightening to keep
inflation in check.



Careful monitoring of secondround effects on inflation and
readiness to tighten monetary
policy to counter pressures on core
inflation. Reliance on a welltargeted social safety net to
cushion the impact on poor.
Communication efforts about the
policies in place are needed.



Greater exchange rate flexibility
would help maintain external
stability and prevent reserve losses.
Declining revenue and lack of fiscal
space would likely require procyclical spending cuts. Weakening
commodity prices and the
widening output gap would
facilitate faster disinflation.

Inflation will likely decelerate as a

12.
Recommendations from the 2012 Article IV consultation remain valid. At that time,
Executive Directors recommended: (i) a fiscal adjustment grounded on sound medium-term
framework; (ii) a further monetary tightening against the backdrop of high inflation and exchange
rate pressures; and (iii) unification of the foreign exchange rates, and the pursuit of greater
exchange rate flexibility. In line with these recommendations, the authorities started improving
revenue collection, and took preliminary steps to tighten monetary policy, including putting a ceiling
on government guarantees,5 reducing gold purchase to slow inflation while preparing the grounds
for a shift to reserve money as anchor.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
13.
There was broad consensus on the key challenges ahead. The authorities recognized that
while the June 2012 package had yielded some positive returns, further policy actions are required
to adequately address Sudan’s deep-seated macroeconomic imbalances and support broad-based
and inclusive growth and poverty reduction.
14.
Discussions centered on the government strategy for completing its adjustment
process and transforming the economy in line with the country’s reduced economic and
financial potential following the secession of South Sudan. In particular, discussions focused on
policies to: (i) continue fiscal consolidation; (ii) unify the exchange rates and markets; (iii) enhance
the monetary framework and improve financial intermediation; and (iv) further liberalize the
economy and improve the business environment.

A. Restoring Macroeconomic Stability and Addressing Near-Term
Challenges
15.
The government’s main policy objective in the near-term should be to address the
large economic imbalances. This will require a coordinated three-pronged policy mix:


Rationalizing government spending and improving revenue collection to address the fiscal
imbalances and limit the monetization of the fiscal deficit;



Rapidly unifying the foreign exchange rates and markets, and pursuing a flexible exchange
rate policy to lessen pressure on the exchange rate and build up external reserves; exchange
restrictions, for their part, will need to be removed gradually; and



Tightening credit to the government in line with the adjustment of the fiscal stance, while
improving monetary management by providing commercial banks with appropriate
opportunities to recycle their unused balances with the central bank.

5

These are guarantees provided by the central bank of Sudan (CBOS) to borrowing by the ministry of finance.

SUDAN

Fiscal Policy
16.
The fiscal policy stance underpinned by the 2013 budget lacks adequate measures to
sustain the needed fiscal consolidation path. Progress on this front will require bold tax policy
measures. Sudan’s revenue-to-GDP ratio is very low compared with peers, reflecting in part
exemptions and extensive tax incentives. Improving tax revenue will entail raising some taxes,
streamlining tax exemptions, rationalizing business tax incentives, and taxing gold activities (Box 1).
Tax efforts should be accompanied by revenue administration measures aimed at developing a tax
procedure code, strengthening the audit capacity, reinforcing the penalty procedures for noncompliant taxpayers, and enhancing the business registration process and core operations’ workflow

Box 1. Sudan: Taxations of Gold
A low tax intake. Sudan’s total revenue and tax-to-GDP ratio are very low compared with neighboring
countries. Whereas the average tax revenue of regional peers is around 17 percent of GDP, Sudan only
collected 6.2 percent in 2012. Such a low revenue mobilization limits the fiscal space for ramping up physical
and social infrastructure development that in turn is crucial to sustain economic growth and promote social
fairness.
The gold sector in Sudan. In 2012, the gold sector became Sudan’s most important export earner. Whereas
it accounted for approximately 1 percent of export earnings in 2008, by 2012 its share increased to over
40 percent. Over the medium term, it is projected to contribute about one-third of total exports. While the

Strategy for Reforming Gold Taxation. Currently there are two groups of gold miners in Sudan: the first
consists of the five main gold mining companies1 and the second includes the thousands of small artisanal
miners. Under the current taxation system, while artisanal miners are not taxed, gold mining companies are
subject to a royalty (7 percent), a business profit tax (BPT; 30 percent), and pay a dividend proportional to for
the equity share held by the government. This system of taxations compares favorably to systems in place in
other gold producing countries. However, in the long-term there is a need to:




1

Levy on mining companies a tax with a view to improving progressivity. This will ensure that taxation will
move in line with changes in activity.
Levy a withholding tax on artisanal miners. Unlike the mining companies, it is very difficult and costly to
collect the business profit tax from small traditional miners because most of them are operating in the
remote desert areas of the country. The simplest approach would be to impose a withholding tax, in lieu
of BPT, on the payments to the artisanal miners when they are paid by gold merchants who are licensed
to buy gold from them and sell it to the central bank. The withholding tax rate should be high enough
to approximate the BPT, but not so high as to encourage smuggling.
By the end of this year seven more companies are expected to begin producing gold.

Streamlining spending remains a key priority. In particular, it will be important to contain
non-priority spending (e.g., goods and services), phase out subsidies, and gradually reduce current
transfers to states, while reallocating part of the savings to better targeted social programs and
higher capital spending.
18.
Wage policy should not be used as a social protection tool. The recent announcement by
the government to increase public salaries by about 20 percent could be inflationary, due to its
contagion effects on the rest of the economy and would adversely affect the disinflationary process.
More generally, in order to boost the economy and strengthen competitiveness, the government
needs to promote a wage policy linking wage increases to the economy’s productivity.

The subsidy reform initiated last year should proceed. In 2012, the authorities have taken
a bold decision to increase the price of fuel products (Text Figure 1), and by year-end overall
subsidies were estimated at 2.8 percent of GDP, as follows: (i) fuel subsidies equivalent to
2.1 percent of GDP; (ii) food subsidies representing 0.4 percent of GDP; and (iii) an electricity subsidy
equivalent to 0.3 percent of GDP. Fuel subsidies in Sudan disproportionately benefit the rich: the
bottom quintile of the population receives about 3 percent of the subsidy, whereas the top quintile
receives more than 50 percent (Text Figure 2). Against this background, the phasing of fuel subsidies
should proceed in a gradual fashion over the next four to five years.6
20.
Protection of the poor should be a priority. About 47 of the Sudanese population lives
below the poverty line. 7 Therefore, any further increase in fuel products will negatively impact a
large segment of the population. Therefore, an increase in social expenditures should accompany

the phasing out of subsidies. Over the medium term, the authorities should gradually move from a
broad-based subsidy scheme to a targeted one.

Since the late 1990s, states have become increasingly dependent on central transfers.

basic social services is inadequate.8
22.
Over the medium term, fiscal
consolidation remains key to maintaining macroeconomic stability. To that effect, fiscal policy
should be anchored in a primary surplus, which would ensure a steady and gradual consolidation of
the non oil primary balance. In that respect, it is critical that the 2014 budget sets a fiscally
sustainable path along the lines of the reforms discussed above, namely by: (i) adjusting the
government revenue model; (ii) streamlining non-priority spending; (iii) overhauling state finances;
and (iv) designing a well-targeted social safety net. These reforms are expected to provide a basis
for a sustained medium-term fiscal adjustment with a view to moving towards a primary surplus,
while ensuring a steady consolidation of the non-oil primary balance.
23.
An adequate public financial management framework is critical to strengthening
budget preparation, execution and monitoring. In this context, staff welcomes steps under way
to finalize the Treasury Single Account (TSA) and establish quarterly cash-flow tables. It will be
important to frame the annual budget for 2014 within a rolling three-year medium- term fiscal
framework. Progress in the area of budget reporting and monitoring is predicated on (i) reforming
the financial guarantees that are used to cover government expenditure; (ii) incorporating in the
annual budget all the medium- and long-term domestic debt maturities falling due during the year;9

While modest domestic arrears may materialize from time to time, there is no evidence that such arrears have been

and (iii) the continued implementation and rollout of the global overall financial requirements
(GOFR).10
The Authorities’ Views
24.
The authorities agreed that fiscal consolidation should be at the center of their
strategy to engineer a sustainable economic turnaround. On the revenue side, the authorities
indicated that they are committed to increasing fiscal revenues through a combination of tax hikes,
expanding the tax base, and enhancing revenue administration. On the spending side, they
indicated that they intend to continue phasing out fuel subsidies, which will be accompanied by a
coherent social safety net program to protect the most vulnerable segments of the population. They
also concurred with staff that it is crucial to streamline transfers to states, which they indicated will
need to be implemented through a progressive approach, as it requires revisiting the legal and
constitutional framework that governs state finances.
25.
The authorities indicated that they intend to take the appropriate measures to
improve public financial management. They reported that progress was being made regarding
the TSA as well as on building quarterly cash flow tables. They agreed to a comprehensive budget
reporting by including all the medium- and long- term domestic debt maturities falling due during
the year. They requested technical assistance to introduce a three-year rolling medium-term budget
and the GOFR.
Enhancing the Monetary Policy Framework
26.
Monetary conditions in Sudan have weakened noticeably since the secession of South
Sudan. This reflects the increased monetization of the budget deficit, which has led to high inflation
and commercial banks holding excess reserves at the central bank. Accordingly, the authorities need
to refocus the objective of monetary policy on combating inflation. This is predicated on: (i)
tightening Central Bank of Sudan (CBOS) credit to the government so as not to exceed the ceiling of
SDG 2.5 billion for the year; (ii) mopping up excess reserves; (iii) reimbursing, by year-end, the CBOS
temporary advances provided to the government in the first half of the year, and refraining from
rescheduling them; (iv) phasing out the practice of holding government deposits with commercial
banks and placing them with CBOS instead; (v) minimizing the provision of credit to public
enterprises until an interbank market is in place;11 and (vi) refraining from acquiring Government
Musharaka Certificates (GMCs) in the primary market.
27.
The use of reserve money as an anchor will help strengthen the monetary policy
framework (Box 2). In support of this practice, the authorities need to: (i) closely coordinate
10

The GOFR will include: (i) the overall fiscal balance; (ii) the cash payment for the amortization of the external debt;
(iii) the amortization of the GMC’s maturities falling due; and (iv) the amortization of the medium- and long-term
domestic debt falling due.

In 2012, the Central Bank of Sudan expanded provision of loans to public enterprises.

monetary policy with fiscal policy to make room for more credit to the private sector; (ii) promote an
inter-bank market of GMCs and Government Investment Certificates (GICs), with no cap on
commercial banks’ holdings of government and central bank securities; (iii) expand the auction
system to provide commercial banks with the opportunity to recycle their unused cash balances;
(iv) discontinue the practice of direct and subsidized credits; (v) gradually withdraw CBOS from the
gold activities; and (vi) discontinuing the provision of guarantees by the CBOS to the government.
The Authorities’ Views
28.
The authorities were in broad agreement with staff on the need for a refocusing of
monetary policy. They agreed that monetary policy should cease to be accommodative. To that
effect, they indicated that they have: (i) established a ceiling on the provision of guarantees to the
government; (ii) committed to limit credit to the government within the legally established ceiling;
and (iii) slowed down gold purchases. They are confident that these bold new measures are crucial
to bring down inflation. They are also in full agreement on using reserve money as the monetary
anchor in order to strengthen the traction of monetary policy and contain inflationary pressures.

Box 2. Sudan: Monetary Policy Transmission Mechanism
Sudan’s monetary policy framework lacks adequate instruments for monetary operations, liquidity
management, and non-inflationary financing of government deficits. Money supply is regulated through
quantitative control by fixing ad hoc credit ceilings, and imposing high unremunerated reserve requirements,
which has not proven to be very ineffective. Furthermore, the absence of an active interbank market has led to
large excess reserves and a loss of monetary control by the CBOS. The lack of adequate monetary instruments has
led to high intermediation costs and persistent inflationary pressures. Lastly, the recourse to multiple exchange
rates raises the need for another anchor for monetary policy.
Monetization of the rising fiscal deficits has further
undermined the effectiveness of monetary policy, particularly
after the secession of South Sudan. The rising fiscal deficit
following the secession of South Sudan has been mostly financed
by the CBOS (Box Figure 1), resulting in rapid monetary expansion
that reached 40 percent at end of 2012. The sharp increase in net
credit to the government exceeded the statutory limit of SDG
1.5 billion and fueled inflation which reached a peak of
47.8 percent in March 2013, nearing hyperinflation. As a result, the
central bank’s independence has significantly weakened, thus
undermining its ability to ensure price stability.

and private sector credit are the main determinants of inflation after the secession of South Sudan and that the

reinforce the need for a comprehensive package of fiscal and monetary measures that strengthens the monetary

As inflation is known to have downward stickiness due to rigidities in labor market, i.e., “inflation inertia,” a deflationary
monetary policy is expected to take longer period to have the desired impact on reducing inflation.

Further Exchange Rate Flexibility
29.
Greater exchange rate flexibility is warranted in order to cushion against shocks and
mitigate external imbalances. Notwithstanding the June 2012 devaluation, which reversed a major
part of the overvaluation, the exchange rate remains overvalued and the gap between the official
and curb market rates remains stubbornly high at about 20 percent (Box 3). The authorities are,
therefore, encouraged to limit market intervention to smoothing excessive exchange rate volatility,
without hampering the underlying trend in the exchange rate. Over the long term, greater exchange
rate flexibility will be even more important as non-oil exports become more diversified.
30.
More efforts are needed to unify the four foreign exchange rates currently in effect.12
This will require: (i) eliminating the subsidized wheat and fuel exchange rates; (ii) introducing a
unique reference rate at a level consistent with the current market conditions, which would also be
used as a central rate; (iii) allowing commercial banks and exchange bureaux to set the exchange
rates to reflect prevailing market conditions; and (iv) ensuring that only authorized banks and
dealers participate in the foreign exchange market.
31.
The operations of the foreign exchange market need to be improved. This will require
improving the mechanism for intervention and creating an interbank foreign exchange market,
including the steps and sequencing, the organization of the market itself, and the role of the
commercial banks.

12

These rates are as follows: (i) a central rate of SDG 4.42 per U.S. dollar that applies also to the importation of fuel
products, the payment of government obligations, and valuation assessment at customs; (ii) a subsidized rate for
wheat of SDG 2.9 per U.S. dollar; (iii) a gold exchange rate used by the central bank in its gold transactions, which is
in line with the curb market rate; and (iv) a commercial bank rates that applies to all other transactions.

Box 3. Sudan: External Stability Assessment
Sudan’s external stability continues to be at risk. The
loss of oil exports and FDI after the secession of South
Sudan in mid-2011 resulted in a structural BOP shift
that exacerbated long-standing vulnerabilities and
created permanent adjustment needs. The moderate
substitution of gold for oil exports has not changed the
dependence on natural resources and some key trading
partners. It is thus crucial for Sudan to further develop
and diversify its export base, alleviate financing
constraints and allow for more exchange rate flexibility.
Price competitiveness. Five available exchange rate
surveillance indicators suggest that the June 2012
devaluation and reforms have not significantly reduced
1
the overvaluation of the SDG:
(i)Current account dynamics have worsened;
(ii) The curb rate has become the main indicator and
its gap to official rates remains in double-digits (Box
Figure 1);
(iii) The devaluation-induced depreciation of the REER
has recently almost fully been reversed, while the NEER
remains on a depreciating path (Box Figure 2);
(iv) Reserves have suffered because of protracted
exchange market interventions in one direction (Box
Figure 3); and
(v) Growing external arrears add to an already
unsustainable external public debt burden.

SUDAN

The Authorities’ Views
32.
The authorities were in broad agreement regarding the need to unify the exchange
rates but disagreed with staff on the pace. They plan to unify the wheat, oil, and customs rates
and will allow a commercial bank rate around a +/- 4 percent band. They felt that a gradual
approach is more appropriate to accompany the phasing out of subsidies, which is expected to
significantly affect prices. They also agree with staff on the need to allow further exchange rate
flexibility to enhance external competitiveness and to build up reserves. They concurred with staff
that the foreign exchange market should be modernized and requested to that effect, technical
assistance from the Fund.
Financial Intermediation and Stability
33.
The financial system in Sudan fully operates under Islamic principles, and, as in many
other low income countries (LICs), is dominated by the banking sector (Box 4). Commercial
banks represent about 97 percent of the financial system, based on total assets. Insurance
companies account for virtually all of the remainder although there is a small microfinance sector.
There is effectively no interbank funding market.
34.
The banking system is weaker than its peers in sub-Sahara Africa. Capital asset ratios are
generally below the required 12 percent, NPLs are high while provisioning is low, although both
have been on improving trends over the past five years. Some of the weaknesses in bank
supervision, inspection and enforcement identified by the 2005 FSAP remain. Sudan’s AML/CFT
framework is currently monitored by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) due to serious
deficiencies. These deficiencies are being addressed on the basis of an action plan agreed with FATF.
35.
The authorities are extremely keen to deepen financial intermediation. Commercial
bank credit to the private sector has increased by an annual average of about 21 percent a year over
the past three years, reflecting increased liquidity in the banking sector, and large current transfers.
However, at about 12.1 percent of GDP at end-2012, credit to the private sector stands below the
average for LICs (Text Table 7). This gap reflects a broad range of factors, including the secession of
South Sudan, bank concentration around the capital city (which leaves much of the country underbanked), outdated legal, regulatory, and institutional frameworks, and recent restrictions on Foreign
Exchange operations introduced by CBOS. It is crucial to strengthen financial intermediation to
support the growth agenda.
36.
Recently the authorities have made a number of moves to broaden access to banking
services. These include, simplifying the procedures for opening bank accounts, encouraging banks
to open new branches and expand ATM networks, and setting up a credit registry.
37.
Equity trading on the Khartoum Stock Exchange (KSE) is thin, and it suffers from weak
corporate governance, poor regulation, and a lack of corporate transparency. Plus, government
securities dominate trading, and what little equity trading that occurs is dominated by one firm.
There is currently no legislative and regulatory framework for the securities market, nor are there

SUDAN

institutions to implement it. Furthermore, the KSE is self-regulated under laws that have not been
amended since 1994.
38.
The microfinance sector (MF) is still small relative to the needs, although the
authorities are actively promoting its development and it has recently started to grow rapidly.
The number of CBOS-regulated MF institutions went from zero in 2007 to 18 at end-2012, and over
the same period, the number of borrowers went from 49,000 to 494,000. However, one of the
factors that may slow further growth is that MF institutions depend on wholesale funding, for which
they have to compete with high-yielding Government Musharaka Certificates (GMCs).

Box 4. Sudan: Banking Sector Soundness and Development
Sudan was selected to be one of the pilot cases for enhancing surveillance of financial systems called for by
Executive Board in May 2012 (FO/DIS/12/66).1 The Board discussion found that a shallow and undiversified
financial sector creates macro-financial vulnerabilities that affect the macro economy, and its ability to
sustain growth and reduce poverty. The main policy recommendations suggested by this exercise are as
follows:
The central bank should continue its good progress in moving towards best practice in bank supervision,
inspection and enforcement, with the assistance of the IMF’s Middle East Regional Technical Assistance
Center (METAC).
The authorities should put in place an up to date legislative and regulatory framework for the securities
market, and institutions to implement it, based on the IOSCO Objectives and Principles for Securities
Regulation.
1

To date, Benin, Ghana, Haiti, Senegal, and the West African Economic and Monetary Union have been included as pilot
cases.

The Authorities’ Views
39.
The authorities were appreciative of Sudan’s inclusion in the pilot exercise. They were
in broad agreement with the staff‘s assessment of the financial sector. They recognized that further
progress is needed to enhance financial deepening and broaden access to banking services,
together with structural reforms in support of private sector investment. The key challenge was
deciding on the appropriate sequencing of reforms. They also agreed with the recommendation to
upgrade supervision and compliance in line with prudential norms. They welcomed technical
assistance from the Fund in this regard. In addition, they pointed out that new securities market
legislation is currently working its way through the system that will rectify deficiencies identified by
the pilot exercise.
40.
They also pointed out that they have made good progress in putting in place many of
the banking sector regulatory reforms called for in the 2004 FSAP. This included requiring banks
to significantly increase their paid-up capital, and setting up a dedicated financial stability unit in the
CBOS.
Reforms and Revised Policies Outcome
41.
The implementation of the reforms outlined above could significantly improve the
outlook and pave the way for an agreement with staff on a successor staff-monitored
program (SMP) (Text Table 8). Non-oil GDP growth would pick up and average about 5 percent.
Inflation would gradually come down to single digits as a result of a steady improvement in the
fiscal position. The primary surplus is projected to be at about 2.5 percent of GDP on average. The
current account deficit would be contained at about 5 percent of GDP.

The envisaged adjustment path is an overarching policy priority. Although the program
may encounter social and political resistance, the pursuit of current policies would widen current
imbalances and jeopardize social stability. Successful implementation of the reform strategy would
require consensus and ownership. In this context, staff encouraged the authorities to adopt a clear
and sustained communication strategy to explain their reform agenda and ensure broad support
among various stakeholders.
The Authorities’ Views
43.
The authorities recognized that unforeseen regional and domestic political and
security factors have so far unduly delayed the adoption of a package of corrective reforms.
They recognize that further delays in containing inflationary pressures will continue to erode the
purchasing power of the population and ultimately could result in social unrest. They indicated that
they have just finalized a comprehensive package of corrective measures, which benefited
extensively from consultation with various stakeholders, and has the backing of the political
leadership (Text table 9). However, its implementation awaits appropriate timing, most likely in the
fall. They also reiterated their interest in a successor SMP to reestablish a track record of
cooperation with the Fund on policies and payments, which in due time could pave the way for debt
relief.

B. A Strategy for Sustainable and Inclusive Growth
Over the medium term, the challenge remains to rebuild the economy and implement a strategy for
sustained and inclusive growth, higher employment, and poverty reduction.
44.
Sudan’s economy needs to adjust to the reduced economic and financial potential
caused by the secession of South Sudan, and needs to increase investment and productivity.
Due in part to the absence of debt relief and the current economic sanctions, Sudan performs below
its growth potential. Appropriate policies in this context need to rely on domestic resources to
create the conditions for broad-based and inclusive growth, higher employment, and reduced
poverty. These conditions could be achieved through: (i) better-targeted investment projects and
promotion of export activities of goods with a higher value added, notably in the agricultural sector;
(ii) progress toward closer integration with South Sudan and other regional partners by facilitating
cross-border transfers, harmonizing payment and settlement systems, and encouraging operations
of bank branches or subsidiaries; and (iii) a stepped-up pace to reform the business environment,
including facilitating cross-border trading, accelerating financial sector development, expanding the
KSE, investing in infrastructure to reduce the costs of production and distribution, and improving
governance. The strengthening of anti-corruption efforts, including by mobilizing existing AML
tools, would also help improve the business climate.
45.
Efforts to increase employment need to be accelerated. With total unemployment
standing at about 20 percent, and mostly affecting youth and women, it is important to: (i) explore
fiscal, institutional, and legal actions to encourage the creation of an integrated network of laborintensive small- and medium-sized enterprises in sectors with growth potential; and (ii) develop
programs for job training.
46.
Coherent social policies will need to be an essential complement to raising growth
prospects of the economy, increasing its resilience, and combating poverty. Building the
economy’s prospects would require putting a comprehensive social safety net, with support from
the donors, which can enhance the efficiency of social spending. It may be useful in this context to
examine the feasibility of food programs and fee waivers in the health and education sectors, and of
public work programs in rural areas. Helping the poor through the community-based network
overseen by the Zakat Chamber is also an important possible avenue to assess.
The Authorities’ Views
47.
The authorities agreed with the need for an overall strategy to accelerate structural
reforms. They indicated that their 2011 three-year emergency program envisages several reforms
that will help revive the non-oil economy, particularly the agricultural sector. They also attached
particular importance to improving project management to enhance the efficiency of public
investment, and welcomed technical assistance in this area. They also look forward to completing a
plan to identify export production chains. They stressed their commitment to more social protection
and saw ample space to strengthen the current mechanisms. They indicated that the focus on social
policies will translate into more resources for priority areas, starting with the 2014 budget.

SUDAN

EXTERNAL DEBT ISSUES
48.
Sudan remains in debt distress with an external debt at end-2012 estimated at
US$43 billion, about 85 percent of which is in arrears. An update to the debt sustainability
analysis (DSA) based on the joint IMF–WB debt sustainability framework and discussed with the
authorities indicates that at end-2012, all debt ratios exceed their indicative policy-dependent
thresholds and stay beyond the threshold through the long-term, except for the debt service-torevenue ratio. Arrears clearance and debt relief will be needed to bring Sudan’s external debt to a
sustainable level and to gain access to external financing. Staff strongly recommended to the
authorities to: (i) reach out to their creditors in order to gain broad support for debt relief;
(ii) normalize relations with IFIs; and (iii) reestablish a track record of cooperation with the IMF on
policies and payments.
49.
Sudan’s arrears to the Fund totalled SDR 982.6 million at end-June. Staff welcomed the
payments made so far in 2013 totalling SDR 2.3 million against obligations falling due of
SDR 1.0 million. Staff strongly encourages the authorities to continue making payments to the Fund,
to make them on a regular basis, and to increase them, as their payment capacity improves.
50.
The non-resolution of Sudan’s debt is poised to create tensions with South Sudan
under the “zero option”. Prior to the secession, Sudan and South Sudan agreed on the zero option
under which Sudan would retain the entire external debt, provided that: (i) South Sudan joined
Sudan in outreach efforts for debt relief for Sudan; and (ii) the international community gave firm
commitments to the delivery of debt relief within two years. Absent such a commitment, Sudan’s
external debt would be apportioned based on a formula to be determined.13 As part of the
September 2012 discussions that led to the resumption of oil shipments and associated oil-relatedpayments, the beginning of the two-year period was reset, implying a deadline of September 2014.
However, agreement on any debt apportionment may prove to be very difficult because it would
likely require extensive negotiations between Sudan and South Sudan, as well as a consensus view
from Sudan’s entire pool of creditors. Staff encouraged the authorities to work closely with South
Sudan on reaching out to creditors and donors to: (i) mobilize support in favor of debt relief; and
(ii) encourage them to finance South Sudan’s development needs.
51.
Minimizing non-concessional borrowing is essential to restoring external stability.
Non-concessional borrowing—which in most cases is associated with specific productive investment
projects—represents the major source of financing for Sudan whose access to international financial
assistance remains very limited.14 Staff pointed that any new borrowing would eventually need to be
treated as part of any comprehensive debt relief workout that would restore Sudan to a sustainable
level of external debt. Staff underscored the need to use such resources to finance priority

13

In this case Sudan will retain IMF debt.

Sudan’s nonconcessional borrowing during the first half of 2013 amounted to US$277 million.

24

investment with positive returns. In this vein, staff strongly recommended upgrading the project
management framework to address current weaknesses in selection, execution and reporting.
The Authorities’ Views
52.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment and advice. They continued to
express frustration about the slow progress towards debt relief, which they consider as being elusive
despite having satisfied key technical requirements, including a long track record of economic
performance with the IMF, a finalized I-PRSP, and a reconciliation of their external debt stock. They
remained, however, determined to step up their efforts for a wider outreach to creditors, with the
goal of gaining commitment for debt relief and thereby avoiding the activation of the “zero option”
clause, which in their view may generate unnecessary tensions with South Sudan. They noted that
they were seeking non concessional support given that it is their only source of financing.

ARTICLE VIII ISSUES
53.
Sudan has put in place an exchange rate regime, as well as measures to restrict access
to foreign exchange, that have been determined to give rise to exchange restrictions and
multiple currency practices (MCPs), which are subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII of
the IMF’s Articles of Agreement. These measures include, in particular, an exchange rate regime
with multiple effective rates, and a policy of rationing of foreign exchange and its allocation to
certain sectors, such that foreign exchange is limited for other current international transactions
(e.g., payments for imports and the transfer of profits and revenues abroad). Staff indicated that
such measures are not helping Sudan’s economy to face shocks, attract foreign investment, improve
resource allocation, or enhance external competitiveness. Staff has completed its jurisdictional
review of these measures and has presented the authorities with recommendations on steps that
could be taken to eliminate these measures, to the extent they are subject to Fund jurisdiction under
Article VIII. A detailed overview of the exchange restrictions and MCPs is set forth in the
Informational Annex to this report.
The Authorities’ Views
54.
The authorities indicated that the multiple currency practices and exchange
restrictions were largely due to the secession of South Sudan, as a result of which they lost
¾ of their oil production, two-thirds of their external payment capacity and more than half of
their fiscal revenues. With CBOS ability to meet all the foreign exchange demand constrained, it
had to impose temporary restrictions for balance of payments reasons and engage in multiple
currency practices for strategic priority needs.15 They indicated that although the economic
conditions in Sudan remain unstable, the CBOS intends to gradually remove the exchange

15

See footnote 12.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

SUDAN

restrictions following the unification of the exchanges rates, which they indicate will take place
in 2014.

OTHER ISSUES
55.
The authorities have completed the Interim-Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP).
This I-PRSP provides an integrated framework of policies aimed at accelerating poverty reduction in
Sudan. Staff urges the authorities to promptly implement those short-term policies as well as to
continue to build the track record of implementation of its medium-term poverty reduction strategy.
Progress in this context will be assessed periodically.
56.
Sudan’s current statistical data base is broadly adequate for surveillance and program
monitoring but needs further improvements. Staff urged the authorities to take action aimed to
address: (i) data gaps in national accounts, balance of payments and social and labor market
indicators caused by capacity constraints; and (ii) the statistical changes arising from the impact of
the South’s secession. An action plan is being developed by the authorities. Staff reiterated IMF
availability to provide technical assistance to help in these areas.

STAFF APPRAISAL
57.
Sudan’ economy has been facing major pressures since the July 2011 secession of
South Sudan and current policies need to be strengthened for stabilizing the economy and
guarding against downside risks. Economic growth is low, inflation remains very high and largely
driven by the monetization of the fiscal deficit, the gap between the official and curb market
exchange rates continues unabated, and the external current account deficit is widening.
58.
The recent agreement with South Sudan on oil provides a unique opportunity to
implement bold corrective policies. Given that access to external assistance is limited, the
Sudanese authorities have little option but to significantly tighten macroeconomic policies. Staff
urges the authorities to act swiftly and implement their reform package to reverse the downside
trend and create the conditions for a successor staff-monitored program. Looking forward, staff
encourages the authorities to seize the opportunity of the 2014 budget to continue the required
fiscal consolidation path before the country enters the presidential election year in 2015.
59.
Addressing current fiscal imbalances is crucial. While most of the adjustment effort will
need to focus on reducing government expenditures, notably subsidies, tax revenues will also need
to be increased. On the revenue side, this will require implementing tax policy measures, including
taxing gold activities, and strengthening revenue administration by streamlining tax exemptions and
rationalizing tax incentives. On the spending side, there is a need to streamline non priority
spending, including the phasing out of subsidies and the reduction in transfers to states. In parallel,
it is important to strengthen social safety nets, while refraining from using the wage bill as a social
protection tool

26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SUDAN

60.
Monetary policy should be geared toward combating inflation while CBOS
independence should be enhanced. The current monetary policy framework is hampered by fiscal
dominance and reliance on central bank financing of the budget deficit which is fueling inflation.
Containing inflation will necessitate a clear central bank mandate for operational independence and
accountability with a view to containing and reducing the monetization of the deficit. It will also
require the elimination of the cap on commercial banks’ holdings of government and central bank
securities. In view of the strong correlation between reserve money and inflation, the monetary
policy framework can be improved by focusing on reserve money as the nominal anchor. To restore
the monetary transmission mechanism, staff advises CBOS to mop up excess reserves, and to
provide the commercial banks with the appropriate opportunities to recycle any unused deposit
liabilities once aggregate excess reserves have been mopped up..
61.
Immediate unification of existing official exchange rates together with greater
exchange rate flexibility is crucial to facilitate the required adjustment as well as safeguard
and rebuild foreign exchange reserves. Continued foreign exchange intervention and the
introduction of exchange restrictions will not address the underlying problem of excess demand for
foreign exchange, and should be avoided. Staff welcomes the authorities’ move towards the
elimination of the exchange restrictions and the multiple currency practices. In the interim, the
authorities are requesting approval of these measures. Given that these measures are temporary,
non-discriminatory and adopted for balance of payments reasons, staff recommends the approval of
these restrictions and multiple currency practices.
62.
Further progress is needed to enhance financial intermediation. A broader access to
banking services will help support growth and reduce poverty. Other reforms should aim at
upgrading banking supervision and compliance to best practice standards, as well as the regulatory
frameworks of insurance and security markets.
63.
There is a need for bold structural reforms to lift growth prospects and help address
the challenges facing Sudan. The agenda should focus on improving revenue administration and
public financial management, and enhancing the monetary policy framework. It will be also
important to step up the pace to reform the business environment, notably strengthening financial
intermediation, facilitating cross-border trading, and improving governance and strengthen anticorruption efforts.
64.
Staff welcomes the completion of the I-PRSP. The latter offers a vehicle for implementing
coherent macroeconomic and structural reforms to lift growth prospects and make indent in
poverty. The participatory process for the I-PRSP was encouraging. Staff encourages the authorities
to strengthen it for the full PRSP.
65.
Sudan is in debt distress and the huge volume of arrears continues to hinder the
country’s access to external financing. Staff strongly encourages the authorities to reach out to
their creditors to elicit their support for debt relief. Staff recommends limiting non concessional
borrowing. In the meantime, closer cooperation with the Fund on policies and payments is crucial to
reestablishing a track record.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

27

SUDAN

66.
The support of the international community is crucial to the success of Sudan’s reform
strategy. A lack of support could jeopardize the adjustment process, create social tensions, and
hinder poverty reduction. Staff encourages Sudan to jointly reach out with South Sudan to the
international community to elicit support for debt relief and avoid triggering the “zero option” in
September 2014. Such an outcome could complicate relations with South Sudan. In the meantime,
the authorities’ implementation of sound economic policies is vital for domestic stability as well as
for mobilization of international support and debt resolution.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Sudan takes place on the standard 12month cycle.

Exchange Rate Arrangement
The legal tender is the Sudanese guinea, which replaced the Sudanese dinar in proportion
SDG 1=SDD 100 in mid-2007. Sudan has a de jure managed floating and a de facto other managed
exchange rate regime. Sudan continues to maintain a exchange restriction and multiple currency
practices (MCP) arising from the cash margin requirement for imports, whereas the previously
identified exchange restriction arising from the imposition of the absolute ceiling on foreign
exchange for travels has been removed.
Staff has identified the following new exchange restrictions and MCPs subject to IMF jurisdiction
under Article VIII: 1) an exchange restriction arising from the government’s limitations on the
availability of foreign exchange and the CBOS’ allocation of foreign exchange to certain priority
items; 2) an exchange restriction arising from a tax certification requirement in respect of transfers
abroad of profits generated by enterprises other than joint stock companies; 3) a MCP arising from
the establishment by the government of a system of multiple exchange rates used for official and
commercial transactions, which gives rise to effective exchange rates that deviate by more than
2 percent; 4) a MCP and exchange restriction arising from the channeling of market participants to
the parallel market due to the CBOS’ establishment of exchange rates that do not reflect market
conditions and the limitations on availability of foreign exchange; and 5) an exchange restriction and
a multiple currency practice arising from the imposition by the government of a cash margin
requirement for most imports.
Sudan is on a 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation discussion was concluded
by the Executive Board on September 21, 2012.

FSAP Participation
The FSAP work took place during October 9–14, 2004 and was completed during
December 1–14, 2004. The Financial System Stability Assessment report was discussed by the
Executive Board on April 29, 2005.

Resident Representative
The Fund’s resident representative office in Khartoum was opened in October 2005, as a shared post
with Djibouti. It was converted to a full post in September 2006.

Technical Assistance
In January 1995, the Executive Board decided to resume Fund technical assistance to Sudan. The
following table contains a summary of the technical assistance provided since 2004. This assistance
has been provided both from headquarters and from the IMF’s Middle East Technical Assistance
Center (METAC).

SUDAN

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(As of July 31, 2013)
1.
The World Bank’s International Development Association (IDA) has no active lending
portfolio in Sudan because of the country’s default on its financial obligations to IDA, which led to
the suspension of disbursements in April 1993. After discussions between the World Bank and the
Sudanese authorities on the need for Sudan to take steps toward normalizing its relations and
establishing a track record with the World Bank, the authorities made small, intermittent debt
service payments between mid-1999 and 2008. The amount of payments has not been sufficient to
prevent a continued accumulation of arrears, which currently stand at about US$715.7 million and
are growing.
2.
The World Bank was a major player in the reconstruction of Sudan following the Addis
Ababa peace agreement of 1972, but was mostly absent from Sudan between 1993 and 2002. As the
prospects for peace with the South rose in 2003, the World Bank formulated a strategy for a
potential reengagement. Following the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) on
January 9, 2005 by the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement, the
World Bank became the administrator for two large Multi-Donor Trust Funds (MDTFs) that support
the CPA, and built up its program of non-lending support. Fifteen MDTF partners1 have contributed
US$790 million in paid-in funds to the MDTFs. MDTF-supported projects initially experienced
implementation challenges, as have all development and recovery programs in Sudan, but
performance has steadily improved. Significant results are being seen on the ground, including the
successful MDTF-supported launch of the CPA-mandated new national currency and the completion
of the 5th Population Census, though daunting challenges remain—most notably low capacity,
especially at the state level and in the South. The MDTF will close at the end of 2012 and a successor
arrangement is currently being discussed with international partners.
3.
A new World Bank’s Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for Sudan will be discussed by the World
Bank’s Board in September 2013. The ISN aims to support the Government of Sudan to achieve the
overarching goal of shared growth and institutional reform that provides economic opportunities
and reduces conflict. The Bank will focus on supporting activities that accelerate growth and expand
sources of growth, ensure equitable distribution of resources and access to services, and respond
urgently to opportunities to consolidate peace in areas emerging from conflict. The Bank will
support Sudan through carefully selected knowledge products and projects financed through
partnership funds and structured across two pillars: (1) Manage the Economic Transition, and
(2) Address Socio-economic Roots of Conflict.

1

Partners having paid in funds to the MDTFs are: Netherlands, Norway, United Kingdom, European Commission,
Canada, Sweden, Germany, Finland, Spain, Denmark, Italy, Egypt, Iceland, Greece, and the World Bank. The World
Bank contributed (from IBRD surplus) US$5 million to each of the MDTFs.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SUDAN

4.
The entry points for World Bank support—through management of the MDTF and other
partnership funds as well as non-lending activities—vary according to the diverse conditions facing
different regions of Sudan. At the National level, a focus on managing the transition and stabilizing
peace entails a major role for analytical work and policy dialogue in support of the recently
published Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy of the Government of Sudan which focuses to a large
extent on activities to promote economic diversification through a vibrant private sector. In Darfur,
the World Bank works with partners, as security allows, to assess development and recovery needs
and to prepare rehabilitation and development programs to be implemented as soon as conditions
are right.
5.
IDA’s financial reengagement requires clearance of Sudan’s outstanding arrears. The
clearance of these arrears can only be undertaken once a firm and comprehensive agreement
among preferred creditors is in place. Such an agreement would also include significant reductions
in bilateral debts, so as to make the total debt service obligations sustainable. Following the
eventual clearance of IDA arrears, an exceptional IDA allocation for Sudan as a post-conflict country
would be sought, and the World Bank would prepare another strategy document which would
include, inter alia, a pipeline of projects. The World Bank, together with the IMF supports the
technical preparation of Sudan for a debt relief process through the Technical Working Group on
Sudan’s External Debt, which met 6 times between 2011 and 2013 and brings together major
bilateral and multilateral creditors of Sudan.
6.
The World Bank has completed a series of major non-lending products since the CPA
in 2005, including a National Public Expenditure Review in 2007, a Diagnostic Trade Integration
Study (on behalf of its Integrated Framework partners) in 2008, a Country Economic Memorandum
in 2009, a Country Integrated Fiduciary Assessment in 2011 and a Sub-National Public Expenditure
Review in 2013. Other major sector works include an Investment Climate Assessment in 2010 and
Education and Health Status Reports in 2011 and 2012. Major non-lending products planned to be
completed and delivered by the end of calendar year 2014 are: A new Country Economic
Memorandum focusing on economic diversification, an Update to the 2008 Diagnostic Trade
Integration Study, Promoting Private Sector Revitalization in Darfur, and Financial Sector Capacity
Building with a focus on financial inclusion.
7.
To enrich this menu of policy and analytical support, the World Bank will seek to deepen
dialogue—and open up space for civil society participation in such dialogue—in areas such as:
managing the economic transition; making fiscal decentralization work; promoting economic
diversification; and local area development.

RELATIONS WITH THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of June 30, 2013)

Group’s Portfolio and Arrears
1.
Since its first intervention in 1971 in Sudan, the Bank Group (AfDB) has approved to date 41
operations amounting to a total net commitment of UA296 million.1 The Bank also approved grants
for emergency assistance under the Special Relief Fund in 2001, 2003, 2010 and 2013 amounting to
a total of US$3.0 million. The most recent is the Emergency Relief to Blue and White Nile States
approved in June 2013 financed with US$1 million from the Emergency Relief Fund (ERF). In terms of
sector distribution, the portfolio is dominated by agriculture (54percent), followed by infrastructure
(28.6 percent), multi sector (8.9 percent), finance (6 percent) and social sectors (2.5 percent).
2.
The Bank ongoing operations include the Institutional Capacity Building for Poverty
Reduction and Good Governance Project (ICBPRGGP), approved in March 2007 for US$15 million in
the form of a grant. Expected to be closed by March-2013, a major accomplishment of the
ICBPRGGP was the completion in 2010 of the Sudan Baseline Household Survey (NBHS) for both the
North and the South, which was instrumental in the subsequent preparation of the Interim Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) for Sudan and National Development Plan for South Sudan.
Other ongoing operations include the Darfur Water Project for Conflict Resolution and Peace
Building which was approved in April 2012 and is financed by Euro 3.3 Million from the African
Water Facility (AWF). This project will rehabilitate and construct water infrastructure in Darfur and
demonstrate an integrated approached to water development. Under the Fragile State Facility (FSF)
the ongoing projects include Capacity Enhancement for Debt Management and Resource
Mobilization (CEDMRM) approved in May 2012 for UA 1.05 Million, and Technical Assistance to
Policy Dialogue on Arrears Clearance and Debt Relief (PDAC) which was approved in February 2013
for US$75,000. CEDMRM will build institutional and human capacities in Debt Units and other
departments in the Ministry of Finance and National Economy (MoFNE), and Central Bank of Sudan,
while PDAC will advance dialogue on external debt. Also as part of FSF, the Bank, in June 2013,
approved Technical Assistance and Capacity Building for a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP)
for UA 1.9 Million. Sudan has also been able to access competitive Bilateral Trust Fund financing for
notable projects including, Technical Assistance to Mamoun Beheiry Centre approved in
August 2012 for US$260,500 which aims to improve the quality of policy analysis and policy
dialogue currently in Sudan, and the Capacity Building and Assessment of Options for Increasing
Access to Energy in Sudan Project approved in October 2012 for US$340,500. The project intends to
identify and map out energy poverty in Sudan. In addition, a grant to support the University of
Nyala (Darfur) to undertake a study on Scientific Adaptation of Livestock Breeds to Climate Change
was approved in May 2013 for US$497,000.

3.
The AfDB has not been in a position of undertaking much needed full-fledged regular
investment activities in the country since 1995 because of arrears. As at end-June 2013, the arrears
to the Bank Group stood at UA 198.6 million, of which UA 83.5 million is from the African
Development Fund (ADF) window and UA 115.1 from the African Development Bank (ADB).

Strategy and Programming
4.
The Bank has maintained field presence and sustained policy dialogue with the Government
of Sudan and Development Partners. It has conducted technical assistance and capacity building
activities, using grant resources that are not affected by the arrears situation of the country.
5.
Given the arrears situation of Sudan, the Country Brief serves as the appropriate
programming document. The last Country Brief was approved in October 2012 covering the
period 2012–2014. It is aligned with the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper 2011–2013 and
the National Development Plan 2012–2016. Under ADF-12 (2011–2013), Sudan is eligible to
resources of the Supplemental Support Window (Pillar 1) of the Fragile State Facility (FSF) and the
Performance-based Country Allocation, but conditional upon arrears clearance. Sudan has
benefitted from resources of the Pillar 3 of the FSF (targeted support for capacity building and
knowledge management).
6.
In the last couple of years, the Bank’s strategic engagement with Sudan has focused on:
(i) accelerating a peaceful settlement of critical post-referendum economic issues with South-Sudan,
by providing technical assistance to the African Union High-Level Implementation Panel (AUHIP);
(ii) technical assistance, capacity building and donor coordination aimed at accelerating the process
arrears clearance and debt relief for the reengagement of Sudan with the international community;
and (iii) sustaining dialogue and conducting analytical work to prepare the ground for effective fullfledged support in addressing the development challenges of Sudan.
7.
In this context, progress was made on a number of issues and initiatives, including:
(i) Participations in meetings of the Technical Working Group; (ii) the Debt Sustainability Analysis
workshop that targeted staff from the Debt Management Office of the Central bank of Sudan and
MoFNE; (iii) support to the Government of Sudan in the preparation of the Sudan External Debt
Relief and Arrears Clearance Strategy (SEDRACS); and (iv) Approval of four new operations namely,
Technical Assistance and Capacity Building for Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, Capacity building
for the assessment of options of access to energy in Sudan, Technical Assistance on Arrears and
Debt Relief, and Technical Assistance to Marmoun Beheiry Centre.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of June 30, 2013)
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Sudan’s current statistical data base appears broadly adequate for surveillance and
program monitoring, but needs further improvements, including upgrading the base year, coverage,
periodicity and timeliness of national accounts data; improving labor market and direct investment
data; and more detailed and comprehensive fiscal accounting. Enhancing the status of the Central
Bureau of Statistics (CBS) with the authority and resources to compile and disseminate official
statistics and coordinate the national statistical work program is important for further statistical
improvements, and should be addressed within the context of the ongoing work in developing a
five-year National Strategy for the Development of Statistics (2012-16). Retooling of the CBS’
computing infrastructure should also be accorded high priority.
National accounts: The CBS lacks a comprehensive data collection program, and relies largely on
administrative reporting which is not optimal for national accounts compilation. Economic surveys
were last conducted in the 1970s and 1980s, and the benchmarks derived from these surveys inform
current estimates of value added. The compilation of GDP by activity depends heavily on indirect
indicators of growth rates and price indicators that are less appropriate. Informal activities are not
covered, and are likely to be significant in areas such as retail trade and construction. Sudan’s
national accounts data are based on the System of National Accounts 1968 (SNA 1968), and the base
year of the existing GDP constant price series (by activity and by expenditure) is 1981. National
accounts statistics are compiled with a lag exceeding three years; and there are no national accounts
or industrial production data at sub annual frequencies. On the expenditure side, data are lacking on
final consumption by households, investment, and changes in stocks.
The adoption of updated statistical guidelines (SNA 2008), rebasing of the national accounts, and
developing procedures to improve the timeliness of GDP estimates should be among the core
medium-term objectives of Sudan’s national accounts work program. There is an urgent need to
increase funding to the CBS and to rebuild its capacity for conducting household, agricultural and
enterprise surveys.
Price statistics: Practices in the production of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) are good. Monthly CPI
data (base year=2007) are provided shortly after the end of each month. However, the CBS should
begin developing plans for a new household expenditure survey to facilitate weight updates to the
existing CPI. The CBS is developing for the first time, a quarterly producer price index (PPI) for
manufactured goods. STA’s recent multisector statistics mission (April 2012) conducted a preliminary
assessment of the methods and procedures for compiling the PPI; and issues regarding the frame
and the sample size were raised with the authorities. The mission also advised on how the base year
weights would need to be adjusted to reflect the reduced contributions of oil to the Sudan
economy.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SUDAN

Government finance statistics: Government finance statistics reported to MCD are broadly
adequate for program monitoring, with the main revenue, expenditure, and financing items
reported on a monthly basis with a lag of about one month. The reported statistics are for the
central government only, and do not include the states and publicly owned corporations. Data are
submitted using an economic classification and, while the allocation of resources by MOFNE to the
various ministries is reported, their actual expenditures are not.
STA’s recent multisector statistics mission (April 2012) noted that there has been no significant
progress in implementing GFS classifications at the level of state governments and all other subnational governments and extra budgetary funds. The responsibility for GFS compilation and
dissemination is not assigned to any specific unit within the MOFNE. The mission also found that
there are no comprehensive data reconciliations on government claims on and liabilities to the
banking system; and the recording of “arrears securities” is not in line with the GFSM guidelines. The
compilation of consolidated GFS for the general government with the objective of producing the
statement of government operations should be a key priority.
Monetary and financial statistics (MFS): Sudan has received significant technical assistance to
improve the collection, compilation, and dissemination of monetary and financial statistics. STA’s
recent multisector statistics mission (2012) found that all major recommendations made by the
previous MFS mission in 2007 have been implemented. The current coverage of Sudan’s monetary
statistics includes the CBOS and 32 commercial banks, which constitute the other depository
corporations (ODCs). Due to South Sudan’s secession, the Bank of South Sudan (BOSS) and the
conventional banks operating in South Sudan were excluded from the coverage of the CBOS and
the ODCs, respectively, beginning with July 2011 data. The revised monthly statistical return has
been used by all commercial banks to report data for compiling monetary statistics. However,
stronger efforts are needed to improve the consistency in reporting of inter-bank data and the
timeliness of data reporting and dissemination. The STA 2012 mission also identified areas for
further improvement.
Going forward, the CBOS should also develop a work program for collecting and compiling data on
insurance corporations and pension funds for inclusion in Sudan’s monetary statistics.
External sector statistics: Daily exchange rate data are posted on the CBOS’ web page with
minimal lags. There are several areas for improvement in the external accounts, particularly with
regard to direct investment (DI), remittances, goods and services, capital transfers and oil statistics.
The lack of survey data continues to affect the compilation of important balance of payments and
IIP items such as direct investment. The BOS’s foreign exchange balances include reserves
earmarked for particular purposes such as medicine, oil, and spare part imports, but the
composition of these reserves and their potential usability in the event of a balance of payment
need is not clear There is a need for clarification on items that qualify as reserves assets in general,
and those earmarked reserves in particular. Compilation of the data template on international
reserves and foreign currency liquidity should be initiated.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

SUDAN

Medium-term oil production projections and data on amortization of private sector debt need
substantial improvement. The authorities have made some progress in improving oil projections, but
appear reluctant to provide more detailed information on the phasing-in and expected production
levels of new blocks and on amortization of debt in the oil sector.
STA’s recent multisector statistics mission assisted the CBOS in improving the compilation of a
number of balance of payments and IIP items, including in particular, the calculation of reserve asset
positions that were incorrectly recorded with a negative sign for some months in 2011. The mission
also advised on the treatment of external debt arrears in the balance of payments and the IIP, and
recommended steps for initiating the collection of data on capital transfers. METAC is providing
ongoing support in the implementation of the DI survey.
Data Standards and Quality
Sudan participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since August 2003. GDDS
metadata and plans for improvement need to be updated. No data ROSC is available.
Reporting to STA
Annual data reported for the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook cover only budgetary central
government up to 1999. No monthly and quarterly fiscal data are reported for the International
Financial Statistics (IFS). The reporting of external trade statistics for inclusion in the Direction of
Trade Statistics (DOTS) database is done with significant lags. National accounts data are not
provided for publication in the IFS. The CBOS has compiled and reported to STA for publication in
the IFS, the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs) 1SR for the central bank and 2SR for ODCs. However,
timeliness of data reporting and dissemination should be improved. The CBOS also reports to STA,
quarterly balance of payments and annual IIP data. As a follow up the STA’s recent multisector
statistics mission, the authorities should submit updated GDDS metadata for dissemination on the
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—FINANCIAL SECTOR REVIEW
Sudan was selected to be one of the pilot cases for enhancing bilateral financial sector
surveillance in low-income countries (LICs) called for by Executive Board in May 2012
(FO/DIS/12/66). The Board discussion found that shallow and undiversified financial systems
amplify macro-financial vulnerabilities, limit policy options to mitigate macroeconomic
volatility, with adverse consequences for growth. The purpose of these reviews is to enhance
the understanding of the interplay between financial development, macrostability, growth,
and the effectiveness of macroeconomic policies in low income countries.
Sudan’s financial system, as in many other LICs, is highly underdeveloped—even by LIC
standards—and dominated by the banking sector. Commercial banks represent about
97 percent of the financial system, based on total assets. Insurance companies account for
nearly all of the remainder although there is a small microfinance sector.
The financial system is run on purely Islamic principles, but most arrangements—for
example, banking supervision—are largely the same as for conventional systems. However, it
does present challenges for the development of an interbank funding market, which the
authorities continue to wrestle with. Hence, banks tend to run with large amounts of excess
liquidity. Monetization and financial intermediation is weak, with broad money at only
26.3 percent of GDP, compared to the 48 percent average for LICs, and domestic credit to the
private sector at only 12.8 percent of GDP, compared to the 32.6 percent average for LICs, at
end-2012. Few people access financial services, with only about seven percent of the adult
population having a bank account. Access is concentrated in Khartoum, even though twothirds of the population is rural.
Small and medium enterprises face difficulties accessing credit markets due to a highly riskaverse banking sector, as in most LICs. Corporate governance and transparency are weak and
corporate accounting and managerial controls are poor. Hence, banks tend to impose
onerous collateral and guarantee requirements.

SUDAN

The authorities have made a number of moves to broaden access to banking services. These
include simplifying the procedures for opening bank accounts, encouraging banks to open
new branches and expand ATM networks, and setting up a credit registry. However,
impediments remain, including the costs of extending branch networks to the largely rural
population, and crowding out by the government borrowing.
The banking system is weaker than its sub-Sahara African peers. Capital asset ratios are
generally below the required 12 percent, nonperforming loans are high and provisioning is
low, although both have recently been improving. Also, some of the weaknesses in bank
supervision, inspection and enforcement identified by the 2005 FSAP remain.
The microfinance (MF) sector is small but the authorities are actively promoting its
development and it has started to grow rapidly. However, one of the factors that may slow
further growth is that MF institutions depend on wholesale funding, for which they have to
compete with high-yielding government securities.
Sudan's shallow financial markets and underdeveloped financial system constrains
macroeconomic policies and heightens its vulnerability to shocks. It's hampering households,
businesses, and the government's scope to smooth spending over time. A cap on banks'
lending to government further reduces fiscal flexibility and the space for counter-cyclical
policies, and forces government when faced with negative income shocks to resort to sharp
cuts in spending or inflationary credit from the central bank. This, together with persistently
high excess liquidity and limited instruments for managing overall liquidity, severely hampers
the scope for effective monetary policy.

BACKGROUND: SECESSION OF SOUTH SUDAN, A
STRUCTURAL BREAK
1.
While the direct impact of the secession of South Sudan on July 9, 2011 on the
economy was significant, the impact on the financial system was more modest, reflecting the
concentration of the financial system in Khartoum. The secession resulted in a large fiscal shock,
with Sudan losing some three-quarters of its oil production—half of its fiscal revenues—and a
balance of payment squeeze, with about two-thirds of its international payment capacity vanishing
overnight. This has weakened macroeconomic fundamentals. The stock of bank credit to the private
sector decline by 7 percent (0.9 of GDP) during the secession, corresponding to the amount of credit
outstanding provided by the southern branches of Sudanese banks. Nonetheless, the indirect
impact over time on financial sector growth is likely to be significant. Oil revenues, which would in
the past have transmitted through the Sudanese banking system will increasingly be channeled
through neighboring countries such as Kenya.
2.
Monetization and financial intermediation is weak. Broad money is only 26.3 percent of
GDP, compared to 48 percent on average for LICs, and the share of currency in broad money is high.
Deposits are also low at only 19 percent of GDP. As a result, domestic credit to the private sector is also
low at only 12.1 percent of GDP versus the 32.6 percent LIC average at end-2012 (Figures 1 and 2).

There is essentially no interbank market largely, due to the persistent excess liquidity
in the system, lack of trust among banks, and the ease with which liquidity can be obtained
from the CBOS. More importantly, under purely Islamic systems, such as Sudan’s, there are no short
term liquidity products that comply with Shariah rules and principles. However, there is an informal
inter-bank market (Qard Hassan) in which banks lend to each other without charging any fee or
expecting any profit for short periods such as one week. This is done on a favor trading basis.
5.
The absence of an active interbank market and a cap on commercial bank holding of
government and central bank securities have led to exceptionally large excess reserves
(Figure 3) and a loss of monetary control with the CBOS providing direct credit to
government (Figure 4) and to individual banks while lacking the means to mop up the
resulting excess liquidity. Banks can only invest up to 20 percent (25 percent prior to 2013) of their
investable funds in government securities, short-term Murabaha investments, and central bank

Aggregate holdings of such investments are currently around 20 percent. Banks not yet complying with the limit have until
September 30, 2013 to comply. This cap severely constrains the ability of the central bank to conduct monetary policy.

Box 1. Securities Subject to the 20 Percent Holding Ceiling
Banks may hold up to 20 percent (25 percent until end-2012) of their financing portfolio in Government
Musharaka Certificates (GMCs), Government Investment Certificates (GICs), CBOS Ijarah Certificates (CICs),
Khartoum Petroleum Refinery Certificates, and other Sukuk.
GMCs, also known as Shahama, are issued in registered form by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) through
auctions. They are based on Musharaka with a one year renewable maturity at the government’s option. The
nominal value of each certificate is SDG 500 and their profits are distributed annually. The return on GMCs is
based on the return from underlying projects and capital gains derived from revaluations of project assets.
These are the highest yielding certificates.
GICs known as Sarh/Sukuk and issued in registered form by the MOF are used to finance development
projects. They are based on a pool of Islamic financial instruments such as Mudarabah and Ijara with
nonrenewable maturities ranging from two to six years (typically five). Investors get a share of the profits
generated by the underlying projects. The nominal value of each certificate is SDG 100 and their profits are
distributed quarterly and semi-annually. There are also GICs known as Shama backed by the assets of the
Petroleum Refinery of Khartoum. The yield is fixed and is paid on a quarterly basis. Central Bank Ijara
Certificates (CICs) known as Shehab are issued only to banks by the CBOS with a 10 year-maturity and a
fixed annual return of 12 percent paid monthly. CICs are backed by the CBOS building and are issued by the
SFSC. These are mainly used by the CBOS for open market operations, and purely for monetary policy
purposes. Dealing in these certificates is restricted among the banks and the CBOS. The nominal value of
each certificate is SDG 1,000.

A. Banking Sector
6.
The banking sector is composed of 35 banks, 4 of which are CBOS/governmentowned, 25 are jointly CBOS/government- and privately-owned, and 6 are foreign-owned
(Table 1).3 The government-owned banks include three specialized financial institutions (SFIs)
jointly owned by the CBOS and Ministry of Finance, and mandated to fill specific access-to-finance
gaps.4 In all, 90 percent of banking system assets are those of banks owned fully or jointly by the
CBOS and/or government. Given the CBOS’s supervisory role, this presents obvious conflicts of
interest.
7.
That the Sudanese banking system is largely Islamic has implications for financial
stability. While conventional intermediation is largely debt based and allows for risk transfer, Islamic

Banks have been classified by ownership according to controlling interest, defined as holding more than 50 percent of equity.

The three SFIs are the Agricultural Bank of Sudan (ABS), the Industrial Development Bank and the Savings and Social Development
Bank (SSDB). The ABS supplies about 53 percent of the bank financing of the agricultural sector. The SSDB specializes in supporting
microfinance activity.

SUDAN

intermediation, in contrast, is asset based and centers on risk sharing, thereby being a better shockabsorber. Depositors share the risk and return in Islamic banks, with no guaranteed return.
Resilience is therefore achieved, as leverage through debt is not permitted, and derivatives are
typically prohibited, though other sources of risks, such as liquidity risks, may indeed be higher than
in conventional banks. Islamic banks also lack the instruments for managing risks—such as
derivatives—and hedge against risks that conventional banks have.
8.
The banking system is weaker than its sub-Sahara African peers. Return on assets and
equity have gradually recovered since the lows reached in 2008, although it is still well below the
inflation rate (Table 2, Figures 5 and 6). Capital asset ratios, moreover, are generally below the
required 12 percent—reflecting a lack of compliance—nonperforming loans (NPLs) are high but
provisioning is low—suggesting potentially weak buffers—although they have recently been
improving (Figures 7 to 11). However, Sudanese banks are required to denote loans as
nonperforming when they are more than one month overdue for all Murahaba mode assets, which
comprise the majority of bank loans. The NPL threshold for other loans is three months. The
international standards generally use a three-month threshold.5

Although a recent reorganization of the onsite inspection teams was helpful (see Box
2), more effort is needed to build their capacity, develop a consistent inspection methodology
and build a better and a more risk-based inspection plan. In addition, the coordination and
exchange of information between the onsite and offsite functions need many enhancements to
develop a complete and comprehensive assessment of banks and to achieve more effective
supervision. It is worth noting that new functions have been added to the banking supervision
department to improve the coordination between Prudential Supervision and the Inspection
Directorates.
Box 2. Banking Supervision Structure
The Banking Supervision Department at the CBOS consists of the Prudential Supervision Directorate (PSD)
and the Inspection Directorate (ID). The PSD is responsible for the regular offsite analysis of banks and
financial companies, while the ID is in charge of the onsite assessment. The PSD is in charge of monitoring
the financial performance of banks, financial companies, and the financial sector based on the analysis of
their main prudential indicators and according to their “Capital, Assets’ Quality, Earnings, and Liquidity”
(CAEL). The PSD assigns CAEL ratings to the banks according to specific benchmarks.
The ID used to consist of ten teams, each responsible for inspection of a specific theme at the banks (e.g.,
corporate governance, financial statements, etc.). Because of this purely theme-based methodology, the ID
did not possess a comprehensive assessment of banks’ financial and managerial performance. During the
first half of 2013, the inspection teams were restructured in order to be responsible for banks rather than
specific themes. There are now eight 6-7 person teams, of which six are responsible for a number of banks,
one is responsible for inspection of the payments systems, and the other is responsible for non-bank
financial companies. This restructuring will provide better and more comprehensive onsite assessments.

10.
Despite banks being restricted in lending to the sovereign, little lending takes place to
the private sector. After a rapid increase in credit to both the government and non-government
sectors in 2001-06, credit to non-government has been stagnant (as a percent of GDP; Figure 12). A
number of obstacles, which are typical of LICs has contributed to this, including:


Informational asymmetries. Lack of information on borrowers, including due to the limited size
of the formal sector and the limited availability of audited company statements increases
adverse selection and moral hazard issues, and ultimately leads to credit rationing. Information
asymmetries are also an issue for the development of the interbank market. However, under
Islamic banking, this problem is in part dealt with as the incentives of investors and
entrepreneurs are aligned, given the risk-based sharing arrangement.



Business and judicial environment. A key issue is the absence of formalized property rights in
large parts of the country, which increases the difficulty of using land as collateral in lending.
Moreover, the judicial process tends to be costly and slow. This inability to recoup losses at a
reasonable cost, through collateral initially pledged, discourages lending further.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

SUDAN



Skills. The quality of human capital is critical for banks as it provides the necessary risk
management expertise and the ability to design and sell the products that customers need. The
lack of appropriate skills may explain why in recent years some MFIs that moved from dealing
with micro-enterprises to dealing with SMEs saw their profitability decrease. Banks may face
similar challenges moving from larger enterprises to SMEs.

Financial Infrastructure
11.
An important recent development has been the enhancement of the credit registry
operated by the CBOS. The registry was formed in 1996 but it was not until 2006 that banks had
online access to the data. Since June 2008, the IMF has been providing technical assistance (TA) to
upgrade the registry to best practice, and in 2012 the Credit Information and Scoring Agency
(CIASA) was established as a separate agency within the CBOS.6 More recently, newly installed
software coupled with expanded data collection, will provide more accurate information on
borrower performance and will allow more informed credit granting decisions. The enhanced
registry will also allow the CBOS to more accurately and timely monitor credit risk in the banking
sector and credit concentration at the level of banks as well as the banking sector as a whole.7

6

The TA project is aimed at enhancing the credit registry function through five phases: 1) adding more demographic data; 2) linking
related parties to borrowers; 3) adding more financial information; 4) creating management reports and a new credit report
template that would allow for the inclusion of expanded credit and demographic data along with other features; and 5) the
migration of borrower codes and financial data from a test database to live production database. Major progress has been achieved
towards the completion of the five phases of the project.
7

Future plans include setting up a credit scoring system, similar to the “FICO” scores used in the United States, although those
plans are still in their infancy. Also, data collection may be expanded to include non-banks (e.g., insurance and microfinance
institutions) and the stock exchange.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SUDAN

12.
Substantial efforts have been made to complete the credit registry expansion project,
but work is still needed to achieve a more effective coordination between the CIASA and
various CBOS departments. This coordination has started, namely in producing and exchanging
information about delinquent borrowers and clients banned from accessing financial services due to
malpractices or irregularities. Coordination is also needed to ensure that the data submitted to the
CIASA are accurate and complete. In this context, an inspection checklist prepared by CIASA is
currently being used by the ID to verify the accuracy of the data sent by banks to CIASA in the
course of the regular inspection performed over banks.
Deposit Insurance
13.
All domestic currency bank deposits (current, savings and investment) are covered by
the government-owned Bank Deposit Security Fund (BDSF) up to SDG 10,000 per depositor.8
Coverage is mandatory for all banks and the annual premia are 0.003 percent of total deposits.9
Accumulated premia (SDG 494 million at end-2012) now amount to about two percent of deposits
versus a target of five percent. Local currency deposits totaled SDG 28.2 billion at end-2012. They
have had to cover two failures since inception (in 1998 and 2000). The BDSF also stands ready to
provide resources to solvent banks facing short-term liquidity problems. This “remedial role” is
reserved for central banks in other countries.

B. Insurance Sector
14.
The insurance sector in Sudan is small, even compared to those in other African
countries. According to Swiss Re, total 2012 premium revenue was about 0.4 percent of GDP, versus
3.7 percent in Africa as a whole, and 6.3 percent globally. However, Sudan’s low level of insurance
penetration is not unusual for LICs.
15.
The primary business line for insurance companies in Sudan is vehicle insurance
(40 percent of gross premia in 2011), which is not an extraordinary phenomenon observed in
developing markets, and vehicle third liability insurance is compulsory in Sudan. Life insurance
comprises only five percent of gross premia (Figure 13).

8

The BDSF was established in 1996 with a coverage limit of SDG 1,000 on current and savings account, and 250 on investment
accounts. The current levels were set in 2010 and further increases are being considered. SDG 10,000 is roughly equal to the
country’s GDP per capita and about $2,000 based on current exchange rates.
9

The Ministry of Finance and CBOS also each contribute an amount equal to 15 percent of total premia collected from the banks.

16.
All Sudanese insurance companies must operate in accordance with Islamic Sharia
principles. Sharia requires insurance to be a “donation contract,” whereby policyholders donate the
premiums to a common pool of resources, and claim payouts are considered a form of charity. Since
policyholders are donors, no gambling is deemed to have occurred. Any surplus may be set aside as
reserves or distributed to policyholders in proportion to the contributions paid.10
17.
Insurers must maintain separate accounts for each policyholder to track all
contributions. Administrative charges and costs of claims are allocated in proportion to
contributions. Any surplus (after making provisions for pay-outs, operating costs, depreciation, bad
debts and establishment of reserves) is allocated to policyholders in proportion to contributions
paid, or set aside as reserves and investments on behalf of the policyholders.11
18.
The 2011 World Bank Financial Sector Review concluded that there were shortfalls in
the Sudanese insurance regulatory and supervisory framework.12 However, it is beyond the
scope of this paper to update this analysis.

10

Owing to the charitable, voluntary nature of the business, company profits on underwriting and policyholders’ receipt of payouts
are tax free, whereas profits on investment income are taxable.
11

Shareholders—as opposed to policyholders—may not profit from the insurance business, for example, by receiving dividends, but
may receive a fee for management services. In addition, it has been argued that shareholders can share in profits on the invested
reserves, as distinct from the underwriting business itself. Investments must be in Sharia-compliant instruments.
12

“The scope of regulation and supervision is defined by the Insurance Supervision Act, which is missing many key elements of a
modern insurance supervision regime. However, the focus of the law is on regulation and compliance, and the supervisor does not
have the mandate or powers to undertake a thorough analysis of possible financial and operational risks. Consequently, in practice,
the ISA has limited scope to go beyond compliance oriented functions, go through the operations of the companies, and the
requisite expertise and capacity to perform these functions have not been developed in its staff.

C. Microfinance Sector
19.
The microfinance (MF) sector is small but growing rapidly, thanks to the authorities’
active promotion. The sector has come alive with the creation of a microfinance unit at the CBOS
in 2007 and the establishment of the Sudanese Microfinance Development Facility (SMDF) in 2008.
The SMDF has $20 million of capital, and is jointly owned by the CBOS and the Ministry of Finance
and National Economy, and financed by donors (through a trust fund administered by the World
Bank).13 These developments are the result of a plan, established in 2006, aimed at positioning the
MF sector within a wider framework for poverty alleviation and economic and financial
development.14 As one part of this plan, the CBOS includes MF as a priority sector, and encourages
banks to allocate at least 12 percent of their investable funds to the sector. Also two governmentowned banks have been reorganized to focus on MF financing.15
20.
The results of this push have been impressive to date. The number of MF borrowers
went from 49,000 at end-2007 to 494,000 by 2012. The growth has occurred in both bank
portfolios (49,000 to 300,000) and at the dedicated MF institutions (zero to 194,000). The CBOS MF
Unit (MFU) estimates that the proportion of the adult population receiving MF funding from banks
and MF institutions has gone from 0.7 percent to 8.2 percent over the same period. And returns are
estimated to be competitive with those on Government Musharaka Certificates (GMC; see below) at
about 18 percent. Moreover, NPLs on MF loans are much lower than those of commercial bank
loans, although microinsurance, paid for by the borrower, plays a role in keeping them low.16
21.
The banks are making slow but steady progress towards meeting the 12 percent of
investable funds target for MF lending set by the CBOS. It was one percent in 2007 and about
five percent at end-2012. But MF institutions, of which 18 are currently in operation (versus zero
in 2007) and are regulated and supervised by the CBOS and MFU, may be the best suited to be the
main drivers of future growth of this sector, even though banks are expected to continue to track
towards the 12 percent target. This is to be accomplished mostly through the newly established
Wholesale Guarantee Agency which would partially guarantee finance from banks to MF institutions.

Consideration should be made to move to a more independent and risk based supervisory and regulatory model with a suitable
transition period. The model should be built around three pillars - solvency, governance and policyholder‘s protection. The sector
should strengthen on-going supervisory capacities through increased suitable staffing in the Insurance Supervisory Authority (ISA)
and encourage the development of insurance institutions to train insurance staff in insurance principles. Sudan should also
encourage the development of specialist insurers (agriculture, bank assurance and micro life/ health insurance etc.)”
13

Also, in 2011 the CBOS and the Islamic Development Bank partnered to allocate around $62.5 million for funding, technical
assistance and information technology to the sector.
14

This push also includes the establishment of the Higher Council of Microfinance, headed by the First Vice President, and the
launch of the 2013-2017 Comprehensive National MF Strategy.
15

Two government-owned banks, the Saving & Social Development Bank and Agricultural Bank, specialize in MF lending.

16

NPLs on MF funding transactions average about four percent. Typical microinsurance policies add about 1 to 3 percentage points
to the annual cost, and cover 75 percent of losses.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

SUDAN

This will help reduce the CBOS’s participation in the MF wholesale funding market. In fact, the
CBOS’s share of MF institution wholesale funding has already declined – during the 2007-12 period
the CBOS provided about 60 percent of such funding, but it now stands at only about 37 percent of
outstandings.
22.
In other countries with active MF sectors, trade unions play an active role in funding
and setting up MF institutions. Although the MF regulatory framework in Sudan allows unions to
establish MF institutions, so far there are only two that have.17 However, Sudanese trade unions have
social programs that provide cash support to members, which would make their involvement in the
MF sector a natural fit. Also, the 2013-2017 Comprehensive MF National Strategy calls for a review
of the cooperatives regulations with the intent of increasing the involvement of cooperatives in the
MF sector.
23.
In terms of active clients, Sudan and Bangladesh are easily the global leaders in Islamic
finance microfinance, with Sudan likely to take top spot given current growth rates.
Nonetheless, this is still a very small market – about $1 billion outstanding according to AlHuda
Centre of Islamic Banking and Economics. Murabaha (cost plus mark-up) funding is the MF vehicle
of choice in Sudan, as it is in other Islamic MF markets.
24.
Finally, while high GMC indicative returns look like they could draw potential
wholesale funds away from the MF sector, private-sector MF institution investors are looking
to establish solid institutions for future higher returns. Also, some look at these investments as
serving their communities and social obligations. Nevertheless, reductions in GMC issuance and/or
returns could only be a good thing for the MF sector.

D. Equity Market
25.
The Khartoum Stock Exchange (KSE) provides an organized market for the trading of
equity shares, government certificates, and mutual funds backed by certificates or equities.
However, the market is small and equity trading is thin, with weak corporate governance, poor
regulation, lack of corporate transparency, and low awareness by the public hindering its
development.18 Plus, government securities dominate trading, and what little equity trading that
occurs is dominated by one firm (Sudatel).19

17

The Youth Microfinance Institution was established in 2010, and the AL-Amal Women’s Microfinance Institution in 2013, by their
respective trade unions. The former is in the process of becoming a deposit-taking microfinance bank.
18

Market capitalization, including government securities, was about $3 billion at end-2005. This equates to about 12 percent of
GDP, which was in the lower third of the selected Middle East and North Africa stock exchanges evaluated in Hearn, Bruce, Jenifer
Piesse, and Roger Strange, 2011, “The Role of the Stock Market in the Provision of Islamic Development Finance: Evidence from
Sudan,” Emerging Markets Review, Vol. 12, pp. 338-43.
19

During the first half of 2013, the trading of government certificates accounted for 96 percent of trading volume, and the trading
of one stock (Sudatel) accounted for 50 percent of the other 4 percent of total volume. Sudatel is a Sudanese telecommunications
firm about 60 percent owned by the government.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SUDAN

26.
Although the KSE switched from manual to computer-based trading in January 2012,
trading still occurs for only one hour (10:00 am to 11:00 am) and brokers must be physically
present at the exchange.
27.
The KSE was established as a self-regulating government-owned institution controlled
by a board of directors (appointed by the Council of Ministers). However, no amendments have
been made to the original KSE law since 1994 in spite of the modernization of global financial
systems, and developments in corporate governance around the world.20 The 2005 FSAP pressed the
need to establish a legislative and regulatory framework for the securities market, and institutions to
implement it, based on the IOSCO Objectives and Principles for Securities Regulation.21
28.
Also, the World Bank 2011 Financial Sector Review made a number of
recommendations with respect to upgrading the KSE’s regulatory framework. They called for
the establishment of an independent market regulator to (i) supervise the market, and (ii) review and
enforce rules on listing, disclosure and market operations. They also recommended establishing
links with international regulatory bodies such as International Organization of Securities
Commissions (IOSCO), for credibility and to improve investor appeal of the market.

ACCESS TO FINANCIAL SERVICES CHALLENGES
29.
Challenges confront individuals and business enterprises in accessing financial
services. Few people access financial services in Sudan, with only about 7 percent of the adult
population having a bank account (versus 24 percent among LICs and other Sub-Sahara African
(SSA) countries). Such access is concentrated in Khartoum, even though two-thirds of Sudan’s
population lives in rural areas. Although documentation standards for accessing financial services
have been eased, they remain difficult to meet for most Sudanese.22
30.
Some access to financial service indices have been improving in recent years, but they
are still at very low levels, even when compared against peer LICs. For example, even though
the number of banks per 1,000 km2 has risen from 0.19 in 2004 to 0.26 in 2011, the average for SSA

20

The 2005 FSAP recommended the separation of control and supervision from the administrative and executive functions of the
market but this is yet to be implemented.
21

The latest version of the IOSCO Objectives and Principles document (June 2010) can be downloaded at:
http://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD323.pdf. The FSAP also thought that there was insufficient surveillance or
investigative expertise available to the KSE; and no market-oriented criminal legislation. Furthermore, there was little or no
cooperation with regulators of overseas exchanges where Sudanese shares are traded
22

Prior to the reform process started in 2012, to open a savings account national identity cards and a proof of residence were
required, and for a checking account proof of insurance and employment, a minimum opening balance far exceeds the per capita
national income was required, and banks were not allowed to operate during afternoons. Now only the identity cards and a
minimum balance of SDG 50 are required, although SDG 50 is still a large sum of money for most Sudanese. Also there are actually
no national financial identity cards. Prospective depositors must obtain the required identity card from the central bank through
their local bank.

countries is 0.90 and 1.20 for LICs in general. Over the same period the number of branches per
100,000 of population has gone from 2.01 to 2.37 (versus an SSA average of 3.40 and LIC average of
2.50).
Also, small and medium enterprises face difficulties accessing credit markets. This is partially
because banks, facing poor accounting and managerial controls in many companies, rely on
onerous collateral and guarantee requirements, and on the borrower’s personal financial health.
Also, according to the most recent World Bank Doing Business survey Sudan scores very low on
contract enforcement.23

POLICY CONSTRAINTS IMPOSED BY FINANCIAL
SHALLOWNESS AND THE CAP ON BANK HOLDING OF
GOVERNMENT AND CBOS SECURITIES
31.
Sudan’s shallow financial system and the cap in place on commercial bank holding of
government and central bank securities constrain its macroeconomic policy options.
32.
Shallow financial markets impact the real economy negatively, making it more difficult
for firms and households in Sudan to access financial services, leading to:


Higher volatility: One of the key functions of banks—to enable agents, including households,
to smooth consumption over time—is not performed the underdeveloped Sudanese banking
system. Shocks—droughts for instance—have to be fully absorbed by a household’s existing
assets, and should they be insufficient, adjustment has to be instantaneous, leading in extreme
cases to destitution or worse. In fact, a shallow banking system tend to create pro-cyclical
financing conditions, providing the private sector with credit in good times, but cutting it back in
bad times, accentuating volatility. Financial sector development can help alleviate these liquidity
constraints, thereby ultimately reducing volatility.



Lower growth: Financial development affects economic growth by facilitating the mobilization
of savings to finance investment and by contributing to a better allocation of resources. Rioja
and Valev (2004a)24 find that finance boosts growth in rich countries primarily by speeding-up
productivity growth, while finance encourages growth in poorer countries primarily by
accelerating capital accumulation. The impact is also nonlinear, with countries with very low
levels of financial development experience very little growth acceleration from a marginal

23

Sudan ranks 143rd out of 185 countries on the World Bank “ease of doing business” index, 151st on contract enforcement, and
158th on investor protection.

SUDAN

increase in financial development, while the effect is larger for rich countries and particularly
large for middle-income countries. This means that a deepening of the financial system going
forward could help spur growth in the Sudanese context.
33.
From a policy perspective, the constraints on fiscal policy of a shallow financial system
and the cap on bank holding of government securities are multiple, making fiscal and
monetary policy largely procyclical and unstable. Fiscal policy effectiveness will be impacted
through the following channels:


Liquidity risk: With debt issued with short maturities, liquidity risks faced by the government
are significant. Should liquidity dry up, the government would be in a difficult position to roll
over its debt, and may have to finance itself through arrears for instance, turning a fiscal issue
into a financial stability risk (if arrears are to banks) or a risk to private sector development (if
arrears to suppliers). Short maturities also expose to significant interest rate risks.



Fiscal cost: A deeper financial market, by creating more liquidity and allowing for economies of
scale in debt issuance, may reduce the marginal cost of borrowing to the sovereign. These costs
tend to be high presently, particularly for longer maturities.



Scope for counter-cyclical policy: Sudan’s economy is susceptible to shocks. This puts a
premium of fiscal flexibility and fiscal space. A deeper financial system and removal of the cap
on commercial bank holding of government securities would give the government more scope
to run counter-cyclical policies in the event of a shock; this would allow more time to adjust to
the shock, avoiding costly adjustment particularly on the part of the population that lives close
to the subsistence level and has itself limited access to credit. It would also avoid delaying
investment projects, which generally results in higher costs (beyond lost output in the medium
term).

34.
Shallowness and the cap on commercial bank holding of government and central bank
securities also hamper monetary policy formulation, implementation, and effectiveness. Four
transmission channels are generally distinguished: The bank lending channel; the interest rate
channel; the asset price channel; and the exchange rate channel. To be efficient, all channels require
functioning financial markets. Research on monetary transmission in LICs25 shows that for all the
channels to be effective, a country should have a strong institutional setup, an independent central
bank, a high degree of capital mobility, a floating exchange rate, and a well functioning interbank,
government securities, equities and real estate markets. Most of these preconditions are not met in
the Sudan, impeding monetary policy. The factors hampering monetary policy in particular include:

25

Transmission in Low-Income Countries: Effectiveness and Policy Implications,” IMF Economic Review 60, 270–302.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

SUDAN



Persistent excess liquidity: The Sudanese banking system is highly heterogeneous and
segmented, including with regard to the distribution of liquidity. The reluctance of banks to
trade liquidity means that liquidity needs from illiquid banks need to be met by injections from
the central bank. In addition, banks also tend to hold large precautionary excess reserves due to
weaknesses with the payments system (e.g., remote branches may need to hold large cash
balances due to transportation problems). Such a context makes it very hard for the central bank
to focus on overall liquidity management. As a result, monetary policy implementation is limited
to direct instruments such as changes to reserve requirements and statutory liquidity ratios (as
opposed to market-based instruments such as open market operations). Furthermore, in the
absence of vibrant money markets banks maintain high precautionary liquid asset balances. In
addition, in the absence of interbank lending markets, the CBOS lacks flexible means to mop up
excess system liquidity. Shallow banking systems also tend to create pro-cyclical financing
conditions, providing the private sector with credit in good times, but cutting it back in bad
times, accentuating volatility.



Credit rationing: Imperfect information is an important issue in Sudan, in particular for
households and smaller firms in the sizable informal sector, including those located outside
Khartoum. When a financial institution tightens credit extension following a tightening of
monetary policy, it may increase the riskiness of new lending due to adverse selection. If
unwilling to accept higher risk, the bank may ultimately decide to keep its lending rates
unchanged, muting the impact of monetary policy decisions.



Restriction on commercial bank holding of government and central bank securities: The
restriction forces government to resort to inflationary central bank financing of the budget and a
loss of monetary control. Caps on direct central bank lending to the government and directing
all of the government’s domestic borrowing to the domestic commercial banks and domestic
securities market without any restrictions on their holdings of government securities would help
the central bank regain control over the money supply. This would also help the development of
the domestic financial markets and secondary trading in government securities, which are
hampered by the current cap on commercial bank holding of government securities. Removing
this cap on commercial bank holding of government and central bank securities would also
facilitate the development of a proper central bank liquidity management framework by
allowing commercial banks to hold central bank instruments intended for managing liquidity,
and by allowing the central bank to use outright sale and purchases of government securities in
the primary or secondary market to manage market liquidity.

CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS
35.
While the secession of South Sudan did not have a large impact on the North
Sudanese banking system, the second round effect has probably been larger than it appears.
With the loss of large oil revenues, the role of the financial system as a driver of diversification and
growth is bound to become ever larger. This note illustrated that the shallowness of the financial
system has both retarded growth, and reduced the effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policy in

22

mitigating shocks to the financial system and the real economy. The large CBOS/government
banking sector footprint remains a concern, with only about 10 percent of aggregate banking sector
assets being owned by fully privately-owned institutions. This raises conflict of interest concerns,
and it is recommended that a drive to full privatization be pursued.
36.
Access to finance needs to be enhanced to promote growth. Challenges confront
individuals and business enterprises in accessing credit. In part it is because banks are concentrated
in Khartoum, whereas most of the population is rural. Non-deposit taking microfinance institutions
can play an important role in reaching out to rural areas, but they face funding challenges too.
37.
The current restriction on commercial banks’ holding of government and central bank
securities should be removed. It amplifies the constraints on Sudan’s macroeconomic policy
options posed by the shallow financial system. It severely limits the government’s scope in the event
of a shock to run counter-cyclical policies and reducing the adjustment costs, including for the most
vulnerable part of the population. It also severely impedes monetary policy and monetary control,
including by forcing government to resort to inflationary central bank funding, hampering
development of the security market, and restricting the few available market-based instruments
available to the central bank to manage liquidity and controlling inflation. Concerns over government
domestic borrowing possibly causing a crowding out of credit to the private sector should be
addressed by reducing the fiscal deficit not preventing lenders to lend to government.
38.
Supervisory weaknesses also need to be addressed, with the aim to move to risk-based
supervision high on the agenda. While banks do not deal in sophisticated financial products, the
secession, risk environment and challenges of supervising Islamic banks require an even better
tailored supervisory and regulatory architecture.
39.
The large commercial bank holding of excess liquidity at the central bank poses a risk
to monetary control and require a careful sequencing of reforms. It could result in an
excessively large credit and broad money expansion that would put further pressure on the
exchange rate and inflation if put into circulation. Improving the traction of monetary policy would
require measures to mop up the excess reserves, and once achieved, putting in place a better
functioning interbank market.
40.
Progress has been made in dealing with the weaknesses in bank supervision,
inspection and enforcement identified by the 2005 FSAP but some remain. However, the
central bank is making good progress in moving towards best practice, including with the assistance
of the IMF’s Middle East Regional Technical Assistance Center (Box 3).
41.
There is currently no legislative and regulatory framework for the securities market,
and institutions to implement it. Furthermore, the Khartoum Stock Exchange is self-regulated
under laws that have not been amended since 1994. However, new securities market legislation is
currently working its way through the system that will rectify these deficiencies.

Box 3. Bank Supervision Recommendations
Although the CBOS has made many efforts to improve the quality of its oversight function over banks and
financial companies, substantial steps are still needed to move the supervision from a compliance-based
exercise to a more risk-based practice. The main actions that would be required by the CBOS can be
summarized as follows:
1.

The current structure of the offsite supervision unit should be reviewed with an eye towards
limiting redundancies and enhancing effectiveness.

2.

The risk-based manuals for offsite and onsite supervision need to be updated, and supervisors
trained on them

3.

An annual supervisory plan for each bank should be developed. For this purpose, the offsite
supervision unit should establish an early warning system in which it analyzes regular data on
banks and the banking sector and produces timely reports on their performance and the
actions that need to be taken in this respect. The onsite supervision unit should prepare an
annual risk-based inspection plan that allocates the resources of the directorate according to
the risk of the banks and financial companies and their impact on the overall financial stability.
The offsite and onsite supervision units should establish regular formal and informal
coordination arrangements to perform a comprehensive assessment and monitoring of banks
and to prepare the supervisory plan for them accordingly.

4.

Review the current division of responsibilities within the banking supervision department and
between it and other CBOS departments to allow more effective regulation and supervision of
banks and financial companies and to enhance the coordination between the onsite and the
offsite functions.

5.

Develop the CBOS bank enforcement framework through: (i) developing enforcement
regulations and manuals, (ii) setting up the institutional framework and responsibilities for
monitoring weak banks and taking enforcement actions against them; and (iii) building the
capacity of supervisors to implement the new enforcement framework.

Annex: Islamic Banking Terms Used in this Report26
42.
Islamic banking refers to a system of banking or banking activity which is consistent
with Islamic law (Sharia) principles and guided by Islamic economics. In particular, Islamic law
prohibits usury, the collection and payment of interest, also commonly called Riba in Islamic
discourse. Instead, profit-and-loss sharing arrangements (PLS) or purchase and resale of goods and
services form the basis of contracts. In PLS modes, the rate of return on financial assets is not known
or fixed prior to undertaking the transaction. Islamic law also generally prohibits trading in financial
risk (which is seen as a form of gambling). In addition, Islamic law prohibits investing in businesses
that are considered haram (such as businesses that sell alcohol or pork, or businesses that produce
un-Islamic media).
Bai salam is a contract in which the buyer pays the seller the full negotiated price of a product that
the seller promises to deliver at a future date (pre-payment, deferred delivery).
Ijara is a contract in which a party leases a particular product for a specific sum and a specific time
period (lease, lease-purchase). In the case of a lease purchase, each payment includes a portion that
goes toward the final purchase and transfer of ownership of the product.
Istisna is a contract in which a manufacturer (contractor) agrees to produce (build) and to deliver a
certain good (or premise) at a given price on a given date in the future (deferred payment, deferred
delivery). The price does not have to be paid in advance (in contrast to Bai Salam). It may be paid in
installments or part may be paid in advance with the balance to be paid later on, based on the
preferences of the parties.
Mudarabah is a contract in which a Rabb -ul- mal provides the entire capital needed to finance a
project while the entrepreneur offers his labor and expertise (trustee finance contract). Profits are
shared between them at a certain fixed ratio, whereas financial losses are exclusively borne by Rabb
-ul- mal. The liability of the entrepreneur is limited only to his time and effort.
The Murabaha is a contract in which the seller informs the buyer of the cost of acquiring or
producing a specified product (mark-up financing). The profit margin is then negotiated between
them. The total cost is usually paid in installments.
Musharakah is a contract in which a bank enters into an equity partnership agreement with one or
more partners to jointly finance an investment project (joint project). Profits (and losses) are shared
strictly in relation to the respective capital contributions.
Qard Hassan is a zero-return funding transaction that the Qur’an encourages Muslims to make to
the needy. Banks are allowed to charge borrowers a service fee to cover the administrative expenses
of handling it. The fee should not be related to the amount or maturity.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITYANALYSIS

September 5, 2013

Approved By
Adnan Mazarei and
Ranil Salgado (IMF)
and Jeffrey D. Lewis and
Marcelo Giugale (IDA)

Prepared by the Staffs of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and the International Development Association (IDA)

As in the last debt sustainability analysis (DSA) in 2012 (IMF Country Report No. 12/298),
Sudan continues to be assessed in debt distress.1 Given the current size and evolution of
the debt stock (that is mostly in arrears), both baselines external and public DSA suggest
that Sudan’s public sector debt remains unsustainable. All debt ratios exceed their
indicative policy-dependent thresholds at end-2012. This continues even through the long
term, except for the debt service-to-revenue ratio. Compared to the 2012 DSA, some
external and domestic debt ratios improve modestly, because of an assumed slowdown of
new external borrowing in the face of growing challenges to the economy from a
continued deterioration of macroeconomic fundamentals after the secession of South
Sudan in July 2011 and incessant accumulation of external arrears. Against this
background, it remains critical for Sudan to follow sound policies consistent with a
prudent borrowing strategy, also with a view to garner support for debt relief.

1

As Sudan is an IDA-only country, this DSA update was prepared jointly by IMF and World Bank staff under the joint FundBank Low-Income Country (LIC) Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF). It was also discussed with the authorities. Sudan’s
fiscal year runs from January 1 to December 31.

SUDAN

BACKGROUND AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Sudan continues to struggle with the enormous macroeconomic challenges arising from the
secession of South Sudan in mid-2011. The secession of South Sudan has inflicted a large permanent
fiscal and external shock on Sudan, involving the loss of some ¾ of its oil output, 60 percent of fiscal
revenues, and about two thirds of the country’s current account payment capacity. This has not only
presented the authorities with the exacerbation of an already difficult economic situation, but also weighs
on the longer macroeconomic outlook and debt servicing capacity. Against the backdrop of a sizable
external debt overhang and continued uncertainties as to the implementation of an oil wealth sharing
agreement between Sudan and South Sudan, the authorities have yet to implement a comprehensive
package of ambitious policy responses that succeeds in tackling the sizable imbalances.

STRUCTURE OF DEBT
A. External Debt
2.
At end-2012, Sudan’s stock of external debt remained very high. In nominal terms, it
amounted to about US$43.2 billion (72 percent of GDP), of which 85 percent was in arrears (Figure 1 and
Table 4). The structure of external debt has not changed over the last decade. Only a small fraction is
private, owed to suppliers (US$1.6 billion). The bulk is public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt
(US$41.6 billion, of which 88 percent in arrears), mainly owed to bilateral creditors (Figure 2). In present
value (PV) terms, the latter corresponds to almost US$95 billion, or 158 percent of GDP, 1790 percent of
exports and 1633 percent of revenues (Table 4).2

This mainly reflects an increase in the stock external debt and a denominator effect, mainly on account of a sharp currency
devaluation (66 percent in June 2012 alone) and secession-induced drop in GDP, exports and government revenues.

3.
The external debt stock and arrears have continued to grow, albeit at a slower pace. This is
the result of a debt strategy that focuses on: (i) adhering to the ceiling on new non-concessional external
public borrowing established in previous SMPs (US$700 million) and (ii) continuing to partially repay
outstanding public debt. In fact, in recent years, Sudan has limited new external public borrowing,
especially on non-concessional terms (Table 1). Mainly provided by either multilateral or non-Paris Club
bilateral creditors, newly contracted debt was mainly directed to projects in the agriculture, services and
energy sector. Meanwhile, debt disbursements and actual debt service continued at lower levels (Table 2).
The latter remained partial, even to creditors providing new financing. The private sector has neither
tapped, nor repaid, any international debt in decades.

B. Total Public Debt and Its Domestic Component
4.
In recent years, total public debt continued to be on the rise (Figure 3), reaching a stock of
SDG215 billion at end-2012. This corresponds to 97 and 170 percent of GDP in nominal and PV terms,
respectively (Table 6). The main driver was the rise in foreign currency denominated debt. Yet, on account
of primary deficits continuously financed by domestic resources, the domestic component has also recently
been on the rise, albeit to a still relatively small level (14.2 percent of GDP).

DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
C. Underlying Assumptions
5.
This DSA update generally builds on the same assumptions as the 2012 DSA (Box 1).3
Changes arise from newly available information emanating from the actual 2012 outcome (especially the
stronger persistence of the deterioration of post-secession fundamentals and difficulties tapping external
financing) and other developments relevant for the medium-term outlook. The most notable change is the
implementation of a 3½-year oil-revenue sharing agreement between Sudan and South Sudan. This is
expected to lead to the resumption of oil exports through Sudan and associated payments, beginning in
mid-2013. As in the 2012 DSA, this DSA update also refrains from presenting alternative scenarios based on
speculations about the timing and magnitude of arrears clearance, possible external debt relief or debt
apportionment between Sudan and South Sudan.4,5

3

Debt data have provided by the Sudanese authorities, complemented by information obtained during the 2011 external debt
reconciliation exercise as well as Fund and World Bank staffs’ estimates.
4

Sudan is potentially eligible for debt relief under different initiatives including the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC)
Initiative, since it is included in the list of ring-fenced countries. Sudan has made good progress toward finalizing the technical work
required to advance towards the decision point of the HIPC Initiative. The government has taken three important steps: (i) it has
reconciled over 90 percent of the end-2010 external debt stock in collaboration with creditors; (ii) Parliament approved an
ambitious interim-PRSP in June 2012; and (iii) Sudan has implemented 13 Staff-Monitored Programs (SMPs) with the Fund
since 1997, establishing a sound track record of cooperation on economic policies and payments. Besides, Sudan has continuously
indicated its desire to continue demonstrate a strong commitment to cooperation with the Fund on policies and the payment of
arrears, preferably also formally in the framework of a new SMP.
5

Prior to the secession, Sudan and South Sudan agreed on the so-called zero option plan, under which Sudan would retain the
entire external debt, provided that (i) South Sudan joined Sudan in outreach efforts for debt relief for Sudan, and (ii) the
international community gave firm commitments to the delivery of debt relief within two years. Absent such a commitment, Sudan’s
external debt would be apportioned based on a formula to be determined. As part of the discussions that led to the resumption of
oil shipments and associated oil-related-payments, the beginning of the two-year period was reset, implying a deadline in the

D. Results
6.
This DSA Update broadly confirms the 2012 DSA outcome.6 Also, alternative scenario and
standard bound tests again fully back up the robustness of the external and public debt baseline
scenarios.7 Some ratios experience some level shift effects, mainly due to an interaction between updated
paths of the denominators and an assumed slowdown of new external borrowing in the face of growing
challenges to the economy from continued adverse macroeconomic developments and further
accumulation of external arrears. In addition, especially PV terms reflect the larger-than-expected currency
depreciation in 2012.
i)

External sector DSA baseline scenario. Most debt ratios continue to breach their
indicative thresholds for poor performers through the long term, Tables 3 and 4).8
Most debt ratios show a declining trend, but persist at very high levels (rather
because of the growing stock of unaddressed arrears than because of the
accumulation of new debt). Debt-to-export ratios show little tendency toward
improvement, because of a dwindling export base built on natural resources
(especially oil and gold), underlining the need for economic diversification.

would have at least a 25 percent chance of having a prolonged debt distress episode in the coming year.

ii)

External sector DSA robustness checks. The alternative scenario is a financing scenario
involving a 2 percentage point higher interest rate (Table 5, Scenario A1). The
outcome does not deviate much from the baseline, suggesting that Sudan’s external

second half of 2014 or early 2015. However, agreement on any debt apportionment may prove to be very difficult since it would
likely require extensive negotiations to reach a consensus view from Sudan’s entire pool of creditors.
6

This worsening of the debt ratios relative to those in pre-2012 DSAs mainly owes to the secession-induced deterioration in
fundamentals and to the more complete external debt portfolio compiled at the 2011 reconciliation exercise.
7

With secession-induced structural breaks in the time series undermining the validity of the historical scenario, this DSA update
follows the 2012 DSA in omitting the historical scenario (in which the main variables that determine debt dynamics are assumed to
remain at their 10-year historical averages).
8

According to the World Bank Country Policy and Institutions Assessment (CPIA), Sudan is a weak performer, i.e. a country with
poor quality of policies and institutions. Its average CPIA rating for 2010–12 is 2.37 on a scale from 1 to 6 and below the operational
cutoff of 3.25 for medium performers.

debt is relatively resilient to new public loan terms. This is not surprising since
Sudan’s debt dynamics are driven less by new debt accumulation than by the stock
of outstanding debt and arrears. The bound tests (Table 5, Scenarios B1 to B6) assess
Sudan’s vulnerability to a range of unexpected external shocks. They show that the
PV of debt-to-GDP, debt-to-revenue and debt service-to-revenue ratios are most
vulnerable to a one-time depreciation shock, whereas the PV of debt-to-exports and
debt service-to-exports ratio are most vulnerable to an exports shock.
iii)

Public sector DSA baseline scenario. Public debt stock and service indicators mirror their
external counterparts (Figure 5 and Table 6). They depict a declining trend, but converge
to relatively high levels in the long term.

iv)

Public sector DSA robustness checks. The alternative scenarios are a no-reform scenario
(involving a primary balanced persisting at the 2013 level) and a permanent growth shock
(Table 7, Scenarios A1–A2). Both scenarios underline how crucially public debt
sustainability depends on improving fiscal soundness and above all growth, particularly in
the non-oil economy. The bound tests (Table 7, Scenarios B1–B5) show the vulnerability of
public debt ratios to especially a one-time 30 percent real depreciation in the coming year
(B4).

CONCLUSIONS
7.
As in the previous 2012 DSA, Sudan continues to be assessed in debt distress. Overall public
sector debt dynamics remain unsustainable. Throughout the long term, all external debt burden ratios
remain well above their respective indicative thresholds (except for the debt service-to-revenue ratio in the
middle of the projection horizon, and the present value of the debt-GDP ratio which dips slightly below at
the extreme end of the period).
8.
To reduce external debt to a sustainable level and regain access to external financing, Sudan
needs to:

i)

re-engage with key creditors and donors. This is a necessary step towards a comprehensive
arrears clearance and debt relief strategy, especially since even after traditional debt relief
according to Paris Club Naples Terms9 and HIPC Initiative assistance, Sudan will likely be
left with a sizeable stock of external debt. This will either need to be serviced or addressed
through further assistance (such as Paris Club beyond-HIPC bilateral,10 Multilateral Debt
Relief Initiative (MDRI) on remaining eligible debt of IDA and the African Development

9

Paris Club members provide a reduction of pre-cutoff date bilateral non-official development assistance and commercial debt up
to 67 percent in present value terms. Other non-multilateral creditors generally join with comparable actions.

Fund (AfDF)11 or MDRI-like12 debt relief). The qualification for debt relief will be announced
at the appropriate time.
ii)

continue to cooperate with the IMF on economic policies and payments. A track record of
sound macro policies, especially under a new SMP, and regular payments in line with
Sudan’s repayment capacity is critical to secure access to possible debt relief under the
Enhanced HIPC Initiative and MDRI.

iii)

pursue prudent public debt management. The debt management strategy should continue
to limit borrowing on non-concessional terms as much as possible (since it further
increases the future debt burden, undermining debt sustainability even after possible debt
relief) and secure foreign support on highly concessional terms to finance necessary
development and infrastructure expenditures.

iv)

effectively address debt and macroeconomic vulnerabilities. To this aim, Sudan needs to
focus on strengthening its external and fiscal stance and on providing a more stable
political and business environment.

11

MDRI is provided by the IDA, AfDF, and IMF at the HIPC Initiative’s completion point. Eligible for MDRI assistance are debt
obligations contracted before end-December 2003 for IDA and end-December 2004 for the IMF and AfDB that are still outstanding
at the HIPC Initiative’s completion point date. All of Sudan’s current debt to IDA and the AFDF qualifies for MDRI since it has been
contracted prior to the cut-off date.
12

None of Sudan’s debt to the Fund would be eligible for MDRI debt relief. However, following the approach developed for Liberia’s
debt relief, “MDRI-like” debt relief could be provided if the necessary financing is secured at the appropriate time.”

Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions 2013–33
Natural resources. After the secession-induced loss of ¾ of oil production oil now accounts for only 4 to
7 percent of GDP, 25 to 35 percent of government revenue, and 35 to 40 percent of exports. At the same time,
there has been an increase in gold production, with gold exports having tripled since 2009. The price outlook
for major commodity exports is guided by the IMF’s latest World Economic Outlook (WEO) figures for the
medium term and the World Bank’s Commodity Market Review for the longer term. Overall, prices are expected
to remain stable and average around US$83 per barrel for Sudanese crude over the medium term before
settling to around US$79 per barrel in the longer term.
Oil deal. In recent months, Sudan and South Sudan have implemented an oil-revenue-sharing agreement,
which is expected to lead to the resumption of oil exports and associated payments from South Sudan to
Sudan around mid-2013. The agreement includes a 3½-year Transitional Financial Arrangement (TSA), involving
payments of $15/bl by South Sudan, until a ceiling of approximately $3 billion is reached. It also involves a
payment of about $10/bl for the use of Sudanese pipelines and related infrastructure. This transit fee is
assumed to continue indefinitely.
Real sector. The real GDP growth rate is expected to gradually increase to 4.4 percent until 2017 and then to
average 4.8 percent over 2018–32. Given the smaller post-secession oil sector, real GDP growth will mainly
reflect non-oil GDP growth in the presence of renewed macroeconomic stabilization, new attempts at structural
reform and finance-constrained low infrastructure investments. Inflation, as measured by the GDP deflator, is a
projected to grow in line with CPI inflation over the long term, implying stable terms of trade. After averaging
20.3 percent over the medium term, inflation will gradually come down to 6 percent by 2033.
Fiscal sector and domestic debt. The projected fiscal deficit averages 1.3 percent of GDP during the
period 2013–18, reflecting a combination of factors, including: (i) some improvements in tax revenue collection;
(ii) a progressive increase in oil revenues; (iii) the continuation of current public wage and employment policies;
(ii) a gradual phasing out of fuel subsidies; (iv) slight decrease of current spending shares on transfers to states;
and (v) rising capital expenditure outlays. During 2018–32, the fiscal deficit is expected to average some
2.6 percent of GDP, reflecting (i) a gradual increase in tax revenues, against the backdrop of decreasing oil
revenues, (ii) the continuation of current expenditure policies, and (iii) increasing interest payments. Owing to
continued limited access to international financing, the projected budget deficit wills will be financed mostly
domestically, assuming no further accumulation of arrears.
External sector and financing. The balance of payments is expected to benefit from export growth until 2020
and then to gradually contract, mainly due to waning production of traditional natural resource exports
(notably petroleum and gold) limited development of other exports, and continued limitations on foreign direct
investment, aid inflows and access to international financing. Stronger export growth in the medium term
contributes to a decline in the current account deficit (incl. official transfers), and a contraction in imports.
External debt. Reflecting continued limited access to international finance and a deteriorating debt service
capacity, disbursements of new loans are projected at about 0.5 percent of GDP during 2013–33. In line with the
recent portfolio of new contracted debt, the share of new concessional loans is kept at around one third.
Starting in 2012, Sudan is assumed to remain current on debt service falling due on disbursed outstanding debt
(including new borrowing), but continue to fail to service obligations arising from the stock of arrears (i.e., late
interest and penalties as well as arrears themselves).

1/ The most extreme stress test is the test that yields the highest ratio in 2023. In figure b. it corresponds to a Onetime depreciation shock; in c. to a Exports shock; in d. to a One-time depreciation shock; in e. to a Exports shock and
in figure f. to a One-time depreciation shock
2/ The secession-induced structural breaks in the time series undermine the historical scenario, w hich is therefore
omitted from the figures.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Sudan
September 20, 2013
I would like to update Directors on recent information and data that have become available to
staff since the staff report was circulated to the Executive Board on September 6. The new
information does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.
Political Situation: Discussion between Sudan and South Sudan in early September
averted a complete shutdown of oil production that was expected to take place as of
September 6. The last minute agreement paved the way for a steady implementation of the
Cooperation Agreement that was signed between the two countries, including continuing oil
production.
2.
Oil Agreement. By mid-September, the Sudanese authorities received oil payments
from South Sudan amounting to about US$ 65 million as a result of shipments of crude oil
from Port Sudan.
3.
Payments to the Fund. The authorities made last week a fourth payment to the Fund
this year for an amount equivalent to SDR 550 thousand. This brings the total amount of
payments this year to SDR 2.9 million, compared to obligations falling due of
SDR 2.3 million.
4.
Exchange restrictions: The authorities have informed staff this week that they have
removed an exchange restriction on tax certification requirement in respect to transfers
abroad of profits generated by enterprises other than joint stock companies. Also, the
authorities informed staff that they issued a circular to clarify that there are no limitations on
sale of foreign exchange by banks.
5.
Inflation. The consumer price inflation continued its downward trend, dropping to
22.9 percent at end-August, against a peak of 47.9 percent in April 2013. This significant
deceleration of inflation mainly reflects continued lower food prices and transportation costs,
as well as modest growth in monetary aggregates.
6.
Revised WEO Oil Prices. The WEO oil price projections were recently revised
upward. The revisions for Sudan will translate into higher prices per barrel (US$4.4 per
barrel for 2013 and an average of $3.7 per barrel for 2014–16). Due to the limited role of the
oil sector in post-secession Sudan, these changes, however, will lead to modest
improvements in the fiscal and external current account balances, within an estimated range
of 0.2–0.4 percentage point of GDP.

2
7.

Next steps:
a) Annual Meetings. A Sudanese delegation is expected to visit Washington to
attend the Annual Meetings. Staff will take the opportunity to inquire about
the status of the reform package, and discuss prospects for a successor Staff
Monitored Program.
b) Technical Working Group. Fund and World Bank staffs plan to organize the
7th Technical Working Group at the margins of the Annual Meetings. At that
meeting, representatives from the African Union, as well as Sudan and South
Sudan will be invited to brief on progress made on the joint debt relief
outreach activities. In this context, the Presidents of Sudan and South Sudan
as well as the Chairman of the African High Level Implementation Panel
(AUHIP) President Thabo Mbeki have recently signed a letter to the
international community to request support for debt relief for Sudan and the
lifting of unilateral sanctions.
c) Next mission. Staff is planning to visit Khartoum in late October to discuss
the 2014 budget. If by then, the corrective policies discussed in the staff report
are in place, staff may then also initiate discussions for a successor Staff
Monitored Program.
d) Resident representative: A new resident representative is expected to take up
his assignment in early October.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
October 4, 2013

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Sudan
On September 20, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with Sudan.
Sudan’s economic performance in 2012 was unfavorable despite the introduction in June 2012 of
a package of reforms. Non-oil real GDP growth slowed to 4.6 percent, inflation rose to
44.4 percent by the end of the year, largely driven by the monetization of the fiscal deficit and a
weakening exchange rate, and the gap between the official and curb market exchange rates
remained at about 20 percent by end-December. The budget posted a deficit of 3.8 percent of
GDP, as a result of a significant fall in oil revenues in the aftermath of South Sudan’s secession
in July 2011. The external current account deficit widened significantly to 10.8 percent of GDP,
reflecting the large drop in oil exports. Gross international reserves, supported by loans and
grants, however, increased to 1.9 months of prospective imports.
Economic conditions remained weak in the first half of 2013 despite some signs of improvement.
Year-on-year inflation declined to 22.9 percent at end-August, in part on account of a sharp drop
in food prices. Fiscal performance exceeded budget projections on account of an improvement in
revenue collections and good expenditure controls—the deficit reached 1.3 percent of GDP
compared with a budget target of 1.6 percent of GDP. Growth in monetary aggregates slowed
significantly from the end of 2012. The gap between the official and curb market rates, however,
remained at 20 percent, largely due to the uncertainty surrounding the implementation of the oil
agreement with South Sudan.
The outlook for 2013 and the medium term are unfavorable, absent a new package of corrective
measures. Non-oil real GDP growth is projected to slow further to 2.3 percent in 2013, and to
remain below potential at about 3 percent over the medium term. Inflation would decelerate
somewhat, but would remain in double-digit levels, reflecting the monetization of the budget

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

deficit, as well as the continued depreciation of the Sudanese pound. While the overall budget
deficit is projected to narrow over the next two years, mainly reflecting the impact of oil transit
fees and the transitional financial arrangement with South Sudan, it is projected to widen again in
subsequent years. The outlook is subject to significant risks—the main risk relates to the
protracted economic and political transition in the period leading up to the 2015 presidential
election and unsettled regional civil conflicts that could result in weaker growth and higher
inflation.
Current economic policies have to be strengthened to reestablish macroeconomic stability and
guard against downside risks. The recent agreement with South Sudan provides a unique
opportunity to implement bold corrective policies. An immediate priority is to address fiscal
imbalances. While most of the adjustment effort will need to focus on reducing expenditures by
reducing transfers to states, and gradually phasing out subsidies, tax revenues will also need to
be increased, in part through streamlining tax exemptions and rationalizing tax incentives.
Monetary policy should be geared towards combating inflation; a key requirement in this regard
is formulation a clear mandate for the Central Bank to facilitate its operational independence.
Immediate unification of the exchange rates and greater exchange rate flexibility is crucial to
facilitate the required external adjustment and to safeguard and rebuild official exchange
reserves. In light of Sudan’s large stock of overdue external debt obligations, the government
should work closely with South Sudan, as part of the recently signed Comprehensive Agreement,
on reaching out to creditors to elicit their support for comprehensive debt relief, given the
approaching deadline of the “zero option” for debt apportionment. In the meantime, closer
cooperation with the IMF is important to re-establish a track record of cooperation with the IMF
on policies and payments, which in due time would facilitate debt relief.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors noted that Sudan continues to face daunting economic challenges since the
secession of South Sudan. Directors welcomed the measures put together by the authorities to
address the imbalances but stressed that swift and steady implementation is necessary to reverse
the downside trends, restore macroeconomic stability, and enhance medium-term prospects for
growth. The recent agreement between Sudan and South Sudan provides a supporting
environment to implement bold corrective policies, creating the conditions for a successor
staff-monitored program.
Directors emphasized that fiscal consolidation, within a sound medium-term framework, is
crucial. They noted that the 2014 budget represents an important step to resume the adjustment
path initiated in 2012. They called for measures to broaden the tax base, including streamlining

tax exemptions, rationalizing tax incentives, and taxing gold activities, while improving revenue
administration. On the expenditure side, the focus should be on reducing transfers to states and
gradually phasing out subsidies, while designing a better-targeted social safety net and protecting
capital spending. An adequate public financial management framework will be essential to
strengthen budget preparation and execution.
Directors agreed that monetary policy needs to be tightened to contain inflationary pressures.
They underscored the importance of reining in monetization of the fiscal deficit, and moving
towards operational independence of the central bank. Directors encouraged the authorities to
improve the monetary policy framework by focusing on reserve money as the nominal anchor,
and to eliminate the cap on commercial banks’ holdings of government and central bank
securities. They highlighted the importance of taking steps towards unifying the official foreign
exchange rates and pursuing greater exchange rate flexibility.
Directors emphasized that further progress is needed to enhance financial intermediation to boost
growth and jobs as well as reduce poverty. They welcomed the authorities’ efforts to promote the
microfinance sector. Directors encouraged the authorities to pursue upgrading banking
supervision and compliance to best practice standards, as well as the regulatory frameworks of
insurance and securities markets.
Directors welcomed the completion of the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. They
stressed the importance of stepping up reforms aimed at improving the business environment,
facilitating cross-border trading, and enhancing governance to support sustained and inclusive
growth.
Directors recognized that Sudan is in debt distress and the huge volume of arrears continues to
hinder the country’s access to external financing, which along with technical assistance, is
needed to support the reform agenda. They encouraged the authorities to work closely with
South Sudan, as part of the Comprehensive Agreement, on reaching out to creditors to mobilize
support for debt relief, given the approaching deadline of the “zero option” for debt
apportionment. They also highlighted the need to limit non-concessional borrowing, and called
for continued close cooperation with the Fund on payments and on strong economic policies,
with a view to reaching an early agreement on an SMP and reestablishing a track record.

Statement by Momodou Bamba Saho, Executive Director for Sudan
September 20, 2013
The Sudanese authorities continue to wrestle with the macroeconomic consequences of
the secession of South Sudan in July 2011. High and unsustainable debt levels, together
with the loss of oil revenue and foreign exchange reserves have generated huge economic
imbalances. The authorities are aware of the complicated and challenging economic
policy environment they face in the context of devastating international economic
sanctions which severely constrain Sudan’s access to international financial resources,
border security tensions and other regional conflicts.
Notwithstanding these challenges, my authorities are committed to undertaking necessary
policy adjustments and structural reforms to restore and sustain macroeconomic stability,
as well as enhance inclusive growth. A new comprehensive package of corrective
measures which benefited considerably from consultations with various stakeholders has
almost been finalized. The authorities are awaiting appropriate timing for the
implementation of these measures which will most likely be this fall. In order to succeed
in these endeavors, my authorities appeal to the development partners, including the IMF,
to provide the much needed technical and financial support to facilitate an adequate and
timely response to these challenges. In particular, they appeal to the international
community to assist in the resolution of the debt environment that confronts them.
Economic Developments
The comprehensive package of corrective measures introduced in June 2012 has laid the
ground work for a much-needed adjustment process. Despite the implementation of this
package, economic developments during 2012 remained weak although there are signs of
improvement going forward. Fiscal performance in the first half of 2013 exceeded budget
projections, while inflation is beginning to moderate. Non-oil GDP is estimated to have
grown by 4.6 per cent in 2012, slightly lower than the 6.0 per cent estimated for 2011.
The Implementation Matrix of the Cooperation Agreement between Sudan and South
Sudan, signed in March 2013, not only paved the way for the Sudanese government to
recover part of the much-needed oil revenue lost as a result of the shutdown of oil
production, but it also reduced the political tensions and reactivated bilateral cooperation
thereby creating an opportunity for renewed policy reforms to address the post-secession
challenges. The implementation of the agreement over vital cross-border oil exports has
regrettably not always been smooth and almost collapsed in August this year. However,
this was averted with an agreement reached between the governments of Sudan and
South Sudan that oil will continue to be transported through Sudan's facilities and ports.
Additionally, the two authorities also agreed to honor all bilateral agreements signed - a
development which should somewhat reduce uncertainty and ensure that the contribution
of oil revenue to the Sudanese budget and foreign reserves continues. The Sudanese
authorities are committed to continuing their constructive dialogue with South Sudan in
resolving any outstanding issues. They undertake to work towards strengthening
cooperation between the two countries in a manner that is consistent with their common
interests and peace.

2
Fiscal Policy
My authorities recognize that while the June 2012 package yielded some positive results,
further policy actions are required to adequately address Sudan’s macroeconomic
imbalances and support broad-based and inclusive growth. They agree with IMF staff
that fiscal consolidation should be at the center of their strategy to engineer a sustainable
economic turnaround. In this regard, they are committed to ensure that the 2014 budget
reflects this priority. On the revenues side, the Sudanese authorities are committed to
increasing fiscal revenues through expanding the tax base, strengthening revenue
administration and where feasible through selected tax hikes. Already my authorities
have begun to explore the most efficient way to enhance taxation of gold. The gold
mining sector accounted for about 40 per cent of export earnings in 2012 and this is
projected to increase. Therefore the authorities are approaching taxation reforms in the
industry cautiously to avoid smuggling and disrupting the momentum gained in the
growth of this sector. As and when necessary, my authorities will seek technical
assistance in this regard.
On the expenditure side, the authorities intend to continue gradually phasing out fuel
subsidies bearing in mind the potential inflationary and social impact of such action. This
will require building appropriate social safety net programs to protect the most vulnerable
in the society. Although the authorities recognize the need to streamline transfers to
states, they consider this to be a medium to long term assignment as this may necessitate
some amendments to the legal and constitutional framework that governs state finances.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
My authorities recognize the weakening of monetary conditions since the secession of
South Sudan. This, in part, reflects the increased monetization of the budget deficit which
precipitated inflationary pressures. In this regard, my authorities are committed to refocus
the objective of monetary policy towards combating inflation. Already they have
established a ceiling on the provision of guarantees to the government, undertaken to
limit credit to the government within the legally established ceiling, and slowed down
gold purchases. Additionally, they agree that using reserve money as the monetary anchor
is the best available option for Sudan to strengthen the traction of monetary policy and
contain inflationary pressures.
The Sudanese authorities are fully committed to unifying the exchange rates and adopting
a more flexible exchange rate regime. However, the process has to be gradual to avoid
unintended consequences. It has to be borne in mind that, to a large extent, the multiple
exchange rates enabled prices of essential commodities like medicine, wheat and energy
to remain lower and stable than they would otherwise have been. A unification of
exchange rates, which will most probably result in a depreciation of the Sudanese pound,
can have devastating impact on prices, particularly against the backdrop of parallel fiscal
action of phasing out other direct subsidies. Such an increase in prices can potentially
generate undue social discontent which may worsen the already difficult policy
environment.

3
Article VIII Consultation
My authorities noted the determination by the IMF staff that certain elements of the
Sudanese exchange rate regime give rise to exchange restrictions and multiple currency
practices which are subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII of the IMF’s Articles
of Agreement. Owing to the secession of South Sudan and crippling international
economic sanctions, which severely constrained the Central Bank of Sudan in meeting all
the foreign exchange demand, the authorities had limited options to address the balance
of payments implications – and hence the adoption of these practices.
The Sudanese authorities view these practices as essential short term interventions which
would be phased out as and when economic circumstances permit. For the time being,
they plead with the IMF to grant approval for the retention of the existing exchange
measures as they consider appropriate timing for the gradual removal of exchange rate
practices. They are also willing to consider advice on any other alternative short term
policy interventions provided their potential impact can be robustly ascertained.
External Debt
The Sudanese debt situation is well known and the authorities have been battling this for
some time now. Sudan is in debt distress and the authorities continue to be frustrated by
the slow progress towards debt relief. Sudan has satisfied key technical requirements for
debt relief, including a finalized I-PRSP, a reconciliation of their external debt stock, and
a long track record of economic performance with the IMF evidenced by successful
completion of many Staff Monitored Programs (SMPs). The Sudanese authorities are
committed to step up their efforts for a wider engagement with creditors with the goal of
attaining the much needed debt relief. They would like to avoid the activation of the
“zero option” clause, which may generate needless tensions with South Sudan. With
limited access to multilateral financial assistance, the authorities continue to seek non
concessional support as this is their only source of financing.
Financial Intermediation and Stability
My authorities are appreciative of Sudan’s inclusion in the pilot exercise for enhancing
bilateral financial sector surveillance in low-income countries. They are in broad
agreement with the staff‘s assessment of Sudan’s financial sector. They recognize that
further progress is needed to enhance financial deepening and broaden access to banking
services, together with structural reforms in support of private sector investment. They
also agree with the recommendation to upgrade supervision and compliance in line with
prudential norms. They welcome the technical assistance from the Fund in this regard.
In addition, my authorities are in a process of finalizing new securities market legislation
that will rectify deficiencies identified by the pilot exercise. Good progress has also been
made in putting in place many of the banking sector regulatory reforms called for in the
2004 FSAP, including the provision that banks significantly increase their paid-up
capital, and setting up a dedicated financial stability unit in the Central Bank of Sudan.

4
Conclusion
My authorities face a difficult economic policy environment. Notwithstanding this
environment, they are determined to continue implementing economic reforms to
enhance macroeconomic stability and promote economic activity. They are aware that
part of these reforms should involve strategies to reduce dependency on oil revenue. In
this regard they understand that it is crucial for Sudan to further develop and diversify its
sources of growth and the export base. The authorities are also committed to reforms that
aim at reducing structural and institutional bottlenecks, and investing in infrastructure to
reduce production and distribution costs. This will facilitate improving the business
environment to encourage private sector development. Finally, my authorities are
interested in a successor SMP to continue building a track record of cooperation with the
Fund and hopefully would, pave the way for debt relief, sooner rather than later.
