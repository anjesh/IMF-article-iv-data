IMF Concludes 2002 Article IV Consultation with Ireland
On July 31, 2002, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Ireland.1
Background
Sound economic policies and favorable circumstances supported Ireland’s sustained
economic expansion over the last decade. Real GDP growth averaged above 7 percent in
1991–2001 reflecting: robust external demand; strong labor supply growth based on a young,
educated population and rising female labor force participation; membership in EU and,
subsequently, EMU; substantial foreign direct investment, attracted by policies such as a
favorable business tax regime and wage moderation; and substantial fiscal consolidation.
Unemployment plummeted and per-capita income rose above the EU average. High growth
and fiscal consolidation brought the public debt ratio down to 36½ percent of GDP by end2001.
GDP growth declined in 2001 to almost 6 percent from 11½ percent the year before, reflecting
the global slowdown and the Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) shock as
well as foot-and-mouth disease-related restrictions. However, the current account remained
broadly stable and unemployment only edged up to 4.2 percent (on a claimant count basis) by
May 2002. Moreover, after a sharp decline in the third quarter of 2001, output rose again in the
fourth quarter. Other—as yet uneven—signs of a recovery have been evident in recent
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

months, including rising manufacturing output, retail sales (excluding automobiles), and
consumer and business confidence. The economic slowdown contributed to a reduction in
inflation in 2001 and house prices fell for five consecutive months during September-January.
However, inflation spiked up again in early 2002, mainly due to indirect tax increases, and
house prices rebounded.
The outturn for the general government balance in 2001 of a small surplus (corresponding to
broad structural balance) was significantly weaker than budgeted, in marked contrast to
previous years. Cyclical effects on revenue of the growth slowdown and temporary factors,
such as animal diseases and September 11, contributed to the deterioration as did
expenditure overruns and unexpectedly strong revenue effects from past income tax cuts. The
resulting fiscal expansion in 2001 is estimated at some 2.2 percent of GDP. The path for
medium-term structural balances was also shifted down sharply in the 2002 Stability
Programme to a deficit of some 1 percent of GDP in 2003-04 from a surplus of about 4 percent
of GDP in 2003 in the previous Programme. This deterioration reflected both higher
expenditure growth and lower structural revenues.
The Fund’s outlook is for GDP to rise by 3.2 percent in 2002, supported by steady growth in
private consumption. Exports are projected to accelerate by mid-year, although the recovery in
private investment would take somewhat longer. Given negative short-term real interest rates,
monetary conditions are expected to remain easy, even if the ECB tightens monetary policy or
the euro appreciates moderately. Nevertheless, price and wage inflation are expected to ease
somewhat this year due to ebbing demand pressures. Following a rebound in the latter part of
2002 and 2003, output growth over the medium term is projected to trend down as labor force
growth slows reflecting demographics and already low unemployment, and as labor
productivity declines with income convergence and the return of foreign direct investment to
more normal levels after the bursting of the ICT bubble.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the authorities for Ireland’s impressive economic performance, reflected
in sustained gains in income and employment over the last decade, and rooted in sound
economic policies, a skilled workforce and flexible labor market, and an investor-friendly
environment. They observed that the economy appears to have weathered the global
slowdown relatively well—partly due to the combination of a weak euro, supportive
macroeconomic policies, and a high level of resource utilization prior to the shock.
Directors noted that, notwithstanding the weakness in the domestic technology sector, the
economic outlook is broadly favorable, with growth expected to pick up in the second half of
2002, in line with a recovery in world demand. However, they cautioned that there are
significant downside risks to the global recovery, and that the continued appreciation of the
euro combined with relatively high inflation and labor costs could adversely affect Ireland’s
competitiveness—particularly in the traditional employment-intensive industries—and the
strength of the recovery. These factors could also pose a risk—albeit likely a manageable
one—to the financial sector.

Directors expressed concern about the sharp deterioration in the structural fiscal balance in
2001, and the indicators that pointed to an expansionary fiscal stance in 2002, after adjusting
for one-time measures and given the risk of revenue underperformance. Directors would have
preferred a neutral fiscal stance, that is, an unchanged structural fiscal balance, in 2002,
particularly against the background of the easy monetary conditions, but agreed that measures
to unwind the stimulus are not advisable at this time in view of the uncertainty of the recovery
and the still-sound fiscal position. However, they stressed that public expenditure, particularly
wages, should be held to budgeted levels, and that fiscal policy should, at a minimum, be
neutral in 2003.
Directors expressed concern over the marked deterioration in the medium-term fiscal outlook,
which, unless checked, could risk Ireland’s growth prospects. They recommended that the
general government position be in structural balance over the medium-term, compared with
the projected deficits of about 1 percent of GDP. Such a policy would help sustain investor
confidence and provide a margin against possible lower structural revenues or higher fiscal
costs. Moreover, in the event of adverse shocks, it would permit the full operation of the
automatic stabilizers without breaching the 3 percent deficit limit of the Stability and Growth
Pact.
In the discussion on measures to achieve structural balance, Directors—while welcoming the
authorities’ efforts to develop multi-year departmental spending envelopes—considered that a
formal medium-term fiscal framework would serve to improve policy predictability. Such a
framework could include an overall fiscal constraint, multi-year spending limits, and safeguards
to protect capital spending from budget pressures. In this connection, Directors cautioned
against rapidly increasing public spending, and recommended that rigorous value for money
criteria, with clearly defined, monitorable outputs, be applied to all spending programs. They
welcomed the use of Public Private Partnerships and encouraged further private sector
involvement in the provision of public services. Directors emphasized that greater fiscal
transparency will be key for the success of a medium-term framework, and some suggested
that the authorities undertake a fiscal Report on Standards and Codes.
In considering policies on the revenue side, and, in particular, should a case emerge for
additional spending, Directors noted that it would be necessary to find efficient sources of
additional tax revenue. There was broad agreement that measures to widen the tax base are
preferable to increasing tax rates, and that there is greater scope for user fees. Targeted
transfers could offset any adverse effects of these measures on the poor. Directors cautioned
against excessive increases in marginal taxes on labor, given possible adverse effects on
labor supply and competitiveness.
Directors underscored the risks to the medium-term fiscal position as well as to
competitiveness from public sector wage pressures. They urged a cautious approach in
phasing in the pay increases agreed under the recent benchmarking agreement and many
Directors suggested that any future national wage agreement be divorced from reliance on
fiscal concessions—noting that negotiating expenditure commitments could run counter to
needed improvements in public expenditure management. Directors noted that continued
dialogue among the social partners could be helpful for maintaining social consensus and

-4–
establishing wage norms, but underscored that wages should be permitted to reflect market
forces, including on the downside and across skill categories.
Directors agreed that strengthening competition through regulatory reform and privatization is
key to securing high growth over the medium term. They welcomed the strengthening of the
Competition Authority and emphasized the importance of further efforts to liberalize regulatory
restrictions, limit the influence of vested interests, and reduce anti-competitive practices,
including in the professions and the public services.
Directors noted that the capitalization of the banking system appears to provide an adequate
cushion against possible risks to asset quality. Nevertheless, they emphasized that
supervisory authorities should ensure that capital and provisions remain adequate in the event
of a deterioration in unemployment, company finances, or property prices. Close monitoring of
systemic risks and the speedy unification of financial sector regulation will also be important. In
addition, Directors encouraged the new, single regulatory authority—when it is established—to
give priority to strengthening insurance supervision.
Directors commended the progress made in the provision of statistics. They suggested that the
priority should now be to further improve the timeliness and coverage of certain data,
particularly on earnings, national accounts, and sectoral balance sheets. Directors welcomed
the steps being taken by Ireland to curb money laundering and combat the financing of
terrorism.
Directors welcomed the increase in the allocation for official development assistance and the
authorities’ commitment to achieve the U.N. target of 0.7 percent of GNP by 2007.

Public Information Notices (PINs) are issued, (i) at the request of a member country, following the
