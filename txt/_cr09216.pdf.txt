EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The discussions and the proposed program focused on debt and fiscal sustainability in a poverty
reduction context, exchange rate alignment, financial sector issues, and structural reforms to
improve competitiveness and broaden economic growth.
Background. Economic growth accelerated in 2007, driven by large foreign direct investment
(FDI) inflows. Inflationary pressures intensified, mainly due to higher food and oil prices. Fiscal
policy continued to be expansionary. The external current account deficit widened significantly,
mainly on account of imports of capital goods and services linked to FDI. Large capital inflows
financed the external position. External competitiveness improved through further real effective
depreciation of the Djibouti franc and implementation of structural reforms.
Authorities’ views
•

Economic growth will continue to be based on the ability to attract large FDI flows. To
expand growth beyond an enclave around the port and other large projects, the authorities are
implementing social policies targeting education and health, and are strengthening the
regulatory framework for the development of the private sector. Inflation is being fought
mainly by establishing limits on commercial margins and eliminating taxes on basic food
items.

•

Fiscal policy is anchored in the medium-term objectives of balancing the budget while
increasing poverty reducing expenditures. The 2008 budget law provides for the introduction
of a value-added tax (VAT) in 2009.

•

The financial sector is rapidly expanding. The authorities are aware of the need to
strengthen the regulatory and supervisory framework, and look forward to the
recommendations of the forthcoming Financial Sector Assessment Program.

•

The exchange rate system has long provided stability for the country. The authorities see
merit in maintaining the currency board arrangement at an unchanged parity.
Competitiveness would improve through structural reforms aimed at increasing productivity
and reducing costs, including by restructuring the main public utilities.

Staff recommendations
•

Fiscal consolidation is critical to improve sustainability and finance the poverty reduction
strategy. This requires actions to broaden the tax base and to contain current expenditure.

•

The exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals. The staff concurs with maintaining
the currency board arrangement at an unchanged parity, and urges the authorities to speed up
the implementation of fiscal and structural measures to address the competitiveness problem.
Streamlining the utilities sector and strengthening the labor market and commercial
transactions regulatory framework would also increase productivity and contain inflation.

•

Staff supports the authorities’ request for a new three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF). The design of the PRGF-supported program is aligned with the authorities’
poverty reduction strategy, and aims at creating fiscal space to finance poverty reduction
expenditures while consolidating the fiscal position and accelerating structural reforms.

5
I. BACKGROUND
1.
The political situation remains stable, despite renewed tension at the border with
Eritrea. President Guelleh was reelected in 2005 for a second six-year term. The ruling party’s
coalition won all seats in the February 2008 parliamentary elections as the opposition boycotted
the polls. The prime minister and the minister of finance were reappointed to the new cabinet
formed in March 2008. Renewed stress in the relations with Eritrea resulted in troop
deployments and, in June 2008, border clashes resulting in several casualties. Nevertheless, the
risk of escalation appears limited and a prompt and peaceful resolution is likely.
2.
The 2008 Article IV consultation and program discussions were held against the
backdrop of growing economic activity and improved prospects following large inflows of
foreign direct investment (FDI). Djibouti’s

only limited employment opportunities and the
development of an export sector is hampered
by the high domestic cost of inputs.
3.
The authorities have elaborated a new poverty reduction strategy (PRS) and are
requesting a new Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement to
support it. The new PRS is critical for anchoring the reform program and unlocking donor
support, spreading the benefits of growth by encouraging private sector development. A
detailed account of the PRS is contained in the new Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP) prepared with the assistance of World Bank and IMF staff, which has been published
on the website of the Ministry of Finance (MoF).1 A new Fund-supported program would
lend credibility to the PRS, anchor it in a stable macroeconomic framework, help expand the
institutional and technical capacity for its implementation, and help close the financing gap
exacerbated by the food and oil price shocks. To mobilize the support of their development
partners, the authorities intend to hold a donors’ conference in November 2008. Limited
available data indicates that progress toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals
(MDG) remains limited, notwithstanding the advances made in improving education,
reducing child mortality, and developing a comprehensive national strategy to combat
HIV/AIDS and other diseases.

The PRSP and corresponding JSAN will be issued to the Board at a later date.

Since 1990, Djibouti has had two Fund-supported programs and two
staff-monitored programs (SMPs). Under the 1996–99 Stand-By Arrangement, progress
was made in reducing macroeconomic imbalances. Under the 1999–2002 PRGF, tax and
pension reforms advanced, but progress was limited in adopting structural reforms to
improve external competitiveness. Only one review was completed under the one-year SMP
in 2004 as the government was unable to maintain fiscal discipline or implement the reform
agenda against the backdrop of a presidential election period. Quantitative fiscal targets
under the July–December 2005 SMP were largely met, and all key structural benchmarks
have now been met.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
5.
Macroeconomic performance improved significantly, but inflationary pressure is
intensifying. Despite a substantial acceleration of economic growth, Djibouti still lags
behind the average of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Real GDP growth accelerated from
4.8 percent in 2006 to 5.3 percent in 2007 (Table 1), driven mainly by FDI concentrated in
the construction and port services sectors. The share of investment in GDP grew
from 23 percent in 2005 to about 42 percent in 2007 (of which slightly more than half is in
the form of FDI). This rapid expansion, combined with the surge in food and oil import
prices, pushed inflation from 3.5 percent in 2006 to 13.9 percent year-on-year in June 2008.
In response, the authorities have eliminated consumption taxes on five basic food items, and
reached agreement with importers and retailers to cap their profit margins on these and other
basic items.

Fiscal policy remained expansionary. The overall deficit remained at
about 2.5 percent of GDP in 2007, even as the basic fiscal deficit (which excludes externally
financed revenue and expenditure) narrowed from 7.2 percent in 2006 to 4.9 percent in 2007
(Table 2). Tax revenue declined by about 1 percent of GDP, as a result of tax exemptions
granted to new investments and sluggish job creation. This decline was offset by an
exceptional collection of overdue taxes, largely from the Electricity Company (EDD).
Current expenditure declined from 30 percent of GDP in 2006 to about 26.5 percent in 2007,
reflecting the non-recurrence of extraordinary outlays in 2006 associated with the regional
elections and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) summit.
Thus, the slight rise in the overall deficit in 2007 is explained by the large increase
(3.7 percent of GDP) in public investment. Most non-Paris Club government external arrears
outstanding at end-2006 have been repaid, but the transitory accumulation of new arrears to
multilateral official creditors led to disbursement delays of some loans.2 Preliminary
information indicates that new external arrears, including with multilateral official creditors,
have accumulated during the first half of 2008. External public and publicly guaranteed debt
remained at about 60 percent of GDP.
7.
After remaining stagnant for several years, credit to the private sector increased
by 23 percent in 2007 (Table 4), owing in part to a real estate and construction boom and
competition from recently

from 17.4 to 8.1 percent at
end-2007 (Table 11), reflecting the entrance of three new banks. Asset quality has improved
through the reduction of nonperforming loans and the increase in the loan portfolio.
Profitability remained high, despite increased competition. Greater confidence in the
currency board and in the banking system has also led to a decrease in dollarization from
52.4 percent of total bank liabilities in 2006 to 51.4 percent in 2007, reducing financial
vulnerability. The arrival of three new foreign banks in 2006–07, increasing the number of
institutions from two to five, has fostered competition by reducing interest rate spreads and
increasing the range of financial instruments (Box 1).

See Appendix I ¶53.

9
Box 1. Reform of the Financial Sector
Djibouti’s financial system is dominated by
a banking sector characterized, until
recently, by a very narrow focus on
short-term trade operations, that did not
provide an adequate basis for the
development of the private sector. As a
consequence, financial intermediation remains
weak as reflected in the relatively low level of
credit to the private sector as a percent of GDP.
High market concentration (two banks account
for 95 percent of the country’s total assets),
weak enforcement of creditor rights, and the
absence of comprehensive information on
borrowers, keep lending risks high.

The entrance of three new banks in the past two years, however, has increased competition among banks,
resulting in lower intermediation spreads and new banking services. The authorities are closely working with banks to
expand their range of financial products and services (such as automated teller machines, Islamic products, and
products for small and medium-size enterprises). A shift has already occurred away from short-term foreign trade
financing instruments to the incipient development of a mortgage market, linked to the recent real estate and
construction boom. This renewed competition largely accounts for the 10 percent annual growth in deposits at
end-2007, prompted by the authorities’ efforts to increase bancarization by reaching new customers via innovative
products, and to attract depositors from neighboring countries to develop a regional financial hub.

The banking system’s growing size and range of instruments has also raised the bar for the Central Bank of
Djibouti’s (CBD) regulatory and supervisory resources and standards. In the coming months, the number of banks
expected to operate in Djibouti will increase to eight, with very diverse capital origins and regulatory structures.
Furthermore, unlike the previous situation, in which the CBD could entrust the supervisory authorities from the parent
institution (France) to oversee the global operations of the only two financial groups operating in the country, some of
the new institutions do not have strong home supervisory and regulatory agencies.
The microfinance sector remains at an embryonic stage. The Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) places great
emphasis on building the capacity of micro-credit associations, to be transformed into genuine microfinance institutions
(MFIs). The MFIs are expected to develop a range of new services including micro-insurance and micro-transfers,
which will significantly boost household access to microfinance (currently only 4 percent of the population benefits
from microcredit).

The widening current account deficit reflects mainly a surge in imports financed
by foreign investment, but also the increase in food and oil prices. The external current
account shifted from a small surplus in 2003 to a deficit of about 25 percent of GDP in 2007
(Table 3), but this has been more than offset by the large capital and financial account
surplus, resulting in a small increase in gross official reserves to US$130 million at end-2007
(equivalent to a currency board cover of 116 percent). This increase, however, lagged behind
imports, thus resulting in a reduction of the import cover to less than two months. The real
effective exchange rate (REER) has depreciated by a cumulative of 24 percent in 2001–07,
relative to its 2000 average, reflecting mainly the weakening of the U.S. dollar. Nevertheless,
a variety of indicators suggest that competitiveness remains low. Electricity, labor, and other
domestic production costs are high, while skill level is low, and the institutional environment
is weak.
9.
Significant progress has been made in implementing structural reforms. A new
Labor Code came into force in 2006, a physical audit of the civil service was completed in
2007, the three key pending structural benchmarks of the SMP were completed (see Table 9),
and a PRSP was prepared with assistance from World Bank and IMF staff. In particular,
reform of the civil service has advanced with the completion of the physical audit and by the
recent establishment of a single registry of civil servants. An assessment of the anti-money
laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/FT) system was conducted by the
Fund’s Legal Department (LEG) in 2007, in the context of a forthcoming Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP). The authorities have started to reform the social safety system,
by merging two of the three pension funds in January 2008. In the area of statistics, the
Fund’s Statistics Department (STA) provided technical assistance (TA) to improve balance
of payments and monetary statistics, while the Fund’s Monetary and Capital Markets
Department (MCM) provided TA to implement the International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) at the CBD.

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
10.
The discussions focused on three key areas: (a) debt and fiscal sustainability in a
poverty reduction context; (b) financial sector issues; and (c) exchange rate alignment and
the role of structural reforms to improve competitiveness and broaden economic growth.
These areas, as well as issues related to strengthening institutional capacity, particularly in
the area of statistics, are relevant both in the context of the Article IV consultation and the
program to be supported by a PRGF arrangement.
A. Outlook and Risks
11.
Short- and medium-term growth prospects remain strong, driven by a solid
pipeline of large investment projects (Tables 5 and 8). These projects are part of the
government’s strategy to

2008 and by about 7 percent a
year in 2009–13. Inflation is
expected to be slightly above 8 percent in 2008, but would decline gradually thereafter as
world food and oil prices ease. The fiscal stance would tighten substantially to reach a
balanced position by 2011. After peaking at 33 percent of GDP in 2008, the current account
deficit is projected to narrow gradually to about 23 percent by 2011. Since Djibouti cannot
pay its external arrears and meet its financing needs, external financial assistance under the
program from the Fund and donors will be essential to filling the 2008 financing gap
estimated at US$37 million (2.13 percent of GDP) (Table 3). After accelerating to 35 percent
in 2008 due to the low starting point, private sector credit growth will decline progressively
to an average rate of about 20 percent over the medium term. While broadly agreeing with
the staff’s medium-term outlook, the authorities flagged the uncertainties associated with
food and oil prices.
12.
The main downside risks to this outlook relate to Djibouti’s vulnerability to
external economic and political shocks. Recent increases in food and oil prices have
negatively impacted the country’s projected external position. The projected increase in the
current account deficit will be financed only in part by projected FDI and other financial

13
inflows, thus weakening Djibouti’s external position in the absence of additional external
support. The authorities are also concerned about food security. Aside from temporary
measures to limit the pass-through of international food prices to domestic consumers, the
authorities are planning to diversify food imports by tapping new and less expensive external
sources, and to increase domestic agricultural production by developing the rural water
supply, providing credit to agriculture, and leasing agricultural land in Sudan and Ethiopia.
Finally, a worsening of the security situation in Somalia or Eritrea could adversely affect
Djibouti’s development prospects.
B. Fiscal Policy
13.
Fiscal policy is geared toward increasing the revenue base, containing current
expenditure and improving budget management, in order to release resources to
finance the PRS without compromising fiscal sustainability or competitiveness. A
unified and integrated tax department at the ministry of finance, including its collection
enforcement unit, has greatly improved tax administration, resulting in a surge of over
300 percent in tax recovery in 2007. In addition, the authorities intend to review the overall
tax framework and streamline tax exemptions to eliminate their negative effects. In order to
contain current expenditure, the authorities resisted calls to increase salaries despite
mounting inflationary pressures, developed a system for the centralization of public
procurement, and made progress in the civil service reform. They requested TA from the
Fund’s Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD) in order to strengthen their public management
framework (PMF), including a reform of the budget classification system and the unification
of government accounts. They also intend to strengthen fiscal transparency by increasing the
range and frequency of the publication of fiscal data.
14.
The authorities intend to accelerate the repayment of outstanding arrears. All
outstanding external arrears will be cleared before consideration of the PRGF arrangement by
the IMF Executive Board, while the repayment of domestic arrears will proceed according to
the existing ten-year repayment plan. A large part of these arrears is owed to the public
utilities companies, particularly to the EDD and the water and sewage company (ONEAD).
Consequently, repayment of these debts will contribute to reestablishing these utilities’
financial viability, improving their competitiveness and, eventually, reducing domestic
production costs. To prevent the accumulation of new arrears, the authorities intend to
improve cash management and expenditure controls and rebuild the stock of government
deposits.
15.
The authorities plan to go ahead with the introduction of a value-added tax
(VAT), despite the delay of the COMESA in reaching final agreement on the external
common tariff (TEC). Progress has been made in modernizing tax administration and
establishing the unified integrated tax department, a critical step to support the introduction of
a VAT, with technical and financial assistance from FAD, the European Union (EU), and
France. Failure to agree on all categories of the TEC in the latest COMESA summit, however,

14
forced the authorities to change the implementation plan. Instead of introducing the TEC and
VAT simultaneously, and immediately eliminating both the existing sales tax (TIC) and
services tax (TPS), the VAT will be introduced starting in January 2009, coexisting with the
TIC until the TEC is introduced. However, the TIC rates will be reduced to avoid a surge in
the fiscal burden.
16.
The fiscal restraint objective embedded in the 2008 budget was rather ambitious,
particularly taking into account the negative effects of the food and oil price shocks.
According to the budget, the overall fiscal deficit would be halved. The authorities are of the
view that the prudent budget revenue targets remain achievable—even after the tax
reductions on food products introduced in the first half of 2008 (estimated to cost about
0.5 percent of GDP), largely compensated by a World Bank grant. However, the budget
expenditure targets would require a considerable containment effort, in view of the additional
spending requirements posed by the PRS, the increase in the transfers to the EDD related to
the increase in oil prices (estimated at about 1.2 percent of GDP as of end-May 2008 oil
prices), and the increase in military expenditure associated with the border clashes with
Eritrea. Therefore, the authorities have already revised their overall fiscal balance target
deficit for 2008 to 1.9 percent of GDP. The authorities are confident in their ability to
mobilize additional external financing in the form of budget support loans and grants for
about 2.2 percent of GDP which might be needed to support the EDD and improve
government liquidity, including through the catalytic effect of a PRGF arrangement.
17.
The authorities concurred with the conclusions of the debt sustainability analysis
carried out jointly with World Bank staff (Box 2, Appendix I), which indicates a high risk
of debt distress in the short term. They agreed that, notwithstanding the improvements in the
underlying economic assumptions and the resulting debt profile, important vulnerabilities
remain. These include external factors such as the worsening of financial conditions,
shortfalls in projected FDI flows or a deterioration in the current account as a consequence of
further food and oil price increases, as well as internal reasons, such as the triggering of
contingent liabilities arising from government guarantees on external debt or the failure to
implement the necessary fiscal consolidation measures.

15
Box 2. External Debt and Fiscal Sustainability
External and total government debt are estimated
respectively at 59.3 percent and 62 percent of GDP in
2007, including arrears. After improving considerably in
2006 following a debt restructuring agreement with Italy,
Djibouti’s debt situation remained broadly stable in 2007.
Most of the external debt portion is owed to official donors
(notably the World Bank and the African Development
Bank), and bilateral Arab creditors. Domestic government
debt includes mainly arrears to government employees and
providers, and outstanding loans to banks and to the Port of
Djibouti. While most external arrears correspond to bilateral
Paris Club loans, some outstanding arrears towards
multilateral official creditors exist as of end-June, 2008.
Since Djibouti has no access to international capital markets,
there is no reported outstanding external debt or arrears
against external private parties. According to the authorities’
data, still to be reconciled with the creditors’, Paris Club debt
amounts to about $58 million, most of it owed to Italy, with
smaller amounts due to Spain and France. About one-half of
this debt is in arrears. Djibouti’s debt to the Paris Club was
rescheduled in May 2000 under “classic terms.” In addition,
part of the debt to Italy was swapped for social projects in
2006. The authorities are expected to negotiate a multilateral
agreement with the Paris Club shortly, and to follow suit with
bilateral agreements under the terms set by the multilateral
agreement.

occasionally thereafter), reflecting a vulnerable situation in
the short term, although it improves markedly in the long
term. Fiscal sustainability indicators are also projected to
improve in the medium term. Revenue measures to reverse
the erosion in the tax base caused by widespread exemptions,

along with measures to contain current expenditure growth
and the repayment of arrears, are projected to reduce the NPV
of government debt from 55 percent of GDP in 2007 to about 33 percent by 2011. These ratios are projected to
improve further in the long term as sustained growth, improvements in revenue collection, and a more efficient
expenditure execution contain the primary deficit well below the estimated debt-stabilizing value.
The DSA illustrates the negative impact of less optimistic scenarios and negative shocks emanating from
some of the major sources of vulnerability. The stress scenarios show that external sustainability remains
particularly vulnerable to a worsening of external borrowing conditions, while fiscal sustainability is more
sensitive to a decline in economic growth. An increase of 2 percentage points in the cost of new borrowing would
cause the NPV of external debt-GDP ratio to remain well above the sustainability threshold, with an upward trend
after 2020. The “high investment, low growth” scenario, which assumes a lower growth path scenario than
projected in the baseline, also weakens debt sustainability, but to a lesser extent. Similarly, a temporary setback in
growth in the short term could result in a much less favorable evolution of fiscal sustainability. If real GDP growth
outturn in 2009 and 2010 were to be close to 1.6 percent, equivalent to its historical average less one standard
deviation, the NPV of debt would eventually climb back to about 50 percent of GDP by 2028, while the debt
service would increase to absorb about 20 percent of fiscal revenue.

16
C. Financial Sector Issues
18.
The authorities shared the staff’s view on the need to introduce liquidity
management instruments to mitigate the current inflationary pressures along with the
gradual tightening of the fiscal stance. Unlike other countries with currency board
arrangements (CBA), the CBD has made little use of liquidity management instruments to
ease the current inflationary pressures. With limited domestic financial instruments and in the
absence of remuneration of deposits at the CBD, banks systematically transfer excess
liquidity abroad. The rapid increase in credit in 2007 was largely financed through the
mobilization of these liquid reserves, thus putting additional pressure on domestic demand
and prices. The development of effective mechanisms to control liquidity is important to
ensuring that structural excess liquidity does not endanger macroeconomic stability,
particularly in a context of rising inflationary pressures. In this regard, the authorities
concurred with the staff’s recommendation to gradually introduce reserve requirements on
bank deposits within the framework allowed by the Banking Law, while preserving the
banking system’s profitability and financing capacity.
19.
Rising inflation is a concern. In the context of a CBA, monetary policy has very
limited influence on price levels. Thus, the authorities expect to partially contain the impact
of higher food and oil prices on overall CPI inflation through measures such as capping
wholesale and retail food distribution margins, eliminating indirect taxes on basic food
products, and maintaining administered prices of electricity and other utilities. The
authorities agreed with the staff that caps on margins should only be seen as a temporary
emergency measure, and that over the long term efforts to contain inflation should hinge on
fiscal restraint3 and on a marked-based response aimed at alleviating capacity constraints and
spurring competition.
20.
The authorities agreed with the staff that the CBD’s ability to oversee the
financial sector needs to be strengthened (Box 1), but they did not see an immediate need
to restructure the banking supervision unit. The authorities look forward to the forthcoming
FSAP recommendations to provide additional guidance in this area. They intend to increase
the effectiveness of their AML/CFT framework by raising awareness, strengthening the
Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), and reinforcing the legal, regulatory, and operational
framework.

3

In 2009, the fiscal impulse emanating from the pick up in social spending should have a minimal inflationary
impact due to its high import content. Concurrently, given the program’s wage freeze, no second round effects
are expected from this impulse. During the rest of the program, the fiscal impulse becomes negative, thus
contributing to reduce inflationary pressures.

17
D. Competitiveness and Exchange Rate Policy
21.
The authorities see considerable merit in maintaining the CBA. They argued that
the currency board has served to enhance confidence in Djibouti’s currency and banks, and
remains essential to attract new investment. The staff agrees that the CBA has contributed
positively to fiscal restraint and macroeconomic stability, and that there is no compelling
case for changing the exchange rate regime or its parity. Nonetheless, the recent food and oil
price shocks necessitate additional external financial support to restore the gross official
reserves coverage of the currency board and to maintain its credibility.
22.
Although there is no evidence of a large misalignment of the Djibouti franc
(Box 3), and the recent trend shows a gradual correction of its overvaluation, several
other indicators suggest that competitiveness remains poor. The authorities agreed that
this can be attributed primarily to the high costs of critical production factors (power,
telecommunications, and labor), which continue to hamper private sector development.
Reducing these costs, including by downsizing and improving the management of the two
main loss-making public enterprises (ONEAD and EDD), will be essential to encouraging
domestic and foreign investment, ensuring sustainable and balanced growth, and reducing the
contingent liabilities that these enterprises pose for the budget. In the energy sector, the
authorities aim to reduce costs and expand capacity by completing the interconnection with
the Ethiopian power grid and developing alternative energy sources, including geothermal,
solar, and wind power (Box 4). The authorities took note of the staff’s suggestion to explore
opportunities for the outsourcing of EDD’s management to the private sector, but stressed
that the successful experience with the Port of Djibouti could not be used as a guide in view
of the small domestic market, weak profitability margins, and overarching social constraints
that characterize the electricity sector.
23.
Enhancing competitiveness also requires improving the business climate. The
authorities have prepared a new code of commerce with the assistance of the EU, which will
be submitted shortly to the National Assembly for approval. The final stages of the
implementation of the labor code will be finished within one year, and the regulations and
procedures that affect the cost of doing business will be simplified by further strengthening
coordination among public sector agencies.
24.
The staff stressed the urgency to address data weaknesses and low
implementation capacity that severely hamper economic management in Djibouti. The
authorities are working to improve the quality and timeliness of statistics on national
accounts and balance of payments with the technical assistance of the Fund, the World Bank,
and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). Additional efforts are being
undertaken to strengthen the poverty monitoring system and to develop a social targeting
mechanism to deliver food aid. The Fund has also provided technical assistance in the areas
of monetary statistics, monetary operations, banking supervision and public financial
statistics.

18
Box 3. Exchange Rate Assessment
A variety of indicators suggest that external competitiveness in Djibouti is weak, which points to an
overvaluation of the Djibouti franc (DF). The staff’s exchange rate assessment confirms the existence of some
overvaluation, but its quantification does not indicate

Estimates based on the equilibrium real
effective exchange rate approach suggest that in
2007 the DF was slightly overvalued (in the order of
8–12 percent), which is well within the margin of
error in this type of analysis. The improvement in
competitiveness compared with earlier years largely
reflects the weakening of the U.S. dollar, productivity
gains in the port operations following new investments
and the outsourcing of management to the private
sector, and constrained public wage growth.

The macroeconomic balance (MB) approach
Source: IMF staff estimate based on the CGER Methodology.
indicates that the current account is close to its
norm. The MB compares the projected current account deficit in 2013 of 13.8 percent of GDP (or 8.4 percent,
excluding FDI-related imports) to an estimated normative equilibrium current account deficit of 12.2 percent of
GDP (or 6.8 percent, excluding FDI-related imports). This implies a 7 percent overvaluation of the DF, also within
the margin of error of the model.
The external sustainability (ES) approach is unsuitable in the case of Djibouti, given its rapidly changing
economic structure and fast growth of FDI inflows in a context of a small country so far deprived of most natural
resources and lacking an industrial productive basis. This makes it particularly difficult to estimate even an
approximate sustainable equilibrium NFA position. Stabilizing the end-2007 NFA position using the Lane and
Milessi-Ferretti database points to an overvaluation of 5 percent. However, it seems evident that the end-2007
NFA position is well below the equilibrium level and, therefore, the overvaluation should be above 5 percent.
Medium-term balance of payments developments and competitiveness reforms are expected to continue
reducing the DF’s overvaluation, although risks remain and the process could be protracted. Short-term
developments—including Djibouti’s vulnerability to external shocks and dependence on imports, its relatively
high debt burden (and lack of debt instruments or access to financial markets), high unit labor costs, and weak
NFA position (including in 2007)—point to an overvaluation of the DF. However, medium-term projections point
to a self-correction of the DF’s overvaluation. Export growth is projected to outpace that of imports due to new
productive capacity created by the massive FDI-financed projects, the progressive decline in FDI-related imports
and the substitution of imported products by local production. Also, food and oil prices are projected to ease from
the peaks of 2008. However, decisive action to increase competitiveness, particularly to reduce Djibouti’s high
unit labor costs to a level in line with neighboring and competing countries, along with fiscal tightening (including
through lower public sector labor costs) and structural reforms to reduce other production costs (particularly
utilities), is indispensable to narrow the current account deficit in the medium term.
Only one (high debt risk level) out of the seven indicators identified in the 2007 Decision on Bilateral
Surveillance is triggered, thus underpinning the assessment of broad alignment of the DF and its sustainability.

Box 4. Electricity Cost
Electricity production in Djibouti comes at a high cost, but service delivery is poor. Despite
energy tariffs amongst the highest in Africa and four times higher than in neighboring Ethiopia,
EDD runs net operating losses, which have increased with the recent surge in oil prices. At the
root of these problems is the dependence on imported oil, aggravated by large arrears from the
public sector, an excessive, inadequately skilled and poorly motivated staff, and obsolete
equipment. Cost recovery is also hampered by large technical and “non-technical” losses (illegal
connections), respectively estimated at 10 and 6 percent of production. The ensuing precarious
financial situation of the company has resulted in insufficient maintenance and investment, and
inadequate service, with frequent power cuts at peak times.
There is little scope for substantial improvements over the short term. Some improvements
can be achieved by enhancing financial transparency through the regular publication of audited
accounts, enhancing efforts to reduce losses, and implementing a plan to increase savings in
electricity consumption. The World Bank and other development partners are providing
technical and financial assistance in these areas. According to the World Bank, some of the key
areas of intervention in the short-term could be to:
•

increase the efficiency of power generation by replacing older equipment;

•

negotiate better fuel storage tariffs at the port or invest in own storage capacity;

•

make operational the interconnection with the Ethiopian power grid (which would
expand capacity and reduce costs by up to 30 percent); and

•

reduce the EDD’s personnel costs. Wages and benefits represented 14 percent of total
operating costs in 2006. Some personnel cost items, such as overtime payments and
subsidized energy tariffs, could be reduced by improving personnel management and
renegotiating contracts.

In the medium to long term, Djibouti’s competitiveness will depend on developing a
reliable array of alternative energies. While fuel-based plants will continue to have a role as a
flexible back-up, the main source of primary energy shall come from renewable resources, for
which the country is well endowed. In order to achieve this objective, large investments are
needed, structured along the lines of a comprehensive strategic plan, with assistance from
Djibouti’s development partners and with full involvement from the private sector. Exploration
and development of geothermal resources to help address power shortages and reduce carbon
emissions has started in 2008, in partnership with foreign investors (Reykjavik Energy
Invest/Iceland and InfraVentures). This is the first project to be funded by InfraVentures, a new
International Finance Corporation fund created to finance infrastructure development in
low-income countries (LICs). The capacity of this geothermal plant is expected to be at least
50 megawatts (about 80 percent of the current EDD capacity). Also, other smaller projects in the
wind and solar energy fields are at different stages of development.

20
IV. THE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL PROGRAM
A. Program Objectives and Medium-Term Policy Framework
25.
Program objectives: taking into account the issues discussed above, the program
aims at fostering sustainable and balanced economic growth through macroeconomic
stability, improved competitiveness, reduced inflation, and a strengthened external position.
In the meantime, the program will liberate fiscal resources to support the implementation of
the authorities’ PRS. It intends to increase the growth rate to about 7 percent; keep the
inflation rate close to 3–3.5 percent; sustain a currency board coverage ratio of at least
105 percent, and reduce the stock of domestic arrears from 18 percent of GDP at end-2007 to
7.5 percent at end-2011 (see ¶14 above).
26.
The program focuses on: (a) bringing the overall fiscal position to a balance in the
medium term while increasing the share of social and infrastructure projects in total
spending; (b) strengthening financial sector soundness; (c) improving competitiveness
mainly through a reduction in domestic production costs; and (d) building institutional
capacity, particularly strengthening the statistical framework, fiscal transparency, and public
sector governance. The specific policy measures envisaged under the program are consistent
with the Article IV policy discussions, and are detailed in the Memorandum of Economic and
Financial Policies (MEFP). The authorities will consider prompt implementation of FSAP’s
recommendations in areas considered urgent and frame their medium-term banking
supervision and money management policies along the lines of the guidance provided.
27.
The authorities’ fiscal policy under the program aims at balancing the budget in
the medium term while increasing spending for poverty reduction (MEFP ¶17). The
overall deficit (on a commitment basis) would be brought to balance by 2011, while current
expenditure on social programs would increase to about 11½ percent in 2011. A balanced
budget is needed to create fiscal space for social expenditures without compromising

macroeconomic stability and is consistent with strengthening debt sustainability. Tax reforms
and improvements in tax administration would reverse the decline in tax revenue and bring it
back to about 20 percent of GDP by 2011. Additional measures would be adopted to contain
current expenditure not related to the poverty reduction strategy, and the public investment
program would be financed mainly by external grants and concessional loans. The wage bill
would be further contained in the medium term by the reform of the civil service, including
completion of organizational and strategic audits.
B. Key Measures Under the First Year of the Program (September 2008–August 2009)
28.
A VAT would be introduced in January 2009 with a single rate of 7 percent
(MEFP ¶19). The VAT law would be submitted to the National Assembly with the revised
2008 Budget, at the latest in November 2008. The VAT would be applied to all goods and
services with few exceptions, which include banking and financial services and basic food
items, thus widening the tax base and reducing exemptions. It is projected to increase
revenue by about 1.1 percent of GDP in 2009 and 2.5 percent in the medium term. In order to
ensure a smooth transition to the new regime, the staff encouraged the authorities to complete
the implementation of all FAD’s TA recommendations. The authorities also intend to phase
out the TIC and TPS, introduce the TEC in 2010, revise the personal income tax regime, and
make additional efforts to expand the tax base by streamlining exemptions by February 2009
(MEFP ¶20, Box 2 and ¶15 above).
29.
Current primary spending would be contained by improving expenditure
management, reducing expenditure in low-priority areas, and gradually reducing the
wage bill (MEFP ¶22). Given the negative impact of relatively high labor costs on Djibouti’s
competitiveness, a freeze in public sector recruitment (except for the ministries of Health and
Education and to strengthen the MoF’s Tax Department) and in the salary structure4 would be
imposed throughout the program’s duration. It is expected that the conclusion of the civil
reform by the end of the program creates the basis for a competitive public sector without the
need for wage ceilings. The budget preparation process would be strengthened in line with
the FAD TA recommendations, through a revision of budget classification by 2009 and
through the introduction of a medium-term fiscal framework that shall form the basis for the
2010 budget law (MEFP ¶21).
30.
All outstanding external arrears would be cleared and domestic arrears reduced
by 1.2 and 1.3 percent of GDP in 2008 and 2009, respectively (MEFP ¶18 and 24). To
prevent the accumulation of new domestic and external arrears, the authorities intend to
introduce a single treasury account, prepare monthly treasury plans based on more accurate
projections of revenue and expenditure needs, and increase the balance of government
deposits at banks (MEFP ¶21 and ¶14 above). Moreover, they intend to request technical

22
assistance to improve current debt management practices, including avoiding the
accumulation of arrears (MEFP ¶18).
31.
The fiscal discipline embedded in the program will help improve debt
sustainability. The program assumes that the authorities will be able to mobilize a
substantial level of exceptional financing from multilateral and bilateral creditors, on highly
concessional terms. For projection purposes, staff assumed that the precutoff debt to the Paris
Club will be rescheduled under classic terms. Furthermore, in order to facilitate the
mobilization of concessional external financing for the public investment program, a
conference of external donors will be organized by November 2008 (MEFP ¶23, Box 2, and
¶3 above).
32.
The CBD would introduce reserve requirements on commercial bank deposits as
a liquidity management instrument (MEFP ¶29, and ¶18–19 above). Required reserves
would support the authorities’ multi-pronged effort to control inflation and mop up excess
structural liquidity.5 The specific characteristics of reserve requirements (level,
computational base, remuneration) would be decided in consultation with local banks, and
with TA from MCM. Moreover, the CBD would intensify banking supervision by increasing
the number of on-site inspections, and commercial banks’ capital requirements would be
doubled (MEFP ¶31, Box 1, and ¶20 above).
33.
The program entails short-term measures to reduce the cost of domestic utilities
and improve the business climate (MEFP¶ 36–40). These include carrying out a study on
the downsizing of the EDD that will trigger its downsizing, reducing the technical losses of
the ONEAD, finalizing the interconnection agreement with Ethiopia, adopting the new
commerce code, and enforcing the new labor code, including by adopting the implementation
decrees and fostering the renegotiation of sectoral collective agreements (MEFP ¶37–41,
Box 4, and ¶22–23 above).
34.
Short-term measures to improve the statistical framework include completing a
full population census, followed by a comprehensive household expenditure survey, and
a survey of economic activities. This would help to update the various social indicators,
including the provision of new estimates of poverty and income distribution, and improve the
quality of national accounts’ estimates (MEFP ¶42, and ¶24 above).

5

Should this measure become inconsistent with the forthcoming FSAP findings, it will be revised during the
program’s first review.

23
C. Program Modalities, Access Level, Monitoring, Risks, and Safeguards
35.
The staff concurs with the authorities’ request for an access level under the
requested PRGF of SDR 12.72 million (80 percent of quota). The access level that would
reflect Djibouti’s status as a second-time PRGF user would be 65 percent of quota. However,
given the impact of the food and oil price shocks on the projected financing needs of the
country, the authorities request an augmented access level of 80 percent of quota, which is
consistent with the level of access received by other countries facing similar shocks, the
latest estimates of Djibouti’s financing gap, and the projected capacity to repay the Fund
(Table 7). To reinforce official reserves in 2008, 24 percent of quota would be frontloaded,
while the rest of the facility would be disbursed in equal semi-annual tranches once reviews
are completed (Table 6). The first review would assess performance of the criteria at end2008. The program would be monitored by quantitative indicators on arrears, net credit to
government, external borrowing and the currency board cover, and by structural performance
criteria.
36.
Performance criteria and benchmarks fall within the Fund’s areas of expertise
and are critical to achieving the economic objectives and mitigating the program’s
risks. The authorities see the introduction of the VAT in 2009 and improvements in liquidity
management as essential to control inflation (MEFP’s Table 1). The nine structural
benchmarks cover reforms that are fundamental for maintaining macroeconomic stability and
improving competitiveness (MEFP’s Table 2). For example, reducing the cost of electricity is
key for the development of the private sector (Box 4), and improvements in banking
supervision and anti-money laundering are critical at this stage of development.
37.
The risks to the program are manageable. Political and social tensions could
hamper the implementation of the wide-ranging and thorny reforms, such as the freezing of
recruitment in the public sector and of the nominal wage structure. Capacity constraints could
limit the authorities’ ability to implement reforms sufficiently rapidly to meet the needs of
incoming FDI. Regional stability could also pose serious risks. Finally, further increases in
oil and food prices could pose added strain on inflation and compromise fiscal sustainability.
These risks are mitigated by the strong ownership of the program, which closely mirrors the
development strategy elaborated by the authorities.
38.
The authorities have received an initial safeguard assessment (SA) mission. The
preliminary assessment indicated that although risks are present in a number of safeguard
areas, these are partly mitigated by the relatively straightforward nature of the CBD’s
operations under the CBA. The full assessment is expected to be completed by the time of
the first review under the PRGF arrangement. Based on the SA recommendations, a strategy
would be developed to address any potential shortcomings in CBD’s legal framework and
financial controls, and specific remedial measures would be incorporated into future program
reviews as needed.

24
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
39.
Djibouti has a unique opportunity to achieve its development objectives. The
continued massive FDI inflows and the authorities’ poverty reduction and investment
strategies have the potential, if supported by adequate fiscal adjustment and structural
reforms, to launch Djibouti on a broad-based, sustainable high-growth path and to achieve
substantial progress in the pursuit of the MDGs.
40.
The authorities’ poverty reduction strategy is a significant step in this direction.
The new PRSP presents a coherent set of measures for addressing the key structural problems
that have hindered economic development. In order to achieve these objectives, however, it
will be essential to strengthen macroeconomic stability by balancing the overall fiscal
position while creating fiscal space to increase the share of social and infrastructure projects
in total spending. The enhanced discipline introduced by the PRGF would further increase
domestic and foreign investor’s confidence.
41.
The staff welcomes the authorities’ plan for a gradual fiscal adjustment based on
a comprehensive tax reform, spending restraint, and better prioritization. The
introduction of the VAT has the potential to widen the tax base and partly reduce the current
system of tax privileges to attract investment with a more stable, transparent, and, on
average, lighter taxation. If adequately supported by improved audit controls and simplified
compliance procedures, these reforms could substantially increase tax revenue in the medium
term. However, timely implementation of the reforms is of the essence, particularly in view
of the rapidly declining revenue path.
42.
The rapid expansion of the financial system is expected to lead to increased
efficiency, but would require strengthening the oversight function of the CBD. In
particular, it is essential that the CBD reorganizes and reinforces substantially its banking
supervision capacities, and that the legal and regulatory framework is updated to keep pace
with the introduction of new financial institutions and instruments.
43.
In order to contain the mounting inflationary pressures, the authorities need to
maintain their fiscal consolidation objectives and accelerate the implementation of
structural reforms that increase productivity and competition. Also, the introduction of
reserve requirements by the CBD would help mop up structural liquidity. The authorities
should refrain from introducing price controls or other restrictions that hamper the effective
functioning of the market, which may result in the rationing of products and the emergence
of black markets. The social concerns raised by the increasing food and oil prices would be
better addressed by promptly developing a system of targeted subsidies to the poorest, with
World Bank assistance.
44.
External financial assistance will be essential to address Djibouti’s short and
medium-term financing needs and to strengthen external sustainability. The authorities
should approach their bilateral and multilateral creditors to clear arrears, seek financial

25
assistance to cover their financing needs, and establish a sustainable path for the external
debt.
45.
The staff agrees with the authorities that the CBA has contributed to
maintaining macroeconomic stability. However, while the slight overvaluation of the DF
does not provide compelling evidence of misalignment, a variety of indicators suggest that
competitiveness remains weak.
46.
The implementation of ambitious structural reforms remains critical to improve
competitiveness and to foster economic growth. In addition to fiscal and financial reforms,
action is urgently needed to reduce costs and increase the efficiency of public enterprises
(particularly the EDD); and to simplify regulations and procedures that affect the cost of
doing business.
47.
Improving the statistical base is essential to guide and monitor macroeconomic
and poverty reduction policies. In this regard, staff urges the authorities to expedite the
population census process followed by the household income and expenditure surveys, and to
take full advantage of the TA offered by Djibouti’s development partners.
48.
Staff recommends the approval of the authorities’ request for a three-year
PRGF arrangement for SDR 12.72 million (80 percent of quota), with an upfront
disbursement of 24 percent of quota.
49.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held in accordance with the
decision on consultation cycles approved July 15, 2002.

Status

Publish the audited 2004 financial
statements of public enterprises
(Djibouti Télécom, EDD, ONED)

Completed. The audited financial statements for 2004 and 2005
were published on the website of the ministry of finance in
December 2007. The authorities continued this practice by
publishing the 2006 audited financial statements in 2008.

Finalize the unified registry of civil
servants in 2005 and adopt it in 2006.

Completed. The single registry of civil servants has been
installed online at the ministry of employment and civil service
and at the ministry of finance.

Finalize the computerization of the
expenditure chain.

Completed. New software (WMONEY) in use in the ministry of
finance. Development of the conceptual scheme, as well as of
all the specified functionalities, pilot testing, and the connection
of other ministries to the network has been finalized.

Establish a new timetable for finalizing
the code of commerce in 2006

Completed. A timetable for the adoption of the new code has
been completed; a draft of the first volume (on commercial
operations) was prepared in June 2007, and a revised version is
expected to be completed by end-June 2008.

Adopt proposed measures for the VAT.

Partially completed. The introduction of the VAT has been
announced in the 2008 Budget Law, and VAT provisions will be
presented to the National Assembly with the 2008 Revised
Budget Law or at the latest by November 2008. Implementation
of the action plan for the introduction of the VAT will require
additional external technical assistance.

Adhere strictly to the monthly cash flow
plan.

Partially completed. The monthly cash flow plans have been
irregularly prepared and adherence has been mixed.

Eliminate the practice of check
exchanges with ONED and Djibouti
Télécom.

Completed. Check exchanges continue only with the EDD as a
way to facilitate payments.

Limit prepayment order expenditure to
expenditure covered by legislation.

Completed, although there are transfers between budget
categories.

Unify and simplify the system of tax
exemptions by merging the various
preferential tax regimes and including
remaining exemptions in general tax
code.

Partially completed. Coordination of the investment code and
the general tax code completed. The texts on investment still
need to be harmonized and the exemptions granted by special
decree prior to introduction of the VAT need to be eliminated.

The government will report monetary
and external debt data and the TOFE to
the IMF each quarter, within a period of
four weeks.

Completed as far as the monetary data are concerned. The
TOFE is sometimes submitted with a lag of up to three months,
and the debt figures are submitted with a long lag.

APPENDIX I. DJIBOUTI: JOINT BANK-FUND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS (DSA)
The joint Bank-Fund low-income country debt sustainability analysis (LIC DSA) indicates
that Djibouti’s risk of debt distress continues to be high, despite some improvement in the
medium-term projections. There are however important sources of vulnerability, including a
worsening of financing conditions, lower than expected long-term growth rates, external
shocks (such as further food and oil price increases), shortfalls in foreign direct investment,
and contingent liabilities arising from government guarantees on external debt.
A. Background
50.
After improving considerably in 2006 following a debt restructuring agreement
with Italy, Djibouti’s debt situation remained broadly stable in 2007. External debt
(government and government-guaranteed) increased from 56.5 percent of GDP in 2006 to
59.5 percent of GDP in 2007, while government debt (external and domestic) declined from
63 percent to 62 percent of GDP.6
51.
Prospects for continued support from official creditors are good, and would be
further enhanced under a Fund-supported program. The country is receiving substantial
financing from official multilateral and bilateral creditors to finance public investment in
health, education, public housing, infrastructure, energy and water sectors, mostly in the form
of earmarked project loans, including loans to state-owned enterprises under government
guarantee. Major projects in the pipeline include the interconnection with the Ethiopian
power grid (already under construction with financing from the African Development Bank
and the European Union), a desalinization plant, the construction of new university buildings,
and projects in energy, water, sanitation and social housing. Altogether, additional external
lending for about $0.5 billion (equivalent to about 40 percent of average annual GDP) is
projected to be disbursed between 2008 and 2013. About 40 percent of this financing had
already been secured at end-2007, and the rest includes assistance pledged by Arab creditors
during a Round Table held in Djibouti at end-2005. If agreement were reached on a
Fund-supported program, all new lending agreements are expected to be extended on
concessional terms, and additional financing could become available from the European
Union, France, and other creditors in the form of budget-support loans and grants
(estimated at about $40 million in 2008 and 2009). A donors’ round table is scheduled for
November 24–25, 2008 in Brussels, under World Bank coordination.
52.
Virtually all external debt—which amounted at end-2007 to $504 million,
equivalent to 59 percent of GDP—is provided by official creditors either to the
government or to state-owned enterprises under government guarantee
(Appendix Table 13; Appendix Figure 3). This includes $14 million of outstanding
liabilities to the IMF, $150 million owed to the World Bank, $103 million to the African
Development Bank, $57 million to the AFESD, and $51 million to bilateral Arab creditors
6

The values for 2006 have been revised on the basis of a re-assessment of debt to Italy still outstanding after the
2006 rescheduling agreement.

39
(Appendix Table 14). Debt to multilateral creditors (with the notable exceptions of AFESD
and OPEC countries) is on highly concessional terms, but debt to most bilateral creditors has
a grant element below the 35 percent threshold considered concessional. About one-third of
the debt ($163 million) is owed by state-owned enterprises under government guarantee.

There are outstanding arrears toward external and domestic creditors but,
except for arrears to Paris Club creditors, they mainly reflect weaknesses in liquidity
management and do not stem from a lack of resources to service debt obligations.
Arrears on external debt service amounted at end-2007 to $35 million, equivalent to
4 percent of GDP and 7 percent of total external debt; these included about $29 million of
arrears to Paris Club creditors on debt agreed before the cutoff date of March 31, 1998,
which is potentially eligible for rescheduling and restructuring. Domestic arrears owed to
state-owned enterprises, social security funds, public employees and government suppliers at
end-2007 amounted to $152 million (18 percent of GDP) and accounted for about 30 percent
of total government debt and for about 80 percent of domestic government domestic debt.
Most external arrears outstanding at end-2006 (excluding those to Paris Club creditors) have
been repaid, but new arrears—for a slightly lower amount—have been incurred in 2007; the
authorities expect to clear all these arrears in by end-August 2008 (MEFP ¶18). In 2007
there has also been a large net repayment of domestic arrears, along the lines of a 10-year
repayment plan that was adopted in 2002.
54.
Government debt amounted to $528 million, equivalent to 62 percent of GDP.
This included debt to external creditors, outstanding external and domestic arrears, and
outstanding loans to banks and to the Port for $6.2 million that are gradually being repaid
(Appendix Table 13).

41
55.
At present, public financing is only available from external official creditors.
Djibouti does not have access to international capital markets, and there is no market for
domestic government debt. Under the currency board arrangement, the central bank is
forbidden by law to lend to the government, and a domestic market for Treasury bills and
bonds has not yet been established. Weaknesses in treasury management and cash planning
have frequently resulted in the recourse to domestic and external payment arrears as a source
of emergency short-term financing.
B. Underlying Assumptions
56.
The medium-term macroeconomic framework has improved compared with the
previous two DSAs, reflecting increased investors’ interest in Djibouti and the
expectation that agreement on a Fund-supported program would result in the
implementation of policy measures aimed at enhancing competitiveness and sustaining
growth (Appendix Box 4). These measures, which would include a major fiscal adjustment
and structural reforms, would enhance growth prospects, promote economic diversification
and increase export capacity and foreign direct investment. The 2005 DSA assumed wideranging reforms but comparatively low FDI, and more moderate growth rates in the medium
term. The 2007 DSA (CR/07/178) took into account the larger FDI flows, but was based
instead on economic assumptions that did not incorporate comprehensive fiscal and structural
reforms.
57.
Past historical trends do not provide a good basis for future projections because
Djibouti’s economy is undergoing a deep and rapid transformation led by foreign and
public investment. Favored by its strategic position at the mouth of the Red Sea and among
major shipping routes, and taking advantage of the increased regional integration that
followed the re-routing of most Ethiopian external trade through the Djibouti Port since
1998, Djibouti has been expanding its port and transportation infrastructure with the support
of massive foreign direct investment from the Gulf, with the aim of transforming the country
into a thriving regional trade and financial hub. At the same time, the authorities have
pursued a program of public investment in social capital and infrastructure, aimed at reducing
poverty and improving opportunities and access to basic services, with the support of
external bilateral and multilateral donors. These investments are expected to result in a
substantial acceleration of growth, which already started in 2006, and could be further
enhanced by policy measures aimed at improving competitiveness.
58.
Prompted by foreign investment and productivity improvements under a
Fund-supported program, real GDP is projected to achieve high and sustained
growth rates in the medium term. Large FDI inflows are expected between 2008 and
2013 in association with the completion of the new port, the building of an oil refinery and
the establishment of new enterprises in the free-trade zone. Investment will then decline to
more normal levels but will remain sustained over the next decade, enhanced by economic
expansion and by the consolidation of Djibouti as a regional trading center. After 2018,
FDI is projected to decline in percent of GDP and annual real GDP growth to slow down
to a more sustainable steady state level. Imports will initially reflect foreign direct
investment—that will prompt the purchase of equipment and other goods and services from

42
external suppliers—and will further increase in 2011 (together with exports) with the opening
of the refinery. In the long term, productivity improvements and the expansion of domestic
production will improve the balance of goods and services. The real exchange rate is
expected to remain broadly stable, as upward pressures arising from capital inflows would be
compensated by the mobilization of a largely underemployed labor force and by productivity
improvements in the public administration and other nontradable sectors. This stability would
facilitate the persistence of the fixed exchange peg to the U.S. dollar under the currency
board arrangement.
Appendix Box 4. Djibouti: Macroeconomic Assumptions
The macroeconomic assumptions have improved considerably compared with the previous two DSAs, reflecting
expectations of an agreement on a Fund-supported program. Growth and FDI inflows are projected to remain
substantial over the next decade, prompting a marked growth in exports.
Real GDP growth is projected to increase to 7 percent by 2009 and remain between 7–8 percent until 2018, to
decline gradually thereafter to a more sustainable steady state rate of 3.5 percent. Persistent growth rates well
above the historical average would stem from productivity improvements induced by structural reforms under a
Fund-supported program as well as from the enhancement in physical and human capital resulting from the
externally financed public investment program and from massive inflows of FDI (projected at an annual
average of 16 percent of GDP until 2013 and 6 percent of GDP thereafter).
Average inflation is projected to peak at about 8 percent in 2008 and to stabilize at 3–3.5 percent by 2011.
Fiscal restraint under a Fund-supported program and structural reforms aimed at increasing competitiveness in
the local market, combined with the fixed dollar peg under the currency board arrangement, are expected to
keep inflation in this small open economy close to the average world level.
The non-interest current account deficit is projected to widen to 3 percent of GDP in 2008 and 2009 and then
decline to about 14 percent by 2013, reflecting the decline in FDI inflows after the completion of the new port
and the refinery. The non-interest current account deficit is then projected to narrow more gradually to less than
6 percent by 2028. Exports are projected to increase threefold, from about 45 percent of GDP in 2008–10 to
about 140 percent of GDP, with the opening of an oil refinery in 2011. This will also be reflected in an
equivalent increase in imports. In the long term, as a result of economic diversification and the expansion of
export-oriented and import-substitution activities, export growth is projected to outpace the growth of imports.
The fiscal position is projected to come into balance by 2011 as a result of fiscal adjustment under a
Fund-supported program, and to remain balanced in the long term. The discipline enforced under the currency
board arrangement, together with limited opportunities to borrow from domestic and external private sources,
are projected to contain the overall deficit below 1 percent of GDP. Grant financing and the availability of
concessional loans are projected to decline after 2013 as a result of the growth of the economy. It is assumed
however that external loans to finance the public investment program will continue to be available from official
creditors in the long term, albeit on less favorable terms.
Debt to Paris Club creditors that was originated before the cutoff date of March 31, 1998, is assumed to be
rescheduled on classic non-concessional terms. The amounts eligible for rescheduling would include arrears
outstanding at the start of the Fund-supported program as well as debt service payments coming due during the
period of the program (September 2008–August 2011). According to the terms of reference agreed with the
Paris Club in 2000, repayments would be made in ten equal semi-annual installments starting in 2013, and
interest would be due at an appropriate market rate, that is here assumed at 5 percent. Similar treatment is also
expected from non-Paris Club bilateral creditors.

43

59.
The substantial pick up in real GDP growth projected in the baseline scenario is
a continuation of the trend seen in 2006 and 2007, when growth started to accelerate
driven by increases in FDI. Productive capacity would be expanded in the near future as
several investment projects, including the new port and free zones (Emirati capital), are
nearing completion, and other large projects, including a refinery financed by Kuwait, are
also confirmed for the period 2008–13 (Table 8 in the staff report). These investments carried
out in the context of strategic partnerships with large public and private foreign investors
(such as U.A.E.’s Dubai Ports) are bringing about important structural changes in the
economy. Dependence on imports will be substantially reduced with the desalinization plant
and the refinery, and other investment projects (salt mining, cattle reexport facilities, port and
logistics services, and new luxury hotels) will boost export capacity. Planned large public
investments in infrastructure and social services will also help increase competitiveness in
the long-term. These investments will be completed in the nearer term with initiatives to
promote the development of a vibrant private sector with domestic SMEs dedicated to
service the large foreign-owned projects. Supporting initiatives include the revised commerce
and labor codes which will provide a stronger legal framework for doing business and
investment, the reform of public utilities' enterprises, and prudent macroeconomic policies.
60.
This favorable growth scenario is expected to be underpinned by a prudent
fiscal policy. In the long term, external grants and revenue from external sources associated
with the military bases are projected to decline in percent of GDP, but fiscal reforms and
improvements in tax administration implemented under the Fund-supported program would
enhance long-term revenue mobilization. A combination of wage restraint, a reorganization
of the civil service, and improvements in expenditure management are expected to contain
current expenditure. At the same, with financial support from external donors, the
government would continue to implement a public investment program aimed at promoting
social development and public infrastructure. It is also assumed that, in order to enhance its
credibility and foster the confidence of domestic and foreign investors, the government
would avoid the accumulation of new arrears. This will be facilitated by treasury reforms and
improvements in cash management implemented under the program. All external arrears are
projected to be repaid or rescheduled in 2008, and the repayment of domestic arrears is
expected to continue broadly in line with the 10-year repayment schedule.
61.
The government is not expected to borrow from private sources in the
foreseeable future. Although negotiable government securities may be introduced for
liquidity management purposes in the medium to long term, a full-fledged market for
government debt is not expected to develop within the projection period. Economic
expansion and policy credibility under a Fund-supported program could facilitate prospects
for future access to international financial markets, but, in order to maintain macroeconomic
stability and debt sustainability, the government is expected to continue to base its borrowing
strategy on the mobilization of external financing from official creditors on favorable (if not
fully concessional) terms. Economic growth is however expected to result in a lower
availability of concessional financing, which will be reflected in a decline in the average
grant element of new loans.

C. Evaluation of External Debt Sustainability
62.
Under baseline assumptions, most external debt and debt service ratios are
above the sustainability threshold, indicating a high risk of debt distress (Appendix
Table 15a; Appendix Figure 4). These ratios tend to improve in the medium and long-term,
under the baseline scenario. The net present value (NPV) of debt, which at end-2007 stood at
50 percent of GDP, is projected to reach the 30 percent level considered sustainable for a
country like Djibouti in 2016, mainly as a result of GDP growth, and remain close to that
level thereafter. The NPV of debt-to-exports ratio is projected to cross the 100 percent
threshold in 2009, and to improve considerably as a result of the opening of the oil refinery in
2011; even excluding this effect, this ratio is projected to maintain a downward trend,
reaching about 40 percent by 2028 (Appendix Table 15a). Other debt sustainability indicators
are well below their respective thresholds and are projected to improve in the medium term.
The debt service-to-exports ratio remains, through the whole projection period, comfortably
below the 15 percent threshold considered sustainable, even when exports of refined products
are excluded from the denominator.
63.
However, external sustainability remains vulnerable to a worsening of external
borrowing conditions and other external shocks. If new borrowing could only be
secured at interest rates 2 percentage points higher than under the baseline (A2 in
Appendix Table 15b), the NPV of debt would remain above 50 percent of GDP throughout
the projection period, with an upward trend after 2020. In the event of a high investment and
low growth scenario (HI/LG, A3 in Appendix Table 15b), with new FDI failing to generate
additional growth, annual real GDP growth would return to a steady state rate of around
3 percent by 2013 and the NPV of debt would reach 50 percent toward the end of the
projection period. Djibouti could also be vulnerable to other types of external shocks whose
effects have not been quantified, most notably less favorable inflows of FDI, a slower than
projected increase in exports, and adverse developments in terms of trade and cross exchange
rates. Lower FDI or lower exports would result in slower growth, weakening the
improvement in debt sustainability produced by the endogenous debt dynamics (in the case
of FDI, this effects could be partly compensated by a reduction in imports that could improve
the current account balance); an unfavorable evolution of the terms of trade, resulting, for
instance, from a protracted increase in international food and energy prices or by a
devaluation of the U.S. dollar vis-à-vis other currencies, unless fully compensated by
improvements in competitiveness (more likely to occur in the case of a devaluation of the
U.S. dollar) would widen the current account deficit, increasing external borrowing needs. A
devaluation of the dollar would also increase the domestic currency value of debt
denominated in currencies other than the dollar (and not pegged to the dollar), which
amounted at end-2007 to 85.4 percent of the total (excluding arrears) (Appendix Table 16).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicit
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

D. Evaluation of Fiscal Sustainability
64.
Fiscal sustainability indicators are also projected to improve remarkably in the
medium term (Appendix Table 17a; Appendix Figure 5). While there are no defined
thresholds for government debt, the NPV of government debt is projected to decline from
55 percent of GDP (and about 160 percent of fiscal revenue and grants) in 2007 to about
33 percent of GDP (and about 100 percent of fiscal revenue and grants) by 2011, as a result
of the fiscal adjustment that would be implemented under a Fund-supported program,
including a large repayment of arrears. These ratios are projected to improve further in the
long term as sustained growth, improvements in revenue collection, and a more efficient
expenditure execution contain the primary deficit well below the estimated debt-stabilizing
value. These improvements would occur under the assumption of a gradual decline in
external revenue from the French and U.S. military bases, and of sustained rates of public
investment. The debt service-fiscal revenue ratio is projected to remain at a comparatively
low level, at 3–5 percent, throughout the projection period.
65.
A temporary setback in growth in the short term could result in a much less
favorable evolution of fiscal sustainability . If real GDP growth in 2009 and 2010 turned
out close to 1.6 percent, equivalent to its historical average less one standard deviation
(B1 in Appendix Table 17b), without further adjustments in public expenditure, the primary
deficit would widen to a long-term average of about 3 percent, which would result in a
renewed accumulation of debt after the initial decline related to the repayment of arrears.
The NPV of debt would eventually climb back to about 50 percent of GDP and 200 percent
of revenue by 2028, while the debt service would increase to absorb about 20 percent of
fiscal revenue by 2028, raising concerns about debt sustainability.

Fiscal sustainability could also be adversely affected by other risks. These include
the materialization of contingent liabilities arising from government guarantees on the
external debt of public enterprises, a failure to implement the projected fiscal adjustment, and
a sharper-than-projected decline in fiscal revenue associated with the foreign military
presence.
E. Conclusions
67.
Djibouti’s debt sustainability outlook continues to exhibit a high risk of debt
distress, although, if confirmed, the projected high sustained growth path would
moderate this risk in the medium to long term. The sustainability threshold for the NPV of
external debt-GDP ratio is breached, in the baseline scenario, until 2017 (and occasionally
thereafter), and the threshold for the NPV of external debt-exports ratio is breached until
2009 . All other debt indicators remain below the thresholds, and all indicators are projected
to improve over time as a result of non-debt creating capital inflows and sustained GDP
growth.
68.
Underpinning this outcome are the sustained interest of foreign investors in the
country, the fiscal adjustment and structural reforms that are expected to be
implemented under a Fund-supported program, and the availability of external
concessional financing for an ambitious public investment program. Together, these
measures are expected to increase the competitiveness of the economy and place it on a
sustainable long-term development path.
69.
Important vulnerabilities remain. The sustainability assessment outlined above
hinges on expectations of a prolonged period with stable, high growth rates. This outcome
however is not assured. The precise impact of investment, fiscal stabilization and structural
reforms on growth remains uncertain. Also, policy slippages and lower FDI could result in
lower-than-expected growth rates. In view of these risks, high priority should be given to the
prompt implementation of measures aimed at increasing external competitiveness, improving
the business environment, and strengthening the fiscal position.
70.
The increase in economic and political instability in the region constitutes a
major risk. Djibouti’s growth prospects are based on becoming a trade and financial hub to
service the markets of Ethiopia and other neighboring East African countries. Whereas
regional instability contributed in the past to expanding Djibouti’s regional integration (by
rerouting most of Ethiopia’s external trade from Asmara to Djibouti), an intensification of
instability and a worsening of the already precarious security situation in the region could
threaten—or at least delay—the implementation of this project.

Safeguards assessments
In 2001, during the safeguard policy transition period, BCD was subject to a review of the
external audit mechanism, which recommended the appointment of an external auditor.
Subsequently, the BCD hired in August 2002 external auditors from Ernst & Young (E &Y) to
audit its 1999, 2000, and 2001 accounts. These audits were completed by end-2002.
Since 2003, the BCD has had its accounts audited on a yearly basis by E &Y, even though
with a delayed timeframe. The BCD’s yearly Balance Sheet and Income Statement are
published in the Journal Officiel.
An initial safeguards assessment (SA) is underway in the context of the new PRGF
arrangement. In this regard, a SA mission was conducted during June/July 2008. Staff met
with the BCD authorities and their external auditors. The full assessment is expected to be
completed by the time of the first review under the new PRGF arrangement. Based on the
findings of this mission, a strategy will be developed to address any potential shortcomings
in BCD’s legal framework and financial controls, and specific remedial measures will be
incorporated into the program as needed.
Exchange arrangements
Djibouti has a currency board arrangement. The Djibouti franc is pegged to the U.S. dollar at
the rate of DF 177.721 = $1. Djibouti maintains an exchange system that is free of
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.
Article IV Consultation
Djibouti is on an annual consultation cycle. Discussions for the 2007 Article IV consultation
were held in Djibouti from January 7 to January 21, 2007. The staff report (IMF Country
Report No. 07/178) was discussed by the Executive Board on May 27, 2007.
FSAP Participation, ROSC, and OFC Assessment
Djibouti has not participated in any of the above-mentioned exercises. An FSAP was
requested by the authorities in 2007 and is planned for the last quarter of 2008. The FSSA
will be available as part of the 2009 Article IV consultation documents. The onsite mission
for the AML/CFT ROSC took place in October 2007, also in the context of the forthcoming
FSAP. This AML/CFT component is expected to be concluded by the end of 2008 and is
based on the 2004 Assessment Methodology. It will report on the observance of the FATF
40 recommendations for AML and the 9 special recommendations for CFT and Djibouti’s
level of compliance and recommendations on how the AML/CFT system should be
strengthened.

APPENDIX II. WORLD BANK RELATIONS WITH DJIBOUTI
(As of end-June 2008)
World Bank lending and non-lending interventions in Djibouti are tailored to support the
pillars of the CAS, which are broadly aligned with Djibouti’s full PRSP endorsed by the
Boards of the World Bank and the IMF in June 2004. The FY2005–08 CAS, endorsed by the
Bank Board in March 2005, is centered on three pillars: (i) growth and competitiveness,
(ii) human development, and (iii) governance.
The CAS pillars are supported by various projects. The current portfolio has six active
Bank-funded projects valued at US$60.5 million. Of this total, 45 percent, by value, is for
health-related activities, 17 percent for education, 12 percent for energy, 19 percent for urban
infrastructure and flood emergency rehabilitation, and 8 percent for budget support in
response to the food crisis. The distribution of projects across the CAS pillars is as follows:
•

The growth and competitiveness pillar is being supported through: (i) a power sector
project to lower the cost of the power utility and increase the poor’s access to
electricity; and (ii) a partial risk guarantee to the concession of the operation and
management of the joint public railway company, following on a previous Bank road
corridor project. Together with the port, transit activities along this corridor are a
major source of growth in Djibouti.

•

The human development pillar support focuses on: (i) a second school access and
improvement project, following on a first successful project; (ii) two health sector
projects (the HIV/AIDS, malaria and TB control and the health sector development
projects); (iii) a social development and public works project; and (iv) an emergency
floods rehabilitation project, for which an additional financing (grant) was approved
on February 22, 2007.

•

Support to the governance pillar is sought through IDF grants aimed at implementing
the action plan and recommendations of the Country Financial Accountability
Assessment (CFAA) and Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR).

In addition to the assistance through lending, the Bank supports Djibouti through country
analytical work. Following a Public Expenditure Review completed in FY 2005, a country
economic memorandum, aimed at recommending a set of policy options to face Djibouti’s
growth and competitiveness challenges, was completed in FY 2006. The Bank is also
supporting the National Initiative for Social Development (INDS) by providing technical
assistance to the INDS secretariat (SESN - Secrétariat d’État chargé de la Solidarité Nationale)
in planning and monitoring policy reforms in close collaboration with the Fund. Close
collaboration with the Fund is prevalent on macroeconomic issues (e.g., debt sustainability
analysis) and on the PRSP evaluation and update. A joint FSAP is scheduled for FY 2009.

57
Finally, given Djibouti’s weak institutional capacity, a great deal of emphasis is put on
technical assistance and capacity building efforts. Currently, the Bank manages a portfolio
of US$9.6 million in trust funds, including four IDF grants, two multiple donors’ trust funds
and a statistical capacity-building trust fund. The IDF grants finance institutional capacity
building in the areas of public procurement (US$357,000), budget and debt management
(US$343,000), and preparation of the implementation of an integrated social protection
system (US$244,000). A fourth IDF grant was approved at the end of May 2008 to support
the monitoring and evaluation systems of the INDS (US$284,000). The multiple donors’
trust funds support Djibouti’s participation to the Education for All Fast Track Initiative
(US$6 million) and efforts aimed at controlling avian and human influenza (US$2.1 million).
The statistical trust fund (US$252,700) supports the strengthening of national accounts and
the implementation of a new census planned at the end of 2008.
In spite of Djibouti’s poor economic environment, the overall performance of Bank projects
is good and development objectives are expected to be achieved satisfactorily for all projects
in the portfolio.
A new CAS covering the period FY09–FY11 is under preparation.

58
APPENDIX III. DJIBOUTI: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Outstanding statistical issues
Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Weaknesses
are particularly significant in the areas of national accounts, the trade balance, and external
debt, and to some extent for fiscal data. However, recent developments indicate an increasing
awareness of the importance of statistics among government officials. In 2002, the authorities
created the Directorate for Statistics and Demographic Studies (DISED) in order to enhance
the capacity of the statistical system and the efficient use of available resources. Djibouti
does not yet participate in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS), but has
submitted metadata and plans for improvements that are being reviewed.
National accounts
National account data have not been provided for publication in the IFS since 1999. With
World Bank and UNDP assistance, the DISED has been re-estimating sectoral GDP for
2000–05 and elaborating national accounts according to the 1993 SNA and updated statistical
guidelines, using a wide range of data based on surveys, import statistics, and financial
statements of public enterprises.
In 2009, once a population census has been completed, a survey to test its results using the
polling basis in the poverty survey will be followed by a comprehensive household
expenditure survey. This work will also help the revision of the CPI basket weights and to
update various social indicators, in particular to provide new poverty and income distribution
estimates (by end-2009). An economic survey, with support from development partners, to
integrate the data in the estimated national accounts will also be carried out.
Prices
The Consumer Price Index (CPI), calculated by the DISED on a monthly basis since
April 1999 using price surveys in Djibouti City, is the only measure of inflation. Before
1999, Fund staff monitored price developments on the basis of the CPI index compiled by the
French government for French expatriate residents in Djibouti. The DISED is currently
working to expand the national coverage of the index to areas outside the capital, as
mentioned above.
Government finance
Following the establishment of a coordination unit in the Ministry of Finance (MOF) in 1998
to improve data coverage and timeliness, fiscal data are now available monthly although with
some delays; however, these data do not cover a number of extra-budgetary accounts,
including three pension funds. In 2002, a comprehensive audit of domestic arrears was

59
completed with assistance from the European Union and the World Bank. Foreign-financed
capital expenditure and some foreign-financed current expenditures and their financing
(i.e., grants and loans) have been reported more regularly since 1999. However, additional
efforts are needed to improve the compilation and coverage of fiscal data, particularly at the
institutional level, in order to fulfill the recommendations made by a government finance
statistics mission in 2001; the above-mentioned pension funds, also need to be incorporated
into a consolidated general government budget. The MOF is reporting neither annual data for
dissemination in the GFS Yearbook nor high-frequency data for publication in the
International Finance Statistics (IFS).
Monetary accounts
Monetary statistics are generally adequate and cover the central bank and the aggregated
balance sheet of all commercial banks. The authorities initiated the publication of a
monthly bulletin in 2001. Monetary data are also posted on the BCD’s web site
(http://www.banque-centrale.dj/).
In 2004, a STA mission assisted the BCD in compiling monetary and financial statistics in
accordance with the Fund’s Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). The mission
highlighted various weaknesses, including the definition of the criterion of residence and the
classification of domestic assets and liabilities by sector, and advised on the preparation of
financial sector metadata for the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS). In September
2005, the BCD reported test monetary data to STA using the Standardized Report Forms
(SRFs), which embody the methodology in the MFSM.
A follow-up monetary and financial statistics mission visited Djibouti during December 2–12, 2007.
The mission: (1) reviewed progress made by the BCD in implementing the recommendations of the
2004 mission; (2) provided technical assistance in the major areas of data collection, compilation,
and dissemination; (3) assisted and provided guidance for the migration to the SRFs for the reporting
of monetary statistics to the IMF; (4) addressed BCD questions on implementing the methodology in
the MFSM; (5) assessed institutional coverage and data sources for the collection of data for other
financial corporations; and (6) reviewed GDDS metadata for the financial sector.
The mission found that the BCD has made little progress in implementing the
recommendations of the 2004 mission mainly because of insufficient staffing. The mission
addressed several issues highlighted by the MFS mission in 2004 as well as new issues that
have arisen since then and agreed with the authorities on a work plan for further improving
the monetary statistics. The BCD appointed a well-qualified division chief for monetary and
banking statistics. This will enhance BCD’s capacity to initiate the regular reporting of
monetary data in the SRF format following the next MFS mission scheduled in December
2008.

60
External sector
Substantial progress has been made in improving balance of payments statistics in line with
recommendations made by Fund’s technical assistance missions over the past few years.
Since August 2004, new balance of payments data adhering to the standards set forth in the
BPM5 are prepared. The new data set incorporates improvements involving transit trade to
neighboring countries, imports by the foreign military forces stationed in Djibouti, and the
treatment of the rent paid by the United States for the military base. The BCD is also
compiling data on the country’s international investment position (IIP) and has commenced
collection of some balance of payments data on a quarterly basis.
However, significant issues remain, which were highlighted by a June 2007 mission. Three
main problems were identified. The first one relates to trade statistics, which are no longer
compiled by the DISED, essentially because of managerial changes within this entity.
Therefore, the BCD has to make estimates of trade data, based on the trends in economic
activity and direct investments in the country. The second problem is a lack of coverage of
direct investment transactions in the BOP, which results mainly from the lack of human
resources devoted to BOP work at the BCD. Finally, the estimates made to calculate workers
remittances should be reviewed, as the figures appear underestimated (and which might help
might explain most of the negative errors and omissions in the balance of payments). The
mission also found that some improvements could be made to several items such as freight
transportation, investment income, transactions related to the presence of foreign military
bases in the country, the treatment of external debt statistics (through more comprehensive
information provided by the Direction du Financement Extérieur (DFE)), and other
investment of private sector (use of IBS data).
In 2007, the BCD resumed submission of balance of payments statistics for publication to
STA. With financial and technical assistance from the World Bank and UNCTAD, the
authorities adopted in 2002 a new system for the management of external debt, centralized
within the DFE of the MOF; the system became operational in mid-2003, and external debt
statistics were revised based on information received from creditors and covering the period
from 1999 onward. Debt statistics continue to be provided irregularly and with delay.

Translated from French

Djibouti, September 10, 2008

Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431

Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
The government of Djibouti has adopted a three-year economic and structural adjustment
program based on the National Initiative for Social Development (INDS), launched by the
government in January 2007 and considered to be the country’s Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (PRSP). The main components of the program are described in the attached
Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) for the period 2008–11. In
addition, the MEFP provides details on the government’s proposed objectives and on the
policies it plans to implement during the period 2008–09. You will also find herewith
a Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) covering a number of concepts and
definitions as well as the data to be reported within the framework of the program.
Djibouti is at a critical stage of its development. To maintain macroeconomic stability,
continue stimulating foreign and domestic private investment, fuel growth, reduce poverty,
and achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) with the help of the international
community, we plan to accelerate our economic and social reforms and link them to policies
designed to support sustained and broad-based growth. Institutional reforms will be essential
for fostering technological and organizational change and for drawing on the currently
abundant foreign investment flows with a view to creating enough jobs for a large portion of
the population.
We hereby request a three-year arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF), totaling SDR 12.72 million (80 percent of the quota), to support our
program. We also request that the first disbursement under the arrangement, for an amount
equivalent to SDR 3.864 million, be made available to Djibouti upon approval of the PRGF
arrangement by the IMF Executive Board.
The government of Djibouti believes that the economic policies and measures described in
the attached MEFP are apt to ensure achievement of the objectives of the program that will
be supported by the PRGF arrangement. However, it will take any further measures that may
prove necessary to that end. The government will also consult with the IMF on the adoption
of these measures, and in advance of revisions to the policies contained in the MEFP, in

2
accordance with IMF policy on consultations, and will provide the IMF with any information
it may need to assess progress made by the authorities in implementing the policies described
in the MEFP.
The government will provide the IMF with any information it may request for the purposes
of monitoring progress in the implementation of economic and financial policies and
determining the measures necessary for achievement of the program objectives. A TMU is
attached, describing the performance criteria and the quantitative and structural benchmarks
of the program. Djibouti will observe the schedule of semi-annual reviews, the first of which
is expected to be completed by end-March 2009.
Sincerely yours,

/s/

and Planning In Charge of Privatization

ATTACHMENT I TO LOI. MEMORANDUM ON ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES
I. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
1.
This memorandum describes the economic and financial program adopted by the
government of Djibouti within the framework of the three-year arrangement with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the period 2008–11, under the Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility (PRGF). During this period, we expect to consolidate macroeconomic
stability and lay a sound foundation for sustaining broad-based economic growth, especially
with a view to reducing poverty and unemployment. Such an outcome is essential to
achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and maintaining broad support for
economic and financial reform. Our medium-term economic and financial strategy will be
consistent with the National Initiative for Social Development (INDS), launched by the
government in January 2007 in consultation with the stakeholders and our development
partners and representing our second-generation Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP).
2.
Our strategy is geared toward creating the conditions for: (a) placing the economy on
a path of sustainable growth with a view to reducing unemployment, mitigating poverty, and
improving the country’s social indicators; (b) ensuring domestic financial stability, in
particular by controlling inflation, which adversely affects especially the poor; (c) moving
closer to a more viable external position over the medium term, notably by increasing
competitiveness and maintaining prudent management of foreign indebtedness;
(d) improving fiscal management and transparency, so as to achieve proper expenditure
targeting and prioritization in such a way as to free up resources to finance poverty reduction
programs; and (e) strengthening administrative and institutional capacities in various areas,
especially statistics.
3.
The satisfactory conclusion of the 2005 staff-monitored program (SMP) helped
improve conditions for private investment and increase external competitiveness in a number
of areas. In particular, progress has been made toward: (a) unifying and simplifying the tax
exemption system by merging the various preferential tax regimes and incorporating the
remainder of them into the General Tax Code; (b) computerizing expenditure procedures;
(c) eliminating the practice of exchanging checks with the national water authority (ONEAD)
and the national telecommunications agency (Djibouti Telecom); (d) limiting advance
payment authorizations of expenditure covered by legislation; (e) preparing a new
Commercial Code; (f) publishing the audited financial statements of the principal public
enterprises; and (g) setting up a new single payroll and civil service file.
4.
In 2006–07, Djibouti’s economic outlook improved significantly, largely because of
policies we implemented to modernize and develop our economy by promoting wide-ranging
foreign investment programs. Taking advantage of our strategic position on the Horn of
Africa and on the planet’s most frequently used sea route, our political stability, and our
membership in the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), we have

4
succeeded in attracting about US$1.2 billion in confirmed foreign direct investments (FDI)
for the period 2008–13, that is, equivalent to 140 percent of GDP in 2007. The linchpin of
those investments is the construction of a new deep-water port on the Doraleh site, where the
oil terminal is already in use, and the first phase of the container terminal is scheduled to
become operational at end-2009. This new port, also managed by Dubai Ports World (DPW),
will enable Djibouti to better serve Ethiopia’s needs, in fulfillment of what has been its
principal vocation for more than a century but also to diversify the port business by
developing our share in the trans-shipment market toward other countries of the region, for
which a huge market is now being created. Other investments go hand in hand with this
major project, notably the improvement of land communications with Ethiopia, the creation
of a hotel and tourism infrastructure, the expansion of the export processing zone, the
implementation of large capital projects in the areas of water and power, the installation of an
oil refinery with a capacity of 45,000 barrels a day, operations in the salt mining industry,
and the development of financial services. Infrastructure investment is supported by an
education policy aimed at providing universal access to secondary education by 2015.
5.
Nevertheless, huge challenges remain to be met in coming years. First, steps must be
taken to ensure that the FDI rate is maintained, and that growth is not limited solely to an
enclave around the port. Second, although economic outturns have improved significantly
over the past two years, highly capital-intensive projects have so far had only a slight impact
on job creation and fiscal revenue. The links must therefore be strengthened between the
large FDI inflows and the domestic economy, for a larger portion of the population to benefit
from growth, primarily by fostering the creation of jobs for the people of Djibouti but also by
freeing up budgetary resources that will enable us to finance the social programs that are
greatly needed by the people. In this regard, we are aware that widespread, sustained growth
is dependent upon the implementation of in-depth structural reforms, in particular the
improvement of our institutions and human capital, with a view to increasing productivity,
enhancing our international competitiveness, and encouraging private sector development,
especially of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
6.
The government is also aware of the need to consolidate the country’s
macroeconomic stability. This involves primarily combating inflation, which has an adverse
impact especially on the poor, while providing budgetary resources that are sufficient for
implementation of the poverty reduction strategy. To that end, we shall strengthen revenue
mobilization, streamline expenditure, and increase fiscal transparency. In addition, we plan to
remove gradually the restrictions on wholesale and retail food distributors’ margins that were
temporarily introduced with respect to a few staples to curtail the rise in commodity prices,
and to implement reforms to increase competition and open up the economy further. For its
part, the Central Bank of Djibouti (CBD) is determined to enhance its capacity to manage
liquidity so as to bring down the inflation rate to a level close to international rates. The
implementation of this program will require firm economic management as well as efforts
with the international community to obtain more financial and technical assistance.

5
7.
The remainder of this memorandum is devoted to a review of recent economic
developments, a description of the main components of the government’s economic program
for 2008–11, and a presentation of the measures and actions planned for the first year of the
program (September 1, 2008–August 31, 2009).
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
8.
The economic environment in Djibouti has improved considerably in recent years, but
inflationary pressures have intensified. Preliminary estimates suggest that real GDP growth
has accelerated, rising from 4.8 percent in 2006 to 5.3 percent in 2007, especially as a result
of the FDI flows into the port and construction sectors. The investment ratio has nearly
doubled in the space of two years, from 23 percent of GDP in 2005 to 42 percent in 2007.
However, the 12-month inflation rate at end-2007 reached 8.2 percent, compared with
3.5 percent in 2006, then increased further to nearly 10.3 percent at end-April 2008, primarily
because of the rise in international food and oil prices. The rate of expansion of credit to the
private sector quickened to 9 percent in 2006 and to 23 percent in 2007, reaching nearly
30 percent year on year at end-April 2008, partly as a result of the real estate and
construction boom and the recent arrival of new foreign banks on the market, which
promoted competition, thus reducing financial intermediation margins.
9.
The external current account deficit widened from 15 percent of GDP in 2006 to
about 25 percent in 2007, following the strong increase of imports related to the new
investments. 1 This deficit was more than covered by the surplus on the financial and capital
accounts resulting from inflows of capital, especially of FDI, which led to an increase in the
gross official reserves to US$130 million at end-2007 (equivalent to 1.9 months of imports of
goods and services and 116 percent currency board coverage). The gross official reserves
have continued to increase, reaching US$135 million at end-April 2008. The Djibouti franc
depreciated by about 4 percent in real effective terms, because of the weakening of the
U.S. dollar to which it is pegged.
10.
On the fiscal side, the overall budget balance on a commitment basis posted a deficit
of 2.6 percent of GDP in 2007, a figure close to that of 2006. The reduction of current
expenditure from 29.9 percent of GDP in 2006 to 26.5 percent in 2007 (partly as a result of
the exceptional increase in spending in 2006, related to the regional elections and to the
COMESA Summit) was offset by the upturn in investments. Accordingly, the basic deficit
narrowed from 7.2 percent of GDP in 2006 to 4.9 percent in 2007. Notwithstanding,
compared with the 2007 Budget Law, budget execution was expansionary in 2007 because of
the rise in international prices, the appreciation of the Euro, the introduction of the INDS, and
spending related to the preparation of the February 2008 parliamentary elections. Tax

The current account deficit, excluding FDI-related imports, is estimated at 3.7 percent of GDP in 2006 and
at 5.1 percent of GDP in 2007.

6
collection for the current year declined to 19.1 percent of GDP in 2007, down
from 19.8 percent in 2006, because of the shortfall generated by the exemptions granted to
investments in the port, the export processing zone, and the tourism sector. However, total
tax receipts remained steady at about 20 percent of GDP, as a result of exceptional
revenue collection for the previous periods (in particular, through an exchange of checks
(cross-offsetting) between the government and the national electricity company—EDD), on
the order of 1.4 percent of GDP. Nevertheless, the increase in external financing facilitated a
net refund of domestic and external arrears, for an estimated amount equivalent to
about 0.7 percent of GDP, despite the accumulation of further external arrears.
11.
Considerable progress continued in the implementation of structural reforms. The
government adopted a new Labor Code in December 2005, which came into force in 2006.
The physical audit of the civil service was completed in 2007. Three key measures in the
2005 staff-monitored program have been implemented, and our PRSP has already been
posted on the website of the Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Planning, Responsible for
the Privatization (MEFPP). IMF technical assistance (TA) has helped us enormously to
define some components of the ongoing reform in the fiscal, financial, and statistical areas.
On the fiscal side, such TA has been provided in the area of tax reforms—in particular, the
introduction of VAT and the improvement of cash management and of the budget and
accounting classification system. On the financial side, the Report on the Observation of
Standards and Codes (ROSC) with respect to anti-money laundering activities falls within the
framework of the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP)—a joint initiative of the
IMF and the World Bank, is currently scheduled for completion at end-2008. As regards
statistics, TA was provided to improve the compilation and classification of the balance of
payments statistics and monetary statistics as well as to implement the International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) at the CBD.
III. MEDIUM-TERM MACROECONOMIC FRAMEWORK
12.
In light of our strategic objectives and the large increases in oil and food prices, our
medium-term economic policy will be aimed at: (a) raising annual real GDP growth to about
7 percent, on the basis of the expected FDI inflows and their impact on the economy and of
the effects of fiscal stabilization and structural reforms; (b) controlling the inflation rate to
reduce it to a level close to 3–3.5 percent through rigorous budget management, structural
measures aimed at increasing productivity, and the introduction of new money management
instruments; and (c) supporting the integrity and credibility of the currency board by keeping
at least a 105 percent rate of coverage. Improving the competitiveness of our economy and
strengthening the production and transportation infrastructure should lead to an acceleration
in the growth of exports of goods and services. With medium-term financing requirements
continuing to be met from grants, concessional loans, and the ongoing flows of private
capital in the form of FDI, the country’s external position will be manageable. The gross
foreign currency assets of the CBD are expected to grow only gradually to cover 1.9 months
of imports of goods and services at end-2011.

7
13.
To increase poverty reduction expenditure while ensuring fiscal viability and greater
competitiveness of the economy, our medium-term fiscal and structural framework will be
designed to ensure that the overall budget during the period 2008–11 is balanced, and that
competitiveness will be improved. To this end, we shall take steps to: (i) implement an
overall reform of the tax system so as to streamline it, broaden the tax base, control
exemptions, increase tax revenue by about 1.8 percent of GDP between 2008 and 2011, and
tailor the tax system to meeting our international commitments within the COMESA and the
World Trade Organization (WTO); (ii) strengthen the tax administration; (iii) reduce the
share of wages in current expenditure by containing nominal wage increases (except merit
increases) and freezing public sector hiring (except in the social sectors), which will enable
us to reduce the wage bill to GDP ratio from 12.4 percent in 2007 to 10.3 percent in 2011;
(iv) adopt measures to control expenditure on goods and services; (v) adopt measures to
contain the contingent liabilities of public enterprises in deficit (in particular, the EDD) by
enhancing their competitiveness and reducing their operating costs; and (vi) improve
reporting on fiscal management, notably through the quick dissemination of fiscal data.
Measures will also be taken to achieve better human resources management in the public
sector, based on the indications provided by the physical audit of the civil service and the
ongoing organizational and strategic audits, with the strategic aim of modernizing and
streamlining government departments while containing personnel costs. Modernization of the
civil service is key to the government’s strategy. The overall improvement of human
resources management may include tailoring staffing to needs; strengthening competency
and merit criteria in recruitment, remuneration, and promotions; updating the civil service
general rules and regulations; and adopting a new Code of Conduct. To strengthen its
capacities, the government intends to request TA from its development partners during the
round table conference scheduled for November 2008.
14.
Other structural measures will be aimed at strengthening the statistical framework,
improving the business climate, and enhancing governance and the labor market. Regarding
the development of the CBD’s capacities for supervision and money management, we will
move expeditiously to consider implementation of the FSAP recommendations in areas
considered urgent and frame our medium-term policy along the lines of the guidance
provided in the program.
IV. THE ECONOMIC PROGRAM FOR 2008–09
15.
Our objective for the first year of the program, which covers September 1, 2008 to
August 30, 2009, is to achieve a growth rate of 5.9 percent in 2008 and 6.9 percent in 2009
while reducing inflation, year on year, to 5.5 percent at end-2009. To achieve this, we will
have to maintain fiscal moderation in light of persistently high international oil and food
prices. The growth target will be sustained by the large volume of FDI already committed for
the expansion of the port, the export processing zone, and the pertinent infrastructure, in
particular as relates to power, water, and the oil refinery.

8
16.
The evolution of the external current account will be largely determined by the
ongoing projects related to the major FDI projects. The external current account deficit is
expected to remain substantial in 2008–09, following an upsurge of imports related to these
new investments. The deficit however will no longer be covered by the increase in the
surplus on the financial and capital accounts generated by the upturn in FDI but by the
disbursement of funds from donors and lenders. Accordingly, the external position should be
manageable, and we hope to increase the foreign reserves gradually from US$131 million in
2008 to US$143 million at end-2009 (equivalent to 1.7 months of imports). We expect the
external public debt to stabilize at about 56 percent of GDP in 2009.
A. Fiscal Policy and Reform
17.
Fiscal policy will be the principal instrument used to implement the macroeconomic
framework defined in the new PRSP. Our economic program provides for a large increase in
poverty reduction expenditure. The execution and financing of this expenditure will remain
consistent with macroeconomic stability. To this end, concerted efforts will be needed to
improve fiscal management.
18.
Our fiscal policy will be designed to ensure a narrowing of the overall deficit, on
a commitment basis, from 2.6 percent of GDP in 2007 to 1.9 percent in 2008 and
to 1.8 percent in 2009. We are also determined to reduce the stock of domestic payment
arrears by 2.5 percent of GDP in 2008–09 and to clear all the external arrears by
end-August 2008. We will negotiate a multilateral agreement with the Paris Club shortly, and
follow suit with bilateral agreements under the terms set by the multilateral agreement. In
addition, we are determined to avoid the accumulation of further arrears and we intend to
request technical assistance to improve current debt management practices. Furthermore, the
government will initiate measures to increase tax revenue and reduce nonpriority current
expenditure.
19.
On the revenue side, our strategy is geared toward introducing VAT in January 2009,
as already announced in the 2008 Budget Law. The pertinent draft law, regarding which we
received TA from the IMF Fiscal Affairs Department, will be placed before the National
Assembly at the same time, at the latest, at the time of the 2008 supplementary budget, and at
any rate, by end-November 2008. There will be a single general VAT rate of at
least 7 percent, to be implemented as of the 2009 budget, and this will produce net revenue
equivalent to about 1.1 percent of GDP in 2009. 2

2

The full elimination of the CIT and the introduction of the COMESA’s common external tariff (CET) are now
scheduled for 2010, following a delay in adopting the common rates at the ministerial level within the
COMESA.

9
20.
To increase the mobilization of resources necessary for achieving our poverty
reduction objective, we intend to adopt, by end-August 2009, measures designed to
modernize the tax administration and improve collection, in particular by increasing the
number of Tax Department employees, to promote taxpayer compliance, and to enhance
collection by strengthening inspections and restructuring the tax collection organization, in
accordance with the recommendations of the IMF Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD)
TA missions. In addition, further measures will be adopted to simplify the tax system and
broaden the tax base while consolidating the tax administration. These measures include the
following: (i) by end-November 2008, revise the schedules of the personal income tax (ITS),
in accordance with the recommendations of the FAD TA missions, with a view to creating
more equity and protecting incomes in the context of poverty reduction; (ii) by
end-February 2009, revise some provisions of the Free trade Zone Law to prevent distortions
in the social security system and in the taxation of wages; and (iii) by end-February 2009,
revise the Investment Code to streamline tax exemptions (duration of exemptions, list of tax
benefits) and strengthen the procedures and resources for monitoring exempt projects. Lastly,
we shall redouble our efforts to collect outstanding taxes from previous financial years by
improving the technical management of the Tax Department.
21.
We also intend to adopt measures designed to increase the effectiveness of public
expenditure and cash management. In this regard, we plan to merge the government accounts
throughout the banking system into a single Treasury account, by end-May 2009. We shall
continue preparing the treasury’s Monthly Cash Flow Plans, based on precise estimates of
revenue and of expenditure requirements, and shall improve the process of budget
preparation, taking account of the recommendations of the FAD TA missions. In particular,
we shall revise the budget classification (by end-August 2009) and begin preparing, with TA
from the IMF (by end-August 2009) a comprehensive medium-term budget framework that
will include all government expenditure and will serve as a basis for preparation of
the 2010 Budget Law. We shall link the IT system of the Finance Department and the
Treasury (by end-February 2009) with technical and financial assistance from the European
Union; and (by end-February 2009) we shall improve the functionalities of the IT system of
the Finance Department, in particular by setting up automatic rejection and alert notifications
whenever budget appropriations are exceeded. To increase the liquidity of the government
accounts (by end-2008) we shall reduce net banking system credit to the government (stock
compared to the beginning of the year, excluding counterpart funds from the IMF and the
Arab Monetary Fund (AMF) by DF 500 million.
22.
Efforts will continue to meet the quantitative benchmarks and performance criteria of
the program, with the adoption by end-September 2008 of a revised 2008 budget and, by
end-December 2008, of a 2009 budget, both of which will be consistent with the quantitative
benchmarks and performance criteria set in the macroeconomic framework agreed between
the authorities and the IMF mission. In the context of the program, the ratio of current
expenditure to GDP is expected to fall from 26.5 percent of GDP in 2007 to 24 percent of
GDP in 2009, as a result of a reduction, in GDP terms, of nonpriority spending on goods and

10
services and better control over wage bill increases. The centralization, as of August 2008, of
public procurement of government departments through a Central Purchasing Office will
reduce average purchase costs by achieving economies of scale. The control of current
expenditure will be facilitated by the freezing of recruitment in the public sector (except for
the Ministries of Health and Education and the Tax Department) and of the structure of
nominal wages (excluding promotions), which we intend to maintain until the end of the
program, as well as through completion of the civil service reform, facilitated by the
finalization of the physical, organizational, and strategic audits and the establishment of the
new single payroll and civil service file. These measures are expected to free up the
additional resources necessary for increasing expenditure on poverty reduction (especially in
health and education).
23.
We estimate that public capital expenditure (primarily on infrastructure and social
projects) will be maintained at about 11 percent of GDP in 2008, financed largely by grants
and concessional external loans. To mobilize financial support, we shall organize
a conference of external donors and lenders by November 2008 and initiate bilateral
negotiations.
24.
The government will continue to abstain from seeking credit from the banking
system. We shall also avoid accumulating further external and domestic payment arrears,
including with respect to government-guaranteed debt, and are determined to reduce
domestic arrears by a sum equivalent to 1.2 percent of GDP, by end-2008.
25.
We shall also continue to strengthen fiscal management communications. We shall
publish regularly, in addition to the year-end preliminary budget execution data (within five
months of year-end), the monthly fiscal reporting table (TOFE—within 60 days of each
month-end), and the audited accounts of the social security fund and the major public
enterprises (within nine months of year-end). We shall also prepare detailed annual reports
on priority poverty-reduction social expenditure, which will be published within a period not
exceeding six months.
26.
Institutional development is key in the context of the new program. The government
will make every effort to build capacity in the areas of project planning, programming, and
preparation. Similarly, the rate of public expenditure implementation will be accelerated in
the context of the reform of the Public Procurement Code, under preparation with World
Bank assistance.
27.
To facilitate monitoring of the program, we shall forward to IMF staff: (i) the TOFE,
within 60 days of each month-end; (ii) quarterly balance of payments statistics, within one
quarter, starting from the third quarter of 2008; (iii) monetary and consumer price index
(CPI) data, within four weeks; and (iv) a monthly list of medium- and long-term public and
publicly guaranteed loans, with indications, for each loan, of: the creditor, the borrower, the

11
amount, the currency, the due date, the grace period, and the arrangements concerning
interest rates, within four weeks of each month-end.
B. Foreign Exchange, Monetary, and Financial Policies
28.
The currency board arrangement has served the economy well by ensuring price
stability, which has helped improve external competitiveness in recent years while
consolidating private sector confidence. The government intends to maintain the exchange
rate peg to the dollar in the context of the currency board. In this regard, the CBD will
rigorously cover its monetary commitments denominated in foreign currencies, with a hedge
ratio representing at least 105 percent of the currency in circulation.
29.
The authorities wish to strengthen liquidity management and improve the
effectiveness of financial intermediation. Accordingly, to be able to absorb excess liquidity
from the banking system and contribute to price stability, the CBD will formulate a project
for introducing a new monetary instrument, that of reserve requirements on deposits. The
reserve ratio to be applied to deposits, the rate of remuneration of those reserves, the deposits
to be subject to reserve requirements, and other characteristics of this instrument will be
defined in consultation with the local banks and with TA from the IMF; the implementation
of this mechanism is scheduled for August 31, 2009.
30.
Increased competition within the financial system following the installation in the
market of three new banks over the past two years should help reduce the cost of credit
further. Domestic credit to the private sector is expected to increase by about 35 percent in
2008 and by 29 percent in 2009. It is anticipated that broad money will grow slightly below
the rate of nominal GDP growth during 2008-09 . In accordance with these projections, the
authorities are also working closely with the banks to encourage them to expand the range of
financial products they offer their customers.
31.
The CBD has undertaken to strengthen its supervisory capacity so as to better ensure
the integrity of the expanding financial system. To meet the new requirements, we are
determined to build banking supervision capacity in accordance with the Basel principles, by
end-August 2009. This involves, among other things: (i) increasing the staffing of the CBD
and improving the technical skills of staff in the area of banking supervision, and
establishing a schedule for more regular on-site supervision (one inspection will be carried
out by end-February 2009, and two additional inspections will be conducted by end-August
2009); (ii) considering the application of accounting and regulatory standards to Islamic
banking; and (iii) doubling the required minimum capital of banks from DF 300 million to
DF 600 million, with a grace period for adaptation of the existing banks. In this context, the
upcoming FSAP mission will help to highlight the vulnerabilities of the new expanded
financial system and strengthen its role as a catalyst for economic growth.

12
32.
The government is also doing its best to increase the effectiveness of monitoring
anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT), by following
the recommendations of the recent IMF Legal Department mission. In this regard, the
authorities will take the following measures: (i) continue to raise awareness of AML/CFT
practices in the public and private sectors; (ii) by end-August 2009, increase the staffing of
the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), its resources, and its independence, so that it can
properly carry out its mission, taking into account the recommendations of the IMF Legal
Department’s AML/CFT mission; and (iii) by end-February 2009, approve additional decrees
or update and send the AML/CFT Law to the National Assembly (as applicable) for
enforcing the following provisions: (a) investigate and prosecute violators; (b) freeze the
assets of suspected terrorists, pursuant to the pertinent Resolutions of the United Nations
Security Council; and (c) include nonbank financial institutions among those to be supervised
for enforcement of the law by the CBD.
C. External Sector Policies
33.
The authorities are determined to maintain the existing free trade system. There are
no foreign exchange restrictions on current account or capital account transactions, and trade
is completely open; imports and exports are not subject to any prohibition. Moreover, we
fully intend to adopt the COMESA’s common external tariff (CET) as soon as an agreement
is reached by the member countries on the applicable rates and the other technical aspects
being defined, which will help allay the concerns recently expressed by the WTO.
34.
The economic reform program being conducted by the authorities is also aimed at
improving export outturns—in particular, accelerating exports of livestock, transportation,
and related services—and encouraging the creation of light industry, especially in the Free
Trade Zone. Exports grew considerably in 2007, partly as a result of the commissioning of
a regional center for livestock re-export in Djibouti at end-2006 and the strong growth of the
Ethiopian economy, which is currently the principal destination for goods and services
exported from Djibouti.
35.
To improve the sustainability of its external debt, the government will not contract or
guarantee nonconcessional loans. It will also be necessary to prevent public enterprises from
borrowing on nonconcessional terms, except in exceptional circumstances and after
consultations with IMF staff. The recent agreement to swap a portion of the external debt to
Italy into social projects is a step in the right direction. We shall pursue negotiations with
other Paris Club creditors once a new multilateral agreement is reached. The authorities will
provide IMF staff with all the details about the amount and the characteristics of each new
loan and will keep them informed of progress in the discussions with creditors. The
authorities will also strengthen their management of the external debt by increasing the
frequency of controls and analyses of the debt monitoring system, which is already
computerized, and by expanding the capacities of this system.

13
D. Competitiveness, Public Enterprises, and the Private Sector
36.
The authorities are determined to implement a policy of improving the country’s
external competitiveness. Although estimates of the real effective equilibrium exchange rate
show a gradual correction of the overvaluation of the Djibouti franc, several competitiveness
indicators suggest competitiveness remains poor, and this can be attributed primarily to the
high costs of the principal factors of production (power, telecommunications, and labor),
which continue to hamper private sector development. We therefore intend to adopt
structural reforms designed to reduce the costs of domestic production and improve the
business climate. Specific measures will be taken to: (a) enhance the legal and regulatory
framework for business; (b) reduce the costs of production factors; and (c) improve the labor
environment.
37.
Enhancing the legal and regulatory framework for business will start with the
submission of the new Commercial Code, prepared with assistance from the European
Union, to the National Assembly by end-November 2008, and the subsequent streamlining of
the procedures for the creation of enterprises. We shall also strengthen coordination of the
one-stop shop at the National Investment Promotion Agency (ANPI) with the other
departments concerned with private investment (Tax Department, Customs, etc.) by
end-February 2009, which will enable new enterprises to start up more quickly and at lesser
costs.
38.
As regards reducing the costs of production factors, we have decided to go forward
with the restructuring and fiscal consolidation of our principal public enterprises
(Djibouti-Telecom, ONEAD, and EDD), so as to improve the quality of their services, ensure
their financial viability, and increase their productivity. These enterprises in difficulty
(especially EDD) place great strain on the government budget, while the rates in effect,
which do not cover operational costs, constitute an increasingly heavy burden on the
consumer and on investors. More specifically, the authorities have undertaken to: (i) draw up
an action plan, by February 2009, for implementing the recommendations of the study on the
strategy for reducing the technical losses of the ONEAD; (ii) reorganize and adjust the
staffing of EDD with a view to reducing personnel costs—in accordance with the results of a
study to be undertaken by an independent, specialized international firm regarding the scope
of this adjustment--with plans for early retirement and the redeployment of excess employees
to other short-staffed public utilities (the report and recommendations will be concluded by
end-August 2009, and a progress report on the study will be produced by end-February
2009); and (iii) complete the study financed by the World Bank on the source of the
electricity distribution losses, by end-August 2009. We are also planning to build the
institutional capacity of the Ministry of Energy and draw up an energy efficiency plan to
increase electricity consumption savings, with assistance from the development partners.
39.
At the same time, we intend to develop alternative energy supply sources. On the one
hand, we are seeking to explore, as a priority, geothermal, solar, and wind energy in Djibouti,

14
and on the other hand, a major agreement was signed with Ethiopia to link our networks; this
will enable us to import electricity from that country. The link with Ethiopia will help us
reduce our production costs considerably; to that end, we intend to settle, by end-May 2009,
within the framework of the electricity purchasing agreement with Ethiopia, on the tariff
rates to be applied to the electricity bought through the connecting line.
40.
Finally, implementation of the new Labor code, which is the legal framework for the
labor market, is also a priority for improving the business climate. In this context, we shall
take measures designed to facilitate hiring and the creation of enterprises on the basis of the
new Labor Code; this will make the labor market more flexible. In particular, we shall by
end-May 2009 adopt the remaining implementing decrees for the Labor Code and by
end-August 2009 renegotiate all collective bargaining agreements within the periods
prescribed by the Code.
41.
The authorities are aware of the pertinence of strengthening governance and
institutional transparency to improve the business climate further. For this purpose, we
undertake to boost the General Finance Inspectorate (IGF) by: (i) restructuring it (by
end-May 2009), (ii) formulating for it an annual program of missions for 2009 (by
end-November 2008), and (iii) continuously building the skills of its personnel.
E. Statistical and Other Issues
42.
Because the quality of our statistical database is still poor, our policy formulation
efforts continue to be hampered. For the future, measures will also have to be taken, with the
help of the IMF, the World Bank, and other development partners, to improve the quality,
coverage, and timeliness of economic data; and to strengthen national accounting, the quality
of the balance of payments data, and the compilation and coverage of government finance
statistics, based on the recommendations of the IMF technical assistance missions. We shall
improve coordination among the Statistics and Demographic Studies Department (DISED),
the CBD, and the various MEFPP departments, including Customs, with a view to creating
a sound statistical base covering the entire country. In particular, by end-February 2009, we
shall carry out a full population census. Early in 2009, when the census has been completed,
we intend to begin a survey to test the results that will be used as the polling basis in the
poverty survey, which is expected to be completed at end-August 2009 and will be followed
by a comprehensive household expenditure survey. This will help us revise the weights used
in the CPI basket and update the various social indicators, in particular to provide new
poverty and income distribution estimates. The information will be forwarded to the IMF and
the international community by end-2009. By end-August 2009, we shall also complete an
economic activities survey, with support from our development partners, to integrate the data
in the estimated national accounts. Our intention is to provide sufficient resources, including
personnel, to the units responsible for carrying out these surveys, so as to produce better
source data.

15
43.
We shall cooperate fully with the upcoming safeguards assessment mission, which is
scheduled to take place by the time of the first review of the PRGF-financed arrangement.
Based on the findings of that mission, we shall formulate a strategy to make up for any
shortcomings in the legal framework and financial controls of the CBD, and provide, where
applicable, for specific remedial measures to be included in the program.
V. RISKS FOR THE PROGRAM
44.
We are determined to launch a vigorous program of reforms and seize the
opportunities presented by the arrival of exceptionally high FDI. However, the success of the
program is subject to major risks and constraints. First, the wide-ranging and thorny reforms,
such as the freezing of recruitment in the public sector (except for the Ministries of Health
and Education and the strengthening of the Tax Department) and of the structure of nominal
wages (excluding promotions), may well lead to political and social pressures that can hinder
implementation of the program. Second, the absorption capacity and implementation
constraints may prevent us from carrying out the reforms quickly enough to meet the needs
of the huge FDI inflows. Third, regional stability may also constitute serious risks. Finally,
further oil and food price increases may well reignite inflation and place budget sustainability
in jeopardy.
VI. PROGRAM MONITORING
45.
For program implementation and monitoring, a constant effort will be required to
improve Djibouti’s economic and financial statistics. The authorities will take all necessary
measures in this area and will request additional technical assistance, if needed. They will
forward in a timely manner any information requested by IMF staff, in accordance with the
calendar set forth in the TMU attached to this memorandum. The first and second reviews
of the program are scheduled for completion, respectively, by end-March 2009 and
end-September 2009. As regards the first review, compliance with the quantitative
performance criteria established for end-December 2008, as shown in Table 1, and with the
end-November structural performance criterion described in Table 2, will also be monitored.
Quantitative benchmarks have also been set for end-September 2008 and end-March 2009
(Table 1), and the TMU will present more in-depth definitions and explanations.
46.
Based on the above-mentioned monitoring indicators and under the authority of
the Minister of Economy, Finance, and Planning, Responsible for Privatization, the
Secretary-General of that Ministry will coordinate the technical data necessary for
monitoring the program.
47.
In addition, the government will not impose any restrictions on payments related to
current international transfers and transactions that would be inconsistent with the country’s
obligations under Article VIII of the IMF Articles of Agreement.

ATTACHMENT II TO LOI. TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
48.
This memorandum defines the quantitative performance criteria and benchmarks for
the new program supported by the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF), described
in Tables 1 and 2 of the pertinent Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies
(MEFP). It also establishes the scope and frequency of data to be provided for program
monitoring purposes. Government (the authorities or the government) is defined only as the
central government, excluding the social security system.
49.
Structural performance criteria and structural benchmarks are established for
end-August 2008, end-February 2009, and end-August 2009, while quantitative performance
criteria are set for end-December 2008 and end-June 2009. By performance criteria (ceilings
and floors) and indicative targets, we mean the cumulative changes that have occurred
between the beginning of the calendar year and the end of the month of reporting. Certain
floors and ceilings are adjusted by the cumulative gaps between flows of external financing
(grants and loans) and the projections, converted at respective projected exchange rates.
PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
50.
Domestic arrears are defined as payments falling due (principal or interest) on the
domestic debt or on obligations contracted or guaranteed by the central government or the
CBD. The ceiling on accumulation of new domestic arrears should be met on a continuous
basis.
51.
External arrears are defined as the stock of external arrears on debt contracted or
guaranteed by the central government or the CBD, excluding debt subject to rescheduling or
cancellation. This performance criterion is applied continuously. The ceiling on accumulation
of new external arrears should be met on a continuous basis.
52.
Net credit to the government from the banking system is defined as the sum of net
banking and nonbanking financing of the government, namely, claims on the government
minus government deposits with the financial system. Claims on the government will not
include IMF and AMF counterpart funds. Treasury bills and similar financial instruments
that may be issued solely for liquidity management purposes will be excluded from claims on
the government.
53.
Medium- and long-term nonconcessional external debt contracted or guaranteed
by the government and the CBD includes foreign currency-denominated debt, of maturities
of one year or longer, contracted or guaranteed by the government or the CBD with a grant
component (discount NPV in relation to of the nominal value) of less than 35 percent, based
on discount rates specific to the currency and the maturity as announced by the OECD
(benchmark commercial interest rates). This performance criterion applies not only to debt as
defined in point 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt
(Decision 12274-(00/85) of August 24, 2000), but also to commitments contracted or

19
guaranteed for which value has not been received. The ceiling on new medium- and
long-term nonconcessional loans contracted or guaranteed by the central government or by
the CBD should be met on a continuous basis.
54.
Currency board coverage. Gross foreign assets of the CBD are defined as the value
of the external assets of the CBD, including: (a) monetary gold; (b) SDR assets; (c) the
reserve position in the IMF; (d) foreign currency holdings; and (e) claims on nonresidents,
such as deposits abroad. The foreign assets of the CBD exclude assets that are committed or
otherwise encumbered, including but without being limited to assets used as collateral or
guarantee for foreign liabilities of third parties (assets not immediately available). For the
purposes of monitoring performance compared with currency board coverage, the effects of
valuation on the stock of gold holdings will be excluded, and gold holdings will be valued at
the gold price in effect on December 31, 2007. Similarly, the U.S. dollar value of the gross
international reserves will be converted into Djibouti francs at the exchange rate of
US$1=DF 177.721. Defined thus, the official reserves totaled US$130 million at
December 31, 2007. The exchange rate for the SDR and for currencies other than the dollar
will be maintained at their end-December 2007 level as published in IFS. All the required
adjustments will be calculated at the exchange rates in the program. For program purposes,
currency board coverage is defined as the gross foreign assets of the CBD divided by the sum
of government deposits at the CBD and reserve money. The floor on currency board cover
should be met on a continuous basis.
QUANTITATIVE BENCHMARKS
55.
Wage bill. The ceiling on the wage bill includes all gross salaries, wages, allowances,
benefits, and payments, including housing assistance, that the government agrees to pay to
civil servants and to military and security personnel (whether permanent or temporary) and to
all other government employees except personnel of the Ministries of Education (including
housing assistance) and Health, regardless of the means of payment used (cash, check, or
other instruments) or the payment agent (the Treasury or another agency acting on behalf of
the government).
STRUCTURAL PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
56.
Reserve requirements will be applied to commercial bank deposits. The reserve
ratio, remuneration, type of deposits subject to reserves and other characteristics of this
instrument will be defined after consultation with the local banks and in agreement IMF staff.
STRUCTURAL BENCHMARKS
57.
Transparency/Reporting. The fiscal reporting table (TOFE), the year-end budget
execution data, and the audited accounts of the social security funds and principal public
enterprises will be published, within the scheduled periods, on the Web page of the MEFPP
or in the Bulletin d’Information Économique (Economic Survey). The social security funds

20
consist of the National Social Security Fund (CNSS) and the Military Retirement Fund
(CMR), and the principal public enterprises include the national electricity company (EDD),
the national water authority (ONEAD) and the national telecommunications company
(Djibouti-Telecom). The audited accounts will include the balance sheet, income statement,
flow of funds, and auditors’ notes. The year-end budget execution data would include a
breakdown by category, thus facilitating identification of all the pertinent subcategories of
revenue, expenditure, and financing (including direct, indirect, and other taxes; grants;
wages; goods and services; investments, etc.).
58.
Single Treasury account. Introduce a single Treasury account. Close the various
Treasury accounts at the CBD, except for accounts 1540 (principal current account) and 1539
(government compensation fund - EIC); consolidate their balances in the principal account
1540, and create subaccounts for operations such as those covered by the wage-earners
account and the Office of the President account; if necessary, amend the banking regulations
to allow for the opening of subaccounts.
PROGRAM ADJUSTMENT COMPONENTS
59.
Gross foreign assets and the targets for net claims on the government and for the
reduction of domestic payment arrears are defined on the basis of the assumed projected
cumulative amounts for external debt service payments in cash, program-related financing
(loans and grants), and the income of military bases.
60.
In cases where the total of the external debt service payments (due date basis)
exceeds (does not meet) the target for net claims on the government, the gross foreign assets
of the CBD will be lowered (raised), and the ceiling on net claims on the government will be
raised (lowered) by the amount of any surplus (deficit) compared with the target. By law, net
claims on the government cannot be negative. Accordingly, in the event that the required
adjustment were such that the total external debt service payments did not allow for this
obligation to be met, leading to a negative net claims on the government figure, the
difference will be applied to lowering the domestic payment arrears reduction target.
61.
In cases where government external debt service payments in cash exceed (do not
meet) the target, the net claims on the government ceiling will be raised (lowered) by the
amount of the surplus (deficit) compared with the target. Net claims on the government will
also be lowered (raised) by the amount of any surplus (deficit) compared with the 2007
French or U.S. payments related to the use of military bases. When net claims on the
government are negative following these adjustments, the difference will be applied to
lowering the domestic payment arrears reduction target.
62.
In cases where the financing of grants and loans in budgetary assistance exceeds
(does not meet) the program target, the net claims on the government ceiling will be lowered
(raised) by one-half of the surplus (deficit) compared with the target. When net claims on the

21
government are negative following these adjustments, one-half of the difference will be
applied to lowering the domestic payment arrears reduction target.
63.
In the event that the nonreschedulable arrears to Paris Club creditors are settled
at end-August 2008, the net claims on the government ceiling will be lowered by the amount
of the payment made. If, following these adjustments, net claims on the government are
negative, the difference will be applied to lowering the domestic payment arrears reduction
target.
REPORTING OBLIGATIONS
64.
The authorities will provide the IMF with all statistical, economic, and financial data
necessary for monitoring economic developments and the results of the program, including
but without being limited to the specific information below.
65.

Statement of the IMF Staff Representative on Djibouti
September 17, 2008

1. This statement updates information presented in the staff report and does not modify
the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2. While still at its peak, inflation growth has moderated and the drought and the
steep increase in international food prices pose an immediate threat for a large
share of the population. Year-on-year inflation at the end of July remained at around 14
percent. Cereals (60 percent year-on-year price increase) and vegetables (44 percent)
continue to be the main inflation drivers. The WFP estimates that about 150,000 people
in Djibouti (about one-fifth of the population) are at risk of malnutrition. The drought is
also causing the loss of livestock and displacing the rural population into urban areas.
International aid agencies, including the WFP and USAID, have stepped up their
emergency assistance programs; USAID is expected to provide over 1 million metric tons
of food to the region during 2008 and a total of about US$3 million in emergency
assistance to Djibouti. The WFP is also working to launch a voucher program to shelter
the urban poor from the effects of food prices, and to provide food rations and assistance
to farmers and livestock in rural areas. In addition, the UAE has provided a US$10
million grant for balance of payments support in July.
3. Budget execution data up to May is broadly in line with projections. Fiscal
revenue appears broadly on target, prompted by a good performance of consumption
taxes. There have been overruns on goods and services, although this could be partly due
to the temporary misclassification of some investment expenditure. Expenditure on
wages is also slightly above trend, and the intensification of the food crisis could pose
additional expenditure requirements that would need to be compensated by cuts in lowpriority areas.
4. The authorities have confirmed that all external arrears vis-à-vis multilateral
creditors have been cleared as of September 15, 2008. Assurances were received from
the Paris Club on the financing of the program, including on the clearance of bilateral
arrears.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 17, 2008

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes
2008 Article IV Consultation with Djibouti
On September 17, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Djibouti.7
Background
Djibouti’s macroeconomic performance improved significantly, but inflationary pressures
are intensifying. Real GDP growth accelerated to 5.3 percent in 2007, driven mainly by
FDI concentrated in the construction and port services, while the contribution of public
services to real GDP declined to 14.5 percent. The share of investment in GDP grew to
about 42 percent. This rapid expansion, combined with the surge in food and oil import
prices, pushed inflation from 3.5 percent in 2006 to 13.9 percent year-on-year in June
2008. In response, the authorities have eliminated consumption tax rates on five basic
food items, and reached agreement with importers and retailers to cap their profit
margins on these and other basic items.
The overall fiscal deficit remained at about 2.6 percent of GDP in 2007, even as the
basic fiscal deficit (which excludes externally financed revenue and expenditure)
narrowed from 7.2 percent in 2006 to 4.9 percent in 2007. Tax revenue declined by
about 1 percent of GDP, as a result of tax exemptions granted to new investments and
sluggish job creation. This decline was offset by an exceptional collection of overdue
taxes. The decline in current expenditure from 30 percent of GDP in 2006 to about
26.5 percent in 2007, was more than compensated by a strong increase (3.7 percent of
GDP) in public investment. Government external arrears at end-2006 have been repaid,

7

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

2
but new accumulations led to disbursement delays in some loans. External public and
publicly guaranteed debt remained at about 60 percent of GDP.
After remaining stagnant for several years, credit to the private sector increased by
23 percent in 2007, owing in part to a real estate and construction boom and increased
competition. The arrival of three new foreign banks in 2006–07, increasing the total to
five, has fostered competition by reducing spreads and widening the range of financial
instruments. Broad money growth slowed down to 9.6 percent due to a lower
accumulation of banks’ foreign assets. The capital adequacy ratio remained well above
minimum requirements and asset quality improved. Greater confidence in the currency
board and in the banking system led to a decrease in dollarization from 52.4 percent of
total bank liabilities in 2006 to 51.4 percent in 2007, reducing financial vulnerability.
The deteriorating current account balance reflects mainly a surge in imports financed by
foreign investment, but also the increase in food and oil prices. The external current
account is estimated to have shifted into a deficit of about 25 percent of GDP in 2007—
but this has been more than offset by the large capital and financial account surplus,
resulting in a small increase in gross official reserves to US$130 million at end 2007
(equivalent to a currency board cover of 116 percent). The real effective exchange rate
has depreciated by a cumulative of 24 percent in 2001–07, relative to its 2000 average,
reflecting mainly the weakening of the U.S. dollar. Nevertheless, a variety of indicators,
including high domestic production costs, suggest that competitiveness remains weak.
Significant progress has been achieved in the implementation of structural reforms. All
key pending structural benchmarks of the 2005 Staff Monitored Program were
implemented. In particular, progress was made in the areas of fiscal transparency, civil
reform and the legal framework for private sector companies. The quality of monetary
and balance of payment statistics is being strengthened with Fund technical assistance,
and an assessment of the AML/CFT system was conducted by the Fund’s legal
department in 2007, in the context of a forthcoming FSAP.
The short-term outlook for growth is favorable, driven by a solid pipeline of large
investment projects. Real GDP would increase by 5.9 percent in 2008. Inflation is
expected to be slightly above 8 percent at end-2008, but would decline gradually
thereafter as world food and oil prices ease. Revenue and expenditure measures are
expected to reduce the overall fiscal deficit to 1.9 percent of GDP in 2008, while the
current account deficit is projected to remain at about 33 percent of GDP, as FDI-related
imports remain high.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They welcomed
Djibouti’s strong economic growth driven by large foreign direct investments in the port
and other key sectors of the economy. At the same time, Directors noted that the
associated increase in inflation has been exacerbated by the surge in food and oil
import prices, pointing to the need to contain inflationary pressures as a priority.
Ensuring debt sustainability while reducing widespread unemployment and poverty
remains a key challenge over the medium term. This will call for strict fiscal discipline

3
and the acceleration of structural reforms to broaden the economic base, enhance
productivity, and promote private sector development.
Directors supported the authorities’ economic program aimed at achieving
macroeconomic stability, improving competitiveness, and strengthening the external
position. They regarded the new Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) as a significant step
toward addressing key structural bottlenecks. Directors underscored that a successful
implementation of the Fund-supported program, which is critical for enhancing the
confidence of investors and donors, will require strong program ownership and
perseverance. They accordingly called on the authorities to take the necessary actions
in this regard.
Directors emphasized the importance of maintaining the fiscal consolidation objective,
with a view to controlling inflation and creating fiscal space to finance the poverty
reduction strategy. Most Directors considered the fiscal adjustment path appropriate,
noting the efforts already taken in, and planned for, 2008, especially those on the
revenue front, which would only bear fruit in few years’ time. A few Directors would have
preferred a more front-loaded fiscal adjustment path than envisaged under the program,
given the limited role of monetary policy under the currency board arrangement, the
widening of the current account deficit, and the vulnerability of the budget to external
financing conditions. Directors cautioned against reliance on price controls or other
restrictions that may hamper the effective functioning of the market. They called for the
prompt implementation of a system of targeted subsidies, with World Bank assistance,
to alleviate the effects of high food prices on the poor.
Directors welcomed the medium-term objective of reaching a balanced fiscal position.
They commended the authorities for the improvements already made in tax
administration, and the plan for a comprehensive tax reform, including the introduction
of a VAT and the streamlining of tax exemptions. Directors also welcomed the
authorities’ commitment to contain current expenditure by improving budget
management, intensifying expenditure prioritization, and gradually reducing the wage
bill. They called for continued efforts to reform the civil service and enhance fiscal
transparency. Directors supported the authorities’ request for Fund technical assistance
to strengthen the budget management framework.
Directors stressed that Djibouti’s still high risk of debt distress and vulnerability to a
worsening of external borrowing conditions and other external shocks require the
authorities’ continued attention. They welcomed the clearance of arrears with
multilateral creditors, and encouraged the authorities to negotiate a multilateral
agreement with the Paris Club. The upcoming donors’ conference provides a good
opportunity to mobilize external financing needed for investment programs on highly
concessional terms. Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to request technical
assistance to improve debt management practices to help avoid the accumulation of
new arrears.
Directors agreed that the currency board has served Djibouti well, contributing to
enhanced confidence and macroeconomic stability. Directors noted the staff’s

4
assessment that the real effective exchange rate appears to be broadly in line with
economic fundamentals, and encouraged the authorities to continue their efforts to
improve external competitiveness, including by reducing the costs of critical production
factors. In particular, Directors saw the need to downsize and improve the management
of the two main loss-making public utility companies, and to develop alternative energy
sources. They also encouraged the authorities to improve the business climate,
including by adopting the new commerce code and enforcing the new labor code.
Directors welcomed the planned introduction of reserve requirements on bank deposits
to mop up structural liquidity and help contain inflationary pressures. They stressed the
need to reinforce the central bank’s supervision capacities and to update the legal and
regulatory framework to keep pace with the rapid expansion of the financial system. The
forthcoming FSAP is expected to provide valuable guidance in this regard. Directors
also looked forward to the implementation of the recommendations of the recent ROSC
on AML/CFT issues.
Directors encouraged the authorities to take full advantage of the technical assistance
offered by donors to improve the quality of statistics. They stressed, in particular, the
importance of completing the population census and the household income and
expenditure surveys to help monitor the effects of macroeconomic and poverty reduction
policies.
The next Article IV consultation with Djibouti is expected to be held in accordance with
the Executive Board decision on the consultation cycle for members with Fund
arrangements.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

IMF Executive Board Approves US$20 Million PRGF Arrangement for Djibouti
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has approved a three-year,
SDR 12.72 million (about US$20 million) arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility (PRGF) for Djibouti in support of the government’s economic program and
its poverty reduction strategy.
The decision allows for an immediate disbursement to Djibouti of an amount equivalent to
SDR 3.864 million (about US$6 million) that will contribute to strengthening Djibouti’s
external position against the effects of the food and oil price shocks.
Following the Executive Board discussion, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy Managing Director
and Acting Chairman, said:
“Djibouti’s growth performance and prospects have improved significantly, driven by large
foreign direct investments in the port and other key sectors of the economy. At the same
time, this rapid expansion, combined with the surge in food and oil import prices, has pushed
up domestic prices. The challenge remains to reduce widespread unemployment and poverty
by expanding growth beyond an enclave around the port, while ensuring fiscal and debt
sustainability. The authorities’ program of economic and financial policies, supported by the
Fund, aims to foster sustained, broad-based economic growth through macroeconomic
stability, improved competitiveness, and a strengthened external position. The Fund’s
financial assistance under the PRGF arrangement with an augmented access will help
Djibouti cope with the impact of the food and oil price shocks.
“The authorities have acted quickly to contain the hardship on the poor through temporary
measures. These measures will be replaced by a system of targeted subsidies to be
implemented with World Bank assistance. Competition-enhancing measures will also be
stepped up to improve efficiency and reduce profit margins.
“The authorities are committed to bringing the overall fiscal position to a balance in the
medium term by containing current expenditure (excluding social expenditures) and
broadening the tax base. Improving competitiveness will require a concerted effort to reduce

2

domestic production costs, through a decisive restructuring of loss-making state-owned
enterprises and a permanent solution to the shortage and high price of electricity power. The
planned adoption of a new commerce code and the implementation of the new labor code
will also help improve the business climate.
“In the context of the currency board arrangement, taming inflation will depend heavily on
fiscal discipline, complemented by the introduction of new monetary instruments to mop up
structural liquidity and improved oversight of the expanding banking system. External
financial assistance from the Fund and other donors will help fill the medium term financing
gap of the program and contribute to financial stability. Debt management should be
strengthened to ensure that Djibouti’s risk of debt distress follows a downward trajectory
towards sustainability, while limiting new financing to grants and external borrowing on
highly concessional terms.
“Djibouti’s National Initiative for Social Development is a significant step to address key
structural bottlenecks. The expected completion of the new population census and household
expenditure survey will be key to monitoring the effects of macroeconomic and poverty
reduction policies going forward,” Mr. Portugal said.
The PRGF is the IMF's concessional facility for low-income countries. PRGF loans carry an
annual interest rate of 0.5 percent and are repayable over 10 years with a 5½-year grace
period on principal payments.

ANNEX
Recent Economic Developments
Djibouti’s macroeconomic performance has improved significantly, but inflationary pressure
is intensifying. Real GDP growth accelerated from 4.8 percent in 2006 to 5.3 percent in
2007, largely driven by foreign direct investments. The share of investment in GDP grew
from 23 percent in 2005 to about 42 percent in 2007. This rapid expansion, combined with
the surge in food and oil import prices, pushed inflation from 3.5 percent in 2006 to 13.9
percent year-on-year in June 2008. In response, the authorities have eliminated consumption
tax rates on five basic food items, and reached agreement with importers and retailers to cap
their profit margins on these and other basic items.
The overall fiscal deficit remained at about 2.5 percent of GDP in 2007, even as the basic
fiscal deficit (which excludes externally-financed revenue and expenditure) narrowed from
7.2 percent in 2006 to 4.9 percent in 2007. The slight rise in the overall deficit in 2007 is
explained by the large increase (3.7 percent of GDP) in public investment. External public
and publicly-guaranteed debt remained at about 60 percent of GDP.
The external current account is estimated to have shifted from a small surplus in 2003 to a
deficit of about 25 percent of GDP in 2007, but this has been more than offset by the large
capital and financial account surplus, resulting in a small increase in gross official reserves to
US$130 million at end-2007. This increase, however, lagged behind imports, thus resulting
in a reduction of the import cover to less than two months. The real effective exchange rate
(REER) has depreciated by a cumulative of 24 percent in 2001–07, relative to its 2000
average, reflecting mainly the weakening of the U.S. dollar. Nevertheless, a variety of
indicators suggest that competitiveness remains low. Electricity, labor, and other domestic
production costs are high, while skill level is low, and the institutional environment is weak.
Program Summary
The program aims at fostering sustainable and balanced economic growth through
macroeconomic stability, improved competitiveness, reduced inflation, and a strengthened
external position. It focuses on: (i) bringing the overall fiscal position to a balance in the
medium term while increasing the share of social and infrastructure projects in total
spending; (ii) strengthening financial sector soundness; (iii) improving competitiveness
mainly through a reduction in domestic production costs; and (iv) building institutional
capacity, particularly strengthening the statistical framework, fiscal transparency, and public
sector governance.
The authorities’ fiscal policy under the program aims at balancing the budget in the medium
term while increasing spending for poverty reduction. The overall deficit (on a commitment
basis) would be brought to balance by 2011, while current expenditure on social programs
would increase to about 12 percent in 2011. Tax reforms and improvements in tax
administration would reverse the decline in tax revenue and bring it back to about 20 percent
of GDP by 2011. Additional measures would be adopted to contain current expenditure not

4

related to the poverty-reduction strategy, and the public investment program would be
financed mainly external grants and concessional loans. The wage bill would be further
contained in the medium term by the reform of the civil service, including completion of
organizational and strategic audits.
The new PRGF arrangement implies access to funds amounting to SDR 12.72 million (about
US$20 million), corresponding to 80 percent of Djibouti’s IMF quota. This access level
reflects Djibouti’s status as a second-time PRGF user as well as the projected financing needs
of the country, taking into account the impact of the food and oil price shocks, and is
consistent with Djibouti’s projected capacity to repay the Fund.

Statement by Laurean Rutayisire,
Executive Director for Djibouti
September 17, 2008

I - Introduction
I would like to express the deep appreciation of my Djiboutian authorities to
Management and Staff for their support and for the constructive policy dialogue during
the recent discussions on the 2008 Article IV consultation and the new program
supported by an arrangement under the PRGF.
Notwithstanding the adverse impact of the surge in global prices of oil and food and the
tension at the border with Eritrea, my Djiboutian authorities have made commendable
progress towards preserving macroeconomic stability and laying out required conditions
for a successful implementation of a new PRGF-supported program. Economic growth
accelerated in 2007 driven by large foreign direct investments. External competitiveness
improved through further real effective depreciation of the Djiboutian franc and key
structural reforms were implemented, notably, the enforcement of a new labor code, the
physical audit of the civil service, and the adoption of a PRSP prepared in collaboration
with the World Bank and the Fund.
High oil and food import price shocks have had severe impact on Djibouti’s cost of
living. In response, the authorities introduced temporary measures to eliminate
consumption taxes on five basic food staples and reach agreement with importers and
retailers to cap their profit margins on these food items. However, going forward, my
Djiboutian authorities are strongly committed to continue their efforts in maintaining
macroeconomic stability, stimulate foreign and domestic investment, expand growth,
create jobs, reduce poverty and accelerate structural reforms. In order to strengthen their
efforts, my authorities are requesting a three-year arrangement under the PRGF. The well
documented debt sustainability analysis has underscored the high risk of debt distress
Djibouti is facing. My authorities are hopeful that a successful implementation of the new
PRGF-supported program will help mobilize the support of their development partners,
advance in structural reforms, improve competitiveness and sustained higher economic
growth.
II - Recent Macroeconomic Developments
The stable political situation and foreign investments flows in 2006-07 have led to
significant improvements in macroeconomic performance. Real GDP accelerated to
5.3 percent in 2007 from 4.8 percent in 2006 thanks to investments in the construction
and port services sectors. The overall fiscal deficit remained at about 2.5 percent with a
basic fiscal deficit narrowing from 7.2 percent in 2006 to 4.9 percent in 2007 as the
current expenditure declined to 26.5 percent in 2007 from 30 percent in 2006. However
due mainly to the increase in imports financed by foreign investments and the surge in

2
food and oil prices, the current account deficit stood at about 25 percent and was more
than offset by the large capital and financial account surplus. The gross official reserves
increased to USD 130 million or to a currency board cover of 116 percent. The credit to
the private sector also increased by 23 percent in 2007 after being stagnant over the past
years.
The strong commitment of my Djiboutian authorities to improve the competitiveness of
the economy has translated into significant progress in implementing structural reforms.
The reform of the civil service has advanced with the completion of the physical audit
and the establishment of a single registry of civil servants. A new labor code came into
force. The reform of the social safety system was implemented by merging two of the
three pension funds. The computerization of the expenditure chain was finalized. The
audited financial statements of public enterprises for 2004 and 2005 were published on
the website of the ministry of finance in December 2007. This practice will continue by
publishing the 2006 audited statements in 2008. The authorities announced in the 2008
budget law the introduction of the VAT early 2009 and also adopted the proposed
measures for this introduction including an action plan. Progress has also been made in
unifying and simplifying the system of tax exemptions by merging the various
preferential tax regimes. With regard to the anti-money laundering, an assessment of the
system in place was conducted by the Fund’s Legal Department. In addition the Central
Bank of Djibouti benefited also Fund’s technical assistance in implementing the
international financial reporting standards (IFRS).
My Djiboutian authorities are fully aware on the urgent need to improve the
competitiveness of the economy by lowering domestic production costs and preserving
macroeconomic stability. They are determined to pursue the implementation of structural
reforms and strengthen the regulatory framework for the development of the private
sector seen as an engine of growth and job creation in order to alleviate poverty. To this
end my authorities intend to further mobilize the support of their development partners
and will organize a donors’ conference in November 2008.
III - Medium-Term Program and Policies for 2008-09
The medium-term economic and financial strategy under the PRGF supported program is
consistent with the National Initiative for Social Development (INDS) launched in
January 2007. This strategy aims at (i) placing the economy on a path of sustainable
growth to reduce unemployment, mitigate poverty and improve social indicators;
(ii) ensuring domestic financial stability by controlling inflation; (iii) increasing
competitiveness and maintaining prudent management of foreign indebtedness;
(iv) improving fiscal management and transparency and (v) strengthening administrative
and institutional capacity.
In implementing this strategy my Djiboutian authorities intend to take full advantage of
the country’s political stability, strategic position on the most used sea route, the currency
board arrangement and its participation in the Common Market for Eastern and Southern

3
Africa (COMESA) to modernize and develop the economy and transform Djibouti into a
regional trade and services hub.
Fiscal Policy and Debt Sustainability
The authorities are strongly committed to improve fiscal management and implement
their poverty reduction strategy. In this regard, they will strengthen revenue mobilization,
streamline public expenditure and increase fiscal transparency. In particular, the overall
fiscal deficit, on a commitment basis will be reduced from 2.6 percent of GDP in 2007 to
1.9 percent in 2008 and to 1.8 percent in 2009. In order to meet this target, the authorities
have initiated strong measures to increase tax revenue and reduce non priority current
expenditure.
On the revenue side, based on progress made in modernizing tax administration and
establishing the unified integrated tax department, the authorities will introduce in
January 2009 a value- added tax (VAT). The VAT will coexist with the sales taxes (TIC)
until the introduction of the external common tariff (TEC) under the COMESA
arrangement. The VAT will be applied at a single general rate of at least 7 percent and
will yield net revenue equivalent to 1.1 percent of GDP in 2009. In addition, a set of
measures to promote taxpayer compliance, simplify the tax system and broaden the tax
base while consolidating the tax administration will also be implemented. The investment
code will be revised by end-February 2009 with a view to streamline tax exemptions and
strengthen the procedures and resources for monitoring exemptions.
On the expenditure side, the authorities aim at increasing the effectiveness of public
spending and cash management. In this regard, the government accounts through the
banking system will be merged into a single Treasury account by end-May 2009. FAD
recommendations in the areas of budget classification and preparation of a
comprehensive medium-term budget framework will also be implemented in 2009. In
order to reduce average purchase costs by achieving large economies of scale, the public
procurement of government departments is to be centralized as of August 2008. The
stock of domestic payment arrears will also be reduced by 2.5 percent of GDP in
2008-09.
The authorities welcome the conclusions of the debt sustainability analysis conducted by
the Fund and the World Bank which indicates that Djibouti’s risk of debt distress in the
short term continues to be high despite some improvement in the medium-term
projections. External and total government debt are estimated respectively at 59.3 percent
and 62 percent of GDP in 2007 including arrears. As regards external arrears, the
authorities will negotiate shortly a debt restructuring agreement with the Paris Club. They
are also determined to avoid the accumulation of further arrears and intend to improve
debt management practices through appropriate technical assistance. Furthermore, they
will avoid contracting or guaranteeing nonconcessional loans and will also ensure that
public enterprises do not borrow on non concessional terms.

4
Monetary Policy and Financial Sector Issues
The authorities reaffirm their commitment to maintain the currency board arrangement as
it has served to enhance confidence in the Djiboutian franc and banks and remain
essential to attract investments. The recent food and oil price shocks have pushed
inflation whose impact was partially contained through temporary measures. The
authorities are of the view that in the context of a currency board, efforts to contain
inflation should focus on fiscal restraint and on reforms aimed at alleviating capacity
constraints and fostering competition. The central bank intends to introduce in 2009 after
consultation with banks and technical assistance from the Fund, the reserve requirements
on deposits to mop up excess liquidity from the banking system and contribute to price
stability. The introduction of this new monetary instrument within the framework of the
Banking Law will preserve the profitability and financing capacity of the banking system.
The competition within the banking system has been increased with the establishment of
three new banks. It has also led to lower intermediation spreads and new banking
services. To enhance the integrity of this expanding banking system, the Central Bank
will strengthen its supervisory capacity in accordance with the Basle principles. In the
same vein the required minimum capital of banks will be doubled in 2009 from
DF 300 million to DF 600 million. Moreover, the authorities are looking forward to the
recommendations of the FSAP mission assigned to highlight the vulnerabilities of the
new financial system and enhance its role as a catalyst for economic growth.
Recommendations made by the recent IMF Legal Department in the area of AML/CFT
will be fully implemented to raise awareness and increase the effectiveness of the
monitoring in the public and private sectors.
Structural Reforms and Competitiveness
The authorities will step up their efforts to further advance in implementing the structural
reforms which remain critical to improve Djibouti’s external competitiveness and foster
growth and alleviate poverty. In addition to fiscal and financial reforms, the authorities
will also enhance the legal and regulatory framework for business through in particular
the submission of the new Commercial Code to the National Assembly by end-November
2008 and streamlining the creation for the creation of enterprises under the coordination
of the one stop shop at the National Investment Promotion Agency (ANPI) with
departments concerned with private investment.
In order to further reduce the costs of production factors, efforts aiming at restructuring
and fiscal consolidation of Djibouti-Telecom, ONED and EDD will be enhanced with a
view to improve the quality of their services, ensure their financial viability and increase
their productivity. With regard to electricity supply in particular, the authorities intend to
develop alternative sources. A major agreement was signed with Ethiopia to enable the
import of electricity from that country. The new labor Code will be complemented by the
adoption of the remaining implementing decrees by end-May 2009 and by end-August
renegotiate all collective bargainings agreements.

5
The authorities are fully aware on the need to strengthen governance and transparency to
improve the business climate. In this respect, the General Inspectorate of Finances will be
further enhanced with its restructuring and continuously building of its capacity.
On the external front, the authorities are determined to maintain the existing free trade
system. The COMESA’s common external tariff will be adopted as soon as an agreement
is reached by the member countries on the applicable rates and other technical aspects
meeting the WTO requirements.
The authorities’ efforts to improve the quality and timeless of statistic will continue. My
authorities are grateful to their development partners for the technical assistance provided
in this area. They intend to carry out by end-February 2009 a full population census
which will be followed by a comprehensive household expenditure survey with a view to
revise the weights used in the CPI basket, update various social indicators and provide
new poverty and income distribution estimates.
IV - Conclusion
My Djiboutian authorities are determined to pursue the implementation of sound policies
and far-reaching structural reforms to sustain economic growth, increase job creation and
make significant inroads in achieving the MDGs. To supplement their efforts, a sustained
assistance from the international community is needed. In this regard, my authorities are
requesting Fund support through a PRGF arrangement.
