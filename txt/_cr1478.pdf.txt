STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND REQUEST FOR EXTENDED ARRANGEMENT

KEY ISSUES
Context: Albania’s economy has weakened and macroeconomic imbalances have
widened. Public debt and financing needs—among the highest regionally—have risen
because of fiscal loosening, particularly in the first half of 2013 and the sluggish
economy. High nonperforming loans (NPLs) are constraining credit growth, and weak
external drivers are preventing a sustained reduction in external imbalances.
Fiscal Policy: Fiscal consolidation should aim at lowering the public debt ratio beginning
in 2015, and reducing it to below 60 percent in the medium term. Significant further tax
and expenditure policy measures will be required, supplementing the steps taken in late
2013 and in the 2014 budget, supported by extensive public financial management
(PFM) and tax administration reforms to tackle the causes of high deficits.
Financial Sector: Reducing NPLs will safeguard financial stability and may help release
credit supply constraints by lowering bank risk aversion. Removing structural distortions
in collateral execution and bankruptcy laws, enhancing loan restructuring and NPL sales,
and clearing government arrears would help. Steadfast implementation of the recent
FSAP recommendations, including those covering nonbank financial institutions, will be
important.
Structural Reform: Ambitious reforms, including in the areas of pensions, energy, local
government, public administration and the business environment, are essential to
support medium-term growth and debt sustainability.
Extended Arrangement under the EFF: The authorities have requested a three year
arrangement with proposed access equivalent to SDR 295.42 million (492.4 percent of
quota). The program seeks to: i) reverse the upward trend in public debt and lay the
ground for its sustained reduction; ii) restore banks’ confidence in lending by bringing
down NPLs and; iii) ease constraints on growth by undertaking ambitious structural
reforms. The heavy structural reform need justifies the use of the longer term EFF.
Program risks are substantial given the complexity of reforms and the need for strong
political commitment. All prior actions have been completed.

CONTEXT
1.
Albania was not directly affected by recent crisis. It successfully avoided recession in the
aftermath of the global crisis and suffered a milder growth shock than neighboring countries.
Inflation was kept low and stable. The banking sector maintained adequate capital and liquidity. This
performance was largely the result of an early fiscal stimulus, effective monetary policy, and
macroprudential actions.
2.
Recently, the economy has shown signs of protracted weakness and macroeconomic
imbalances have widened, partly because of policy indiscipline. Public debt and financing
needs—among the highest regionally and heavily dependent on banks—have risen because of fiscal
slippage and accumulation of sizable arrears, particularly in 2013H1. As a result, investor confidence
has suffered, contributing to the economic slowdown. Rising NPLs and bank risk aversion, as well as
incomplete investment climate reforms, have amplified the slowdown (Figures 1–7).
3.
Implementation of earlier Article IV consultation recommendations has been mixed.
The authorities have strengthened financial sector supervision and stretched the maturity profile of
public debt in line with 2012 Article IV consultation recommendations, but there was little progress
on fiscal consolidation (Box 1).
4.
The new government is committed to economic and structural reforms. A stronger than
usual electoral majority in the 2013 elections has allowed the new authorities to launch difficult
public finance and structural reforms, including those required for EU accession. While the EU has
acknowledged progress, it has recently postponed the candidacy decision till mid 2014, citing the
need for a sustained record of judiciary, parliament and public administration reforms. A strong
reform push that improves perceptions about EU accession prospects would help boost business
confidence, FDI and growth.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
5.
Growth is expected to rebound in 2014 (Table 1). Real growth could be around 2 percent,
spurred by dissipation of uncertainties related to elections, change of government and bureaucracy
and future policies, and a confidence boost from reducing underlying risks notably in the fiscal area,
tackling of high NPLs, monetary easing, and arrears clearance. However, external demand would
remain sluggish and remittances continue to weaken (given close links to Greece and Italy). The
current account deficit will increase to 10 percent of GDP (compared to 9 in 2013) on account of
release of import compression, but the gross reserves cover is expected to remain near 4½ months
of imports.
6.
The medium–term outlook is generally favorable. Economic growth is expected to
gradually reach about 4½ percent over the medium term, though still remaining below the more
than 5½ percent achieved in the 4 years prior to the crisis, because of weak partner growth. Output
will remain below its potential by 2.1 percent in 2014, but the gap will narrow thereafter to close in
2019. The recovery will be driven by improved confidence stemming from implementation of
policies to correct domestic imbalances and ambitious structural reforms to boost total factor
productivity. EU accession-related reforms would improve Albania’s prospects as an investment
destination. Investment and growth will also be aided by significant energy-related investments—
the recently–agreed Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP), and foreign investment in new hydropower
production, amounting in total to about 15 percent of 2013 GDP (the fiscal impact of these projects
has not been factored in because of lack of data). Underlying external imbalances would improve
modestly, and the reserves cover would remain comfortable at about 4 months of imports.
7.
There are significant downside risks to the outlook. A protracted period of slower
European growth could spill over through trade and remittances channels, hurting growth and
external and financial sector stability. Insufficient fiscal consolidation effort could undermine fragile
investor confidence and increase rollover risks, while lack of progress on structural reforms could
lead to a protracted period of slower growth (see RAM, Annex I).

REPORT ON DISCUSSIONS AND PROGRAM POLICIES
A. Fiscal Policy: Laying the Groundwork for Fiscal and Debt Sustainability
Fiscal consolidation should aim at reducing the public debt ratio. This will require tackling the root
causes of high deficits through significant tax and expenditure policy measures and extensive PFM and
revenue reforms.

Background
8.
High indebtedness is a risk to macroeconomic stability. Albania’s public debt, which has
reached unprecedented levels, partly because of the accumulation of unpaid bills and arrears, is
prone to risks (Annex II). Short-term financing needs are high and budget financing rollover relies on

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ALBANIA

banks with already sizable holdings of public debt. High debt could be a significant drag on
medium-term growth.
9.
Fiscal deficits have been driven up by structural factors and policy slippages. The
2007–08 tax reform—which substantially lowered corporate income tax rates, ostensibly to enhance
competitiveness—reduced revenue intake from the corporate income tax (CIT).1 Excise and property
tax rates and other fees have been unchanged for years and, an increase in the personal income tax
(PIT) exemption threshold earlier in 2013—now close to the average private sector wage—has
further exacerbated the problem. Optimistic revenue assumptions—which in the event forced the
government to postpone capital spending—and spending units’ use of multi-year commitments
without due regard to budget appropriations, have resulted in arrears in excess of 5 percent of GDP.
Overall public spending-GDP ratio is still relatively low (Figure 3), and sizeable spending rigidities—
wages, transfers, and interest claim more than ¾ of revenues—limit the scope for spending cuts.
10.
Pensions are a heavy fiscal burden. The social insurance system deficit has risen to
5 percent of GDP in 2013, because of contribution rate cuts (in 2006 and 2009), and recent
unfunded increases in benefits. There is an incentive for high-middle income workers to underreport
earnings, or to avoid the system altogether. While worker contributions vary with income, and the
highest can be as much as five times the lowest contribution, the highest benefits are at most twice
the minimum benefit; this discourages high and middle income earners to contribute and report full
earnings. The system also subsidizes the rural self-employed at the expense of the rest (the
minimum pension is about 50 percent of average rural income, compared to 35 percent in urban
areas). Without reforms the pension system will come under increasing pressure as Albania’s young
population ages in coming decades.

Policy advice
11.
Commit to appropriate medium and long–term public debt targets to anchor
expectations. The authorities should aim to reduce public debt to about 60 percent of GDP over
the medium term and 40 percent of GDP over the longer term to mitigate risks and strengthen the
economy’s resilience to shocks. Staff recommends that the debt target be adopted by Parliament
inscribed in the organic budget law and announced publicly. The authorities should also improve
the credibility of the debt target by adopting a binding medium-term budget framework in the near
future.
12.
Sizable fiscal adjustment is needed to achieve the medium term debt target. However,
excessive fiscal consolidation, in the context of current weak cyclical conditions, could damage
growth and adversely impact debt sustainability and social outcomes.2 Therefore, staff recommends
1

The PIT and CIT rates were lowered to 10 percent (flat) from five income dependent PIT rates (5, 10, 15, 25, and
30 percent), and a 20 percent flat tax on profits. Intake from these taxes fell from 3.7 percent of GDP in 2007 to 3.4 in
2012.
2

Fiscal multiplier estimates for Albania are in the range of 0.4–0.7, with a multiplier of 0.5 used in the DSA (Annex II).
Given the large balance sheet improvement expected from arrears clearance, staff estimates the arrears clearance

that government policies should aim to begin lowering the debt-GDP ratio in 2015. Doing so in
2014, or even maintaining it at the 2013 level, would necessitate an excessively large adjustment
(3 percent of GDP in the structural primary balance) that would be quite harmful for growth. Over
the medium term, further improvement in the structural balance of about 3.8 percent will be needed
to reduce debt to near 60 percent of GDP by 2019. Even with this adjustment, the medium-term
debt profile is subject to risks, including adverse growth shocks.

13.
Implement tax and spending policy reforms to tackle the root causes of high fiscal
deficits. The relatively low level of spending and limits on the extent to which expenditures can be
trimmed suggest the burden of adjustment should fall largely on revenues. Revenue measures,
some spending restraint and pension reform should form a feasible and credible basis for the
needed adjustment (Box 3).3 To soften the impact of the adjustment on vulnerable groups, staff
support targeted relief measures.
14.
Clear arrears in a comprehensive and transparent fashion. The government needs to
reestablish credibility by acknowledging outstanding arrears through a diligent process, and
undertaking clearance impartially and transparently. Arrears clearance should be based on a strategy
approved and endorsed by the highest level and made publically available. Amounts cleared should
be made public on a regular basis and an external auditor should be employed to ensure the
transparency and integrity of the arrears verification and clearance process. The process of
documenting and vetting arrears, if implemented appropriately, could take time.
15.
Credible measures should underpin the prevention of arrears in future. Tangible and
transparent steps are needed to stem the recurrence of unpaid bills and arrears. While rationalizing
revenue projections at budget time would help, clear actions to improve reporting of procurement

multiplier to be in the range of 0.1–0.2, about one quarter to one third of the regular multiplier. With credit
constraints and the negative output gap, risks are weighted towards multipliers being higher than estimated, which
argues against an excessively rapid adjustment.

As the package of fiscal measures beyond 2014 have yet to be specified, Table 2 lists them under “unidentified
measures.” They will be chosen in due course from the menu listed in Box 3.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

and introduction of multiyear commitment limits would be key. Key ministries should regularly
report if current obligations are being met as they fall due. Spending discipline will also ensure
capital projects do not suffer from funding problems.
16.
Implement extensive spending reforms. The approvals of investment projects should be
consistent with budget space. The financial planning of local governments should be enhanced to
prevent fiscal risks. Making budgetary transfers contingent upon implementation of revenue and
PFM reforms at the local level should reduce fiscal risks while improving accountability and the
quality of services. External borrowing by local governments should be discouraged, given weak
institutional capacity. The existing disability benefit system is also in need of reform.
17.
Strengthening tax administration is critical. The authorities should ensure compliance
discipline is maintained and steps are taken to build capacity at the General Directorate. Developing
a corporate strategy to guide the medium and long term reforms would help. More immediately
care should be taken to ensure proper adoption the new IT system. The system of VAT refunds
should be streamlined by making the Treasury responsible for making payments.
18.
Prepare a pension reform strategy in consultation with the World Bank and IMF. A
Pension Reform commission should be established as a first step to devise the reform strategy. Key
reform priorities should include: i) raising the retirement age for men and women; ii) upgrading the
social transfers system and divorcing it from social insurance (which should be available to only
those who contribute); iii) aligning benefit and contribution ceilings; and iv) limiting the size of
pension benefits, by keeping increases in public sector wages and pension bills in line with inflation.
Staff underscores the importance of up-front announcements to anchor expectations.
19.
Manage debt rollover risks. Although bank demand for government paper has been
strong in recent months—largely a reflection of their aversion to the high perceived risk of lending
to the private sector—this could change in the future. Efforts to lengthen the maturity structure of
debt and deepen public debt market by diversifying securities holders and steps to help develop the
secondary market should therefore continue.

Authorities’ views
20.
The authorities commit to achieving medium term fiscal and debt sustainability. They
view a medium-term debt-GDP target of 60 percent as feasible, but are cautious about adopting an
explicit target of 40 percent by 2024 because such commitment would be difficult to maintain over
two electoral cycles. Similarly, a comprehensive medium-term fiscal framework or fiscal rule, while
highly desirable, would require time to prepare. The authorities agree with the path of medium term
fiscal adjustment recommended by staff and the level of adjustment in 2014. But they underscore
the need for flexibility in adhering to the deficit targets in case economic conditions worsen.
21.
Tax policy reform will underpin the adjustment effort. Under the approved 2014 budget,
there is an increase in the rates of CIT, fuel circulation tax and property tax and imposition of various
excise duties and road tolls (Box 3). The personal income tax has been made progressive. While

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

ALBANIA

cognizant of the need for tangible measures, the authorities caution that sizable tax rate increases
have limits, given the country’s narrow tax base and large informal sector.
22.
Paying arrears in a transparent and equitable manner is a priority. The authorities agree
that re-establishing the credibility of government is critical and will adopt a strategy that includes:
i) stocktaking and verification of claims; ii) clear and transparent criteria for the order of settling
claims; and iii) scheduling and monitoring of the payment process (MEFP ¶22). An external auditor
will conduct risk-based audits of payments made. To release the liquidity drag on business activity,
the authorities prefer an accelerated pace of arrears payment, but are also cognizant of the need for
due diligence and ensuring the process is properly managed—they expect the amount of arrears
cleared to not exceed 0.9 percent of GDP by June and 2.6 percent by December (MEFP ¶23).
23.
Credible measures will be taken to prevent future arrears. The authorities will introduce
processes to control future commitments, enhance the reporting and approval procedures for
procurement orders, and ensure that central government does not accumulate new arrears
(MEFP ¶23–27 and MEFP Tables 1 and 2). A quarterly survey of the main ministries will monitor if
new obligations are being met. The authorities request continued IMF technical assistance to
strengthen PFM capacity in general and arrears prevention in particular.
24.
Clear steps will be taken to strengthen tax administration. The authorities will develop a
new corporate strategy for medium and long term capacity building in tax administration. They will
take tangible steps to improve compliance and reduce fraud, including in tax refunds, and expect to
complete the introduction of new IT system by year end (MEFP ¶14–15). IMF technical assistance is
expected to continue to play a key role.
25.
Pension reform is a key medium term priority. The authorities are working closely with
the World Bank on design and implementation of pension reform, though they also caution about
potential political and social difficulties. They will establish a pension reform commission soon, and
after undertaking extensive stakeholder consultation, will complete a reform strategy by end-2014.
26.
Rollover risks will remain manageable. While the authorities acknowledge that the current
strong demand for government paper could be temporary, they are of the view that the decline in
public debt under the program will help keep yields under control and rollover manageable.

B. Use of Monetary Policy to Ease the Economic Slowdown
Further modest monetary easing could be employed to support the weak economy, provided inflation
and exchange market pressures stay muted. The key to reviving credit is restoring banks’ confidence in
lending by reducing NPLs.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ALBANIA

Background
27.
The inflation-targeting framework has yielded low and stable inflation, anchoring
macroeconomic stability. It has contributed to overcoming various shocks and keeping inflation
within the 3±1 percent annual target range, one of the lowest and least volatile in the region.4
However, inflation in December amounted to 1.9 percent, slightly below the authorities’ target
range, and core inflation was 0.3 percent.
28.
Monetary easing has not prevented a slowdown in credit to date. With continued
economic weakness, the Bank of Albania (BoA) has lowered its policy rate—the one-week reverse
repo rate was cut by a cumulative 225 basis points since mid-2011 to 3.0 percent. While lek lending
and deposit rates have declined somewhat, credit to the private sector has continued to slow,
declining by 2.6 percent (yoy) in November (rates on euro loans have not changed much). The
weakness in credit is largely the result of tightened lending standards because of banks’ perception
of risks (which has increased with the rise in troubled loans).
29.
Financial stability considerations constrain monetary policy. The monetary transmission
mechanism is restricted by heavy euroization, with foreign currency loans amounting to two-thirds
of all loans. Aggressive monetary easing runs the risk of exerting exchange market pressures, with a
fallout on unhedged foreign currency borrowers.

Policy advice
30.
Further moderate monetary policy easing could help with credit, though currency
exposure and loan quality risks should be considered. With inflationary and exchange market
pressures remaining muted, additional easing could help borrowers as interest rates on existing
loans reset. If that contributes to improving loan servicing, then banks’ risk aversion could also
diminish, thereby easing credit supply constraints. However, further monetary easing should be
carefully weighed against the risks posed by unhedged foreign currency exposure and high NPLs.
31.
The key to accelerating credit is tackling the large stock of NPLs. Further monetary
easing, in the context of weak demand (i.e., profitable projects may be scarce) and supply
constraints, is unlikely to have a strong impact. A comprehensive approach is therefore needed to
reduce NPLs over the medium term (see below).
32.
The exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals (Box 4). The standard exchange
rate assessment points to a slight overvaluation, but the relatively stable FDI, and the imports
associated with it, imply that Albania’s current account deficit norm should be higher than that
suggested by the standard approaches. Staff believes that the inflation targeting framework and a
relatively flexible wage setting process—as indicated by one of the smallest increases in unit labor
4

The BoA uses a mid-corridor approach to implement monetary policy, and holds weekly repo operations for which
treasury bills and bonds with remaining maturity of one year or less are eligible. It has a clearly articulated policy on
foreign exchange market interventions, and has not transacted to affect the value of the exchange rate since 2009.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

ALBANIA

costs (ULC) in the region since 2008 (Figure 6)—should help avoid currency misalignment, in the
future. Advancing structural reforms to improve the business environment and expand the export
base would improve competitiveness.
33.
Exchange restrictions. In addition to the existing exchange restriction arising from balances
under inoperative bilateral payment arrangements and maintained under Article XIV of the IMF
Articles of Agreement, which remains in place, staff has identified two further exchange restrictions
inconsistent with Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3 under the IMF’s Articles. These are as follows: (i) an
exchange restriction arising from the requirement for residents and nonresidents to submit a tax
certificate that they do not owe any outstanding taxes prior to transferring foreign exchange for
certain current transactions including the payment of moderate amounts for amortization of loans,
the payment of certain insurance premium, and the transfer of profits and dividends from
investments in Albania; and (ii) an exchange restriction arising from the requirement to provide
customs clearance documents in respect of advance import payments prior to making payments for
unrelated foreign exchange transactions. Since these exchange restrictions are not BoP-relevant,
staff does not recommend approval of the temporary retention of these measures.

Authorities’ views
34.
Low inflation and weak domestic demand provide scope for some further modest
easing. The authorities agree, however, that the impact is likely to be constrained by impaired
corporate balance sheets, and increased risk aversion by banks. They are also aware of the risks of
aggressive monetary easing, particularly on the exchange rate.
35.
NPL reduction is critical for credit growth. They concur with staff that credit supply rather
than demand is currently the binding constraint. They expressed concern that some banks may
choose not to re-lend the improved loan repayments associated with arrears clearance,5 and instead
opt to repatriate funds to parent banks. The authorities agreed that macroprudential measures to
boost credit have been largely ineffective.
36.
Staff exchange rate assessment is broadly appropriate. In the authorities’ view, the
observed exchange rate stability in recent years reflects a lack of strong market forces to bring a
major adjustment of the currency. They are firmly committed to a free floating exchange rate
regime, and their intention is to continue to refrain from market interventions. They expect Albania’s
FDI potential (as underlined by recent gas pipeline and hydropower projects) and ongoing import
substitution to improve external balances over the medium run. They believe Albania’s current
international reserves cover level appropriately reflects the elevated external risks the country faces.
The authorities have been notified of the new findings on exchange restrictions; they are committed
to removing one (item (i) above), and are discussing removal of the other.
5

The reduction in NPLs following the commencement of arrears clearance could take time as banks typically require
clients to maintain an improved repayment record before the associated loan is re-classified as performing.
According to the BoA, the NPL ratio could eventually decline by 5–6 percentage points.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ALBANIA

C. Maintaining Financial Stability in the Face of Continued Challenges
Vulnerabilities stem from profitability pressures and potential deleveraging in a system dominated by
subsidiaries of foreign banks. High euroization and strong financial links between banks and the
government further complicate financial management. A comprehensive long term approach to the
NPL problem and steadfast implementation of FSAP mission recommendations are essential.

Background
37.
The risk of direct inward financial spillovers is contained. Despite a large share of foreign
banks (from Austria, Greece, Italy, and Turkey), the banking system has been resilient to eurozone
stress so far, largely because it relies almost exclusively on domestic deposits—the loan-to-deposit
ratio is merely 50 percent. Banks’ strong solvency ratios and stringent provisioning rules have also
contributed to banking system stability.6
38.
High financial euroization is a risk. Although net open positions in euro are small, risks
arise because: (i) half of loans in foreign currency are unhedged; (ii) there are large maturity
mismatches; and (iii) credit risk for euro loans may be underpriced. The BoA has a limited capacity to
act as lender of last resort in foreign currency.
39.
Profitability pressures from high NPLs highlight deleveraging risks. The NPL increase is
driven by both cyclical and structural factors, notably government arrears, the adverse tax treatment
of write-offs, and a long and unpredictable legal collateral execution process.7 High NPL-related
provisioning is hurting bank profits and puts pressure on capitalization. With parent banks facing
their own problems, deleveraging risks (e.g., through loan shedding and shrinking balance sheets)
are likely to remain elevated as long as NPLs remain high.
40.
Strong link between banks and the sovereign is a concern. Financial interdependence
represents systemic risks for banks, which are vulnerable to changes in the value of longer-term
debt securities, and for the government, which depends on regular rollover of debt by banks.
41.
The recent emergence of investment funds is a sign of financial deepening, but also
points to gaps in supervisory infrastructure. The lack of a functioning secondary market for
government securities constrains investment funds’ ability to manage liquidity risks, given their
holdings of mostly illiquid government bonds, thereby increasing systemic liquidity risks.

6

While most lending is secured by collateral, the BoA does not allow its value to be subtracted from loan-loss
provisions for prudential purposes.
7

Until recently, tax write-offs of loans were not recognized until a final court decision indicated that all legal recovery
efforts were exhausted. Recent directives have asked the tax authorities to recognize write-offs 360 days after legal
collection efforts are initiated, though this directive does not grandfather the 2008–10 write-offs.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

ALBANIA

Policy advice
42.
Strengthen financial stability by implementing recent FSAP mission recommendations.
The authorities should prepare an action plan to guide reforms in financial market supervision,
financial market deepening, contingency planning, and the AML/CFT enforcement framework. Box 5
summarizes the findings and recommendations of the recent FSAP mission.8
43.
A comprehensive and forceful approach is needed to address NPLs. Resolving the tax
treatment for loan write-offs and improving collateral execution have been on the reform agenda
for a while and require forceful action, particularly as the NPL problem has worsened. Review and
reforms of competition policy and bankruptcy laws would help. The clearance of government arrears
may also contribute to NPL reduction.
44.
Ensure that risks associated with euroization are internalized. The authorities could
increase the liquidity requirement on foreign currency deposits, and ensure that banks require
higher loan-to-value ratios, if appropriate. New unhedged foreign currency lending could be
disallowed. Robust consumer education and protection of borrowers is important.
45.
Continue efforts to lengthen maturities and diversify government debt holders. The
best way to reduce rollover risks is to bring down public debt. Nevertheless, debt management also
has a role to play in minimizing risks from systemic links between banks and the sovereign.
46.
Take steps to strengthen nonbank supervision. The Albanian Financial Regulatory
Authority (AFSA) should be reformed to ensure its financial and operational independence.
Regulation and supervision of investment funds should be beefed up by introducing liquidity and
capital adequacy requirements, as well as mark-to-market accounting in calculating unit values. In
addition, investment funds should ensure that they have adequate liquidity contingency
arrangements with banks, and transparently disclose to clients that they are not covered by deposit
insurance.

Authorities’ views
47.
FSAP recommendations would be implemented. The authorities agree that doing so will
further solidify financial sector stability and boost confidence in the banking system. They plan to
proceed with a strategy to implement FSAP recommendations in the coming months.
48.
Tangible actions will attempt to address the NPL problem. The authorities are cognizant
of the risks associated with high NPLs and weak profitability, and how they adversely affect
perceptions among parent banks and regulators, and encourage deleveraging. Immediate actions
would include, resolving the adverse tax treatment of loan write-offs and ensuring legal collateral

and recommendations on enhancing the system’s resilience to shocks and contagion.

execution is facilitated (MEFP ¶32–33 and MEFP Table 2). The authorities will also undertake: i)
corporate restructuring, including a review of competition policy and modifications in bankruptcy
laws,9 ii) a monitoring system for corporate and household indebtedness, and iii) a revamped
framework of loan restructuring and collateral repossession. They are aware that arrears clearance
would help lower outstanding contractor obligations to banks and hence improve credit risk.
49.
Financial euroization is structural. Euroization is a reflection of Albania’s strong links to the
euro area, and in this regard, significant foreign currency deposits provide a cushion. At the same
time, monetary policy decisions are planned carefully to avoid exchange market pressures which
could adversely impact bank balance sheets, given unhedged foreign currency lending.
50.
Systemic risks posed by the recent emergence of investment funds will be addressed.
The law governing the AFSA operations will be amended and investment fund regulatory framework
would be revised to introduce liquidity, capital and valuation aspects (MEFP ¶37, and MEFP Table 2).
Strengthening regulation and supervision of the nonbanking system will require time.

D. Embarking on a Path of Sustained Medium-term Growth
An ambitious reform effort is needed to unlock structural constraints and boost investment and
medium term growth. Reforms that aid in progress towards EU accession would help.

Background
51.
Lack of reforms has affected the country’s growth potential. While macroeconomic
imbalances and recent policy slippages have affected confidence in the economy, a sustained
deceleration of structural reforms has coincided with declining potential growth in recent years. It
has also prevented a broadening of the productive base, reduction in economic informality, and
diversification of exports.
52.
Albania’s business environment is weak. Attracting investment is key to boosting growth,
with FDI leading to the transfer of technology, greater innovation, higher productivity, and
opportunities for high-wage employment. Despite the relatively flexible labor market and low
statutory tax rates, the investment climate has suffered from poor property rights, corruption, weak
contract enforcement, an inefficient judicial system and weak access to finance, particularly for SMEs
(Figure 6).
53.
Structural problems in the electricity sector are a source of fiscal and growth risks.
Albania’s hydroelectric endowment should enable it to be self-sufficient. However, poor collection,
electricity theft, and low quality grid affect the sector’s viability. As a result, the state producer has
either run down the reservoir in dry years or imported electricity, either by issuing state guarantees

ALBANIA

(that are often called), or direct budget support. The lack of payment discipline by consumers has
also discouraged investment in new generation capacity.
54.
Public administration is inefficient and overly politicized. Many civil service
appointments, even for mid-level positions, are based on political affiliation. Political transitions
often undermine civil administration because of high turnover—the recent experience with the
deterioration in tax administration during the change of government is telling. The EU has made
public administration efficiency improvements a critical measure for progress on accession.
55.
Weak local government structures pose fiscal risks. Local government revenues have
been on a declining trend (down to 0.7 percent of GDP in 2013, from 1.4 in 2005), and PFM is weak,
lacks transparency and suffers from corruption. Smaller local governments face capacity constraints.
Coordination weakness between local and central government adds to fiscal risks.
56.
National statistics are problematic. Annual national accounts data are based on limited
information and data on an expenditure basis have not been published since 2007, while quarterly
GDP statistics are subject to significant revisions. Fund TA has focused on developing capacity in
national accounts statistics compilation.

Policy advice
57.
Move ahead forcefully with targeted reforms to improve the investment climate.
Improving the legal framework and judicial effectiveness related to land titling and property rights
should be a priority. Less arbitrary tax enforcement would also improve investor confidence.
Expanding access to finance would help ease liquidity constraints, including for SMEs.
58.
Initiate energy reform to address both liquidity risks and long term sustainability. The
authorities should develop a comprehensive reform plan for the electricity sector, in consultation
with the World Bank, to reduce current fiscal risk as well as improve sustainability over the medium
term, including through attracting investment. Measures to mitigate near-term fiscal risks—such as
limiting subsidized prices to low-income consumers and opening price setting for commercial users
to market competition—should be adopted quickly. Actions should also be taken to lower power
losses (including through preventing electricity thefts), reform market structure for electricity supply,
restructure main participants’ balance sheets, and attract private capital into distribution to expand
capacity.
59.
Public administration reform should proceed promptly, underpinned by a new civil
service reform law. While public sector employment in Albania is not excessive by international
standards, reforms have to focus on making it efficient and professional, and improving the delivery
of services to the public. A civil service law should provide the legal context to undertaking any
future reforms, which would also benefit from close cooperation with the EU and the World Bank.

60.
Develop a local government reform agenda to address fiscal risks. Improved
transparency and accountability and enhancing capacity should reduce fiscal risks while improving
governance and the quality of services at the local level. More immediately, fuller reporting of local
governments’ new procurement orders would be helpful. The EU and bilateral donors’ current
support to create larger and more efficient local government units should continue.
61.
Improve quality of statistics. Continued improvements in national accounts and balance of
payments statistics, as well as strengthening the independence of the statistical agency, are essential
for improved surveillance and policymaking. Staff urged the authorities to set up an intergovernment data-exchange scheme for macroeconomic statistics to improve data quality.

Authorities’ views
62.
Prompt implementation of ambitious reforms is a high priority. The government plans
to address not only the obvious business environment constraints, but also the more politically
difficult problems of property rights and judicial enforcement. Progress in these areas is critical for
achieving sustained growth and signaling commitment to EU accession (MEFP ¶40–42).
63.
Energy sector problems are complex and multifaceted, but require prompt attention.
A newly established task force working directly under the Prime Minister is expected to take the lead
in sorting out inter-company debts and short-term investment needs to curb network losses, and
handling negotiations with the energy distribution parent company. The authorities will finalize a
reform action plan by early 2014, in collaboration with the World Bank. They are also committed to
taking near term measures to address the sector’s liquidity risks, including through enforcement of
bill payments and tariff reforms (MEFP section D).
64.
The efficiency of public administration will be enhanced. Reducing the size of public
administration is a priority. The authorities also believe that employment flexibility and ability to
offer higher salaries to attract key staff will also contribute to improving the quality of public

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

ALBANIA

administration. They commit to hiring new staff in compliance with a forthcoming civil service law
(MEFP ¶17).
65.
Addressing local government problems is important for lowering fiscal risks, and
ensuring good governance. In the near term they will issue instructions to local governments to
report all new procurement orders to the ministry of finance (MEFP Table 2). The authorities are also
committed to addressing local government weakness in a comprehensive manner over the medium
term. Administrative and territorial reform, which would be completed before the 2015 local
elections, should help tackle concerns about collection of revenues, human resource management,
financial control, and transparency. A fractious political climate could constrain progress.
66.
Existing statistics weaknesses will be addressed. While insufficient resources have played
a role, the politicization of the statistical agency has also been detrimental. The authorities
underscored their determination to create a statistical agency that is professional and transparent. In
this regard, they are committed to using IMF TA to further improve statistics.

PROGRAM MODALITIES AND RISKS
67.
Albania faces a balance of payments need in 2014-16, and staff proposes a three-year
extended arrangement under the extended fund facility (EFF) with access equivalent to SDR
295.42 million (492.4 percent of quota) to address it. Albania’s large current account deficit
reflects low domestic savings stemming from the large fiscal deficit and underperforming nonenergy export sector. Repayment of government arrears would require a large fiscal and current
account adjustment in 2014 in order to produce the required increase in domestic savings. External
support under the EFF will provide the necessary financing to allow the required adjustment to be
phased over several years, avoiding a large and disruptive immediate adjustment, while providing
space for progress on key structural reforms that would improve the economy’s productive capacity,
particularly in export-oriented sectors. As a result, the arrangement under the EFF would support
the authorities’ efforts to increase public savings to repay arrears and put public debt on a
sustainable medium-term trajectory, while addressing structural constraints on growth. In addition,
Fund support would buttress confidence by signaling sustainable macroeconomic policies, and
would help unlock financing from other multilateral institutions.
68.
Program disbursements will be in the form of direct budget support. This is essential
because i) Albania has limited access to international capital markets, ii) financing the fiscal deficit,
including clearance of arrears, through domestic securities markets would further strain the market
and aggravate rollover risks in an uncertain environment, and iii) the established practice of very
limited, if any, provision of direct credit by the central bank to the government has been an
important element of the BoA’s operational independence. Direct budget support will contribute to
medium term fiscal consolidation, ease risks associated with high public debt and smooth economic
adjustment in the short run. This in turn will contribute to the reduction of the external current
account deficit. Staff expects that by the end of the three-year program period, the fiscal position

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ALBANIA

would shift into primary surplus, with substantially lower financing and rollover needs, reduced
reliance on domestic bank financing and improved access to global financial markets.
69.
Performance under the program will be monitored through quarterly quantitative
performance criteria and extensive structural conditionality. In 2014, structural conditions and
prior actions focus on PFM, revenue administration and financial reforms, the latter based on the
recent FSAP update (Box 6 and MEFP Table 2). The Quantitative Performance Criteria and Indicative
Targets on NIR, fiscal deficit, accumulation of external arrears, ceiling on central bank lending to
government, domestic arrears accumulation, payment of existing arrears, and inflation consultation
are elaborated in Box 6 and MEFP Table 1. Over the program period, emphasis will be on PFM,
arrears prevention, addressing shortcomings of the pension system, and putting the energy sector
on a sustainable footing. Program risks are substantial given the complexity, scale, and scope of
reforms and the need for strong political commitment (Box 6).

STAFF APPRAISAL
70.
The economy is slowing at a time of elevated macroeconomic imbalances. Domestic
demand has been increasingly sluggish—reflecting the sharp increase in public debt, worsening
NPLs, and credit contraction. Ongoing weak external demand, particularly from Greece and Italy,
continue to exert economic headwinds.
71.
The authorities’ economic program—supported by the proposed extended
arrangement under the EFF—offers a credible plan for correcting underlying imbalances and
supporting sustained growth. The program seeks to: i) reverse the upward trend in public debt
and lay the ground for its sustained reduction; ii) bring down NPLs and restore banks’ confidence in
lending; and iii) reduce structural constraints on growth by undertaking ambitious structural
reforms.
72.
Sizable further fiscal adjustment is needed over the medium term to correct domestic
imbalances and put public debt on a sustainable footing. The adjustment profile strikes a
balance between reducing public debt vulnerability and safeguarding growth. Fiscal policy will
therefore target a reduction in public debt in 2015, with the objective of further reducing it to
60 percent of GDP by 2019. The authorities should consider building a bipartisan consensus around
adopting a longer term debt target of 40 percent of GDP to strengthen the economy’s resilience to
shocks, and underpinning it through an effective medium term budget framework.
73.
Tax and expenditure reforms will be needed to tackle the underlying causes of high
fiscal deficits. The burden of fiscal adjustment should fall primarily on revenues, given the country’s
development needs, the low share of revenues in GDP and embedded inflexibility in expenditures.
Pension and energy reform should form a part of medium-term adjustment.
74.
Reducing the outstanding stock of arrears and putting in place mechanisms to prevent
a recurrence is critical for fiscal sustainability. The announced measures, if implemented properly,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

ALBANIA

should help re-establish credibility of the government, aid with maintaining fiscal sustainability and
re-inject liquidity into the private sector. The authorities should proceed cautiously with payments
and employing an external auditor promptly to begin conducting ex-post risk based audits is crucial.
The authorities’ ambitious program of PFM reforms, supported by IMF TA, will help prevent a
recurrence of arrears. Nevertheless, the process will take time before tangible results can be seen.
The restoration of spending discipline will prevent ad hoc cuts in capital spending.
75.
In the absence of fiscal buffers, monetary policy has a role to play in supporting
economic recovery, but caution is warranted. Further moderate easing of monetary policy,
provided inflation expectations and financial stability remain well anchored, could help. However,
two caveats are warranted. First, sluggish credit demand and bank risk aversion would likely limit the
effectiveness of conventional easing. Second, the high unhedged foreign currency exposure and the
rising NPL level underscore the need for caution. Nonetheless, taking measures to reduce the large
stock of NPLs will aid in restoring credit growth.
76.
Continued vigilance is needed to maintain financial stability. Rising NPLs is a concern
and requires prompt and comprehensive action. Removing structural distortions in collateral
execution and bankruptcy laws, revamping the framework for loan restructuring and NPL sales, and
clearing arrears would help with bank profitability, and ease deleveraging concerns. Strengthening
the regulation and supervision of the nonbank financial system, in line with FSAP recommendations,
would help alleviate systemic risks.
77.
Embarking on a path of sustained medium-term growth hinges on implementation of
an ambitious structural reform program. Planned reforms include pensions, energy, local
government, public administration, and business environment. If implemented properly, they will
strengthen Albania’s ability to attract investment, reduce fiscal risks, and strengthen debt
sustainability.
78.
Risks to the program are significant. The proposed program will require strong political
commitment by a largely untested new government. The key risk is therefore that implementation
will be delayed or faced with unanticipated challenges, particularly given the complexity of some of
the proposed reforms. The authorities’ commitment to undertake broad based reforms and make
upfront commitments should help mitigate these risks.
79.
Staff supports the authorities’ request for an Extended Arrangement. In view of
Albania’s balance of payments need, the policy actions already taken, and the authorities’
commitment to implement ambitious reform package over the duration of the program, staff
supports the authorities’ request for an Extended Arrangement in an amount equivalent to SDR
295.42 million.
80.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Albania be held on the
24-month cycle, subject to Decision No. 14747, as amended.

The exchange rate level appears broadly in line with fundamentals in the ERER approach, and moderately
overvalued in the MB and ES approaches. The ERER approach points to a relatively small difference (of about
3 percent) between the REER and the estimated equilibrium real exchange rate. The MB and ES approaches
suggest a gap between the projected 2019 current account deficit and the estimated norm of about
3.5–4.0 percentage points of GDP. These approaches, however, do not take into account Albania’s stable and large
FDI flows which are associated with import needs without raising external sustainability concerns. In particular, the
medium term current account and FDI projections reflect two recent energy-related investments—Trans Adriatic
Pipeline (TAP) and foreign investment in new hydropower production—amounting in total to about 15 percent of
2013 GDP. These suggest that the gap between the current account and its norm would be smaller than estimated
once the FDI-related imports are accounted for.

Box 5. Albania: Conclusions of the 2013 FSAP
Several key features of the banking sector in Albania increase its vulnerability to shocks. These include its
high euroization, strong financial links between banks and the government and the dominant presence of
subsidiaries of foreign banks. The risks have been exacerbated in recent years by the high and rising rate of NPLs
and resulting decline in bank profitability.
Stress tests show that banks are vulnerable to shocks, but the aggregate capital shortfall in these scenarios
is limited. In severe macroeconomic scenarios, banks suffer simultaneous losses from credit, market, and
sovereign risks, and at least 6 banks (representing 21 percent of the assets of the banking system) become
undercapitalized. The additional capital requirement is relatively modest, however, while liquidity stress tests show
that banks are amply liquid and able to confront large deposit withdrawals. Credit risk is also mitigated by
solvency ratios that are above international norms and stringent provisioning rules. Sensitivity tests show that
banks are most vulnerable to lek depreciation, given the large share of unhedged foreign currency lending, and
that credit risk is exacerbated by the high concentration of loan portfolios.
Reduction of the large stock of existing NPLs is essential. The authorities are moving forward with the
adoption of legal and prudential measures to support voluntary restructuring, encourage NPL sales, resolve tax
ambiguities and reform the insolvency and collateral execution regime. This should be supported by stronger
financial reporting requirements, an expanded definition of related parties and an asset quality review. In addition,
more effective risk-based supervision, focusing on the quality of credit policies and underwriting standards, will
help to ensure that new loans are of better quality.
The strong financial links between financial institutions and the sovereign pose challenges. Large holdings
of government securities present systemic risks for banks, making them vulnerable to changes in interest rates and
the value of debt securities. At the same time, the government depends on regular rollover of debt by banks. The
risk is heightened by the lack of a secondary market, which creates significant liquidity risk for bondholders.
The recent emergence of investment funds has helped diversify the ownership of government securities,
but attendant risks must be managed carefully. These funds face significant liquidity risk, which could have
wider systemic implications in the event of a sudden demand for redemptions that forces the sales of assets into a
largely illiquid market. It is essential to put in place a framework that helps ensure that key risks are understood
(by both the funds and their investors) and contained.
With new insurance and investment fund complexities arising, it is essential to improve the capacity of the
nonbank financial regulator (AFSA). The effectiveness of AFSA to date has been severely constrained by its lack
of independence, limited financial resources, and shortage of qualified personnel. Major institutional reform is
needed to strengthen AFSA’s financial and operational independence and turn it into an effective regulator.
The legal and institutional framework for macroprudential policy, the financial sector safety net, and crisis
preparedness are generally strong but need further refinement. Banking supervision should be strengthened
by expanding consolidated supervision, formalizing cooperation with home supervisors, increasing supervision
staff and enhancing their legal protection. The BOA has used macroprudential tools to manage the credit cycle,
but should remain cognizant that using prudential tools to boost credit has potential risks to financial stability and
that their impact is likely to be limited due to the difficulty of effectively targeting these measures. The institutional
framework for Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) is generally strong, but could be strengthened by increasing
supervisory reach on banks in receipt of ELA, establishing a contingency plan in the event the BOA’s foreign
currency resources are insufficient to meet ELA demands, and establishing guidelines for reporting the use of ELA.

Box 6. Albania: Program Modalities and Risks
Access and Phasing
Albania will face a moderate balance of payments financing gap in 2014–16—about 7.1 percent of GDP (2.5
percent of GDP in 2014). Staff proposes a 36-month extended arrangement under Extended Fund Facility (EFF)
with total access equivalent to SDR 295.42 million (about 492.4 percent of quota) to support Albania’s BOP need
and the authorities’ policy and structural reforms.
Upon approval, the Fund arrangement will also unlock about €145 million in World Bank budget support in 2014–
the World Bank will support the reform program through a series of Development Policy Loans (DPLs) focused in
the fiscal and financial area, but also incorporating energy and pension reform measures. Filling the remainder of
the gap in 2014 will require about 94.2 million SDR, or 157 percent of quota from the Fund (Table 7). The EU will
provide support, but in 2016. The Fund-supported program is expected to be fully financed in the first year. The
phasing over three years under the program has been determined after accounting for the support expected from
other multilateral partners.
Given the independence of the central bank and budget financing constraints, the authorities intend to use the
domestic currency equivalent of Fund resources for budgetary financing. This is also consistent with the limits on
the domestic debt market’s ability to continue to absorb high budget financing need, including that for arrears
clearance. A government-BoA MoU establishing a framework on the modalities for the repayment to the Fund has
been prepared. A safeguards assessment of the BoA will be conducted by FIN prior to the time of the first review.
Conditionality and Monitoring
The program entails structural reforms, notably, to strengthen PFM, arrears prevention, addressing shortcomings
of the pension system, and putting the energy sector on a sustainable footing. Financial sector reforms would be
based on recent FSAP recommendations. Program reviews will initially be on a quarterly basis (for the first five
reviews) and subsequently on semi-annual basis, conditional on strong program performance in the first year.
Quantitative targets. There will be performance criteria on the overall deficit, net international reserves, and
accumulation of external arrears. Given the well functioning inflation targeting framework, monetary conditionality
will be embedded in the inflation consultation clause. Lastly, there will be indicative targets on BoA credit to the
general government, and on accumulation and payment of central government domestic arrears (MEFP Table 1).
Structural benchmarks. Strengthening PFM, notably related to arrears clearance and prevention would be
prominent in conditionality in the first year of the program. Structural benchmarks include the contracting of an
external auditor to conduct risk–based audit of arrears payments, publication of report on arrears payment,
quarterly surveys on new arrears accumulation in key ministries, and introduction of multi-year commitment limits.
Financial sector measures will address the NPL problem and strengthen nonbank supervision (MEFP Table 2).
Capacity to Repay the Fund
Albania is expected to meet its repayment obligations to the Fund. By the end of the proposed extended
arrangement, Fund credit outstanding is projected to be 3.1 percent of GDP, or 16 percent of gross reserves (Table
8). After peaking at 43.1 percent of GDP in 2014, external debt will decline to 32 percent of GDP by 2019, with
external public debt falling from 30.9 to 21.1 percent of GDP. Albania has a strong record of repaying the Fund.
Risks
The political climate remains contentious. Implementation risks also arise because of the complexity of reforms.
However the authorities are committed to launching a broad based reform agenda and will make up front
announcements on planned measures. If economic growth does not evolve as expected, fiscal objectives, including
the envisaged reduction in public debt, could be undermined, and there could be further pressure on bank asset
quality, profitability and capitalization. In that event, staff will consider easing, in subsequent, reviews, the nominal
deficit targets to allow automatic stabilizers to work consistently with a broadly unchanged structural balance.

Appendix I. Letter of Intent
Tirana, February 5, 2014

Ms. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C., 20431
Dear Ms. Lagarde:
1.
Albania is experiencing serious economic challenges—an economic slowdown and elevated
domestic imbalances. To tackle these challenges, we are proposing a strong and ambitious reform
program, aimed at reducing macroeconomic vulnerabilities and promoting economic recovery.
2.
To accompany our reform efforts, we have turned to our international partners for support.
Our estimate is that the external financing need would be up to 7.1 percent of GDP during the
duration of the three-year program. We therefore request that the Fund support our policy program
through a three year extended arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility, in an amount
equivalent to SDR 295.42 million (about EUR 331.1 million, and 492.4 percent of quota). This
arrangement, along with support from the World Bank and the European Commission, is expected to
close Albania’s financing gap. The Fund’s support is therefore critical for reducing risks as we begin
to restore market confidence and return to sustainable growth.
3.
The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) outlines the policies
that the government and the Bank of Albania will implement during the next three years. We are
confident that by the end of the program we will achieve our objectives of high and sustained
growth and reduced macroeconomic vulnerabilities.
4.
Implementation of our program will be monitored by the Fund through reviews, quantitative
performance criteria and indicative targets, as well as structural benchmarks, as described in the
attached MEFP and Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU). There will be 5 quarterly
reviews and 3 bi-annual reviews under the arrangement. The reviews will assess progress in
implementing the program and reach understandings on any additional measures that may be
needed to achieve its objectives.
5.
While we are confident that the policies described in the MEFP are adequate to achieve
program objectives, we stand ready to take additional measures that may be required for this
purpose. In accordance with the Fund’s policies, we will consult with the Fund on the adoption of
such measures in advance of revisions to the policies contained in this letter and the MEFP.
6.
The government of Albania will provide the IMF with such information as it may request to
monitor progress made in economic and financial policy implementation.

7.
The Albanian authorities wish to make this letter available to the public, along with the
attached MEFP and Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU), as well as the IMF staff report
on the 2013 Article IV consultation and the request for a three year extended arrangement under the
EFF. We therefore authorize their publication and posting on the IMF website, subject to Executive
Board approval. These documents will also be posted on the official websites of the Albanian
government.

Sincerely,

ALBANIA

Attachment I. Memorandum of Economic and Financial
Policies
1.
This Memorandum lays out the economic program of the government of Albania by
highlighting the policy and structural reforms that we will be undertaking in the period ahead,
supported by the IMF. Our economic policies are aimed at putting the Albanian economy on a path
of sustained medium term growth that results in tangible gains, including employment generation
and improvement in the standard of living of the Albanian population. We will undertake broadranging economic reforms that improve the business environment and remove the constraints that
hamper economic development. We are committed to pursuing our growth objectives while
enhancing macroeconomic stability and, in this regard, will strive to lower the debt related
vulnerabilities that the country faces today by putting public finances on a sustainable footing.

I. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
2.
The Albanian economy has been slowing sharply since 2012. Output growth held up
relatively well in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, but has been slowing sharply since 2012.
Although remittances (which come primarily from Italy and Greece) have been on a downward trend,
the direct impact of the global financial crises was small because of the limited financial exposure to
international markets and an expansionary fiscal policy initiated before the crisis. Real GDP growth
has slowed sharply since 2012, however, as weak credit growth and rising government payment
arrears have contributed to significant weakness in domestic demand. The uncertainty associated
with 2013 parliamentary elections has also dampened confidence of the private sector. External
demand has been the primary driver of growth in the last two years, but remains limited by lingering
weakness in the euro zone, including our immediate trading partners, and a narrow export base.
Growth in 2013 is projected to slow to around 0.7 percent, the lowest level since 1997. We expect
growth to recover to 2.1 percent of GDP as confidence is restored and domestic demand begins to
recover.
3.
External imbalances have declined but remain high. After reaching 14 percent of GDP in
2009 the current account deficit has steadily declined to 9.5 percent in 2012 and is projected to be
9 percent in 2013. While most of the adjustment is a result of improved export performance,
particularly petroleum exports, it also reflects the subdued domestic demand which has curtailed
imports. External debt has nearly doubled since 2004 to around 40 percent of GDP in 2012, the
largest part of which reflects external public debt. Despite slowing remittances, Albania’s FDI
potential (as underlined by recently agreed gas pipeline and hydropower projects amounting to a
projected $1.5 billion), combined with increasing domestic production that lowers our reliance on
imports (especially for agricultural products), is expected to improve external sustainability over the
medium and long run.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

47

ALBANIA

4.
Inflation remains muted due to weak domestic demand. Headline CPI inflation fluctuated
around the lower band of the target range during 2012 and the first three quarters of 2013,
reflecting both weak demand and low imported inflation. Core inflation has also fallen amidst
subdued wage pressures. With inflation expectations subdued, the BoA has steadily reduced its
policy interest rate by 225 basis points over the past 24 months to 3.0 percent.
5.
The financial sector has remained largely stable despite a sharp increase in
nonperforming loans (NPLs). Although the banking system is almost entirely foreign-owned, the
impact of the financial crisis was limited by foreign bank subsidiaries’ lack of reliance on foreign
funding, including from their parents, with most banks entirely financed by local deposits. However,
the level of NPLs in the banking system has increased significantly in the aftermath of the financial
crisis, reaching 24 percent of gross loans at end-November 2013. Comparatively strict provisioning
requirements and a comfortable capital adequacy ratio have helped to contain the negative shocks
to the system thus far. However, the large increase in NPLs and deterioration in the economic
outlook have caused banks to take a much more conservative approach to lending and contributed
to a sharp slowdown in credit growth. Annual credit growth turned negative in September 2013 for
the first time in the last decade, declining by 3 percent (year-on-year). Banks have raised provisions
for credit risk, which in September reached 62.3 percent of NPLs and 15.2 percent of total loans.
6.
The fiscal deficit has widened significantly in 2013. The slowdown in the economy
together with general elections in June 2013 led to an expansionary fiscal policy during the first half
of 2013. In addition to higher expenditures, tax revenue underperformed considerably. The sharp
deterioration in revenues forced the government to increase the deficit projection to about 6 percent
of GDP from 3.5 percent planned initially. Public debt (including arrears) will exceed 70 percent of
GDP by end 2013.
7.
Public debt and accumulated arrears have reached a level that poses significant
macroeconomic risks for Albania. The high public debt level has also led to elevated interest
expenditures, presenting a major vulnerability to the budget and crowding out other more
productive spending. A large portion of debt depends on short term financing that is subject to
considerable rollover risks. In addition, an ambitious capital investment program in the context of
persistently optimistic revenue projections has resulted in a large accumulation of payment arrears in
recent years. The bulk of the arrears are in the Ministry of Public Works and Transport, but arrears
have also been arising elsewhere, including the Ministries of Education and Health. There have also
been long delays in VAT and profit tax refunds. Preliminary estimates of IMF staff, based on currently
available information, show a total stock of arrears of 5.3 percent of GDP at the end of 2013.

II. FISCAL CONSOLIDATION
8.
The government is committed to fiscal consolidation to put public finances on a
sustainable footing and lower public debt over the medium term. Given the weak economy it is
important to calibrate the extent of fiscal consolidation. We are committed to beginning the process
of fiscal consolidation in 2014, in order to achieve a reduction in public debt in 2015. We plan to

48

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ALBANIA

adjust our future fiscal targets, in consultation with IMF staff, in line with the strength of the
economy—fiscal adjustment will be loosened in the event that economic growth is weaker than
envisaged, and vice versa.
9.
Medium-term fiscal consolidation will also be key to achieving fiscal sustainability.
Over the medium-term, we aim to bring it down to 69 percent of GDP by the end of the program
with the IMF in 2016 and to well below 60 percent by 2019. We will work closely with our
international partners, including the IMF to strengthen medium-term fiscal framework and introduce
fiscal rules into our policy framework in 2015.
10.
We are targeting a fiscal deficit of about 4.0 percent of GDP in 2014, excluding
spending on the repayment of arrears, down from near 6 percent estimated for 2013. The
approval of the 2014 budget in line with the agreement with IMF staff is a prior action under the
program.
11.
The 2014 budget incorporates a number of policy measures to support fiscal
consolidation. On the revenue side, there will be increases in i) the corporate income tax (CIT) rate
from 10 to 15 percent (a level still well below the rate of 23 percent that was in place until 2008);
ii) excise tax rates on cigarettes, tobacco, beer, energy drinks, wine, and alcoholic drinks and
industrial lubricants (grease) will increase; 3) circulation tax increase, equivalent to an increase in
gasoline and diesel fuel prices of about 6.6 percent; 4) property tax rates paid by businesses (local
tax) to rise. On the spending side, we will i) refrain from increasing public sector salaries in 2014, with
the exception of a structural increase for police officers (given our desire to tackle widespread
corruption more effectively), and ii) limit pension increases to cost of living adjustments (a
requirement under the pension law).
12.
At the same time, we will also implement initiatives to ease the burden of fiscal
adjustment on individuals, small businesses, and vulnerable groups. In particular, we plan to
introduce a progressive income tax system on salaries with rates of 0, 13 and 23 percent
corresponding to monthly salaries up to lek 30, 130, and in excess of 130 thousand respectively,
abolish the small business tax (local tax), and reduce the rate for the simple tax on profit for small
businesses to half the corporate tax rate. To counter the impact of the tax increases on vulnerable
groups, we will provide targeted food support to those in need (half of the VAT paid for some basic
food products will be subsidized), as well as support those who have difficulties paying their
electricity bills (half of the VAT paid for electricity will be subsidized). To support agriculture, which
sustains a large number of the rural population, we will refund VAT by April 1, 2014, partially paid on
agricultural inputs. Finally, we plan to exempt medicines and medical services from VAT, in line with
EU regulations.
13.
There is a built-in flexibility in the design of the program to ensure that the fiscal
objectives are achieved. The 2014 budget includes a contingency in the event of revenue shortfalls.
Appropriations allocated under this category will be saved unless revenues over-perform as a result
of better tax policies and administration. Any decision to release these funds will be made in

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

49

ALBANIA

consultation with Fund staff, in the context of a supplementary budget request to Parliament during
the second half of the year. If on the other hand, revenue performance is better/worse than currently
expected as a result of improved/worsened economic conditions, the over/under performance so
calculated will be applied toward tightening/loosening fiscal policy in consultation with IMF staff. In
this manner the proposed program with the IMF will allow us to calibrate the speed of fiscal
adjustment over the medium term in line with the economic cycle.
14.
Improving tax administration will be critical for realizing the program objectives.
Revenue collection in Albania continues to be undermined by the high level of informality in the
economy, resulting in one of the lowest tax efficiency ratios in the region. We have recently received
technical assistance from the IMF on tax administration, and plan to move forward with
recommendations in 2014, including completing the introduction of a new IT system by end-2014. In
addition, we have contracted a foreign consultant to assist customs in tax collection, which we expect
to begin having sizable impact in improving efficiency and reducing corruption. Tax administration
will also establish committees to guide its strategic and operational decision making (prior action). A
new corporate strategy for medium and long term capacity building will be developed by end-June
(structural benchmark, June 2014). To reduce incentives for delaying VAT refunds, beginning in
January 2014 the Treasury will be responsible for making payments on all new VAT refund claims
after approval by the Tax Administration. Tax administration practices will also be revised to ensure
consistent application of rules and procedures, and the tax administration will make progress in
speeding up the repayment of VAT refunds with minimum delays.
15.
We are in the process of implementing a series of measures to increase tax compliance
and reduce fraud. We plan to implement lotteries on sales receipts by June, 2014 to give consumers
more incentives to request receipts in market transactions. For the businesses to which the
government owes arrears, we will check tax payment records and net out tax debt from the arrears
payments they will receive. We will launch a public awareness campaign beginning in June, 2014
through media on the importance of paying taxes. To reduce fraud in VAT and CIT refunds, we will
carry out more thorough verifications of refund claims, and in 2015, will change the verification
process to link it directly to businesses’ online tax payment records, so as to reduce the risk of
corruption. Undertaking the verifications electronically will also help in expediting the refund process.
16.
We will begin preparations shortly to move to a valuation-based property tax by 2015.
Property tax collections at the local level are currently very low, reflecting weak compliance and
incomplete property records that make the system difficult to administer. We have requested
technical assistance to introduce a valuation-based property tax that will be based on objective
appraisal of property values. Toward this end, we plan to begin the work for geospatial imaging, and
reinforcement of the land registry by end of 2014.
17.
Public Administration reform is high on our policy agenda. Our objective is to create a
professional civil service that is immune from political interference. We will conduct a review of
public administration in 2014 to inform future reforms. Our aim is to increase the efficiency and cut
costs, including by reducing the number of employees in public administration. The government will

50

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ALBANIA

not hire new staff beyond the level allowed by the current organigrams and the number of
employees in the public administration in 2014 will not exceed the current level of 87,700. Going
forward, we are committed to hiring new employees on merit, and in strict compliance with the new
Civil Service Law that is to be implemented by April, 2014.
18.
Pension reform is a key medium-term priority. The current system constitutes a significant
burden on budgetary resources, in large part due to the very low level of collections, and requires
comprehensive reform in order to ensure its medium-term fiscal sustainability. We acknowledge that
putting public pensions on a sustainable footing would require rationalization of benefits and
contributions. A new Reform Commission, which will be established by March, 2014 (structural
benchmark), will launch a comprehensive review of the pension system in cooperation with the
World Bank, and present a medium-term reform strategy to Council of Ministers for approval by
December, 2014 (structural benchmark).
19.
The existing benefit structure will be reviewed. We intend to reform of the disability
system to prevent abuse. In this regard, we intend to prosecute those who are found guilty of
abusing the system so as to deter similar incidents in the future. Moreover, we will streamline the
program for property compensation and tackle fraud, with the Social Assistance Scheme of the
World Bank.
20.
In the coming year, we also plan to launch a comprehensive local government reform
effort. Weakness in local government administration adds to fiscal risks and hampers the effective
delivery of services. Our goal is to streamline finances, increase autonomy, and make them more
accountable for their decisions. Administrative and territorial reform, which should be completed
before the 2015 local elections, should help tackle some concerns about the functioning of local
government units, related to the collection of revenues, human resource management, financial
control, and transparency.
21.
Further boosting capital expenditure is essential for meeting our development
objectives over the medium term. Finalizing the ongoing infrastructure projects is a major priority
in the short term in order to minimize delays which give rise to additional costs. In this regard, we
intend to renegotiate existing project commitments during 2014 to release space for
accommodating new initiatives while reducing outstanding government obligations. We are
committed to gradually increasing budgetary allocations toward this end consistent with the medium
term macro framework.

III. PREVENTION AND CLEARANCE OF GOVERNMENT ARREARS
22.
Our first priority is to meet the government’s payment obligations and to avoid the
recurrence of new arrears in the future. The significant accumulation of public sector arrears
during the last few years is a major contributing factor in the slowdown in economic activity, and has
created a negative chain of payment delays that have adversely affected both corporate and bank
balance sheets. A prompt clearance of these obligations should help to restore confidence and
alleviate the liquidity constraints in the private sector.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

51

ALBANIA

23.
Arrears repayment will be guided by a comprehensive and transparent prevention and
clearance strategy, which will be published quarterly on the MoF website. The Arrears Prevention
and Clearance Strategy (APCS; prior action) will comprise measures the government will undertake to
ensure weaknesses in the system that generated the arrears problem are addressed. It will also lay
out the structure of the clearance process, including the committee in charge of executing the
clearance (the Arrears Committee). We expect to pay arrears without delay upon verification. The
High State Audit will be involved in the verification and monitoring of the procedures followed and
its adherence with the APCS. We will also contract an external auditor to perform ex-post risk-based
audit of randomly chosen cases (structural benchmark, June 2014), to ensure that the repayment
process adheres to the APCS. The breakdown of individually cleared arrears, by amount, and result of
the external auditor’s findings will be published quarterly on the Ministry of Finance website
(continuous structural benchmark). External financing from the IMF and the World Bank will enable
us to meet our goal of a timely clearance of these arrears, without overstretching domestic financial
markets with the volume of domestic bond issuance that would otherwise be required. Nonetheless,
we expect that the due diligence and verification process would limit the amount of arrears cleared
to 11.7 billion lek by June 2014 and 35 billion lek by December 2014. We will consult with Fund staff
should arrears clearance exceed these clearance bands.
24.
Besides clearance of existing arrears, we are also committed to putting in place the
necessary processes to monitor future commitments and avoid arrears accumulation. The first
step in this regard was the inclusion of the Albanian Roads Authority as one of five institutions in the
pilot rollout of the extension of the Treasury System in November 2012. This change has given five
institutions the responsibility to register all contract commitments and pre-commitments in the
Treasury system. In addition, we have strengthened commitment management by requiring all new
procurement orders (for goods, works and services) to be sent to the MoF for clearance prior to
starting the biding process. Submission to Parliament of legislation to clearly define expenditure
arrears and payment terms is a prior action under the program, for January 2014.
25.
In addition, we will enhance the reporting and approval procedures for procurement
orders, especially for multi-year commitments. One important cause for the build-up of contract
arrears was the lack of control over the procurement process, especially for multi-year contracts that
demand budget resources beyond the current year. To tackle the problem, beginning in March 2014
we will require all procurement orders to be sent to MoF for clearance based on appropriations and
outer-year commitment ceilings. Operationally, this will be done through the following steps:




52

MoF will issue budget instructions by January, 2014 to all central government entities to
report all proposed new procurement orders for MoF clearance, and suspend issuing any
new multi-year procurement orders until outer-year commitment ceilings are approved by
the Council of Ministers (CoM) (prior action). This is to ensure that new procurements will
only be made in observance of the outer-year commitment ceilings.
MoF will start clearing in-year procurement orders based on appropriations and sign on each
cleared procurement order (January 2014).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ALBANIA







MoF will record signed procurement orders for all investment contracts and for all current
expenditures of higher than $300,000 a year in a designated database. (January 2014)
MOF will issue instructions to all local governments to report all new procurement orders to
MOF starting September 2014 (structural benchmark, March 2014).
MoF will submit to CoM proposals for outer-year commitment limits and get them approved
(March 2014)
Government entities will be allowed to resume issuing multi-year procurement orders and
start reporting them to MoF, including their disbursement schedules by year (March 2014)
MoF will start clearing multi-year procurement orders based on annual appropriations and
outer-year commitment ceilings (March 2014)

The above reporting and clearance procedures will be in place until we reconfigure the Treasury
System to fulfill the same functions for key ministries and gradually extend the coverage of the
system to 60 percent of the state budget and Tirana Municipality by end-2014.
26.
We are planning to make several additional improvements in public financial
management in 2014. These will include: i) modification of the commitment module in the treasury
system to disaggregate multi-year commitments by individual year allocations by June, 2014; ii)
require the registration in the Treasury system of all invoices received, regardless of cash availability
within 5 days of acceptance by June 2014, iii) strengthening the timeliness and flow of tax and
revenue information so that the gross transactions and values of collections and refunds are
captured in the treasury system on weekly bases using the interface for data exchange between Tax
Information System and Treasury System by 2015. In addition, we have already granted the authority
and responsibility to the treasury to execute tax refund payment transactions starting January 2014.
We are also receiving assistance from the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA)-financed
twinning project (supported by the French and Austrian governments) which is providing technical
assistance on Public Financial Management reforms, particularly a comprehensive review of primary
and secondary legislation.
27.
We plan to start introducing commitment limits with the 2015 budget (structural
benchmark, December 2014). The commitment limits will specify, for every line item of the budget,
the amounts of commitments that can be made in the current year and for each outer-year. The sum
of the commitment limits will be lower than the cash ceilings for the outer-years, to preserve room
for new commitments that will be made in the outer-years. We will also amend the relevant laws in
2014 to legally enforce the commitment limits. Meanwhile, we will conduct public campaigns to
inform the business community of the above reform measures.
28.
To monitor any potential new accumulation of arrears, we will strengthen financial
data reporting of government agencies, starting with the ministries that have created the largest
amounts of existing arrears. Starting in the first quarter of 2014, the MoF will carry out a quarterly
survey of arrears accumulation among selected parts of central government (the Ministries of
Transportation, Health, Education, Justice, and Defense, and the GDT) to collect information on all
unpaid obligations (structural benchmark, April, 2014). Coverage of the arrears survey should be

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

53

ALBANIA

gradually expanded (structural benchmark, October, 2014). A new unit responsible for conducting
the surveys and consolidating the results will be established within the MoF; the unit will collect and
monitor arrears data. We will send a consolidated survey report to the IMF for review, 45 days after
the end of each quarter. Meanwhile, we will conduct financial reporting training for all line ministries,
with the goal of gradually extending the survey to other ministries. By the end of 2014, the survey is
expected to cover the 10 ministries with the highest existing arrears stocks.

IV. MONETARY AND EXCHANGE RATE POLICY
29.
The BoA remains committed to preserving price stability under an inflation-targeting
framework. As defined in our medium-term strategy, the BoA aims to achieve a headline average
CPI inflation target of 3 percent over the medium term, with a tolerance band of +/-1percentage
points to account for supply side shocks and inflation inertia. The monetary policy decision-making
process is guided by the deviation of forecasted inflation from this objective, while striving to avoid
excessive volatility in the real and financial sector. The BoA targets headline inflation, but will also
monitor core inflation as a measure of underlying inflationary pressures. The inflation performance
will be monitored through an inflation consultation clause (see TMU).
30.
The BoA remains committed to a free floating exchange rate regime. This regime
complements our price stability objective and supports our operational framework of monetary
policy. The BoA will also aim to maintain adequate reserve coverage over the program; reserve
coverage is currently well above the level prescribed by most standard reserve metrics. For the
duration of the program we will not, without Fund approval, introduce or intensify restrictions on the
making of payments and transfers for current international transactions, nor introduce or modify any
multiple currency practices or conclude any bilateral payments agreements that are inconsistent with
Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. Moreover, we will not introduce or intensify import
restrictions for balance of payments reasons.
31.
The main tool of monetary policy will continue to be the one week repo rate. Our
monetary operations will aim to achieve an adequate supply of liquidity, so that short term interest
rates in the interbank market are close to our policy rate. The BoA will aim to improve its operational
framework in order to increase the efficiency of the transmission mechanism and to promote the
development of money markets. In order to increase our transparency and effectiveness, and
improve the anchoring of inflation expectations, the BoA will also continue to enhance its
communication strategy.

V. SAFEGUARDING FINANCIAL SECTOR STABILITY
32.
The BoA will continue to closely monitor the situation in the banking sector to ensure
that it remains well-capitalized and liquid. If necessary, BoA will apply higher minimum required
levels of risk weighted capital and liquidity ratios, according to risk profiles of individual banks. In
order to identify other potential vulnerabilities in the banking sector, BoA will also continue to
regularly perform top-down and bottom-up solvency and liquidity stress tests, applying scenarios

54

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ALBANIA

that assume persistent uncertainties in the economic environment and increased volatility in
macroeconomic indicators.
33.
NPL reduction is a priority, and the BoA will focus on actions to bring this about, and
to ensure that standards on new lending are strengthened. In this regard, the BoA will improve
by February 2014 the regulatory framework to strengthen credit standards and provide more
guidance on NPL management. The BoA and the MoF, in conjunction with the Ministry of Justice and
other related agencies, and Albanian Banking Association has submitted the legal amendment of the
Tax Law to the Parliament to remove legal and technical issues that impede the loan write-offs from
banks’ balance sheets within January 2014. In addition, we will prepare (with IFC assistance) changes
in the Civil Code and other relevant laws in order to introduce improvements in insolvency
requirements, set the payment to bailiffs in line with success rate (rather than requiring full up-front
payment as at present), and restrict judicial discretion in postponing borrowers’ payments or
determining priority in collateral claims. Of course, arrears clearance will also help NPL reduction.
34.
The Bankruptcy Law will also be reviewed. The present law is inadequate, particularly with
regard to setting timelines for the process and liquidation of property. A joint project with the IFC
will start in February to review the legal framework dealing with bankruptcy issues.
35.
The BoA will also continue to strengthen its macro-prudential framework. In this regard,
it will gather additional information on the interlinkages between the banking sector and the
nonbank financial institutions, and strengthen its financial crisis preparedness framework to address
systemic risk issues by end 2014, including its Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) framework to
align with FSAP recommendations. The BoA, along with other authorities, will ensure that the
meetings of the Financial Stability Advisory Group (FSAG) take place on a quarterly basis as required
and focus on financial stability and systemic risk management. By end of March 2014, we will also
introduce monthly meetings at a technical level (structural benchmark, March 2014). All the
authorities will cooperate under the FSAG guidance, to strengthen FSAG legal support for prevention
and management of a systemic financial crisis. In order to ensure that risks from the lack of a
secondary public debt market are effectively mitigated, the BoA also plans to issue a regulation by
March 2014 that applies the same collateral standards to all monetary operations of the BOA
(including repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements) and expands collateral eligibility to all
negotiable securities issued by the government of Albania (structural benchmark, March 2014).
36.
BoA will further improve its stress-testing toolkit. It will aim at developing sound
technical skills in banks over time in order to improve the quality of bottom-up solvency stress-tests.
In this regard, BoA will streamline its procedures by September 2014 to ensure that its macro-model
and other satellite models are effectively used to determine macroeconomic scenarios and estimate
their impact for stress-testing purposes.
37.
During 2014, the BoA plans to take measures that will facilitate the development of the
secondary market for government securities. The new system—which includes fully automating
the clearing and registration of government securities transactions—aims to minimize the risks

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

55

ALBANIA

involved in transactions, such as settlement risk, liquidity risk and legal risk. This should help to both
foster the development of the secondary market in government securities as well as the repo market
with such underlying securities. In addition, strengthening the technological and legal environment
for trading government paper could also help to foster increased participation from foreign investors
in this market.
38.
We will also strengthen the regulatory framework for the nonbank financial sector. We
will move forward with amendments to the law governing the operations of the Albanian Financial
Supervisory Authority (AFSA) in order to strengthen its operational and financial independence, and
amend the insurance law in line with recommendations from the recent FSAP (structural benchmark,
June 2014). We will also revise the regulatory framework for investment funds in Albania to introduce
liquidity and capital requirements (structural benchmark, June 2014) and require the calculation of
net asset value to be done on a mark to market basis (structural benchmark, June 2014). We have
requested technical assistance to determine how to set the market value of these assets, given the
lack of a secondary market, and implementation would be based on the outcome of the technical
assistance. We will also strengthen requirements for funds’ disclosure and consumer protection by
September 2014 to align with the FSAP recommendations.

VI. IMPROVING COORDINATION OF MACROECONOMIC POLICIES
39.
To strengthen coordination of macroeconomic policy, we have taken steps to
institutionalize this cooperation. The recently formed National Economic Council (NEC) will
function as a roundtable forum where the business community can reach the highest levels of the
government with their concerns, ideas and propositions. The NEC is chaired by the Prime Minister,
and will coordinate government policies with the needs and demands of the business sector and
donors, in order to create functional policies and efficient communication between all interest
groups. A new Inter-Ministerial Commission for Economic Development Policies will also help to
provide an integrated reaction from all government institutions on key economic issues. We also
made effective a tax council—a consultative body of the Ministry of Finance that will engage with the
business community.

VII. STRUCTURAL REFORMS
A. Business Climate
40.
Business climate is an important factor in enhancing investment, and the government
is committed to taking a proactive role in reforms in the area. Our approach entails addressing
the problem issues both over the short and medium term. In addition to resolving the problem of
arrears, which is critical for restoring the health of the private sector, we are taking active steps,
including creating the National Economic Council which will facilitate the direct communication
between the business community and government, the wrong and harmful procedures competition,
posted on the website of the Ministry of Economic Development and ongoing, which will address
procedural problems, and the review of the VAT legislation, which is currently under way, to ensure

56

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ALBANIA

that business complaints are addressed immediately. Measures we are implementing in improving
revenue administration, including the hiring of a consultant will help reduce ad hoc practices by
government revenue agencies.
41.
We plan to undertake a comprehensive assessment of the regulatory framework for
business that will provide the basis for our medium-term agenda. The Ministry of Economy
(MoETDE) will seek input from the local business community through direct communication with
them and interest groups (currently ongoing regarding Manufacturing relief measures) in order to
identify the key deficiencies that need to be addressed. We hope to move on an EBRD project on a
business climate reform by the second half of 2014. MoU will most likely be signed by the Prime
Minister during the official visit to EBRD headquarters on February 24, which will identify and resolve
key legislative and procedural obstacles to private sector activity. The Ministry is also preparing a
questionnaire that will be sent to the business community on the most harmful and time consuming
procedures that they face in Albania. The competition was held from December 6, 2013, until January
6, 2014, identifying 19 procedures, but has been reopened in order to allow more time for the
business community to provide their comments and suggestions. By addressing the concerns of the
market with adequate policy and institutional procedures, the government will ensure that the basis
for a more functional market is being established, which should also help to facilitate new
investment. The MoETDE is also reviewing the existing concessions for elements of exclusivity that
result in monopolies. Any amendments should be made consistent with applicable laws.
42.
A reform of business registration procedures will be high priority. The objective would
be to improve transparency and reduce the time spent by businesses in this area. We plan a
comprehensive review of the National Registration Office by the beginning of 2015, including the
review of the legislation, the launch of online applications and online financial tables, which will be
the basis for reforming bureaucratic processes, improving recordkeeping, and ensuring transparency.
In particular, we plan to reform the regulatory framework of the tourism sector by the beginning of
the second half of 2014 to improve the quality of service and ensure adherence to international
standards.

B. Agriculture Reform
43.
We also plan a series of reforms in the agricultural sector, which we believe has
significant underutilized potential. We plan to carry out agricultural land reform, which would
strengthen property rights and yield economies of scale and facilitate investment in the sector. Our
goal is to distribute 70 percent of land titles by 2015. Improvements in coordination with all
government institutions with jurisdiction in licensing, certification and granting of ownership titles to
create an integrated system of information on farmers and land will also support the reform effort.
We will also establish the Farm Accountancy Data Network by 2017 which will contain individual
accounts for all farmers, and will help farmers with access to lending and markets. The Rural
Development and Water administration (MoARDWA) will strive to improve irrigation infrastructure
and food safety, by developing initiatives for capacity building in the sector. Finally, we intend to

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

57

ALBANIA

decentralize the management of the Rural Development funds by 2016 and move the organizational
structure closer to EU requirements.

C. Social Welfare Programs
44.
On social protection, the government seeks to improve equity and efficacy of the
system. The Ministry of Welfare will aim to “de-institutionalize” the social services, by combining
direct monetary transfers with the provided services. A new TA project with the World Bank will
modernize the social assistance scheme, and produce a unified formula for evaluating all applicants
for Economic Aid and the Special Needs Pension. We also plan to introduce by April 2014 a database
that will allow different government agencies to exchange publicly held data on individuals, which
will enable easier cross-checking of claims and reduce fraudulent claims for social benefits, which
have ballooned in recent years. By improving the screening of social benefit programs, we expect to
reduce the number of recipients by 20 percent by 2016.
45.
We are developing an initiative to complement social benefits with vocational training
in order to empower recipients to find work. A portion of the people who get economic aid will
be offered a small payment instead of the aid, and will be engaged in community work. This policy
will be in place by year 2015. In addition, we plan to expand the incentive system that would provide
financial compensation to companies for employing these individuals.

D. Energy Sector
46.
The Task Force for energy sector reform will develop a medium-term strategy, in
cooperation with the World Bank. There will be changes in all laws regulating the power sector—
Law “On power sector” by the end of June, and the Law on Renewable and Law on Efficiency, by
December 31, 2014, with a revised market model including all the necessary sublegal acts and
regulations ready by December 31, 2014. The Ministry of Energy will design a plan by first quarter of
2014 to increase billing in the regions where informality is prevalent. The Ministry will also push for
an increase in correct billing, at first through average expenses based on consumption, and then with
special measures that will account for the energy before it reaches the consumer. We will also review
by end of June, 2014 the tariff system to bring prices closer to the market prices, and revise the
prices for feed-in energy produced by small private hydro-electric companies (HEC) plants by
December 31, 2014. In addition, we will review by end of June, 2014 and distinguish clearly the types
of customers that require subsidies for electricity. A Strategy is expected to be presented to
Parliament in December.
47.
Administrative measures are planned to reduce system losses and broaden the base of
bill payers. A task force in collaboration with other law enforcement agencies will identify the
consumers who are receiving service illegally, cut them off the grid unless there is a proper legal
request and provide assistance to re-connect these as new customers, legally. The task force will
publish quarterly reports on progress achieved, one month after the end of each quarter. The Task

58

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ALBANIA

Force will also identify the immediate needs for meter repairs and grid maintenance and propose an
investment plan by first quarter of 2014.
48.
In addition, we plan to resolve the inter-company debts that have accumulated in the
energy sector. Because of the heavy network losses and low collection rate of the distribution
company, the company has accumulated significant arrears to the state power company. The energy
sector Task Force and the Ministry of Energy will devise a plan by first quarter of 2014 to sort out
these inter-related debts which have rendered the sector dysfunctional. An amicable resolution of
the conflict with the distribution company remains our immediate priority.
49.
Finally, we plan to upgrade the electricity distribution grid to increase the security of
supply and lower losses. This will include installation of smart meters and a smart grid by a partial
application in a pilot zone, by end 2014; we will also need to improve the transmission grid and
complete the construction of the interconnection line Tirane–Prishtine by the end of 2014 and for
Elbasan–Bitola (study completed but no deadline for the construction). The initiation of new
important projects for the generation of new sources of power, such as the Skavica HEC is also a
long term objective. There will be an analysis on the feasibility of the Interconnection project with
Italy and also the Master Plan for the gasification of the country, given the possibilities presented by
the TAP Project. The World Bank will support the above reform measures through an investment
operation in coordination with other IFIs.

E. Education and Health
50.
We envisage a comprehensive agenda for educational and health reform. First, the
Ministry of Education will increase investment in early child education to increase access to and
enrollment in pre-school education and will overhaul of the long-term budgeting process. Higher
education reforms will focus on allocating resources to public universities on the basis of quality and
cost performance. We will launch a comprehensive review of the poor performance of the
professional education system, and based on the findings, we intend to increase the number of
professional education and training institutions, with an emphasis on improving the skills quality and
lower skill mismatches in the labor market. For this, we also plan to engage the business community
in design of the curriculum, and establish apprentice arrangements with companies, in order to
ensure that professional education will be directly connected to the demands of the labor market. In
the health sector a new National Agency for Medicines and Medical Materials will improve
procurement of pharmaceuticals and other medical materials.

F. EU Integration
51.
We plan to launch a complete review of the legal framework for European integration,
in line with the recommendations of the 2013 Progress Report of the European Commission.
This review and subsequent reform will aim to update the national coordinating structures for
addressing the challenges and tasks identified by the EU. The new structure will seek to develop a

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

59

ALBANIA

comprehensive approach at the institutional level and an increased awareness of the public with
regard to integration issues.

G. Statistics
52.
Improving inter-agency data sharing is a priority in order to improve the reliability and
timeliness of national accounts and other macroeconomic statistics. We plan, together with
INSTAT and Bank of Albania, to introduce by the end of 2014 a more systemic way to share
administrative data in line with the European Statistics Code of Practice and with the IMF Data
Quality Assessment Framework, which would eliminate or minimize duplications in data submission
and streamline requests for information from businesses.

VIII. PROGRAM MONITORING
53.
The program will be subject to quarterly reviews for the first five reviews and semiannual
reviews thereafter based on performance criteria, indicative targets and structural benchmarks as set
out in Tables 1-2 and in the attached Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU). We
anticipate that the first four reviews will take place on June 28, 2014; September 15, 2014;
December 15, 2014; and March 27, 2015, respectively. These reviews will require observance of the
conditionality for end-March 2014, end-June 2014, end-September 2014, and end-December 2014,
respectively.

The fiscal year starts on January 1 and ends on December 31.

I. QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
A. Floor on Net International Reserves of the BoA
Definition
5.
Net international reserves (NIR) are defined as reserve assets minus reserve liabilities of the
Bank of Albania. Reserve assets are readily available claims of the Bank of Albania on nonresidents
denominated in foreign convertible currencies, and held for the purpose of meeting balance of
payments financing needs, intervention in exchange markets, and other purposes. They include Bank
of Albania holdings of monetary gold, SDRs, Albania’s reserve position in the IMF, foreign currency
cash, securities, and deposits abroad. Excluded from reserve assets are any assets that are pledged,
collateralized, or otherwise encumbered; claims on residents; precious metals other than monetary
gold; assets in nonconvertible currencies; illiquid assets; and claims on foreign exchange arising from
derivatives in foreign currencies vis-à-vis domestic currency (such as futures, forwards, swaps, and
options).
6.
Reserve liabilities are defined as foreign exchange liabilities to residents and nonresidents
of the Bank of Albania, irrespective of their maturity. They include: foreign currency reserves of
commercial banks held at the Bank of Albania; foreign currency deposits of the government held at
the Bank of Albania; all credit outstanding from the IMF that is a liability of the Bank of Albania;
commitments to sell foreign exchange arising from derivatives (such as futures, forwards, swaps, and

options); and all arrears on principal or interest payments to commercial banks, suppliers, or official
export credit agencies. Reserve assets and reserve liabilities will both be expressed in euros, at the
program exchange rate.

Reporting
7.
Data will be provided by the BoA to the Fund with a lag of no more than five days past the
test date.

B. Cumulative Ceiling on General Government Overall Cash Deficit
Excluding Arrears Payments
Definitions
8.
The overall cash deficit of the general government will be measured from the financing
side (below the line) at current exchange rates, based on the template below:

CASH BALANCE
Financing (Cash)
Domestic
Privatization receipts
Domestic borrowing
National
Local
Other
Foreign
Loan(Drawings)
Change of statistical account
Repayments

9.

In determining the overall cash balance, the following considerations will apply:


Privatizations: Privatization receipts should be reported on a gross basis



Domestic borrowing: Domestic borrowing is reported on a net basis and is determined on
the basis of the residency criterion. It covers bank loans, securities issued, overdraft accounts,
and other debt instruments, less government deposits.



Other: “Other” refers to the change in the Single Treasury Account, the accounts of Special
Funds, and other transitory accounts.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

65

ALBANIA



Foreign borrowing: Foreign borrowing is reported on a gross basis and is determined on the
basis of the residency criterion. It covers disbursements by international financial institutions,
bank loans, securities issued, overdraft accounts, and other debt instruments.



Change of Statistical Account: This item covers balances held by nonresidents in financial
institutions for project-related spending.



Repayments: This item refers to all payments to nonresidents related to disbursements by
international financial institutions, bank loans, securities, overdraft accounts, and other debt
instruments.

10.
Excluded from the calculation of the overall cash deficit of the general government are the
arrears payments to be made in the context of the Arrears Prevention and Clearance Strategy (APCS).
The amount of arrears paid will be identified using the verified arrears list and matching the list with
the Treasury payment records. A summary of the total amount of arrears paid under the clearance
strategy, as defined above, will be provided on a monthly basis.

Reporting
11.
Data, including the amount of arrears payments under the APCS, will be provided to the
Fund using current exchange rates with a lag of no more than four weeks after the test date.

Adjuster
12.
The ceiling on the overall cash deficit of the general government will be adjusted
upward (downward)—that is, the deficit target will be increased (reduced)—by 50 percent of the
privatization receipts, up to total privatization receipts of lek 14 billion in a given year. The
programmed amount of privatization receipts in 2014 is Lek 400 million.

II. CONTINUOUS PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
A. Accumulation of New External Payment Arrears by the General
Government
Definitions
13.
External debt is determined according to the residency criterion. The term “debt”2 will be
understood to mean a current, i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual arrangement
through the provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which
requires the obligor to make one or more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or
2

As defined in Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to External Debt in Fund Arrangements,

Decision No. 6230-(79/140), as amended.

66

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ALBANIA

services, at some future point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest
liabilities incurred under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones being as
follows:


Loans, i.e., advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the basis of an
undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits, bonds,
debentures, commercial loans and buyers’ credits) and temporary exchanges of assets that
are equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which the obligor is required to repay the
funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future
(such as repurchase agreements and official swap arrangements);



Suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer payments
until sometime after the date on which the goods are delivered or services are provided; and



Leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee has the right to
use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter than the total
expected service life of the property. For the purpose of the program, the debt is the present
value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the
period of the agreement excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair or
maintenance of the property.

14.
Under the definition of debt set out above, arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded
damages arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual obligation that constitutes
debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not considered debt under this
definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt.
15.
Under this definition of debt set out above, external payments arrears consist of arrears of
external debt obligations (principal and interest) falling due after the due date and grace period, as
specified in the contract, has passed. Arrears resulting from nonpayment of debt service for which a
clearance framework has been agreed or rescheduling agreement is being sought are excluded from
this definition.
16.
The external arrears of the general government will be calculated based on the schedule of
external payments obligations reported by the MoF. Data on external arrears will be reconciled with
the relevant creditors, and any necessary adjustments will be incorporated in these targets as they
occur.
17.

This performance criterion does not cover arrears on trade credits.

18.

The performance criterion will apply on a continuous basis.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

67

ALBANIA

Reporting
19.
The MoF will provide the final data on the external arrears of the general government to
the Fund, with a lag of not more than two weeks after the test date.

III. INFLATION CONSULTATION
20.
The quarterly consultation bands apply to the 12-month rate of inflation in consumer
prices (as measured by the headline consumer price index (CPI) published by the INSTAT). Should the
observed year-on-year rate of CPI inflation (quarterly average) fall outside the outer bands, the
authorities will complete a consultation with the IMF on their proposed policy response before
requesting further purchases under the program. In addition, the BoA will conduct discussions with
IMF staff should the observed year-on-year rate of CPI inflation (quarterly average) fall outside the
inner bands specified for the end of each quarter.

IV. INDICATIVE TARGETS
A. Ceiling on Accumulation of Central Government Domestic Arrears
Definition
21.
Domestic expenditure arrears are defined as payments to residents determined by
contractual agreements that remain unpaid 30 days after the due date specified by the contract or
by the law. Domestic tax refund arrears are defined as obligations on tax refunds in accordance with
tax legislation that remain unpaid 30 days after the due date. The due date refers to the date in
which domestic debt payments are due according to the relevant contractual agreement or
legislation, taking into account any contractual grace periods.
22.
For the purpose of this target, the accumulation of domestic arrears will be monitored
through MoF’s quarterly survey on arrears accumulation, which will cover the following part of the
central government: General Directorate of Taxation, Ministries of Transportation, Health, Education,

B. Clearance of General Government Domestic Arrears
Definitions
24.
Domestic expenditure arrears are defined as payments to residents determined by
contractual agreements that remain unpaid 30 days after the due date specified by the contract or
by the law. Domestic tax refund arrears are defined as obligations on tax refunds in accordance with
tax legislation that remain unpaid 30 days after the due date. The due date refers to the date in
which domestic debt payments are due according to the relevant contractual agreement or
legislation, taking into account any contractual grace periods. General government domestic arrears
include arrears on domestic general government direct debt, including to suppliers, all recurrent and
capital expenditure commitments, and all tax refund arrears.
25.
The limit on clearance of general government domestic arrears consists of a floor for the
amount of arrears payment.

30.
Publish a comprehensive arrears prevention and clearance strategy. The strategy
should include the government’s plan and prioritization criteria for the liquidation of arrears, and
measures for arrears prevention. The draft strategy should be sent to the Fund for review before
being submitted to the Council of Ministers for approval.

Contract an external auditor with a mandate to conduct risk-based audits of arrears
payments. The MoF should submit the Terms of Reference for the external auditor to the IMF for
review before starting the tendering process.
32.
Introduce multi-year commitment limits in the 2015 budget, and change the
Procurement Law, the Financial Management and Control Law, and the Budget Law
accordingly. Commitment is an obligation to make a future payment subject to the fulfillment of
certain conditions (contractual or otherwise). Commitment limits specify the amounts that can be
committed in the current year for both the current year and each outer-year per line item of the
budget. The sum of the commitment limits for an outer-year should be lower than the cash spending
ceiling for that year, to leave sufficient room for the amounts that can be committed within that year.

In agreement with BoA and Albanian Financial Supervisory Authority (AFSA), amend
the regulatory frame work for investment funds on asset valuation, liquidity requirement, and
capital adequacy requirement. The amended regulations should:
1. Require that the calculation of the unit value represent the proportionate share of the aggregate

Annex II. Debt Sustainability Analysis
Albania’s public debt is high and requires urgent action to bring back toward a sustainable level. Over
the medium term, substantial further fiscal consolidation will be needed to put debt on a downward
trajectory and mitigate risks to debt sustainability. Albania will have to tackle a variety of risks, notably
rollover risk and exposure to shocks.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Albania’s public debt at end 2013 is estimated at 70.5 percent of GDP. This amount
includes outstanding arrears and unpaid bills (5.3 percent of GDP). Most public debt—defined at the
level of general government and in gross terms—is domestic (about 62 percent of the total) and
short term (about 30 percent), 1 and includes guaranteed debt (about 5 percent of the total). 2 Local
government debt is negligible (0.04 percent of the total). Most domestic debt is held by commercial
banks and increasingly by nonbanks. External debt is owed to multilateral creditors (about
51 percent), official bilateral creditors (28 percent), and private creditors (21 percent).
2.
Public debt has increased sharply
in recent years. Since 2008, public debt as a
percent of GDP has increased by more than
10 percentage points. The increase also led to
the breach and ultimate removal of the 60
percent of GDP debt ceiling in 2012.

3.
In line with the guidelines on Public
Individuals
62.6%
DSA in market access countries, Albania is
considered a higher scrutiny case. In
particular, Albania meets the following criteria
for higher scrutiny: i) current (and projected) public debt exceeding 60 percent of GDP, ii) gross
financing needs (25 percent of GDP in 2013) exceeding 10 percent of GDP.
4.
The macroeconomic assumptions underpinning the DSA are in line with the
macroeconomic adjustment program. There is a gradual recovery of growth to about 4.7 percent
in the medium term, supported by a rebound of confidence and higher private investment flows.
Inflation expectations will remain anchored keeping inflation within the central bank’s 3±1 percent

1

About half of domestic debt is short term.

2

Gross debt includes: i) central government debt, ii) central government guarantees, and iii) local government debt,
as reported by the Ministry of Finance. The coverage of public debt is consistent with that of the fiscal accounts.

76

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ALBANIA

annual target range. Given the sharp increase in the fiscal deficit estimated to have taken place in
2013 and the accumulation of unpaid bills and arrears, reduction in public debt will require sizable
fiscal adjustment. The overall fiscal balance is expected to decline from an estimated deficit of
6.2 percent of GDP in 2013 to a balanced position in 2019. The external current account deficit is
expected to decline gradually as higher investment leads to a widening of the export base and fiscal
consolidation reduces demand for imports.

II. PUBLIC DSA RESULTS
5.
Albania’s debt is expected to decline gradually over the medium term, but will remain
high. Under the baseline scenario, Albania’s debt is expected to decline below 60 percent of GDP
only at end-2019. Debt near that level poses significant risks because of i) high rollover need,
ii) rising interest rates, iii) close links to the financial sector, and iv) vulnerability to terms of trade
shocks.
6.
The financing profile continues to pose risks. On the positive side, short term debt is
expected to decline over time, in line with the authorities’ efforts to lengthen the maturity profile of
debt and reduce rollover risk. Nevertheless, public gross financing needs will remain elevated in the
near term, above the 20 percent of GDP early warning benchmark associated with past debt crises.
Interest rate risk on the other hand is expected to increase with the lengthening of maturities,
although the lack of a secondary market limits the impact on valuations. Foreign currency debt is
expected to increase over the medium term, reflecting external financing under the program and
efforts to contract debt with longer maturities. Exchange rate risk will therefore increase, but
Albania’s comfortable level of reserves would help mitigate this risk. While the creditor base is
currently heavily weighted toward banks, it is expected that over the medium term there will be
some diversification toward other institutions (e.g., investment funds).
7.
Alternative scenarios underscore risks associated with the baseline scenario. Two
alternative standardized scenarios based on the historical scenario and constant primary balance
scenario3 suggest that reducing public debt below 60 percent of GDP by 2019 would require a clear
departure from past practice. Specifically, the historical scenario suggests that public debt will
remain slightly above 70 percent of GDP, while the constant primary balance scenario suggests a
substantial increase to about 83 percent of GDP by 2019.
8.
The results of the alternative scenarios do not warrant adjustment of the baseline
scenario. First, the historical period is rather short and not representative of the current economic
environment. 4 High growth at the time led to pro-cyclical fiscal policy while easy financing was a
3

Under the historical scenario, real GDP growth, the primary balance, and real interest rates are set at their historical
average while other variables are the same as in the baseline. Under the constant primary balance scenario, the
primary balance remains unchanged compared to the first projection year (in percent of GDP), while all other
variables are the same as in the baseline.
4

Due to data limitations, the historical period covers data since 2006.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ALBANIA

disincentive for fiscal adjustment.5 Use of the constant primary balance scenario may also be
inappropriate because the authorities understand that maintaining the primary balance at its 2014
projected level would entail significant risks for macroeconomic stability and growth.6
9.
The realism of the baseline scenario is further corroborated by other countries’
experience. The track record of projecting macroeconomic variables (growth, primary balance,
inflation) relative to other countries does not reveal systematic one-sided biases. Forecast errors for
these variables were generally within the 25–75 inter-quartile range. For the primary balance, in
particular, projections have been rather conservative in recent years. 7
10.
Nevertheless, the planned fiscal consolidation effort is ambitious and poses risks. The
proposed fiscal consolidation, measured by the three-year adjustment in the structural primary
balance, is among the largest for high debt countries (those with debt exceeding 60 percent of
GDP). Still, the level of the three year average cyclically adjusted primary balance is broadly typical of
other countries’ adjustment experience.

III. STRESS TESTS
11.
Debt indicators could worsen significantly if Albania was hit by macro and fiscal
shocks. Stress tests included shocks on the primary balance, real GDP growth, interest rate,
exchange rate, and a combined macro–fiscal shock. Albania would be particularly vulnerable to a
combined macro–fiscal shock (which incorporates the largest effect of individual shocks on all
variables) because it would lead to a permanent increase in debt relative to 2013. It would increase
to about 80 percent by 2016, and then decline gradually to about 70 percent by 2019. A growth
shock (reduction in real GDP growth by one standard deviation for two consecutive years) would
also lead to an increase in debt to 75 percent of GDP by 2016, before declining to about 65 percent
by 2019. Shocks also have a negative impact on gross financing needs. Under the combined macro–
fiscal shock, gross financing needs are higher by more than 6 percentage points of GDP relative to
the baseline.
12.
A customized shock scenario examines the potential impact of a reduction in foreign
banks’ exposure to Albania. Under this scenario, a substantial withdrawal of exposure could lead
to a further reduction in the supply of credit, raising government borrowing costs, and putting
pressure on the exchange rate. The depreciation could raise inflation in the near term and result in
an increase in the monetary policy rate. Economic growth and fiscal revenues would suffer. Given
expenditure rigidities, the primary balance could deteriorate relative to the baseline, exerting
5

In the past arrears accumulation concealed the impact of expansionary fiscal policy on debt indicators.

6

This option may not be feasible given financing constraints.

7

While Albania’s growth projection may appear optimistic compared with other boom-bust cases, it is built on the
assumption of an investment rate that is lower than during 2006–11. Medium term growth will also be driven by
ambitious reforms which will boost total factor productivity. Energy–related investments including the Trans Adriatic
Pipeline (TAP) and foreign investment in new hydropower production will support the growth outlook.

78

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ALBANIA

pressure on government borrowing costs and investment. The resulting drag on growth could
persist throughout the projection period.
13.
The impact of this customized scenario on public debt and financing requirement
could be severe. Under this scenario—which is only illustrative of the risks associated with the
program—public debt and gross financing needs would rise steadily throughout the projection
period to about 85 percent and 35 percent of GDP respectively. At such high debt level and with
large rollover needs, multiple equilibriums risks would increase substantially. The risk of a “bad
equilibrium”—the government effectively loses domestic market access as investors become
concerned about solvency—is impossible to quantify precisely. However, even under this not–so–
extreme scenario, the danger that deteriorating investor confidence would morph into a “bad
equilibrium” is plausible.
14.
Fan charts also present the possible evolution of debt over the medium term by
simulating a large number of shocks to macroeconomic variables. Fan charts show a spectrum
of possible outcomes for the level of debt based on a probabilistic view of uncertainty around the
baseline. These simulations suggest that under a symmetric distribution, the debt stock could range
between 40 and 70 percent of GDP by 2019. Nevertheless, risks are likely to be on the upside. As a
result, under a restricted distribution (which precludes a positive shock to the primary balance), debt
could increase up to about 85 percent of GDP by 2019 relative to the baseline scenario.

IV. CONCLUSION
15.
Albania’s debt is high and poses significant risks. Shocks related to growth, primary
balance, interest rates, and the exchange rate push Albania’s debt and gross financing needs above
relevant benchmarks, providing early warning signs of emerging risks. Specifically, Albania’s debt
exceeds the 70 percent debt benchmark both under the baseline and various shocks (red in the
standardized heat map). Similarly, gross financing needs exceed 15 percent of GDP under the
baseline and specific shocks (red in the standardized heat map). Finally, changes in the debt profile
pose moderate risks (yellow in the standardized heat map), with the exception of changes in short
term debt which pose low risks (green in the standardized heat map).
16.
Addressing the risks associated with high debt is critical for macroeconomic stability.
High debt is associated with lower growth and may prolong recession. High debt also means higher
vulnerability to shocks. Even stabilizing debt at high level (much more reducing it) requires large
primary surpluses for many years which may be politically difficult to sustain. Finally, high debt is
associated with high rollover requirements which increase vulnerability to sudden reversals in
market perceptions.

Safeguards Assessments: A safeguards assessment mission will take place in February 2014 and
the assessment will be issued soon after. The last safeguards assessment of the Bank of Albania,
completed on July 14, 2006, found that some weaknesses existed in the central bank's safeguards
framework. The main vulnerabilities identified by the assessment concerned the quality of the
external audit, lack of audit committee oversight of the external and internal audit functions and the
system of internal controls, and certain weaknesses in the controls over the Fund data reporting
process. Subsequent to the assessment completion, external audit quality has been improved by
adding a cosignatory from a larger office of the audit firm, and the data reporting process was
modified as recommended. The authorities are working to address remaining vulnerabilities in the
internal audit function, but have not yet established an audit committee.
Exchange Rate Arrangement: On July 1, 1992 the Albanian authorities adopted a floating
exchange rate system. The de jure exchange rate system is classified as free floating, but the de
facto exchange rate arrangement is floating, with the monetary authorities occasionally intervening
in the foreign exchange market in order to avoid excessive and short-term disruptions in the
functioning of the market and to accumulate reserves. The country still avails itself of the transitional
arrangements under Article XIV and maintains an exchange restriction in the form of outstanding
debit balances on inoperative bilateral payment agreements, which were in place before Albania
became a Fund member. These relate primarily to debt in nonconvertible and formerly
nonconvertible currencies. Albania maintains two further exchange restrictions inconsistent with
Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3 under the IMF’s Articles: (i) an exchange restriction arising from the
requirement for residents and nonresidents to submit a tax certificate that they do not owe any
outstanding taxes prior to transferring foreign exchange for certain current transactions including
the payment of moderate amounts for amortization of loans, the payment of certain insurance
premium, and the transfer of profits and dividends from investments in Albania; and (ii) an exchange
restriction arising from the requirement to provide customs clearance documents in respect of
advance import payments prior to making payments for unrelated foreign exchange transactions.
The exchange rate stood at lek 103.17 per U.S. dollar on November 30, 2013.
Article IV Consultation: The 2012 Article IV consultation was concluded on December 3, 2012 (IMF
Country Report No. 13/7).
FSAP Participation and ROSCs: The most recent FSAP was carried out in November 2013 (Board
date February 28, 2014). A data module ROSC was published on the Fund’s website in June 2000. A
fiscal ROSC was completed in June 2003. Albania participates in the General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS), and a complete set of GDDS metadata for the external, financial, fiscal, and real
sectors, as well as for the socio-demographic indicators is posted on the Fund’s Dissemination
Standards Bulletin Board (http://dsbb.imf.org). A data module ROSC reassessment using the Data
Quality Assessment Framework was conducted in March 2006. A ROSC for assessing the Financial
Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Special
Recommendations on Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) was conducted in November
2010 and the report was published in July 2011.

WORLD BANK GROUP RELATIONS
The Republic of Albania has been a member of the World Bank since 1991. Since then, the WBG
has provided strong support to Albania, including 72 IDA, IBRD and GEF projects in different sectors
totaling US $1.4 billion, IFC investments of US$621 million, and MIGA guarantees totaling
US$8.6 million. The quality of the active portfolio has continued to improve, with an increasing focus
on long-term capacity development and implementation through Government structures.
The National Strategy for Development and Integration (NSDI) for 2007-2013 outlined the
Government’s economic and social development program. The strategic goals of the NSDI were:
(i) integration to the European Union (EU), strengthening the rule of law and democratization; and
(iii) achieving rapid and sustainable economic and social development. The authorities have made
progress towards the NSDI goals. First, Albania joined NATO in 2008 and submitted its application
for EU membership in 2009. In November 2010, the European Commission found out that
“negotiations for accession to the EU should be opened with Albania once the country has achieved
the necessary degree of compliance with the membership criteria.” Second, its GDP growth
continued throughout the global financial crisis, while poverty continued to decline. However,
despite adopting some business environment reforms, Albania declined in its overall ranking on the
World Bank’s 2014 Doing Business (DB) Indicators to the 90th position.
The new Government, which took office in September 2013, is in the process of revising the
draft National Strategy for Development and Integration (NSDI) for 2014–2020. The Strategy
for 2014–2020 is expected to be finalized by September 2014. The current draft, which is undergoing
a consultative process, has three broad pillars or overarching goals: (i) to prepare Albania to become
a full member of the European Union; (ii) to foster strong and sustained economic growth; and
(iii) to transform growth and enhanced wealth into improved well-being for all citizens in a fair and
cohesive society. These broad goals are to be advanced through measures in four key areas: (i) good
governance, democracy and rule of law; (ii) growth through fiscal stability and increased
competitiveness, forming Pillar I; (iii) sustainable growth through efficient use of resources, forming
Pillar II; and (iii) investing in people and social cohesion, forming Pillar III.
The current Bank Group Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for 2011–14 supports the
Government’s National Strategy for Development and Integration by focusing on three
strategic objectives: (i) supporting Albania’s economic recovery and growth in a crisis-affected
Europe; (ii) broadening and sustaining Albania’s social gains; and (iii) reducing vulnerability to
climate change and natural disasters. The CPS program also supports governance improvements in
Albania and the EU integration agenda. It focuses on accelerating the implementation of the
ongoing program, while selectively introducing new IBRD lending in strategic areas, increasing IFC
financing for the private sector to US$120–150 million, strengthening partnerships with other IFIs
and donors, and expanding its knowledge program through regional and national activities. As part
of its initiative to help several countries in Central, East, and South East Europe mitigate the impacts
of the Eurozone crisis, the IBRD has increased the financing envelope available to Albania under the
CPS, initially set at around US$300 million, to US$575 million, mainly for strengthening financial

stability, macroeconomic management, and growth. The Progress Report has been prepared
reconfirming CPS priorities, with an increased focus on supporting growth, competitiveness, and
energy sector development.
The 2010 CAS proposed a lending range of US$ 75–US$ 196 million, with actual lending to
have been determined by the pace of reform in key sectors. The current portfolio consists of five
projects totaling US$200 million in IDA credits and IBRD loans. The portfolio has been consolidating
significantly in the past few years, from 18 projects at the end of FY09 to five projects by FY13.
Portfolio performance as measured by disbursement improved in FY11, with 22 percent, and FY12
with 24 percent, but it was 17 percent in FY13, partly because of some new projects and also
because of deteriorating macro-fiscal performance, forcing the Government to cut expenditure even
under IFI financing and leading to arrears under several projects. In order to improve performance, a
number of steps taken in collaboration with the Government to simplify and streamline the
portfolio, restructure problem projects, and introduce regular portfolio performance reviews have
produced results.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
ALBANIA—STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
(As of January 31, 2014)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. The main obstacles are
in real sector statistics.
National Accounts: The weaknesses in national accounts are mainly due to poor source data. While technical
assistance has been provided on methodological procedures, source data still do not provide sufficient
information to compile reliable estimates, especially on the unobserved economy. The long lag in handling certain
source data, e.g., the Structural Business Survey (SBS), also hampers the timeliness of annual GDP publication,
which is currently around 13 months after the year. INSTAT is considering adopting partial electronic survey
reporting, which can potentially shorten the processing time for the SBS, but would require considerable
resources. Quality and timeliness of national accounts can also be improved by better inter-government agency
data sharing of administrative data. But without speeding up source data processing, timeliness of GDP
publication is not likely to improve in the short run.
INSTAT has benefited from technical assistance from the Fund and the European Union, mainly to address
weaknesses in methodology, basic data sources, and coverage of the private sector. The Labor Force Survey was
incorporated into the estimates of the unobserved economy in the annual national accounts while attempts were
made to use the Household Budget Survey to develop a new benchmark estimate of private consumption. A new
methodology for gross fixed capital formation based on a commodity flow approach was developed. Due to
severe resource constraints at INSTAT, the improvement in the national accounts has been relatively slow.
INSTAT is currently working on adopting the ESA95 methodology. The revised methodology for GDP compilation
will, among other things, render more comprehensive coverage of the informal economy. INSTAT plans to revised
annual GDP numbers for 2008–2011 using the new methodology in Q2:2014.
The quarterly GDP is published with a lag of over 90 days, using the so-called indirect method based on selected
indicators and certain statistical assumptions. Due to differences in compilation methods, there are large
discrepancies between the aggregated quarterly GDPs and the annual GDP estimates.
Labor statistics: The quality of Labor Force Survey (LFS) is of insufficient quality, which in turn affects the quality
of employment/unemployment data. Remote areas are under surveyed due to resource constraints. The treatment
of agricultural employment needs to improve, as currently all individuals that own agricultural land is considered
self-employed by the survey. Various short-comings in LFS lead to the lack of variation in the
employment/unemployment data.
Price statistics: Compilation generally follows international standards, and the estimation of imputed rent within
the CPI was improved in 2003. In December 2007, INSTAT updated the CPI weights using the results of a new
national-level HBS conducted during the period October 2006–September 2007. PPI has been published only
quarterly due to financial constraints. The weights were derived from the Structural Business Survey of two years
before.
Government finance statistics: Fiscal source data is sufficiently adequate to allow a broad presentation of the
Albanian general government’s fiscal operations in line with to the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001
(GFSM 2001) framework. Transitioning to the GFSM 2001 fiscal presentation does not appear to substantially
change the overall picture (Appendix Table 1). However, transitioning also necessities further improvements in the

10

alignment of the fiscal statistics, above all by (i) providing greater detail on some of accounts (such as National
Taxes, Income of Budgetary Institutions, Property Compensation, and Compensation for Electricity); (ii) reporting
transactions of Albania’s local governments in a separate statement instead of with the general government;
(iii) breaking down the Net Acquisition of Nonfinancial assets (labeled as Capital Expenditure in the local
presentation) into the GFSM 2001 subcategories (i.e., fixed assets, inventories, valuables, and nonproduced assets);
and (iv) breaking down the financing section into net acquisition of financial assets and net acquisition of liabilities
(and their respective instruments).
Monetary statistics: The monetary data compilation framework conforms to the methodology recommended in
the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM) 2000. The depository corporations’ survey covers the Bank of
Albania (BoA) and all the other deposit-taking institutions (commercial banks and savings and loans associations
(SLAs)). The accounts of the SLAs, with the exception of loans, are produced on a cash basis, which contrasts with
the MFSM’s recommendations of accrual accounting. Another deviation from the MFSM’s methodology is that the
BoA’s and commercial banks’ holdings of nontradable long-term securities are recorded at book value.
External sector statistics: The Balance of payments data is compiled by the BoA with a time lag of less than
90 days, and is methodologically sound, though some of the estimates, particularly for international transactions
outside the banking system, need to be refined. Problems remain in the areas of service transactions and
remittances, and in the monitoring of financial account transactions, foreign assistance (grants from abroad to
regional and local governments are underreported), and external debt.
The estimation methods for transactions outside the banking system (mostly remittances and investment
transactions by nonresident Albanians) require further improvement, though this is arguably a less concern going
forward as remittances are more and more channeled through the banking system. The BoA will conduct a
household survey in 2014 to improve the accuracy of remittance estimates.
The external debt database ensures timely and accurate reporting of external government debt (including
commitments of state-owned enterprises). The collection of data on external grants (EG) is not timely and only
covers the central government. The BoA is working on revising the EG numbers.
The International Investment Position (IIP) data is compiled annually by the BoA, which plans to shorten the
timeliness of publication—currently 15 months after the year—to 9 months in 2014.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Albania
February 28, 2014

1.
This statement provides information that has become available since the issuance of
the Staff Report. The information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Preliminary data for 2013 indicate that the fiscal deficit was 4.8 percent of GDP,
compared to 6.2 percent of GDP in the staff report (Table 1). The improved performance was
primarily the result of lower than expected capital expenditure (foreign–financed). Tax revenues
were higher than envisaged, particularly VAT. Without a clear sign of a pickup in economic
activity, the improved revenue collection is likely to have been from better administration—
following resolution of uncertainty associated with elections and change of government. The
good revenue performance was partially offset by lower than expected nontax revenues and
grants.
3.
Credit to the economy declined by 2.6 percent in November (y-o-y), unchanged from
September. The profitability of the banking system remains weak, but provisioning has
increased slightly relative to September. Financial soundness data for November indicate that the
NPL ratio was unchanged at 24.2 percent of gross loans, the same level as in September. The
nominal stock of NPLs fell slightly on a month-on-month basis.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 28, 2014

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Approves €330.9 Million Extended Arrangement for Albania
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved a 36-month
SDR 295.42 million (about €330.9 million, or about US$457.1 million; 492.4 percent of
country’s quota in the Fund) arrangement under the Extended-Fund Facility (EFF) for
Albania in support of the authorities’ reform program. The approval allows for immediate
disbursement of SDR 23.55 million (about €26.4 million, or about US$36.4 million). The
World Bank and the EU are also likely to provide assistance to the authorities’ reform
program.
Following the Executive Board’s discussion on Albania, Mr. David Lipton, First Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:
“Albania’s economic outlook is expected to improve in 2014, spurred by the planned
reduction of underlying risks in the fiscal area, clearance of arrears, tackling of high
nonperforming loans (NPLs), and the launch of structural reforms. However, risks are
significant and refinancing needs are large. The EFF will help Albania meet its external
financing needs while providing the necessary support to strengthen fiscal and debt
sustainability, lower public financing risks, and put the economy on a sustained medium-term
growth path.
“Albania’s high public indebtedness calls for fiscal consolidation that aims to lower the
public debt ratio to below 60 percent of GDP in the medium term. This will require
significant tax and expenditure policy measures, supported by extensive public financial
management and tax administration reforms. Lowering the outstanding stock of arrears and
putting in place mechanisms to prevent their recurrence will also be critical.
“Further moderate easing of monetary policy could help to support economic recovery,
provided inflation expectations and financial stability remain well anchored. However, this
would need to be carefully balanced against risks posed by high unhedged foreign currency
exposure.

2

“Preserving financial stability while promoting access to credit is necessary to facilitate a
durable recovery. Reducing NPLs will safeguard financial stability and may help release
credit supply constraints by lowering bank risk aversion. Steadfast implementation of the
recent Financial Sector Assessment Program recommendations, including those related to
lowering risks in the non-bank financial sector, will be important.
“The authorities’ plans to reform pensions, energy, local government finances, public
administration, and the business environment are welcome. If implemented properly, these
reforms should strengthen Albania’s ability to attract investment, improve prospects for
sustained medium-term growth, and reduce fiscal risks, Mr. Lipton stated.”

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Albania
On February 28, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the 2013 Article IV Consultation with Albania.1
Albania successfully avoided recession in the aftermath of the global crisis and suffered a
milder growth shock than neighboring countries. Recently, however, the economy has shown
signs of protracted weakness and macroeconomic imbalances have widened.
Weak investor confidence, bank risk aversion, as well as incomplete investment climate
reforms, have amplified the slowdown. Real GDP growth is expected to decline to
0.7 percent in 2013, the lowest in more than a decade. Inflation has remained low, largely
within the central bank’s 2–4 percent target range, reflecting the negative output gap. The
external current account deficit has begun to adjust on account of oil exports and import
compression, but weak external drivers are preventing a sustained reduction.
The fiscal position deteriorated significantly in 2013. Public debt and financing needs—
among the highest in the Central, Eastern and Southeastern European region—have risen
because of fiscal loosening prior to the 2013 elections, the accumulation of significant unpaid
bills and arrears, and the weak economy. Fiscal deficits have been driven up also by
structural factors, with pensions exerting a heavy fiscal burden.
The banking system has been resilient to eurozone stress so far, largely because it relies
almost exclusively on domestic deposits. Banks’ strong solvency ratios and stringent
provisioning rules have also contributed to banking system stability. Nevertheless, nonperforming loans (NPLs) have increased considerably, further constraining credit growth and
putting pressure on bank profitability.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

The authorities have requested IMF’s financial assistance in support of their program to
boost growth and support macroeconomic stability. The program seeks to: i) reverse the
upward trend in public debt and lay the ground for its sustained reduction; ii) restore banks’
confidence in lending by bringing down NPLs and; iii) ease constraints on growth by
undertaking ambitious structural reforms, including in the areas of pensions, energy, public
administration, and the business environment. The program will be supported by an IMF
arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (see Press Release No. 14/81).
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their adoption of a package of measures
to restore fiscal sustainability, safeguard financial stability, and improve the investment
climate, which will be critical for reviving the economy and allowing sustained medium-term
growth. Noting the significant risks from underlying imbalances, they looked forward to
strong and lasting commitment to the program.
Directors stressed that given Albania’s high debt, fiscal consolidation should aim to lower the
public debt ratio to below 60 percent of GDP in the medium term. Achieving this objective
requires significant further tax and expenditure policy measures, supplementing the steps
taken in late 2013 and in the 2014 budget, supported by extensive public financial
management and tax administration reforms. Adopting a medium-term budget framework or
fiscal rule would anchor the commitment to the debt target. Directors generally agreed that
the burden of fiscal adjustment should fall primarily on revenues, given the country’s
development needs and the low share of revenues in GDP. Pension and energy reforms
should form a key part of medium–term adjustment. Reducing the outstanding stock of
arrears and putting in place mechanisms to prevent their recurrence is critical for fiscal
sustainability and restoring confidence. At the same time, Directors underscored the
importance of proceeding cautiously with payments and employing an external auditor
promptly to begin conducting ex post risk-based audits.
Directors commended the authorities for maintaining low inflation under the
inflation-targeting framework. Most Directors saw scope for moderate monetary policy
easing to support economic recovery, provided inflation expectations and financial stability
remain well anchored. Nevertheless, they stressed the need for a cautious approach, given
that further easing could increase the risks posed by high unhedged foreign currency
exposure, while its effectiveness could be limited by sluggish credit demand and bank risk
aversion. Directors also encouraged the removal of exchange restrictions as soon as possible.
Directors underscored the importance of continued vigilance to maintain financial stability.
They encouraged prompt and comprehensive action to address rising non-performing loans

to help boost bank profitability and credit growth, including through removing impediments
to collateral execution and loan restructuring, and clearing arrears. Strengthening the
regulation and supervision of the nonbank financial system, in line with recommendations
from the recent Financial Sector Assessment Program, will help alleviate systemic risks.
Directors stressed that embarking on a path of sustained medium-term growth hinges on the
implementation of ambitious structural reforms. Planned reforms include pensions, energy,
local government, public administration, and measures to improve the business environment.
If implemented properly, these reforms should strengthen Albania’s ability to attract
investment, reduce fiscal risks, and strengthen debt sustainability.

Statement by Mr. Andrea Montanino, Executive Director for Albania
and Marco Senatore, Advisor to Executive Director
February 28, 2014

On behalf of the Albanian authorities, we thank staff for their helpful and constructive
cooperation during the missions to Tirana and for the informative documents which have
been prepared.
The Article IV and FSAP missions, together with the negotiation for the proposed three –
year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program, have provided valuable insight to the
authorities in the pursuit of their macroeconomic objectives.
In the current juncture, Albania has the chance to improve significantly its
macroeconomic environment, and, to this aim, the country is pursuing a path of wideranging reforms that are expected to contribute to economic recovery and to the reduction
of arrears and nonperforming loans (NPLs).
The Albanian authorities assign the highest importance to such reforms and to the
cooperation with the Fund which is needed to successfully pursue them.
Request for an Extended Arrangement under the EFF
The proposed three-year program under the EFF has been requested by the Albanian
authorities on the basis of the estimated external financing need, amounting to about 7.1
percent of GDP in 2014-16. With the support of the program, the authorities will
undertake initiatives aimed at significantly reducing public debt, bringing down NPLs in
order to restore banks’ confidence in lending and introducing structural reforms to
promote long-term growth, while at the same time achieving a gradual fiscal adjustment.
As for the modality chosen for the program, direct budget support, it is to be recalled that,
while in the current juncture domestic markets could not finance the fiscal deficit without
significant risks, on the other hand external financing of the budget may be catalyzed
only after the involvement of the IMF, as the country has limited access to international
capital markets.
The agreement, which foresees access to Fund resources, will increase confidence in the
economy and ease the impact of the fiscal adjustment required.
The authorities are aware of the risks linked with the program, but they are also
committed to putting the Albanian economy on a path of sustained medium term growth,
by increasing private sector credit, strengthening public finances, reforming the energy
sector and improving the business climate.
Economic developments and outlook
In the last few years economic growth in Albania has continued to slow down, and for
2013 it is estimated to have reached 0.7 percent, the lowest level since 1997. This is the
result of weak domestic demand, which in turn is dependent on weak confidence in the
business and household sectors.

2
The gradual decline in the current account deficit (estimated at 9 percent of GDP in 2013),
has been linked most of all with the good performance of exports and with the reduction
of imports. The positive financial account received a significant contribution from direct
investments, which have remained stable, at around 8 percent of GDP. In the last ten
years, external debt has almost doubled, and it could reach about 43 percent of GDP in
2014, before declining in the following years.
For 2014, a significant contribution to growth should come from the initiatives aimed at
reducing NPLs and clearing arrears, as well as from improved confidence. For the next
years, the Albanian authorities are committed to wide-ranging reforms which, with the
support of the EFF program, will significantly contribute to sustained growth.
Fiscal policy
In the past few years the public debt to GDP ratio in Albania has significantly increased,
from about 60 percent in 2009 to about 71 percent in 2013. Such figure, which represents
a historical peak, includes unpaid bills and government arrears (about 5 percent of GDP)
linked with contracts signed by the Public Administration. Moreover, the estimated
deficit for 2013 is of 4.8 percent of GDP.
In the current juncture, on one hand, domestic financial markets would be too much
stressed by the volume of bond issuance which would be required to significantly reduce
arrears. On the other hand, arrears represent a significant obstacle for economic growth,
as they generate NPLs and constrain credit dynamics.
Against this backdrop, a significant part of the measures envisaged by the proposed EFF
program is aimed at clearing arrears, in order to provide liquidity to the real sector. In this
regard, a comprehensive arrears prevention and clearance strategy (APCS) has been
published on the website of the Ministry of Finance (MoF). Moreover, an amended Law
for Payment of Arrears on Contractual Obligations has been submitted to Parliament to
define expenditure arrears and payment terms. An external auditor will be contracted to
conduct risk-based audits of arrears payments.
The authorities are also committed to monitoring future expenditure commitments and
avoiding arrears accumulation. For instance, all new procurement orders will be sent to
the MoF for clearance prior to starting the biding process. Moreover, the reporting and
approval procedures for procurement orders will be enhanced, especially for multi-year
commitments. To this aim, MoF has already issued budget instructions to all central
government entities to report all proposed new procurement orders for MoF clearance,
and suspend issuing any new multi-year procurement orders until outer-year commitment
ceilings are approved by the Council of Ministers.
The authorities also plan to start introducing commitment limits with the 2015 budget.
At a more general level, the authorities are committed to fiscal consolidation, in order to
reduce the debt ratio to 69 percent of GDP by the end of the proposed EFF program in
2016 and to well below 60 percent by 2019. Moreover, the fiscal deficit target for 2014 is
about 4 percent of GDP, excluding the repayment of arrears.

3
To this aim, the 2014 budget envisages increases in the corporate income tax (CIT) rate,
(from 10 to 15 percent), in excise tax rates, in fuel tax and property tax rates. On the
spending side, there will be, with the exception of police officers, no increase in public
sector salaries in 2014. Moreover, pension increases to cost of living adjustments will be
limited. The authorities will also ease the burden of fiscal adjustment on small businesses
and vulnerable groups, introducing a progressive income tax and reducing the rate for the
simple tax on profit for small businesses to half the corporate tax rate.
Tax administration (an area where the Fund has provided technical assistance to the
authorities) will be improved, as a foreign consultant will assist customs in tax collection.
Moreover, management committees for taxpayer compliance have been established to
guide decision making of the tax administration.
Some initiatives are also envisaged to reduce fraud, for instance by verifying more
efficiently refund claims and, in 2015, changing the verification process to link it directly
to businesses’ online tax payment records.
In the medium term, a pension reform will be adopted. To this aim, a Reform
Commission will be established by the end of next March and will present a mediumterm strategy to Council of Ministers for approval by December 2014.
Monetary policy
The monetary policy of the Bank of Albania (BoA) has managed to keep inflation low
and relatively stable. At the same time, the impact of macroprudential measures has been
low or marginal in boosting credit growth. According to the authorities, the monetary
stance could be moderately expansive, taking into account the low inflation and weak
demand, but they will try to avoid excessive strains in financial stability.
The BoA will improve its operational framework in order to increase the efficiency of the
transmission mechanism and to promote the development of money markets.
The BoA will also continue to enhance its communication strategy.
Financial sector
The BoA is fully committed to implementing the FSAP recommendations, and to using
the assessment as a guideline for the action plan to advance the level of supervisory
standards towards the best practices, considering that this is also the best contribution to
its mandate of guaranteeing the banking and financial stability.
The banking sector is well-capitalized and liquid. Branches of foreign banks do not
depend on parent funding, as they are fully funded by domestic deposits. Moreover, a
number of measures will be aimed at reducing the level of NPLs, which is relatively high.
In particular, a legal amendment of the Tax Law has already been submitted to
Parliament to remove issues which impede the loan write-offs from banks’ balance sheets.
Moreover, the regulatory framework to strengthen credit standards will be improved. The
Civil Code and other laws will also be amended to improve insolvency requirements, set
the payment to bailiffs in line with success rate and restrict judicial discretion in

4
postponing borrowers’ payments. A contribution to the reduction of NPLs will also come
from arrears clearance.
Moreover, the BoA will further improve its macro-prudential framework. The regulatory
framework for the nonbank financial sector will also be strengthened, by improving the
operational and financial independence of the Albanian Financial Supervisory Authority
(AFSA). The regulatory framework for investment funds will be revised to introduce
liquidity and capital requirements and require the calculation of net asset value to be done
on a mark to market basis.
Structural reforms
Lack of reforms, as observed by staff, has negatively affected the growth potential of
Albania. Against this backdrop, the authorities are committed to undertaking
interventions in several areas.
Measures aimed at improving the business climate will include an assessment of the
regulatory framework for business and a reform of business registration procedures in
order to improve transparency and reduce the time spent by the businesses in this area.
In the energy sector, a Task Force will develop a medium-term strategy, in cooperation
with the World Bank. By the first quarter of 2014 a plan will be designed to increase
billing in the regions where there is a greater percentage of informal sectors. The Task
Force and the Ministry of Energy will also develop a plan aimed at sorting out intercompany debt accumulated in the energy sector. By the first half of 2014 the tariff system
will be reviewed to bring prices closer to the market prices.
For the agricultural sector, a land reform will strengthen property rights, distributing 70
percent of land titles by 2015. Moreover, the irrigation infrastructure and food safety will
be improved by the Rural Development and Water administration, through capacity
building.
Another area of intervention will be social protection, where a TA project with the World
Bank will modernize the social assistance scheme. A new database should also be
introduced by April 2014, in order to allow exchange of information on individuals
among different government agencies.
In Public Administration, the authorities are committed to using meritocratic criteria in
hiring new employees, in compliance with the new Civil Service Law.
The authorities will also increase investment in early child education, launch a review of
the professional education system and establish apprentice arrangements with companies.
A review of the legal framework will be launched in order to address the issues identified
by the European Commission with a view to future integration with the EU.
Finally, statistics will be improved through better inter-agency data sharing.
Conclusion
All in all, my Albanian authorities believe that the combination of deep structural reforms,
coupled with gradual fiscal consolidation, will set the stage for a return of the Albanian

5
economy to sustainable growth, and request the Board’s support of their ambitious
program under the EFF.
