STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
November 14, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context. Macroeconomic stability has been maintained and policies are broadly in line with the
recommendations of the 2012 Article IV consultation. Growth is expected to slow somewhat,
reflecting in part lower coffee production and slowdown in construction. Inflation expectations
are anchored by the crawling peg and core inflation remains stable. The external current account
deficit has remained large, while international reserves coverage of imports has been broadly
adequate. Bank credit to the private sector increased rapidly over the past year and may pose
risks. The Board discussion of the 2012 Article IV took place in June 2012.
Outlook and Risks. Under current policies, growth is expected to decline from about 5.2 percent
in 2012 to 4.2 percent in 2013; inflation is projected to pick up marginally to about 7 percent by
end-2013. Large external current account deficits with associated financing needs and high
external debt will keep vulnerabilities relatively high. Risks to the outlook stem from slower than
expected economic recovery in the United States and Europe, higher oil prices, and
unexpected changes to the oil collaboration scheme with Venezuela.
Policy recommendations. Sustained implementation of prudent macroeconomic policies has
strengthened the economy’s resilience to risks but large external and fiscal vulnerabilities remain.
The authorities’ fiscal strategy is to keep deficits low and to lower public debt ratios over the
medium term which will require protecting revenues, reforming the social security system to
ensure its long-term financial viability, containing current spending, and rationalizing subsidies to
electricity and other economic sectors. Economic collaboration with Venezuela, while beneficial,
has generated dependency on financing that could pose risks to external stability, and needs to
be made more transparent.
Authorities’ views. The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment of near-term risks and
the need to reduce fiscal and external vulnerabilities. In particular, there was agreement on the
need to continue prudent fiscal policy and lower public debt ratios to gain fiscal space, and to
further increase transparency of public sector operations. The authorities also concurred with the
assessment that rapid credit growth might pose risks and required monitoring. They welcomed
close cooperation with the Fund and its role as a trusted advisor.

BACKGROUND
1.
Since the global financial crisis Nicaragua has made significant progress toward
restoring sustainable growth, consolidating the fiscal position, and keeping inflation under
control. This achievement was largely due to sustaining prudent policies in the context of the global
financial crisis, commodity price shocks, and natural disasters. However, with the second lowest per
capita income in the Western Hemisphere and poor other social indicators Nicaragua is facing
formidable challenges of achieving higher growth to reduce poverty while addressing fiscal and
external vulnerabilities.
2.
Prudent policies implemented during 2012-13 have contributed to strengthening
macroeconomic stability. Following the conclusion of the ECF arrangement with the Fund in 2011,
policies have continued to support macroeconomic stability and are in line with the
recommendations of the 2012 Article IV consultation (Box 1).1 Over the past two years, real GDP
growth has been stronger and inflation and external current account deficits lower than previously
envisaged, a tax reform was implemented in December 2012, and progress has been made in
strengthening the electricity sector which had been as source of fiscal vulnerability and a significant
impediment to growth.
3.
The government’s medium-term economic strategy aims at achieving equitable
growth, financial stability, and poverty reduction.2 To achieve these objectives, the strategy
seeks to balance an ambitious investment and social spending agenda and fiscal sustainability. In
addition, the government plans to reduce fiscal and external vulnerabilities by lowering the public
debt ratios and lessening dependence on oil imports. The government’s policy agenda includes
reforms in the fiscal, social, and electricity sectors. The political cycle (general elections in 2016)
provides space to implement new structural reforms and the government has stressed its
commitment to seek consensus in key areas through broad consultations.
4.
Planned large investment projects have the potential to boost growth. Changes in
government policies and to the regulatory framework in recent years have helped attract private
investments in wind, geothermal, and biomass electricity generation, thereby largely eliminating
blackouts and improving the system's stability. New energy projects expected to be completed by
2018 would further boost electricity production without significantly increasing oil imports. In
addition, the government has signed a concession with a foreign private investor for an interoceanic canal. The value of the project is tentatively estimated at nearly 4 times the 2012 GDP.

Feasibility studies, undertaken by reputable international firms, are expected to be completed in
2014, and the costs of the project are expected to be incurred by the foreign investor.3
5.
Improvements to national accounts methodology and data resulted in an upward
adjustment of nominal GDP of about 30 percent (Box 2). Per capital GDP for 2012 is now
estimated at US$1,762 (US$1,313 before the change). The revision, supported by technical assistance
from CAPTAC-DR, uses improved source surveys and statistical procedures and a new base year
(2006) to calculate GDP. As a result, fiscal and external sector ratios to GDP are significantly lower
than reported in the 2012 Article IV consultation report.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
A. Recent Economic Developments
6.
Recent macroeconomic performance has been favorable. After growing 5.2 percent in
2012, real GDP increased by 5 percent in the first half of 2013, as a result of a good basic grain
harvest and a robust performance in the maquila sector, notwithstanding a decline in coffee
production affected by leaf rust and a slowdown in private construction. Headline inflation increased
to 7.4 percent (yoy) in September 2013, boosted by food, housing, and transport prices, but core
inflation remained subdued at 5.9 percent.
7.
While fiscal deficits remain small, the policy stance has turned expansionary. After
having reached a balanced budget in 2011, the combined public sector recorded a deficit of
0.7 percent of GDP in 2012. The deficit is expected to widen to 1.4 percent of GDP in 2013 largely on
account of rising capital expenditure in public enterprises despite a robust growth in revenues,
particularly from the income tax. Nevertheless, the public debt ratio is projected to continue to
decline, to about 42 percent of GDP in 2013 (from 45 percent of GDP in 2011).
8.
Bank credit to the private sector increased rapidly, while key financial indicators
appear relatively strong. By August 2013, domestic credit increased by about 23 percent (yoy),
following an annual increase of 26 percent in 2012. Credit expansion was particularly strong in the
consumer sector (43 percent). Deposits increased by nearly 10 percent. The capital adequacy ratio of
the Nicaragua’s banking system was 13 percent as of August 2013, above the regulatory norm
(10 percent) but significantly below its peak of 2010 (16.6 percent).
9.
The external position remains vulnerable. The current account deficit for 2011–13 is
estimated to be around 13 percent of GDP, while the external private and public debt is projected to
be about 74 percent of GDP at end-2013. In the first half of 2013, trade balance was broadly
unchanged from the corresponding level of 2012 as maquila net exports increased by 6.5 percent
3

Owing to the uncertainties at this stage, the potential impact of the canal project has not been incorporated in
staff’s projection.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

while other trade flows declined mostly due to lower prices for gold and coffee and lower imports
for power plant investments. By August 2013, remittances increased by 7.3 percent (yoy). As of endOctober 2013, gross international reserves stood at US$1.9 billion, or equivalent to 3½ months of
imports, broadly unchanged from end-2012.
10.
Further progress was made in structural reforms. The tax reform approved in December
2012 features the elimination of VAT exemptions on some items consumed by higher income
households, changes in the personal income tax thresholds, and a plan for further rationalization of
tax exemptions over the medium term. The revenue impact in 2013 is estimated at 0.2 percent of
GDP. In April 2013, electricity tariffs were increased by 12.8 percent thereby narrowing the gap
between indicative (reflecting changes in international oil prices) and actual tariffs to 3 percent. In
addition, changes to the regulatory framework enabled anti-theft measures to be strengthened.
Both measures are expected to help stabilize the financial position of the electricity distribution
company.

B. Outlook and Risks
11.
Under current policies and the baseline scenario about external conditions, near- and
medium-term outlook remain broadly favorable (Table 10). In such scenario, growth is
projected to decline to 4.2 percent in 2013 (from 5.2 percent in 2012), and then converge to its
long-term trend of 4 percent. Inflation would increase to 6.9 percent by end-2013 (compared to
6.6 percent at end-2012), consistent with the 5 percent rate of crawl of the exchange rate and
international prices. The external current account deficit is projected to widen marginally to
13.2 percent of GDP in 2013, and then contract to about 11 percent of GDP over the medium term.
The risks to the outlook are on the downside and stem mostly from slower than expected economic
recovery in the United States and Europe and higher oil prices. Unanticipated changes to terms or
levels in the oil collaboration scheme with Venezuela could generate additional pressures on the
external position.

Policy Advice

12.
The authorities agreed with staff’s assessment of the near-term outlook and the need
to address significant fiscal and external vulnerabilities. There was broad agreement that
prudent fiscal policies needed to be sustained to reduce vulnerabilities, in particular if the

government had to absorb various subsidies currently covered by oil collaboration with Venezuela
and channeled to the private sector. The authorities recognized that large external current account
deficits would remain a key source of vulnerability over the medium term. This reflects both a high
oil import dependency (12 percent of GDP) that can be only gradually reduced over time, as well as
the associated reliance on financing from Venezuela. However, the authorities were confident that
external inflows, including FDI and from official sources, as well as the oil collaboration scheme with
Venezuela, were sufficiently stable to help finance those deficits and maintain adequate
international reserves buffers. They concurred with staff assessment that high dollarization and
recent rapid increase in private credit could also pose risks.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
13.
The consultation discussions focused on policies aimed at maintaining macroeconomic
stability, reducing vulnerabilities, and creating conditions for higher growth. The staff team
welcomed the authorities’ medium-term strategy which sought to establish foundations for
sustainable growth while maintaining macroeconomic stability. Staff agreed that the strategy
appropriately targets further lowering of public debt ratios, reducing oil import dependency and
protecting the external position to reduce the economy’s vulnerabilities. The authorities and staff
recognized that to boost economic growth over the long term and significantly raise living
standards would require substantial investments in infrastructure and improvements in the
education system to achieve sustainable increases in productivity.

A.

Fiscal Policies

14.
The authorities and staff agreed that the present policy stance is broadly appropriate.
As output gap is closing, no policy change was needed for 2014 and maintaining the present deficit
level was consistent with a further lowering of public debt ratios over the medium term that would
help fiscal sustainability. Accordingly, the draft 2014 budget submitted to the national assembly in
October features revenues rising as a ratio of GDP and the deficit of the combined public sector
broadly unchanged (1.2 percent of GDP). The authorities stressed that in line with their commitment
to fiscal discipline the budget would begin incorporating in 2014 the wage bonus (0.4 percent of
GDP), which until 2013 had been funded with grants provided by a private sector entity (CARUNA)
from resources originating from oil collaboration with Venezuela, without increasing the deficits by
restraining other current expenditure and taking advantage of higher tax revenues.4
15.
The authorities’ strategy aims at strengthening fiscal sustainability and increasing the
fiscal space. To strengthen fiscal sustainability over the medium-term, the combined public sector
deficits need to remain at about 1-1 ½ percent of GDP, thereby reducing the public debt ratios,
consistent with the recommendations arising from the Debt Sustainability Analysis. To this end, it is

necessary to strengthen revenue performance, reform the pension system, and rationalize
expenditures. To raise public sector revenues as a ratio of GDP, the authorities intend to fully
implement the tax reform approved in December 2012 which eliminated various exemptions and
included measures to improve tax administration. On the expenditure side, staff and authorities
agreed that it would be critical to implement a reform of the pension system along the lines of the
proposal submitted for consultation with key stakeholders last October. The key proposed changes
included step increases in employers’ contributions and some modification of benefits eligibility so
as to ensure the system’s financial viability over the next 15 years. The reform would also
incorporate a new program of reduced pensions for people who are at the retirement age and have
contributed to the system but have not yet met all eligibility criteria, and a resolution of government
debt to the social security system. In addition, electricity and other subsidies need to be rationalized
through better targeting and the financial position of public enterprises strengthened to avoid
incurring intra-sector arrears and reduce the vulnerability of the budget. The authorities agreed on
the need to review the system of energy and other subsidies and indicated that the key law on
electricity subsidies needed to be updated by 2015.
16.
Staff supported the authorities’ intention to continue increasing transparency of
public sector operations. The staff team recognized that economic cooperation with Venezuela
had benefited Nicaragua, contributing to higher growth, easing external financing constraints, and
boosting social development, but noted that these ties are opaque (Box 3) and subject to risk of
political and economic developments in Venezuela. The flow of financing (about 7¼ percent of GDP
in 2012) is managed through a private entity in Nicaragua and the stock of associated debt reached
21 percent of GDP at end-2012. Staff welcomed the increase in the electricity tariffs earlier this year
which will help strengthen the financial position of the distribution company. However, staff also
argued in favor of more transparency in energy subsidies which are currently provided through a
system of VAT refunds as well as extra-budgetary channels under the cooperation with Venezuela.
The authorities welcomed staff recommendations and committed to continue expanding the
provision of information on international cooperation.

B.

Monetary and External Sector Policies

17.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ commitment to increase international reserves and
keep inflation under control. Given Nicaragua's highly dollarized system and the rigidity of the
exchange regime, monetary policy appropriately focuses on the external position, and the central
bank’s operations are anchored by its objectives for the stock of international reserves. Staff
supported the authorities’ objective to increase gross international reserve and maintain them at
above the equivalent of three months of imports, which is important for reducing external
vulnerabilities.
18.
The authorities stressed that the exchange rate regime based on a crawling peg has
been beneficial for Nicaragua. It has helped anchor inflation expectations and maintain broad
financial stability. Nevertheless, the authorities’ agreed with staff assessment that the present rate of
crawl (5 percent) has set a relatively high floor for domestic inflation which is generally higher in
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
8
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NICARAGUA

Nicaragua than in its regional peers. In addition, it may be a factor contributing to rising
dollarization. The authorities agreed with the staff’s assessment and noted they would welcome
technical assistance to develop a long-term strategy to reduce incentives for dollarization and that
in that context would explore alternative exchange rate regime options.
19.
The authorities acknowledged that Nicaragua is facing considerable external
vulnerabilities. However, they noted that there is no significant misalignment of the exchange rate
(Annex 1) and external reserves are above internationally recognized benchmarks. Nonetheless, they
recognized risks stemming from the large external current account deficits and oil import
dependency, the high level of external debt, and the economy’s exposure to potential changes in
the levels or terms of the oil collaboration with Venezuela. The authorities were confident that the
probability for these risks to materialize was low, while agreeing on the merit of developing a
contingency plan to deal with external shocks (to include additional financing and measures to
compress expenditure).5 They also committed to continue negotiations to complete bilateral debt
reduction agreements with non-Paris Club creditors.6
20.
Staff recommended close monitoring of commercial bank credit to the private sector.
Staff cautioned that a rapid expansion in the banking system’s exposure to the private sector in the
context of high dollarization, in particular in the consumer loan sector, could pose risks. In that
context, it urged close monitoring of banks' foreign exchange positions and of credit quality. The
authorities broadly concurred with staff’s assessment while noting that the recent credit expansion
represented a rebound from the contraction in the aftermath of the global recession and was
slowing in the course of the year. They also pointed to relatively strong capital adequacy indicators,
and emphasized the stability of deposits, including those linked to the oil-collaboration scheme with
Venezuela (about 8 percent of total deposits). However, they agreed that increased vigilance over
credit quality and stress tests based on exchange rate and other shocks were warranted. Staff
supported the authorities’ intention to strengthen the supervision framework based on the
evaluation of risks. Staff welcomed the authorities’ commitment to continue providing transfers to
the central bank to reduce its operational losses. Staff also encourages the authorities to improve
the AML/CFT framework in line with the action plan agreed with the Financial Action Task Force to
address remaining strategic deficiencies.

C.

Structural Reforms

would require substantial investments in infrastructure and significant progress in reforming

At end-2012, debt to non-Paris Club creditors still subject to relief stood at US$1.5 billion (14 ½ percent of GDP). In
2011, an agreement with Libya was reached but is yet to be finalized. In 2012, an agreement with Iran was signed but
the final approval by the Iran authorities is pending. In 2013, a consolidated loan agreement was signed with Taiwan
and is pending parliamentary approval.

labor and product markets and education. Nicaragua needs to implement a broad program of
structural reforms to boost annual output growth to about 5–6 percent to significantly raise income
levels and reduce poverty. Indicators suggest that Nicaragua is behind its peers in key governance
and doing business indicators (Annex 1) and there are other significant inefficiencies in the
economy, as evidenced by a negative total factor productivity growth (on average -0.2 percent of
GDP per year) experienced during 2001–11.7 Progress is being achieved in some important areas,
such as the electricity sector where blackouts have been largely eliminated and generation capacity
is expanding, although high generation costs and other inefficiencies constitute an important
impediment to growth. Similarly, rationalizing public spending, as well as the system of tax
exemptions and subsidies would be important to reduce policy induced distortions. Also, significant
reforms are needed in the labor and product markets to reduce informality, allow more competition,
and further enhance conditions for private investment.


Electricity sector. Nicaragua is highly dependent on oil imports (12 percent of GDP) which
are a key input to electricity generation. However, large distribution losses, consumer
subsidies, and below-cost tariff require subsidies to the electricity sector of about
1½ percent of GDP. The authorities’ strategy is to expand access to electricity supplies
nationwide as part of their social and economic modernization strategy, reduce distribution
losses, and lower electricity costs by changing the generation matrix toward renewable
energy sources. It is expected that efficiency gains and cost reductions, in part due to falling
oil prices, would help eliminate the electricity tariff gap. In addition, they plan to review the
tariff policy in view of their social policy objectives and the availability of public resources.



Labor and product markets and education. High degree of informality in the economy
hampers growth by inhibiting integration of small firms into the formal sector and limiting
incentives to business expansion and productivity improvements. Low education levels also
constrain growth in higher productivity areas. Addressing these challenges requires reducing
incentives to informality in the economy, for example by easing access to social security
schemes, simplifying tax filing, and improving business licensing procedures. It would be
also important to better match the skills provided by the education system and those
demanded by the labor market.

OTHER ISSUES
22.
The authorities welcomed close collaboration with the Fund. They stressed the
importance of close cooperation outside of a formal Fund program for maintaining confidence and
donor support. The central bank announced that after many years of Fund-supported programs the
Fund would continue to act as Nicaragua’s trusted advisor in the context of staff visits, Article IV
consultations, and technical assistance.

23.
Data provided to the Fund are broadly adequate for surveillance purposes. The recent
revision to national accounts considerably improved reporting on real sector developments.
However, the coverage and timelines of public financial accounts could be further improved. In
particular, there are incompatible methodologies in the compilation budgetary data from “above”
and “below” the line which contribute to delays in the reporting of reconciled revenue, expenditure,
and financing accounts.

STAFF APPRAISAL
24.
Nicaragua’s recent macroeconomic performance has been favorable. The authorities
deserve credit for sustaining fiscal discipline and prudent monetary management. In addition, the
pursuit of important structural reforms in the areas of taxation, electricity sector, and social security
has contributed to strengthening confidence and helped taking advantage of improving external
conditions to boost economic growth. However, the economy continues to face important
vulnerabilities stemming from high public and private debt and exposure to external shocks that will
require careful management over the medium term.
25.
Risks to the near-term outlook appear moderate. Under staff’s baseline projections,
economic growth is expected to slow to its long-term trend level and inflation would remain
anchored by the exchange rate crawling peg regime. To support these outcomes and help reduce
external vulnerabilities, it will be crucial to sustain the path of fiscal consolidation, implement key
structural reforms, and protect the stability of the banking system. On the external side, Nicaragua
could be adversely affected by slower than expected economic recovery in the United States and
Europe and higher oil prices. Additional risks could arise from changes to the oil collaboration
scheme with Venezuela.
26.
Sustained fiscal consolidation should be the main anchor of the authorities’
macroeconomic strategy. The draft budget for 2014 appropriately maintains the fiscal stance of
this year. Staff welcomes the incorporation into the budget of the wage bonus (“bono solidario”) by
taking advantage of rising revenue yields and making adjustments in other expenditures. Staff
supports the authorities’ medium-term objective to lower public debt ratios to gain fiscal space for
dealing with shocks and conducting countercyclical fiscal policy. To this end, it will be crucial to
broaden the revenue base by fully implementing the elimination of tax exemptions envisaged in the
2012 reform, rationalize public expenditures, and reform the pension system to ensure its financial
viability. This strategy should be complemented by renewed efforts to conclude negotiations on
public debt reduction with the remaining non-Paris Club official creditors.
27.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ commitment to rationalize public expenditure and
increase transparency of public sector operations. Key in this area would be a reform of subsidy
policies in the electricity and other economic sectors. Staff recommended targeting electricity
subsidies to the lowest income groups and providing them through a mechanism that is transparent
and insulates the budget from shocks to international prices. This should also involve strengthening

the financial position of public enterprises and avoiding intra-public sector arrears. Staff welcomed
the increased provision to the public of information on international cooperation and recommended
dissemination of full information on the financial flows and economic benefits of oil collaboration
with Venezuela.
28.
Reducing external vulnerabilities remains one of Nicaragua’s key challenges. In this
regard, the authorities’ strategy to reduce dependence on oil imports through diversification of the
generation matrix is welcome. Meanwhile, it will be important to develop contingency plans to
address potential vulnerabilities stemming from high oil imports and potential volatility in the
financing of large external current account deficits. Monetary policy will also have a role to play by
keeping inflation under control to ensure that the real exchange rate remains broadly in line with
fundamentals and international reserves coverage stays above the international benchmarks.
29.
Financial system soundness indicators are satisfactory, but growing lending to the
private sector warrants close monitoring. The average capital adequacy ratios of the banking
system and indicators of non-performing loans remain relatively robust, and progress in
strengthening risk-based supervision is welcome. However, the recent rapid increase in credit to the
private sector in a highly dollarized system may pose risks and needs to be monitored. Staff
supports the authorities’ commitment to continue recapitalizing the central bank.
30.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to advance the structural reform agenda and
mobilize infrastructure investments needed to boost Nicaragua’s productive capacity. It is
imperative to build on the progress achieved in the electricity sector by further expanding its
capacity and enhancing efficiency to reduce impediments to growth and reduce fiscal risks. Reforms
to rationalize public spending and strengthening the framework for private investment would be
critical for developing infrastructure. Reducing labor market informality and better matching of skills
provided by the education system to those demanded by employers would also raise long-term
growth prospects.
31.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV Consultation take place on the standard 12month cycle.

During the 2012 Article IV consultation, Directors encouraged the authorities to maintain prudent
macroeconomic policies, reduce external vulnerabilities, and step up the pace of structural reform. In particular,
they stressed the need for fiscal consolidation, reforms to strengthen the revenue effort and to restore the
pension system’s viability, current expenditure restraint, and to tackle weaknesses in the energy sector. Overall,
policies implemented since 2011 have followed past Fund advice, economic growth has picked up, and progress
has been made in key structural areas.
Fiscal consolidation. The tax reform passed in December 2012 will reduce exemptions and help strengthen
tax administration and revenues. With current expenditures under control, fiscal deficits have been small and
public debt ratios have continued to decline. The adjustment in electricity tariffs and changes to the
regulatory framework implemented in April 2013 will strengthen the financial position of public enterprises
and reduce fiscal pressures. A social security reform currently under public consultation will also contribute
to reducing fiscal risks.
External vulnerabilities. Gross international reserves have increased as envisaged at the last consultation,
and reserves coverage of imports exceeds international benchmarks. To reduce dependence on oil imports,
the authorities’ strategy is to develop alternative energy sources, including with large private and external
investment. The authorities are cognizant of the risks associated with large external current account deficits
and high oil import bill and are considering developing a contingency plan to deal with unforeseen shocks
(including additional financing and measures to compress expenditure).

Box 2. Nicaragua: New National Account Statistics
On September 20, 2012, Nicaragua launched new national account statistics. The improvements
involve: (i) a change in base year (from 1994 to 2006); (ii) the implementation of a complete set of
integrated economic accounts by institutional sector in accordance with the recommendations of the
1993 System of National Accounts; and (iii) the implementation of classifications and most relevant
recommendations of the 2008 System of National Accounts. The revisions were conducted under the
supervision of the Central Bank of Nicaragua with financial support from the Inter-American
Development Bank. CAPTAC-DR provided technical assistance, in particular with respect to source
surveys and statistical procedures for a new GDP base year. It also helped analyze the data on
compensation of employees and savings while ensuring full consistency of the complete sequence of
accounts among institutional sectors.
As a result of these improvements, nominal GDP was adjusted upward by about 30 percent.
GDP per capita for 2012 is now estimated at US$1,762 (US$1,313 before the change); despite these
revisions Nicaragua’s per capita income remains the second lowest among countries in the Western
Hemisphere. Fiscal and other ratios to GDP are markedly lower than reported in the 2012 Article IV
report.

Box 3. Nicaragua: Oil Collaboration with Venezuela
Nicaragua’s oil collaboration with Venezuela was agreed by Presidents Ortega and Chavez in April 2007.
The collaboration is based on a broad framework for oil import-related financing as well as other
financing (e.g., FDI) and debt servicing schemes (through in-kind repayments). In a nutshell, the scheme
works as follows:


PDVSA, a Venezuelan state-owned oil company, is Venezuela’s representative under the agreement.



ALBANISA (ALBA de Nicaragua) was created in 2008 and is owned by PDVSA (51 percent) and

It supplies petroleum and is a financial agent for FDI and other arrangements in Nicaragua.
PETRONIC (a Nicaraguan state-owned company; 49 percent). ALBANISA imports oil from PDVSA
which is subsequently sold in Nicaragua at market prices. It also serves as Venezuela’s agent in FDI in
various sectors in Nicaragua’s economy. Under the agreement, 100 percent of the oil bill is paid by
ALBANISA to PDVSA within 90 days. On behalf of PDVSA, 50 percent of the oil bill (FOB) is then
transferred to CARUNA (Caja Rural Nacional), a privately owned Nicaraguan financial cooperative, in
the form of a long-term loan (payable over 25 years, with a 2-year grace period, 2 percent interest,
and grant element of 30 percent).


Under the oil collaboration scheme, 38 percent of the funds received by CARUNA are used for quasifiscal operations (e.g., subsidies and transfers for electricity and transport, and public sector wage
bonuses). The remaining 62 percent is used to finance for-profit projects.
Payments to PDVSA for oil or the debt service on oil financing can be made in-cash or in-kind. The
latter can take place only through exports of goods by ALBALINISA (ALBA Alimentos de Nicaragua), a
joint venture between ALBANISA and PDVSA, to Venezuela. ALBALINISA purchases primary products
(e.g., cattle, beef, sugar, coffee, and beans) from domestic private firms and re-sells these to retail
chains in Venezuela.

ANNEX I. Nicaragua: External Sustainability and External
Competitiveness Assessment
I.

Exchange Rate and Competitiveness

Estimates based on the CGER methodology (macroeconomic balance approach, external
sustainability approach, and equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) approach) suggest that the
exchange rate is overvalued by about 4.9 percent (simple average of the three CGER-based
methodologies). This conclusion masks a range of estimates (between 1.8 percent and
7.8 percent) and is subject to significant methodological uncertainties. 1 Analysis based on other
indicators points to a mixed picture. The export market shares have moderately improved, but
weak business environment, governance and corruption perceptions continue to weigh on
Nicaragua’s external competitiveness. Over the medium-term, the external current account
deficit will decline as changing energy matrix will reduce oil import dependence, but still will
remain large at about 12 percent of GDP (on average in 2014–18). As a result, vulnerability
stemming from external current account deficits and associated external financing needs will
persist.
A. CGER Assessment

Historically, Nicaragua’s external current account
deficits have been large (on average about 14.3
percent of GDP during 2003–12). The current
account deficit for 2013 is expected to widen to
13.2 percent of GDP, from 12.9 percent of GDP in
2012 on account of lower external demand,
continued FDI-related imports, and temporary
import of machinery for the energy sector. FDI,
fiscal balances, global spillovers via remittances
and exports, oil imports, and real growth are the
key drivers of the current account deficit in
Nicaragua.

fundamentals through 2018. The underlying current deficit is estimated to be 11.6 of GDP
after adjusting the medium-term current account by temporary factors (temporary
import of machinery for energy sector estimated at 0.4 percent of GDP). A comparison of
the norm and the underlying current account using elasticities of current account to
change in REER, and export and import volume estimated for Nicaragua yields an
overvaluation of 5.2 percent.


External sustainability approach. As of end-2012, the estimated net International
Investment Position was -123.7 percent of GDP. According to the external sustainability
approach, an external current account deficit of 9.9 percent would stabilize the net IIP.
Given the underlying current account deficit of 11.6 percent of GDP, the resulting
overvaluation is estimated at 7.8 percent.



The equilibrium real exchange rate approach (ERER). The ERER is estimated as a
function of terms of trade, government consumption, relative productivity (computed as
GDP per working population), and remittance and FDI inflows.2 This approach suggests a
modest overvaluation of 1.8 percent.
B. Other Assessment

Various indicators suggest that Nicaragua’s competitiveness performance is mixed both relative
to historical trends and to its regional peers. Nicaragua’s exports as share of trading partners’
non-oil imports have moderately increased
140
since 2009. At the same time, Nicaragua has
demonstrated its ability to attract high levels
130
of FDI, which is attributed to a positive record
120
on personal safety and low labor cost.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS1
Approved By
Saul Lizondo and
Dhaneshwar Ghura (IMF)
and J. Humberto Lopez
and Jeffrey D. Lewis
(IDA)

The Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) has been prepared
jointly by IMF and World Bank staff, in consultation with the
authorities.

The IMF and the World Bank 2013 Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) indicates that Nicaragua’s
risk of external public debt distress remains moderate. All present value debt ratios have declined
following the recent reform of the discount rate; however, an alternative scenario points to
vulnerabilities arising from contingent liabilities (e.g., if private debt is taken over by the public
sector). The DSA of public debt suggests that debt levels are high, but that debt dynamics are
sustainable although subject to, contingent liability risks. The DSA underscores the need to:
(i) continue borrowing mostly on concessional terms; (ii) build up fiscal buffers over the next
decade to lower debt ratios and strengthen the capacity to respond to shocks; (iii) reduce oil
dependency; (iv) continue to make efforts to conclude ongoing debt relief negotiations; and
(v) remain alert to contingent liability risks.

1

This appendix was prepared in the context of the Article IV consultation mission held in September 2013. It
updates the last comprehensive DSA conducted in June 2010 (SM/10/156, Supplement 1) and a DSA update in
th
the Staff Report for the 7 Review of the ECF (Country Report No. 11/322).

NICARAGUA

BACKGROUND
1.
This is the third DSA for Nicaragua prepared under the joint Bank-Fund Low-Income
Country (LIC) Debt Sustainability Framework since 2007. As in 2010, the 2013 DSA includes an
assessment of the external indebtedness of the financial and non-financial private sector. The 2010 external
DSA concluded that Nicaragua was at moderate risk of debt distress, with vulnerabilities arising from a
depreciation shock, lower growth, and lack of external adjustment; in addition, less favorable financing
terms temporarily deteriorated debt and debt-service ratios. The 2010 DSA of public debt concluded that
debt levels were high, but that debt dynamics were sustainable.
2.
Four changes have been included in this comprehensive DSA relative to the one in 2010.
First, nominal GDP has been revised upwards (about 30 percent) on account of the publication of new
national accounts data.2 Second, Nicaragua was reclassified in 2011 as a medium performer (instead of a
strong performer) based on its 3–year average CPIA rating (this was also reported to the Board in 2011
during the 7th review of Nicaragua’s ECF). Nicaragua has since recorded some improvement in its CPIA
rating, but this is not yet sufficient for it to be re-classified again as a strong performer.3 Third, as per a
recent Board decision, the discount rate has been revised upward from 4 percent (in the 2010 DSA) to
5 percent (3 percent in the 2011 DSA).4 And fourth, this DSA includes remittances in the baseline scenario.5

2

The authorities launched on September 20, 2012 a new set of national accounts with 2006 as the base year.
Nominal GDP has been revised upwards by about 30 percent. The revision, supported by technical assistance from
CAPTAC-DR, uses improved source surveys an statistical procedures and a new base year (2006) to calculate GDP.
The revision in nominal GDP has a large impact on debt-to-GDP ratios.

3

The IMF-World Bank debt sustainability framework (DSF) uses policy dependent external debt thresholds based on
the principle that the debt levels LICs can sustain are influenced by the quality of a country’s policies and institutions.
Such policies and institutions are assessed by the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index compiled
by the World Bank. The DSF divides countries into three performance categories: strong (CPIA >= 3.75), medium
(3.75 > CPIA > 3.25), and poor (CPIA <= 3.25). Nicaragua’s current rating (3–year average of 2010-12, as defined in
the LIC DSA guidelines) is 3.68.
4

The Executive Boards of the IMF and World Bank approved on October a reform of the discount rate (SM/13/271).
The reform unifies the discount rate used for DSF and grant element calculations at 5 percent.

5

The joint World Bank-IMF interim guidance on the use of remittances in DSF recommends that countries with large
remittances conduct the DSA with remittances in the base case. Nicaragua is considered a large remittances country
(i.e., the ratios of remittances-to-GDP and remittances-to-exports of goods and services are 10.3 and 26.6 percent,
respectively, during the period 2003-12; these ratios are above the established thresholds of 10 and 20 percent).

DEBT PORTFOLIO
3.
Nicaragua’s public and publicly-guaranteed external debt ratios have declined, but external
debt relief negotiations have progressed slowly. After reaching its completion point in 2004, Nicaragua
received debt relief from bilateral (mostly Paris Club members) and multilateral official creditors. Progress
was also made in restructuring public debt with private creditors.6 The government is making efforts to
conclude negotiations with non-Paris Club members, but progress with some of these countries has been
slower.

Excluding non-Paris Club outstanding debt relief.

4.
At end-2012, debt to non-Paris Club bilateral creditors still subject to relief stood at
US$1.5 billion (equivalent to 14½ percent of GDP and 35 percent of total outstanding external
debt). This amount excludes Taiwan that is in the process of being resolved. Of the ten countries holding
claims on Nicaragua still subject to debt relief, only Taiwan receives debt-service payments as this debt was
incurred after the cutoff date and an agreement has recently been reached.7 In addition, bilateral and
multilateral debt relief from Spain, Slovak Republic, FIDA, and Nordic Funds for US$32 million has been
granted since the 2010 DSA.8 It is also worth noting that Nicaragua’s public and publicly-guaranteed (PPG)
external debt (including debt still subject to relief) is almost equally divided between the central
government and the central bank. Most of this PPG external debt is owed to multilateral institutions or to
non-Paris Club official creditors.

6

In 2007-08, a commercial debt buy-back operation (with support from the World Bank’s Debt Reduction Facility)
resolved outstanding debt to private creditors (both domestic and external) for US$1.4 billion or 19 percent of 2007
GDP; the participation rate exceeded 95 percent and it provided relief for 95 percent of the outstanding principal.

7

In 2011, an agreement with Libya was reached but is yet to be finalized. In 2012, an agreement with Iran was
signed but the final approval by the Iran authorities is pending. In 2013, a consolidated loan agreement was signed
with Taiwan and legislative approval is pending.

8

Negotiations on a US$23.6 million claim by Honduras’ electricity company are being settled in the context of official
bilateral debt relief negotiations with non-Paris Club member countries.

Public and publicly-guaranteed debt has also declined as a result of the reduction in
domestic public debt. The ratio of domestic debt fell from 29 percent of GDP in 2002–03 to about
11 percent in 2012 reflecting debt buyback (see footnote 6). Most of it is indexed to the U.S. dollar but
serviced in córdobas. Property settlement bonds (BPIs) is the largest component of domestic debt. These
bonds are issued as part of court settlements on property expropriations that occurred in the 1980s. New
issues of BPIs have steadily declined—they averaged US$75 million in 2003–06 and were down to
US$21 million in 2012. BPIs represent 49 percent of total domestic debt and their stock fell from 15 to
5 percent of GDP between 2005 and 2012.

Private external debt is rising sharply on account of the ALBA oil collaboration.9 Specifically,
private external debt rose from 22 percent of GDP in 2007 to 42 percent of GDP in 2012. A large share of
this rise is as a result of the ALBA oil collaboration.10

MACROECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS
7.
The 2013 DSA incorporates Nicaragua’s revised national accounts and is built on
conservative macroeconomic assumptions. The DSA of external and public debt assumes that growth
slows down from 5.2 percent in 2012 to its potential rate (4 percent) by 2014. This is the same mediumterm growth as assumed in the 2010 DSA. The staff projection assumes the continuation of (i) prudent
macroeconomic management policies, and (ii) reforms that support the change in the electricity generation
matrix. The non-interest external current account is programmed to improve in the first 10 years of the
projection period (2013–22) broadly in line with a relative decline in the oil bill.
8.

On the external side, the baseline scenario assumes:



A relative decline in Nicaragua’s dependence on oil imports and, consequently, a lower (noninterest) external current account deficit. The assumed decline reflects programmed non-fossil
electricity generation projects. Thus, no significant changes in external imbalances would occur
after 2023. This is a more conservative assumption than in the 2010 DSA, which had a similar
external imbalance in the first 10 years of the projection period (2013–22), but that also assumed
this adjustment continued during the following 10 years.11



Export-to-GDP ratios remain broadly stable at about 50–53 percent of GDP and import-to-GDP
ratios will decline mildly from 73 percent to 68 percent in 2013–33, largely reflecting a declining
relative dependence on oil imports and lower FDI.



Completion of negotiations with non-Paris Club bilateral creditors on HIPC-equivalent terms are
assumed throughout the projection.12 This in effect generates debt relief of 9.4 percent of GDP
(in stock terms as of end-2012 or US$983 million). HIPC terms were also assumed in the 2010
DSA; most of this debt is currently not serviced.

9

The Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our Americas (Alianza Bolivariana para los Pueblos de Nuestra América, or
ALBA) is an international cooperation organization founded originally by Cuba and Venezuela in 2004. The member
countries are Antigua and Barbuda, Bolivia, Cuba, Dominica, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines,
Venezuela, Saint Lucia, and Suriname.

10

The financial terms assumed on new private borrowing (excluding ALBA) are, for the financial sector, an 8-year
maturity with a 3-year grace period and an interest rate of 4 percent and, for the non-financial sector, a 7-year
maturity with a 1-year grace period and an interest rate of 7 percent.
11

This is after adjusting the 2010 DSA for the mentioned changes in nominal GDP.

12

It is assumed that debt relief amounting to US$982.8 million at end-2012 (excluding Taiwan Republic of China) is
obtained (out of US$1,507 million outstanding pending non-Paris Club debt).



Net official external assistance (official public loans and grants) is expected to decline from
10 percent of GDP, on average, for the period 2007–12 to about 3 percent for 2027–33.
Exposure to multilateral development banks is projected to grow. This is similar to the
assumptions in the 2010 DSA.



FDI is assumed to remain about 1¼ percent of GDP below the level recorded in 2010–12, as
recent foreign investment in the energy sector is expected to decline. The projected levels are
also below those assumed in the 2010 DSA (by about 1½-2 percent of GDP).



ALBA-related flows are assumed to decline smoothly through 2033. It is also assumed that the
ALBA oil collaboration continues to be channeled through the private sector.

9.

On the fiscal side, the baseline scenario assumes that:



In line with the achievements since 2010, fiscal management remains prudent. Primary deficits
(after grants) are expected to average less than ½ percent of GDP in the first 10 years of the
projection period (this is broadly similar to the level observed in 2010–12) and about ¼ percent
of GDP in the following 10 years.



The baseline assumes a pension reform is implemented in 2013, which is key to keeping debt
sustainable. In the absence of such a reform, the social security system would begin incurring
deficits by 2015 that would reach about 1-1.5 percent of GDP by 2023 and could rise to nearly
3.5 percent of GDP by 2033.



Capital expenditures are programmed to increase over the medium-term by about 1½ percent
of GDP relative to their 2012 level reflecting increased investment in infrastructure.



Issuance of BPIs is expected to remain at the level observed in 2012 through 2018, in line with
the annual projection in the 2010 DSA (US$21 million).

EXTERNAL PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
Baseline Scenario
10.
Under the baseline scenario (with remittances), Nicaragua’s external public debt indicators
remain below their policy dependent indicative thresholds. The thresholds used are those that apply to
medium performers in terms of policies and institutional quality, as measured by a 3–year moving average
of the World Bank’s CPIA. All present value (PV) external debt stock indicators, which measure the future
debt-service burden of debt stocks (repayment risks), are below the policy indicative thresholds and
expected to decline over the 20–year projection period. For instance, the PV of the PPG external public
debt-to-GDP (plus remittances) ratio declines from 22½ percent in 2013 to 12 percent by 2033 (Table 2
and Text table 3); this is well below the 36 percent threshold (Figure 1 and Text table3). (Table 1 shows the
underlying assumptions of the baseline projections presented in Table 2). Likewise, reflecting the relative

openness of Nicaragua’s economy, the PV of external public debt as a share of exports (plus remittances)
remains below indicative thresholds throughout the projection period.

small erosion in the concessionality terms of new borrowing.

Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests
12.
Under the current discount rate policy (set at 5 percent), none of the standard alternative
scenarios and stress tests would breach the policy dependent indicative thresholds (Table 2 and 3,
and Figure 1 and 3).13


Historical scenario. In an “historical” scenario (i.e., where key variables remain at their historical
averages), the PV of the PPG external-debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to grow, but would remain
by 2033 below the policy dependent threshold.



Non concessional financing. In the scenario where new borrowing occurs on less favorable
terms, which assumes that the interest through 2033 is 2 percentage points higher than in the
baseline, all debt ratios deteriorate but stay below the threshold.



Exchange rate depreciation. Similarly, under the standardized stress test of a one-time
30 percent nominal depreciation in 2014, all debt ratios deteriorate but stay below the indicative
thresholds.



Scenario without remittances. Remittances to Nicaragua are relatively large. Average
remittances during 2008–12 were the equivalent of 10 percent GDP and 23 percent exports of

13

The change in the discount rate has significantly improved all PV of public debt ratios. For example, the PV of
public debt to GDP in 2013 is now reduced to 34.4 percent from 41.4 percent.

goods and services. As recommended in the DSF (interim guidance), a scenario without
remittances is also conducted. The results in Figure 3 and Table 3 are presented as an alternative
scenario and point to conclusions that are similar to those reached in the analysis with
remittances (the base case in this DSA).

PRIVATE EXTERNAL DEBT AND EXTERNAL DEBT
SUSTAINABILITY
13.
The PV of private external debt is well above the indicative thresholds that are used for
public external debt.14 The DSA projections assume that: (i) the ALBA oil collaboration continues through
2033; (ii) these resources will continue to be channeled to the private sector with financial terms similar to
those currently under application;15 and (iii) Venezuela-related oil bills will decline in relative terms as
savings from renewable energy sources materialize.16 Under these assumptions, the pace of accumulation
of private external debt eventually decelerates; i.e., it is projected to peak in 2020 (at about 56 percent of
GDP, in PV terms) and decline steadily thereafter.

The use of the public DSF threshold to discuss the private sector debt dynamics is for illustrative purpose only as
there are no good guidelines on what is a sustainable level of private debt.

15

Venezuela represents 94 percent of Nicaragua’s FOB oil imports; 50 percent of this oil bill is financed with a loan
that has a maturity of 25 years, a grace period of 2 years, and an interest rate of 2 percent; this implies the equivalent
of a grant element of 37 percent when using a discount rate of 5 percent.

16

Several non-thermal generation projects are assumed to come into operation to reduce Nicaragua’s oil bill;
namely, several hydroelectric (Bokobé, Larreynaga, and, in particular, Tumarin in 2018) and a new eolic project (ALBA
vientos). It is worth noting that non-thermal energy sources accounted for only 17 of total gross generation in 2007
and this is expected to rise to over 40 percent by end-2013.

path, it is expected that Nicaragua will
continue to experience a gradually declining debt path. As a result, the PV of total public debt-to-GDP is
projected to decline to 20.4 percent of GDP by 2033 (from 34.4 percent in 2013 (see Table 5; Figure 2 and
Table 4 provide background on the underlying assumptions). Excluding remittances from these debt
scenarios has only a marginal impact (Figure 4).
15.
Debt service ratios are also expected to improve. Total public debt-service-to-revenue ratios
are expected to decline from 13.0 to 4.8 percent between 2013 and 2033. Also, the availability of
concessional external financing limits the need to rely on domestic debt, which in Nicaragua’s highly
dollarized economy involves higher yields and exchange rate risks; the projection assumes the level of
dollarization does not change.

Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests
16.
Nicaragua's large share of foreign-currency denominated debt makes it vulnerable to
exchange rate shocks. The stress tests for total public debt (Table 5) indicate that a 30 percent
depreciation would increase the PV of public debt-to-GDP ratio from 34 percent in 2013 to 47 percent in
2014 and decline only gradually thereafter. In sum, public debt service ratios deteriorate but remain
manageable. For instance, total public debt ratios-to-revenues would increase from 126 percent (in PV
terms) to 175 percent. Finally, contingent liabilities, such as those that could arise from property
confiscations and social security deficits, all add to Nicaragua’s public debt vulnerabilities.
17.
Should the government be required to assume private debt, this would severely impair debt
sustainability. This risks applies to any private debt and, given the rapidly increasing levels of private debt
and the potential risks to external current account financing, an alternative scenario is carried out that

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

NICARAGUA

assumes some private debt being absorbed into the public sector’s balance sheet.17 Specifically, it is
assumed that nearly two thirds of private external debt are assumed by the public sector in 2014.18 This
scenario also assumes that no additional debt will be generated from future oil imports. If such a
contingent liability risk were to materialize, then this would drive up the PV of public external debt ratio to
GDP in 2014 to 41.7 percent (compared to 24.6 percent under the baseline) and the public debt ratio to
GDP would rise to 67.8 percent in 2014 (compared to 40.6 percent under the baseline). In both cases the
indicative thresholds for the PV of debt-to-GDP ratios would be breached.
18.
Other stress tests suggest, with few exceptions, only a temporary deterioration in debt and
debt-service ratios. This includes: (i) a 10 percent of GDP increase in other debt-creating flows in 2013; (ii)
a GDP growth at its historical average minus one standard deviation in 2013–14; and (iii) a scenario that
combines the latter with a primary balance at its historical average minus one standard deviation in 2013–
14 (Table 5). The most concerning stress test is the one that results from a depreciation shock; it takes
about a decade to recover from such a shock. In all cases, however, PV ratios remain below their thresholds.

DEBT DISTRESS CLASSIFICATION AND CONCLUSIONS
19.
In the staff’s view Nicaragua should be considered at moderate risk of external debt
distress; also, the DSA on public debt suggests that Nicaragua’s public debt is high, but that debt
dynamics are sustainable. The above assessment is consistent with the 2010 DSA19 and assumes a
continuation of Nicaragua’s prudent macroeconomic management of the past few years and its so far
successful transformation of the electricity generation matrix. Finally, the rapid increase in private external
debt, which includes the debt arising as a result of the oil collaboration with Venezuela, requires continuous
monitoring and the government’s continued commitment not to extend public guarantees on this debt.
20.
The authorities concurred with the thrust of the analysis, findings, and key conclusions. They
agreed on the need to keep pace of key reforms, including the social security reform. They also recognized
that it is imperative to continue making efforts to conclude ongoing negotiations with non-Paris Club
creditors under the HIPC Initiative. The authorities requested the support of the IMF and the World Bank in
encouraging the creditors who had not yet reached agreement on debt relief for Nicaragua to participate
in the Initiative. Finally, while the authorities noted they had obtained similar results in their own DSA, they
have requested that staff shares the final detailed DSA output.

17

This private debt includes the obligations of CARUNA, a privately-owned Nicaraguan financial cooperative that
holds the debt obligations arising from the oil collaboration with Venezuela; according to the authorities, the
repayment risks of this debt are borne by PDVSA.

18

It is further assumed that concessional terms would apply to this new public debt (specifically, 1.8 percent interest
rate, 5 years grace period, 30 years maturity; at 5 percent discount rate, this would yield 36 percent grant element).

19

Adjusting debt and debt service ratios in the 2010 DSA by the level impact of the new national accounts data, the
conclusions of the 2013 DSA are similar to those presented in the 2010 DSA; the 2013 DSA also benefits from the
recent change in the discount rate.

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.
1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt. Historical estimates of debt have been revised (upwards) by the Central Bank of Nicaragua. The projections assume that outstanding debt to non-Paris Club
bilateral creditors is settled on HIPC-equivalent terms by end-2012.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Grant element assumed on residual financing (i.e., financing required above baseline) 6/
Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the
baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after
the shock (implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

1/ Public debt refers to the gross debt of the Consolidated Public Sector. The projections assume that the outstanding debt to non-Paris Club bilateral creditors is settled on HIPC-equivalent terms by end-2012.
2/ Gross financing need is defined as the primary deficit plus debt service plus the stock of short-term debt at the end of the last period.
3/ Revenues excluding grants.
4/ Debt service is defined as the sum of interest and amortization of medium and long-term debt.
5/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms
at the completion point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in
NPV terms at the decision point. Hence these two amounts cannot be added.
2/

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point
corresponding to interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not
disbursed during the interim period.
Definitions:
Decision point - point at which the IMF and the World Bank determine whether a country qualifies
for assistance under the HIPC Initiative and decide on the amount of assistance to be committed.
Interim assistance - amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision and
completion points, up to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the assistance committed at
the decision point (or 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in exceptional circumstances).
Completion point - point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its assistance
committed at the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of interest income as
defined in footnote 2 above. The timing of the completion point is linked to the implementation of
pre-agreed key structural reforms (i.e., floating completion point).

Exchange Rate Arrangements:
In December 1995, the Monetary Board of the central bank approved the unification of the
exchange rate system effective January 1, 1996. With the unification of the exchange rate, all
previous exchange restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions and
multiple currency practices were eliminated. The central bank buys/sells any amount of foreign
currency from/to financial institutions at the official exchange rate, and implements a crawling peg
system. Since December 2004, the monthly crawl has been set at an annual rate of 5 percent. As of
November 7, 2013, the exchange rate in the official market was C$25.1496 per U.S. dollar.
Nicaragua has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an
exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions.
Article IV Consultation:
The previous consultation was completed by the Executive Board on June 27, 2012, (Country Report
No. 12/256). The last Fund-supported program review (Seventh Review under the ECF Arrangement
and Financing Assurances Review) was concluded on October 21, 2011.
FSAP Participation:
An FSAP update was completed in October 2009, and the Financial System Stability Assessment
report for Nicaragua was issued on April 28, 2010.
Technical Assistance:
Nicaragua has received substantial technical assistance. The schedule below details assistance
provided since 2011.

IDB Loan Commitments and Disbursements
As of October 21, 2013, there were 25 projects in the IDB’s current sovereign loan portfolio with a
total commitment of US$702.3 million and an undisbursed balance of US$471.15 million. Basic
infrastructure (roads and energy) accounts for almost half the portfolio. Nicaragua is one of four IDB
borrowing member countries to receive highly-concessional loans from the Fund for Special
Operations (FSO). More precisely, Nicaragua receives a lending blend of 50 percent from the FSO
and 50 percent from the Ordinary Capital. The annual sovereign lending envelop depends on the
availability of FSO funding as well as an allocation formula that encompasses policy framework,
portfolio performance, per capita income and population. The allocation for Nicaragua was
US$80.2 million per annum in 2007 and 2008. In early 2009, the overall FSO funding for the four
low-income countries was increased as a counter-cyclical response to the global economic crisis,
and Nicaragua’s allocation increased to US$162.0 million for 2009 and US$170.2 million for 2010.
For 2011 and 2012, the FSO allocation increased to US$171.2 million. Finally, the allocation for 2013
and 2014 increased to US$191.5 million.
Technical Assistance
As of October 21 2013, there were 32 non-reimbursable technical cooperations (for the public
sector) in execution with an approved commitment of US$12.8 million and an available balance of
US$5.9 million. The Multilateral Investment Fund has: (i) 14 non-reimbursable technical cooperation
(including regional operations) in execution with an available balance of US$5.7 million; and (ii) 4

loans in execution from the Social Entrepreneurship Program with an approved commitment of
US$2.2 million and an available balance of US$1.3 million.

Directors in November 2012.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of October 31, 2013)
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General. Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Areas
requiring most improvement are government financing statistics and labor statistics.
National accounts. In September 2012, the Central Bank of Nicaragua (CBN) published new national
account statistics. The new statistics include a number of improvements: a change in base year (from
1994 to 2006); the implementation of a complete set of integrated economic accounts by institutional
sector in accordance with the recommendations of the 1993 System of National Accounts; and the
implementation of classifications and most relevant recommendations of the 2008 System of National
Accounts.
Price and labor statistics. The consumer price index (CPI) uses expenditure weights derived from a
(2006/07) household expenditure survey. The CPI covers Managua and eight other cities and is
published monthly. Expenditures (weights) and prices in rural areas are excluded. The producer price
index (PPI) (July 2006=100) covers a sample of small and medium-size establishments, as well as
goods for processing establishments in the tax-free zones (i.e., “maquila”). There is scope for
expanding the coverage of the PPI to the service sector.
Labor market statistics are scarce and unemployment figures are available irregularly during the year.
Government finance statistics (GFS). Authorities are making significant progress in implementing
the GFSM 2001 methodology. However, the fiscal data still present large discrepancies between the
overall balance compiled by the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (MHCP) and the financing data
compiled by the BCN. Therefore, stronger collaboration is needed between the MHCP and the BCN to
derive more accurate and timely estimates of external and domestic financing of the nonfinancial
public sector.
The MHCP disseminates government finance statistics (GFS) covering only the central administration,
and compiles annual GFS for the nonfinancial public sector (NFPS) for internal use and for reporting
to the Western Hemisphere Department. The BCN reports budgetary central government data, albeit
with considerable delay, for publication in the International Financial Statistics. In 2006 the MHCP
reported GFS data for publication in the GFS Yearbook.
Monetary finance statistics: Monetary statistics are, in general, consistent with the Monetary and
Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM, 2000). In January 2012, STA provided technical assistance under the
Regional Project on Harmonization of Monetary and Financial Statistics to develop a work plan to
compile surveys for the other financial corporations following the recommendations of the Monetary
and Financial Statistics Manual and Monetary and Financial Statistics Compilation Guide. Authorities
are encouraged to start the compilation of monthly data for insurance companies and recommended

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NICARAGUA

the compilation of the monetary and financial statistics for credit and savings cooperatives.

External sector statistics: Balance of payments statistics broadly follow the concepts and definitions
set out in the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5), within the limits set by the
availability of information sources.
A. Resident institutional units are defined in conformity with BPM5’s concepts of economic territory,
residency, and center of economic interest. However, coverage of the private sector is incomplete; this
is the case in both the current and financial accounts. Major coverage weaknesses include areas such
as services, compensation of border employees, and financial transactions. Despite some recent
progress, there is scope for better coordination with the Superintendency of Banks and Other
Financial Institutions to access more disaggregated data on insurance services data and the
implementation of insurance’s accounts catalog.
B. With assistance from CAPTAC, the Central Bank of Nicaragua has been developing a system of
Integrated Indices of Prices, Value, and Volume for Imports and Exports. Preliminary unit value indices
have been developed. However, some of these unit value indices could be improved.
Data dissemination and Quality: Nicaragua has participated in the General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS) since February 2005. Data ROSC was published in December 2005.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Nicaragua
On December 4, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation 1 with Nicaragua.
Over the past two years, macroeconomic developments in Nicaragua have been generally
favorable. Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew by an average of 5¼ percent
during 2011–12, and the annual average inflation was 7¼ percent during the same period.
Looking ahead, the macroeconomic outlook also remains broadly positive. Real GDP is
expected to grow by 4¼ percent in 2013 and then stabilize at its potential level of 4 percent
over the medium-term. Inflation is projected to remain at about 7 percent supported by the
crawling-peg exchange rate system that has helped anchor inflation expectations.
Fiscal discipline contributed to lower public debt ratios. After a balanced position in 2011,
the combined public sector experienced a deficit of ¾ percent of GDP last year. In 2013, the
deficit is expected to widen to 1½ percent of GDP. This reflects mostly an increase in capital
spending by public sector enterprises while the accounts of the central government are
projected to remain balanced. As a result, the ratio of public debt to GDP is projected to
decline to about 42 percent in 2013, compared with 50 percent in 2010.
The external position remains vulnerable. The external current account deficit is projected to
be about 13 percent of GDP in 2013, broadly unchanged from the previous year, reflecting a
large dependence on oil imports and relatively tepid increases in exports and remittances
inflows. Strong capital inflows, mostly foreign direct investment (FDI) and oil-related
financing from Venezuela, are expected to help finance the current account deficit and
increase gross international reserves to nearly US$2 billion (equivalent to 3½ months of
imports).

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2

The soundness indicators of the banking system appear robust. The average adequacy ratio of
the system was 13 percent as of August 2013, above the regulatory norm of 10 percent and
nonperforming loans have declined from their 2009 peak. However, commercial bank credit
to the private sector increased rapidly over the past two years. As of August 2013, bank
credit increased by 23 percent (yoy), following an annual increase of 26 percent in 2012.
Credit expansion was the strongest in the personal loan sector.
Progress is being made in the structural reform area. In 2012, a tax reform was approved
featuring the elimination of some VAT exemptions, changes in the personal income tax
thresholds, and a plan for further rationalization of tax exemptions over the medium term. In
April 2013, electricity tariffs were increased by close to 13 percent to bring the actual tariffs
closer in line with international energy prices.
The near-term outlook contains risks. Adverse external shocks, such as the deterioration of
Nicaragua’s main export prices (e.g., for coffee, gold, and meat) or an increase in oil prices,
could widen trade deficits and negatively impact growth. A slowdown in global economic
activity could reduce FDI and remittances inflows. Also, the terms and levels of the
economic cooperation with Venezuela could change and add to external pressures. On the
domestic front, the rapid increase in private sector credit could pose risks and merits careful
monitoring.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed Nicaragua’s stable macroeconomic condition despite the
weak global environment. They commended the authorities’ efforts to maintain fiscal
discipline and monetary stability, which, combined with progress in structural reform, have
helped to strengthen confidence and boost economic growth. However, Directors noted that
downside risks remain, stemming from Nicaragua’s large external deficit and uncertainties
regarding the global outlook and the oil import financing scheme with Venezuela. They
welcomed the authorities’ commitment to continue implementing prudent macroeconomic
policies and structural reforms and encouraged development of contingency plans to address
potential external vulnerabilities.
Directors stressed that fiscal discipline should remain the cornerstone of Nicaragua’s
macroeconomic policy framework. They supported the fiscal stance of the draft 2014 budget,
which, while incorporating a wage bonus, remains consistent with the medium term goals of
strengthening fiscal buffers and lowering further public debt ratios. They underscored the
importance of broadening the revenue base by fully implementing the 2012 tax reform,
rationalizing public expenditures, and reforming the pension system to ensure its financial
viability, while reinforcing the social safety net. Directors noted that the risk of external
public debt distress remains moderate, and called for renewed efforts to conclude debt relief

negotiations with non-Paris Club official creditors. In this respect, they encouraged all
creditors to deliver fully the debt relief envisaged under the HIPC Initiative.
Directors agreed that monetary policy should aim to contain inflation and keep the real
exchange rate broadly in line with fundamentals, and that external reserves coverage should
stay above the established international benchmarks. Directors also observed that, while
financial soundness indicators appear to be satisfactory, the recent rapid, albeit slowing,
increase in bank credit to the private sector needs to be monitored closely. They welcomed
the progress in strengthening bank supervision and the authorities’ commitment to continue
recapitalizing the central bank.
Directors encouraged the authorities to advance quickly with structural reforms to spur
economic growth and reduce poverty. These would include reforms to lower informality in
labor markets, improve and expand education and training, reduce dependence on oil
imports, and strengthen the framework for private investment in infrastructure. Directors
welcomed the authorities’ intention to expand further the electricity sector’s capacity and
efficiency, and encouraged continued reform of the subsidy system to reduce fiscal risks.
Directors commended the increased dissemination of information on international
cooperation, and recommended full disclosure of the oil import financing agreement with
Venezuela.

Statement by Mr. Nogueira Batista, Executive Director for Nicaragua, Mr. Torres,
Alternate Executive Director, and Mr. Coronel, Advisor to the Executive Director
December 4, 2013
The Nicaraguan authorities appreciate the dialogue with IMF staff. Discussions were
forthright, transparent, and the results openly shared with the Nicaraguan people.
Following a successful three-year Extended Credit Facility (ECF) program (that ended in
2011) the Fund and the government of Nicaragua have consolidated a constructive
relationship.
Solid progress on the reform agenda
Based on its Economic and Financial Program (2013-16), and as part of an ongoing
engagement with the Fund, the government made significant progress in major areas.
Staff acknowledged the progress made and agreed with the authorities that Nicaragua
needs neither external financial support nor a new IMF program.
Progress on the reform agenda can be summarized as follows:
1.
A tax reform, the “Ley de concertacion tributaria” (Consensus tax law) was
approved by the National Assembly in 2012 and entered into full force in January 1st
2013. It will increase revenues and improve tax administration, and is consistent with
IMF recommendations. Nicaragua’s fiscal authorities estimate that tax revenues will
increase by an equivalent of 0.21 percent of GDP.
2.
A reform of the electricity sector to provide financial stability and improve
competitiveness. A financially sound private company1 recently acquired almost all the
country’s electricity distribution facilities. The government has approved new legislation
and is already enforcing measures to reduce technical and non-technical losses (including
theft)2. It is also supporting community-based plans to commercially integrate illegal
connections3. These actions are part of the deal negotiated with the aforementioned
private company and are being supervised by the country’s independent regulator. Along
with improved maintenance plans and increased infrastructure investment, they will
strengthen the sector’s performance. Oil price dependency still constitutes the main risk,
but the electricity industry continues to reduce its dependence on subsidies as tariffs
adjustments progressively narrow the gap between the reference price for distributors
(close to the cost of generation) and the actual price charged to consumers.
3.
Improvements in providing information on off-budget operations. As staff notes
the “solidarity bonus”4 paid to low-income state employees, formerly an off-budget
1

The TSK energy group and the Andalusian Company Melfosur, with which TSK has partnered for several
projects, purchased from Gas Natural–Union Fenosa more than 83% of the two biggest distribution utilities
in Nicaragua.
2
Non-technical losses in electricity distribution include mainly electricity theft, but also losses due to poor
equipment maintenance, calculation errors and accounting mistakes.
3
Recent successful experiences in the cities of Leon and Managua have been implemented with IDB and
WB financing.
4
This bonus is a monthly allowance of US$ 20 for each of the approximately 150,000 low-income
government employees (those who earn less than US$ 230/month). It costs about US$ 40 million per year
or 0.38 percent of GDP.

expenditure financed by Venezuelan cooperation, has been integrated into the 2014
budget. The government decided to include the bonus as a permanent payroll benefit to
partially reduce accumulated disparities in public sector salaries.
4.
Social security reform ensuring financial sustainability until (at least) 2030.
Negotiations between representatives of labor, the private sector and the government are
well under way. The purpose is to reach consensus on social security reform based on a
proposal presented by the government5. It is important to note that in Nicaragua the
informal sector is still very large (out of 3 million economically active, only 21 percent
are affiliated to the national pension system). Increasing the number of social security
subscribers will contribute to the pension’s system sustainability and also increase the tax
base. The government has acknowledged a debt of US$ 580 million with the Social
Security Institute and will start honoring it in 2014. The authorities anticipate that
consensus will be attained by the end of the year so that the reform could be enacted by
January 2014.
Economic growth has been strong
Nicaragua’s growth remains relatively strong, averaging 5.3 percent in the last two years.
Quarterly GDP reached an inter-annual growth (y-o-y) of 5.3 percent during the first
semester of 2013, mainly driven by construction, industry, and the primary sector. The
authorities conservatively project 4.8 percent GDP growth for 2013.
In the authorities’ medium term forecast (2014-2017) growth hovers between 4.7 and 5
percent. This projection is based on the performance of the manufacturing industry
(mainly food products and textiles), construction, and on estimates of potential gains in
agricultural productivity, as well as on further expansion of energy generation and
coverage. The authorities’ forecast is somewhat higher than that of the IMF staff, which
projects medium-term growth at 4 percent . For 2014 (assuming the continued recovery
of the economy in the United States, stable commodity prices, and the normalization of
local meat production), the Central Bank of Nicaragua (CBoN) projects 4.5 percent
growth.
Monetary policy has worked well, yet authorities envisage the possibility of changes
in the medium term
Inflation receded in 2012 (partly due to moderation in oil prices) and has remained stable
since then. Headline inflation is projected at 7.4 percent and core inflation at 6.5 percent
by the end of 2013. The preservation of the crawling peg and the maintenance of an
adequate level of international reserves have been priorities for monetary policy. The
authorities consider that the peg arrangement has successfully anchored inflation, while
helping to maintain external competiveness over the years. Yet the 5 percent annual crawl
also provides an undesirable floor to inflation and interest rates, limiting the elbow room
for monetary policy. The hyperinflation experienced in the 1980’s led to high levels of
dollarization in Nicaragua. Consumers and economic agents in general welcomed and got
5

The proposal puts forward several options, all of which ensure financial sustainability.

used to the crawling peg system. All in all, the authorities are willing to explore with staff
alternative policy options for a gradual transition towards a less dollarized economy in
the long run.
External sector remains stable and well financed
The external sector reflects the reduction of global demand for commodities. Exports
decreased by 9.3 percent in value terms (y-o-y) until August 2013, but manufactured
products from free-trade zones (textiles, car harnesses, among others) and tourism
continue to perform favorably and total exports are expected to be higher than last year’s.
Oil imports excluded, the current account deficit is narrowing. While exports have more
than doubled since 2009, non-oil imports have increased by 83 percent. Netting-out oil
imports, the current account deficit has dropped from 10 percent of GDP in 2002 to 1.5
percent in 2012.
Furthermore, in the medium-run the changes in the electricity matrix are expected to
continue reducing oil imports. The current account deficit is still quite high (12.9 of GDP
in 2012 and projected at 13.2 percent in 2013), reflecting Nicaragua’s dependence on oil
imports. However, it is expected to remain stable and be covered mostly by foreign direct
investment. International reserve levels are adequate and stable and the CBoN considers
that the real effective exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals.
Fiscal consolidation efforts paid off
The Central Government’s consolidation efforts have paid off as its primary balance has
been slightly above equilibrium between 2010 and 2012. In 2013, the primary surplus is
expected to reach 1.1 percent of GDP.
The evolution of taxes until September 2013 was consistent with the country’s economic
performance and the effects of the 2012 tax reform. Until September 2013 government
revenue grew at an inter-annual accumulated rate of 13.6 percent, reflecting the general
VAT and income tax upturn in the first half of the year.
The overall balance of the “Combined Public Sector” (after grants) went from
equilibrium in 2011 to a 0.7 percent deficit in 2012. Despite higher revenues, the deficit
is projected to increase to 1.4 percent of GDP in 2013 due to an expansion in capital
spending. However, staff and the authorities agree that this is a manageable deficit
considering that fiscal revenues are increasing and economic growth, together with
prudent fiscal policies, have put public debt firmly on a downward path. According to the
CBoN public debt is projected to drop from 42 percent of GDP in 2013 to about 35
percent of GDP by 20186.

6

Staff has a slightly less favorable projection: a decline from 42.4 to 37.5 percent of GDP between 2013
and 2018 (Table 10 of the staff report).

The authorities are committed to pursue further fiscal consolidation and agree with staff
that this will require implementing social security reform, concluding debt negotiations
with non-Paris Club creditors, better targeting electricity subsidies and strengthening the
Water Utility Company (ENACAL).
The country’s financial sector remains stable and well capitalized
Staff notes that credit expansion has been rapid and argues that this could increase the
financial system’s vulnerabilities. This remains one of the few areas of disagreement with
staff. By the end of July, average capital adequacy in the banking system was 3 percent
higher than the regulatory requirement, and NPLs were less than 2 percent of total loans.
Credit expansion follows a period in which credit virtually did not exist. Moreover, the
pace of credit expansion is moderating while deposits continue to increase. The CBoN’s
favorable assessment of the financial system is based on these factors, as well as on
positive indicators of the quality of credit and profitability of commercial banks.
Productivity, the Nicaraguan economy’s soft spot
Low productivity constitutes the main constraint for long-term growth. The authorities
are persuaded that to increase Nicaragua’s very low agricultural yields (despite the
fertility of its land) and better position the agro-industrial sector in international valueadded chains, the government will need to step-up investment in infrastructure and in
human capital development. With this in mind the government is striving to strengthen
the quality of (and facilitate access to) technical education. The Inter-American
Development Bank and the World Bank Group are supporting these efforts.
Concluding remarks
Nicaragua has achieved considerable progress on the macroeconomic and structural
reform fronts, as acknowledged by staff. Yet the authorities are mindful of the paramount
challenges that remain. Elevated and persistent poverty levels, a long-standing lag in
basic infrastructure and competitiveness, as well as relatively weak human development
indicators, are reminders of the tasks ahead.
Nicaragua is committed to continue implementing coherent macroeconomic and
development policies to remove structural hurdles, achieve higher productivity levels and
improve income distribution. The Government counts on the Fund’s support through
policy advice and capacity building tailored to the country’s specific needs and
circumstances.
