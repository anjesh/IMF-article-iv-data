VIETNAM
Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2004 Consultation with Vietnam
Approved by Masahiko Takeda and Anthony Boote
November 5, 2004
•

A mission visited Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City during August 25-September 9 to conduct
the 2004 Article IV consultation and discuss the Ex Post Assessment (EPA) of Vietnam’s
long-term program engagement with the Fund.

•

The team comprised Mr. Ishii (head), Mr. Aitken, and Ms. Al-Mashat (all APD), Ms. Muñoz
(formerly APD, currently AFR), Mr. Wang (formerly PDR, currently APD), and Mr. Lueth
(FAD), and Ms. Soon Ling Chin (Consultant, MFD), and was assisted by Mrs. Adams
(Senior Resident Representative). Ms. Rogers (OED) attended some of the meetings.

•

Vietnam’s three-year PRGF arrangement (SDR 290 million) expired on April 12, 2004. Only
two reviews were completed, with SDR 124.2 million disbursed. Since the expiration, the
Fund has continued to provide analysis and policy assessments on macroeconomic and
financial sector issues, supplemented by an active technical assistance program. In addition,
the Fund has cooperated closely with the World Bank as it continues its Poverty Reduction
Support Credit program, and provided regular assessments to donors in the Consultative
Group process.

•

In concluding the last Article IV consultation in October 2003, Directors noted that prudent
macroeconomic management had provided an environment conducive to growth, and that the
transition to a more market-oriented economy and increasing integration into the global
economy had been key to poverty reduction. Nonetheless, they cautioned that the transition
process was still incomplete, with the authorities facing challenges, especially in reform of
state-owned commercial banks and enterprises.

•

Vietnam’s statistical base has significant limitations for surveillance purposes. STA is
providing assistance to address deficiencies in the national accounts, prices, and monetary
statistics. Vietnam has become a subscriber to GDDS, with its metadata posted on the official
website (Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board) since September 2003.

•

Vietnam maintains exchange rate restrictions under the transitional arrangement of Article
XIV, Section 2, and a number of restrictions are subject to approval under Article VIII. The
capital account is also subject to extensive controls.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
•

Economic growth remains strong in 2004, despite the impact of the avian flu
outbreak and droughts on agricultural output. Led by strong export performance,
real GDP growth of 7-7½ percent is expected for the year.

•

CPI inflation rose sharply to about 10 percent in September 2004, driven by supplyside shocks. Since July, however, food inflation has fallen rapidly, contributing to a
decline in annualized monthly inflation to 4½ percent in September.

•

Credit growth has accelerated to 36 percent in July 2004. In response, the authorities
have raised reserve requirements and also taken a range of administrative and fiscal
measures.

•

The pace of structural reform in state-owned banks and enterprises has been slow,
despite the January 2004 Party Plenum’s initiatives to accelerate key reforms.

Key Issues and Staff Recommendations
•

The authorities should tighten monetary conditions further if there are signs of
second-round effects from the supply-side price shocks. Aside from inflationary
considerations, credit growth should be reduced significantly to prevent a further
deterioration in banks’ asset quality.

•

The policy of keeping the dong-US dollar exchange rate and interest rates stable
could weaken the reserve position. Moving toward greater exchange rate flexibility
would facilitate adjustments to external shocks and rapid structural changes, and allow
for a further strengthening of the relatively weak reserve position.

•

The pace of structural reforms in state-owned banks and enterprises should be
accelerated to sustain economic growth and poverty reduction over the medium
term. Equitization of large state-owned commercial banks and enterprises—a key
reform measure—should be aimed at transforming their operations to a more
commercial basis.1

•

WTO accession would help sustain export growth and foreign direct investment
over the medium term. Vietnam’s WTO commitment will also help catalyze other
structural reforms.

•

Transparency as well as reliability and timeliness of data should be improved,
particularly in the areas of balance of payments, fiscal operations, foreign exchange
reserves, national income accounts, and state-owned banks and enterprises.

1

Equitization, a form of privatization, involves share sales of a portion of state capital in an
enterprise.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The three-year PRGF arrangement expired in April 2004. Although the program
had been de facto suspended since late-2002 over the authorities’ reluctance to comply with
the Fund’s safeguards policy, it had achieved a number of successes. Strong output growth
and low inflation remained throughout the PRGF period, resulting in further poverty
reduction (Table 1), and progress in trade liberalization was impressive. Nevertheless, the
pace of reforming state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs) and state-owned enterprises
(SOEs) has been slow. Aiming to ensure continued strong growth and poverty reduction, the
Communist Party Plenum held in January 2004 called for acceleration in several structural
reforms, including initiating the equitization of one of the four large SOCBs, increasing the
pace of equitizing major SOEs, and actively pursuing integration into the international
economy.
2.
The Article IV consultation and EPA discussions provided a timely opportunity
to assess policy achievements under the PRGF-supported program and to take stock of
Vietnam’s challenges ahead. The discussions also took place in the context of rising
inflation, which together with rapid credit expansion, poses significant challenges for
macroeconomic management.

In 2003, real GDP growth
remained strong (7¼ percent), led by
investment and export growth
(Table 2, Figure 1).2 Fixed capital
formation increased by 15 percent.
Exports were robust, mainly benefiting
from the U.S.-Vietnam Bilateral Trade
Agreement, as well as higher oil
prices. Private consumption, which
increased by 7-7½ percent, was also an
important contributor to overall
growth.

Growth declined in the first quarter of 2004 but began to rebound in the
following months. In the first quarter of the year, agricultural production fell, mainly
reflecting the avian flu outbreak and droughts, and manufacturing and construction growth

slowed since higher world commodity prices—notably steel—caused a delay in investment
projects. The impact of these developments was mitigated by buoyant exports led by oil
exports (Box 1 on the impact of oil price increases). Since then, agriculture production has
recovered and industrial production rebounded.
5.
Inflation, which was moderate in 2003, rose to 10 percent (year-on-year) in
September 2004 driven by supply shocks. Food prices, which account for about 48 percent
of the CPI basket, jumped in early 2004, owing to the avian flu outbreak, droughts, and rising

rapidly, contributing to a decline in annualized monthly inflation to 4¼ percent (seasonally
adjusted) in September. Non-food inflation has remained subdued, averaging only 2 percent
during the first nine months of 2004.

Vietnam’s overall balance of payments strengthened in 2003 despite a widened
current account deficit (Table 3, Figure 2). Export growth was outpaced by import growth,

-7Box 1. The impact of Oil Price Increases on Vietnam’s Economy
The oil sector plays an important role in the economy.
•

Vietnam is a net exporter of oil. It exports about 16-18 million metric tons of crude oil per year,
accounting for almost 20 percent of its total annual exports. Since Vietnam has no oil refineries,
it imports some 10 million metric tons of petroleum products per year, about 10 percent of its
total imports. The net oil export proceeds amount to US$1.3-1.4 billion, close to 4 percent of
GDP per year.

•

Revenues from crude oil exports amount to roughly 5 percent of GDP; import duties, VAT and
excises on imported petroleum products add another 1–2 percent of GDP. The government
typically adjusts import duties on petroleum products in response to oil price fluctuations to
stabilize the domestic prices.

•

Petroleum product prices are administered in Vietnam. They represent 3 percent of the CPI
basket, but indirectly affect an additional 3 percent of the basket through electricity and
transportation costs.

Oil price increases have had an important macroeconomic impact.
•

An increase in net oil exports for 2004 as whole is estimated at US$490 million (1.2 percent of
GDP). Net oil exports increased by US$350 million (0.9 percent of GDP) in the first eight
months of the year, as crude oil exports and petroleum product imports increased by 40 and 24
percent (y/y), respectively.

•

A net fiscal impact of 1.5 percent of GDP is expected in 2004. Revenues from crude oil exports
are projected to exceed the budget target by 2.6 percent of GDP. Import duties on petroleum
products have been reduced to virtually zero since end-May, causing revenue losses of 0.7
percent of GDP. Adjustments in domestic petroleum prices fell short of world price increases,
likely requiring subsidies of 0.4 percent of GDP in 2004. SOEs have been advised to absorb a
part of higher input prices through lower profit margins, but the revenue impact is difficult to
estimate.

•

Administered petroleum product prices were increased in February and again in June 2004,
adding almost 2 percentage points to 12-month inflation.

Future oil price increases would improve the external current account balance and increase
fiscal leeway, but may threaten domestic price stability. Based on staff estimates, an additional
US$ 5 per barrel increase in the world oil price would:
•

Bring additional net oil export proceeds of US$290 million, or about 0.8 percent of GDP.

•

Increase crude oil revenues by about 0.9 percent of GDP. Given that import duties can not be
adjusted downward much further, total revenues would increase commensurately. With
regulated prices at their current level, subsidies would increase by about ½ percent of GDP
annually.

•

Raise 12-month inflation by about 0.7 percentage points, assuming full pass-through of higher
oil prices.

10.
The authorities have taken a series of monetary and administrative measures in
response to rising inflation and rapid credit growth. In early July 2004, reserve
requirements on dong and foreign currency deposits were increased from 2 percent and
4 percent to 5 percent and 8 percent, respectively. In addition, the government cut the tariffs
on petroleum and steel products, and the Prime Minister issued a directive in August 2004
calling for a cut in government recurrent expenditure and lending by SOCBs, a strengthening
of enterprises’ efforts to reduce production and distribution costs, and a tightening of price
control enforcement.

8.
Vietnam’s real effective exchange rate depreciation in 2003 was reversed in 2004
(Figure 2). Despite only a 1¾ depreciation in the dong-US dollar exchange rate, the
depreciation of the US dollar against other major currencies resulted in a 6 percent real
effective depreciation of the dong in 2003. While the dong-US dollar exchange rate has been
kept virtually unchanged since early 2004, a sharp rise in inflation has resulted in a 6 percent
appreciation of the dong in real effective terms. Nevertheless, Vietnam’s external
competitiveness is likely to remain adequate provided that the supply-side price shocks and
the civil service wage increase in October 2004 do not lead to widespread wage increases.

12.
The fiscal outturn through the first half of 2004 was better than budgeted.
Revenues outperformed budget expectations, reflecting higher oil prices. Recurrent spending
remained in line with the budget despite exceptional outlays for avian flu and oil price
subsidies. Capital spending was also on track, but domestically-financed on-lending reached
only 30 percent of the budget target by mid-year.

under a benign scenario in which food

latter months of the year, export growth is likely to slow, with the current account deficit
in 2004 projected to remain at 4¾ percent of GDP. While ODA inflows would remain strong,

FDI inflows would decline, in part reflecting investors’ wait-and-see attitude relating to the
uncertain timing of Vietnam’s WTO accession. Reduced short-term capital inflows would
allow for only a modest accumulation of international reserves. Initiatives to tighten projects’
eligibility requirements for domestically-financed on-lending and reduced expenditure are
expected to lead to a significant fiscal tightening compared to 2003.
14.
Although Vietnam will face some external challenges in 2005, the overall growth
outlook is projected to be broadly unchanged, with inflation expected to decline. A
projected decline in some commodity prices (such as rice) and the elimination of textile
quotas for WTO members—which could expose Vietnam to greater competition—could lead
to a significant decline in export growth and a widening of the current account deficit. While
the deficit is expected to be covered by ODA financing and FDI inflows, there would be
limited scope for reserve accumulation without exchange rate or other policy adjustments.
With slower export growth offset by a rebound in agricultural production and a modest fiscal
stimulus, economic growth is projected to remain at about 7-7½ percent. If world commodity
prices decline as projected and the avian flu remains under control, inflation would fall to
around 5-6 percent.
15.
Under the staff’s baseline scenario, the medium-term outlook appears favorable
(Tables 6–7). Real GDP growth is expected to average 7 percent per year, supported by
export expansion (notably of manufactures), reflecting in part the assumption of a successful
WTO accession by end-2005. The external position is likely to remain manageable, with
current account deficits declining gradually and a steady increase in capital inflows driven by
strong FDI following WTO accession leading to an accumulation of reserves.

The outlook for 2005 and beyond,
however, is subject to several downside
risks. In the short run, measures taken so far
could be insufficient to substantially reduce
credit growth and contain inflation. This,
together with the possibility of higher-thanexpected food prices, could reverse the
downward trend in inflation and fuel
inflationary expectations. Over the medium
term, growth, which has been increasingly
supported by investments of uncertain
quality (as evidenced by a steadily rising
ICOR since 1992), could fall short of the
projected level if the efficiency of

- 11 -

investment does not improve. Prolonged delays in WTO accession could also threaten
growth prospects (Box 2). Moreover, public debt sustainability could be threatened if SOCB
performance does not significantly improve.4
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
17.
The discussions focused on rising inflation, rapid credit growth, and the policy
priorities needed to maintain strong growth over the medium term. The staff urged the
authorities to take further measures if inflationary expectations become entrenched and credit
growth does not decline significantly. While agreeing with this, the authorities’ near-term
policy priority remains achieving the growth target set under the five-year plan (2001–05).
The staff emphasized that beyond the short term, sustained economic growth and lasting
poverty reduction would hinge on the pace of structural reform, aimed at improving
efficiency of the state-owned sector, ensuring public debt sustainability, and encouraging
private investment.
A. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
18.
The SBV’s monetary policy is guided by a number of often conflicting economic
policy objectives, including economic growth, price and currency stability, and financial
system stability. The SBV’s ability to respond to inflationary shocks is further constrained by
its weak and underdeveloped indirect instruments and the dominance of SOCBs, which
frequently operate based on non-commercial objectives (Box 3). Against this background,
the authorities have taken a range of administrative and fiscal measures to supplement
monetary policy actions (as discussed above) in response to the increase in inflation.
19.
The SBV’s current policy is to stabilize the exchange rate while keeping interest
rates unchanged, with foreign exchange reserves adjusting as needed. The authorities
regarded the high inflation as reflecting temporary factors, and not loose monetary policy,
and expected inflation to fall in 2005. As a result, the SBV expected only a modest reserve
accumulation in 2004, but did not regard the current reserve position as a concern given the
large build-up in 2003.5
20.
The staff encouraged the SBV to tighten monetary conditions further if there are
signs of second-round effects from the supply-side price shocks, which could be reflected
in pressures on foreign exchange reserves and wages. The staff highlighted that increasing
the discount and refinancing rates would reinforce the authorities’ policy goal of containing

Box 2. Vietnam’s WTO Accession: Progress and Prospect
The prospect for Vietnam to become a WTO member by 2005⎯the publicly announced
government objective⎯remains unclear, despite strong efforts on the part of the
Vietnamese government and significant progress in the accession negotiations since May
2003. At the conclusion of the 8th WTO Working Party (WP) meeting on Vietnam’s
accession in June 2004, the WP members stated that an agreement with Vietnam is much
closer than at the December 2003 meeting. However, considerable work still remains in
continuing to negotiate market access and other terms of Vietnam’s membership, in
obtaining further clarification of Vietnam’s regulations and policies, and in Vietnam’s
putting in place the necessary legislation (e.g., the Law on Competition, the Amended
Commercial Law, the Common Investment Law). Vietnam concluded a bilateral trade
agreement with the EU, its largest trading partner, in October. The next WP meeting will be
held in December 2004, and significant progress by then is critical for an accession by end2005.
Achieving an early WTO accession is very important to Vietnam. Specifically,
•

Market access of Vietnam’s exports. As a WTO member, Vietnam would be able to
benefit from the eventual phasing out of quotas on textile and garments exports under
the WTO Agreement on Textile and Clothing, scheduled to begin in January 2005.
Textile and garments have been the major driver of Vietnam’s export growth,
accounting for nearly 20 percent of its total exports in 2003, and any delay in
accession would represent an important missed opportunity.

•

Investors’ confidence in Vietnam. WTO accession would help boost foreign direct
investment by unlocking additional investments that have been awaiting WTO
accession.

•

Reform momentum. The process of the WTO membership negotiation and the
eventual accession have been considered by the reformists within the government as
well as the donor community as an important mechanism to lock in and catalyze
structural reforms through external commitments.

- 13 -

Box 3. Monetary Policy Instruments in Vietnam
Monetary policy implementation at the SBV has partially evolved from one of heavy reliance on
direct credit control to the more frequent use of indirect instruments. Interest rates on dong
deposits and lending in both dong and foreign currency are liberalized, but the SBV still imposes
interest rate ceilings on enterprises’ foreign currency deposits. Open market operations (OMOs) were
introduced in 2000, and their use has increased since. The SBV provides two standing facilities, the
discount facility and the refinancing facility.
•

Through the discount facility, credit institutions can access SBV funds subject to quotas, and the
maximum term of drawing is 91 days.

•

The refinancing facility is a collateralized lending facility.

The discount and refinancing facility rates form the lower and upper bands of an interest rate
corridor that is set by the SBV and

The SBV also announces a base
rate, which was introduced in 2000
to provide a reference rate for
commercial banks’ lending rates.
However, the relationship between
the base rate and other interest rates
has been very weak.

The SBV continues to use less
market-based monetary policy instruments such as reserve requirements considered by the SBV
to be the most effective policy instrument. Reserve requirements are differentiated by bank, currency,
and maturity. The SBV pays interest on required reserves in dong and on excess reserves in foreign
currency.

- 14 -

credit growth (see below) and fighting inflation. While noting the authorities’ concern that
raising interest rates could adversely affect short-run growth and weaken the balance sheets
of vulnerable SOEs, the staff argued that an interest rate increase would help contain
inflationary expectations and safeguard the quality and sustainability of long-run growth. The
authorities agreed that maintaining macroeconomic stability was a priority, and signaled a
willingness to tighten monetary conditions further if there are signs that inflationary
expectations are becoming entrenched. However, the SBV preferred to rely on reserve
requirements rather than interest rates, maintaining that with indirect instruments
underdeveloped,6 the transmission mechanism of interest rates on inflation was both weak
and slow.
21.
Aside from inflationary considerations, the authorities broadly shared the staff’s
view that a significant reduction in credit growth was needed, given uncertain loan
quality and its implications for bank balance sheets. The authorities emphasized that rapid
credit growth was needed to support the government’s growth objectives, but regarded the
current rate as too high. The SBV argued that recent policy actions—including the doubling
of reserve requirement ratios, and the SBV’s instruction to SOCBs to curb their lending to
inefficient investment projects—should bring about a reduction in credit growth in 2004.
However, the staff saw no clear sign that credit growth had fallen, and urged the SBV to take
further measures if credit growth does not decline significantly.

22.
The staff emphasized the risks of a de facto pegged exchange rate regime. The
authorities stated their intention to keep the dong-US dollar exchange rate broadly stable in
the near future, with the SBV

foreign exchange exposure in the economy. The staff urged the authorities to move toward
greater exchange rate flexibility, both intra-day and over time, and to limit intervention to
addressing temporary disorderly conditions. Introducing greater flexibility would also
facilitate adjustments to external shocks and rapid structural changes, and allow for a further
strengthening of Vietnam’s relatively weak reserve position.
B. Fiscal Policy
23.
The staff noted that the authorities were pursuing a more cautious fiscal stance
in 2004 than budgeted. The authorities agreed that revenue was on pace to exceed budget
estimates, but were less optimistic than the staff regarding the amount of excess revenues,
projecting the deficit including net lending to exceed 3½ percent of GDP. The staff
welcomed the authorities’ intention to keep capital spending and on-lending close to the
budgeted levels, given their uncertain quality.
24.
Annual budget targets for 2005 and beyond should be set consistent with
medium-term public debt sustainability. The authorities are currently targeting a budget
deficit (including net lending) in 2005 of about 5 percent of GDP. The staff argued that the
5 percent deficit target could be considered an upper bound estimate for a sustainable fiscal
stance based on illustrative projections of the public debt (Annex V), and encouraged the
authorities to reevaluate the 2005 fiscal stance and formulate annual budget targets beyond
based on a thorough assessment of the quality of SOCBs’ balance sheets. While a modest
fiscal stimulus in 2005 could be appropriate to offset an expected significant decline in
export growth, the staff urged the authorities to reduce the 2005 budget deficit target if
inflation remains high due to demand pressures.
25.
The authorities and staff agreed that revenue pressures were likely to increase
over the medium term, arising mainly from trade liberalization and stagnating oil revenues.
Reforms aimed at addressing structural weaknesses of the tax system might add to the
revenue pressures.7 The authorities noted their intention to maintain a revenue-to-GDP ratio
of 21–22 percent through improvements in tax administration, and to extend self-assessment
to additional taxpayers by January 2005, as recommended by a recent FAD TA mission. The
staff cautioned, however, that tax administration measures alone would be unlikely to
compensate for the projected revenue losses, and encouraged the authorities to begin
identifying possible tax measures which could be applied when needed.

7

Structural deficiencies include cascading features and restrictive rules on deductible
expenses in determining taxable income. Removing these deficiencies recommended by a
recent FAD TA mission could lead to a revenue loss.

- 16 -

26.
The authorities’ wage reform will align public wages closer to the market levels.
Wages in the higher ranks of the civil service have not kept pace with wage growth in the
private sector. Effective October 2004, the government has overhauled the pay scale for civil
servants to increase the wage spread, with the 30 percent pay increase on average financed by
a combination of retrenchment, cuts in non-wage recurrent expenditure, and recourse to offbudget revenues retained by spending units. The staff welcomed the widening of the wage
spread but warned that cuts in non-wage recurrent expenditure would exacerbate the existing
imbalance between recurrent and capital outlays. Ministry of Finance (MOF) officials shared
the staff’s concern about the low level of recurrent expenditures.
27.
The staff recommended that the price subsidies, used as a measure to fight
inflation, be temporary to minimize distortions and adverse effects on growth. The
authorities cut tariffs on petroleum and steel products and refrained from bringing domestic
petroleum prices in line with world prices. They argued that these measures were needed to
anchor inflationary expectations, and added that since Vietnam is a net exporter of oil, most
of the fiscal cost has been offset by windfall oil revenues.
28.
The staff welcomed the important steps taken by the authorities to streamline
on-lending activity, but underscored that loan quality remains uncertain. A recent
decree narrows the list of enterprises eligible for on-lending, brings interest rates more in line
with market levels, and limits state support to 85 percent of project costs. The authorities
noted that domestically financed on-lending would remain constant in nominal terms over the
medium term, implying a steady decline in relation to GDP.
C. Structural Reforms
Financial Sector Reform
29.
The SOCBs, which account for about 70 percent of the banking system’s total
assets, are the strategic weak point among Vietnam’s economic institutions, burdened
with low asset quality, multiple mandates from the government, significant
undercapitalization, and the poor capacity of credit assessment and risk management. While
the authorities have taken some initiatives, including the issuance of credit manuals by all
SOCBs, progress in SOCB reform has been slow.
30.
The staff recommended that the authorities develop a renewed comprehensive
reform strategy for the SOCBs. Such a strategy should include decisive steps to ensure that
lending is based on a strictly commercial objective and sound appraisals of repayment
capacity, banks are recapitalized to rebuild balance sheets, and nonperforming loans (NPLs)
are resolved and revalued. These steps need to be accompanied by measures to improve
governance, with the MOF exerting a more active ownership role and significantly
strengthening the SBV’s supervision in line with the recommendations of recent MFD TA.
31.
As a first step, the staff urged the authorities to obtain a more accurate
assessment of the quality of banks’ balance sheets, a prerequisite for effective banking
supervision. The authorities acknowledged that banks are likely to be showing an unrealistic

- 17 -

level of NPLs, and that current loan classification practices do not accurately reflect
customers’ ability to repay debt as well as their potential risk. As a result, current
provisioning practices are regarded as an inaccurate reflection of true capital needs.8 In
April 2004, the SBV launched an initiative to obtain financial indicators of the banks’ large
borrowers as a step toward obtaining a more accurate assessment of the SOCBs’ balance
sheet problems. However, the SBV has made little progress under this initiative, and
continues to have few concrete indicators of the true quality of banks’ balance sheets and the
size of their NPLs. The staff urged the authorities to accelerate progress in this area, and put
in place a more thorough and regular reporting framework for monitoring banks’ financial
performance.
32.
The staff emphasized the importance of the initiative to equitize Vietcom Bank
(VCB), one of the large state-owned banks, as a precedent for SOCB restructuring. 9
This initiative could provide impetus to reform provided that the result is stronger
governance, greater transparency, and a shift in the bank’s operations to a more commercial
basis. The equitization plan, originally scheduled to be submitted to the Prime Minister by
end-June 2004, has not yet been finalized, but the authorities indicated that it would likely
entail a sale of shares, possibly through public auction, with the government retaining a
sizeable majority shareholding. The staff recommended that the equitization process be
carefully designed to include a thorough assessment of the bank’s asset quality, fair and
transparent share sales procedures, and clear NPL resolution and recapitalization plans.
International experience with state bank reform has shown that the active involvement of
foreign strategic partners can be an effective way to improve the performance of state-owned
banks, and the staff urged the authorities to consider selling a large share of the VCB to
foreign strategic investors. The authorities noted that they would consider the staff’s
recommendations in developing a concrete equitization plan.

8

The staff’s highly tentative estimates indicate that the capital needed to bring SOCBs to
solvency is about 15 percent of GDP at end-2003.

9

Plans to equitize Mekong Housing Bank, a small SOCB, have been underway for some
time with the assistance of the IFC, and some progress has been made toward preparing this
bank for sale to foreign strategic partners.

- 18 -

SOE Reform
33.
Restructuring of SOEs continues at a slow pace. Plans to restructure large SOEs
are being prepared, but are not expected to be finalized before end-October 2004.
Restructuring of small- and medium-sized SOEs remains sluggish, and the authorities’ target
of restructuring over 1,000 enterprises by end-2004 looks out of reach. The authorities noted
that several initiatives are underway, including the issuance in August 2004 of a decree on
state-owned enterprise classification to reduce the number of strategic sectors to remain
under full state ownership, a process for assessing SOEs and assigning performance ratings
with the first ratings expected around the second half of 2005, and a new decree to be issued
shortly to improve the SOE equitization process.10 While welcoming these initiatives, the
staff recommended that plans to equitize large SOEs be designed carefully to increase
commercial incentives for managers and improve performance. Both the authorities and staff
agreed that the new enterprise rating system should lead to improved operations and
oversight of loss-making enterprises over time, but will need to be followed by strict
enforcement of timely reporting requirements, with the MOF taking the lead role in
identifying problem sectors and enterprises.
Private Sector Developments
34.
The authorities considered that the amendment to the Land Law issued last
year, yet to be implemented, is a key step facilitating further development of the private
sector. They also explained that significant progress has been made in eliminating
regulations that discriminate against privately-owned firms, and supporting small- and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The staff agreed that the full implementation of the Land
Law would speed up the registration of land and its allocation to private businesses, but
pointed out that with SOE reform lagging, private enterprises’ access to land will still be
limited, constraining private investment. The staff welcomed plans to unify the enterprise law
with the SOE law and the domestic investment law with the foreign investment law, which
could lead to an even playing field for all types of enterprises.
Trade Liberalization
35.
The authorities reiterated their intention to achieve WTO accession in 2005,
which is crucial to sustaining economic growth in the medium term. The staff commended
Vietnam’s significant trade liberalization in recent years, and expressed strong support for its

10

responsibilities of managers and supervisors, and increase the shares which would be sold
publicly through public auction rather than internally.

- 19 -

WTO accession objective and other efforts to promote free trade in the region as an ASEAN
member (e.g., ASEAN-China free trade area initiative). The authorities reported that active
preparations, such as harmonization of domestic legislation with WTO principles, were being
made in the run up to the next WTO working party meeting scheduled for late 2004, but
explained that the achievement of WTO accession would also hinge on conditions set by the
negotiating counterparties. The staff noted that significant steps would need to be taken in
order to secure WTO membership in 2005 and delays would place Vietnam’s export
industry, especially textiles and garments, at a significant disadvantage relative to its
competitors, and would also affect FDI inflows.
D. Other Issues
36.
Vietnam should improve transparency as well as reliability and timeliness of
data. Improvements are particularly needed in the areas of balance of payments, fiscal
operations, foreign exchange reserves, national income accounts, and state-owned banks and
enterprises. The authorities noted that they have taken steps, including the new Statistics Law
passed in January 2004, which would improve data collection by strengthening the
coordination among ministries and government agencies. The staff encouraged the
authorities to improve the timeliness of data provision to the IMF and to make more
economic and financial data (including international reserves and the banking data) available
to the public. The authorities and staff agreed that further TA is needed to help address these
weaknesses.
37.
The staff encouraged the authorities to eliminate remaining exchange
restrictions to accept the obligations of Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of
Agreement. This will facilitate Vietnam’s WTO accession. The authorities reiterated their
intention to accept Article VIII obligations and expressed interest in Fund TA to revise the
country’s foreign exchange restrictions law, which is an important step in Vietnam’s
preparation to accept Article VIII obligations.
38.
The authorities are committed to establishing an effective regime for AntiMoney Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) in line with
the recommendations of an MFD TA mission in December 2003. The staff underscored the
importance of avoiding further delays in the issuance of the AML Decree, which has already
been postponed to early 2005.
E. Ex Post Assessment of Longer-Term Program Engagement
39.
The staff discussed with the authorities the EPA report of Vietnam’s longerterm program engagement with the Fund. The authorities welcomed the report, which
they regarded as a candid assessment of the limitations and issues in developing and
implementing the ESAF and PRGF programs. The authorities provided the following specific
observations:
•

The authorities emphasized their ownership over the reform program, arguing that
from the beginning the government, the Fund, and the World Bank all agreed on the main

- 20 -

direction of reform and the essential elements required to ensure high and sustainable
growth. This commitment was reflected in Vietnam’s continued reform progress despite
the de facto suspension and expiration of the PRGF program.
•

The authorities argued that Fund conditionality should have better reflected actual
conditions in Vietnam and been more flexible in adjusting to implementation
challenges. In their view, this was particularly evident in the disagreements leading to the
suspension of the ESAF and PRGF programs; they regarded the Fund’s call for a
combination of rapid quota elimination and tariff reduction during the ESAF program as
in conflict with WTO principles and an impediment to their negotiations on multilateral
and bilateral trade agreements, and the safeguards requirements as outside the original
program commitments and incompatible with the Vietnamese legal framework. In some
cases, such as SOE reform, the authorities argued that the program’s goals were too
ambitious from the start, but they nevertheless agreed to them to obtain program
approval.

•

The authorities emphasized the importance of the Fund’s policy advice despite the
PRGF program’s suspension and expiration. Given the high level of financial support
from the World Bank and other donors, the authorities had never regarded access to Fund
resources as a main reason for Vietnam’s entering into program engagements with the
Fund. Rather, the benefit to Vietnam was access to the Fund’s policy advice and TA,
which they argued had assisted Vietnam considerably in macroeconomic stabilization,
creating conditions for high and sustainable economic growth, and accelerating structural
reforms. Given this, the authorities argued that the EPA report may have been too
pessimistic concerning the loss of Fund influence following the suspension of the PRGF
program.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL

40.
In recent years, Vietnam has succeeded in maintaining strong economic growth
and low inflation and achieving further poverty reduction, supported by favorable
macroeconomic conditions and increasing integration with the world economy facilitated by
trade liberalization.
41.
The near-term economic outlook is favorable, provided that the authorities can
contain inflationary expectations. Economic growth has rebounded following the
slowdown in the first quarter of 2004, and growth for 2004 as a whole is projected to be 77½ percent. Inflation would fall by end-2004 as the impact of the supply shocks subsides.
The current account deficit is manageable, financed by a combination of ODA and FDI
inflows. Lower short-term capital inflows, however, would allow for only a modest
accumulation of international reserves in 2004.
42.
Second-round effects from the supply-side price shocks are a potential risk. The
authorities have taken monetary policy actions supplemented by a number of administrative
and fiscal measures, but the effectiveness of these measures has yet to be seen. The staff

- 21 -

encourages the SBV to tighten monetary conditions if there are signs of the second-round
effects. In particular, higher interest rates would reinforce the authorities’ policy goal of
reducing credit growth and safeguard the quality and sustainability of long-run growth.
43.
Credit growth should be reduced significantly in light of uncertain loan quality
and the banks’ weak balance sheets. Although the significant increase in the reserve
requirement ratios has reduced liquidity in the banking system, the SBV should take further
measures if the pace of the credit growth does not fall significantly. Maintaining rapid credit
growth to meet the short-term growth target could lead to mounting quasi-fiscal liabilities,
which could threaten fiscal sustainability and long-term growth.
44.
The staff encourages the authorities to move toward greater exchange rate
flexibility, which would facilitate adjustments to external shocks and rapid structural changes
and allow Vietnam to further strengthen its modest reserve position. Increased exchange rate
flexibility also encourages market participants to manage exchange rate risks, thereby
avoiding excessive foreign exchange exposure in the economy. The staff calls for a more
rapid build up of international reserves by limiting foreign exchange intervention to
addressing disorderly conditions.
45.
The staff commends prudent fiscal management in 2004, with the budget deficit
including net lending expected to fall significantly below the targeted level. The staff
welcomes the authorities’ intention to save a large part of revenue overperformance while
keeping capital spending and on-lending close to the budgeted levels. Although price
subsidies used to fight inflation are mostly financed by windfall oil revenues, they should be
temporary.
46.
Annual budget targets should be set consistent with medium-term public debt
sustainability. While the decision to streamline on-lending activity is an important step in
the right direction, the staff recommends that annual budget targets for 2005 and beyond be
adjusted depending upon the size of fiscal costs of the banking sector restructuring. The staff
also urged the authorities to reduce the 2005 budget deficit target if inflation remains high
due to demand pressures. With further trade liberalization and stagnating oil revenues adding
revenue pressures, the authorities are encouraged to begin identifying possible tax measures
in addition to on-going tax administration measures to achieve their goal of maintaining
revenue at 21–22 percent of GDP.
47.
Sustaining strong growth and poverty reduction over the medium term hinges
on the pace of structural reforms in a number of key areas. These include restructuring of
SOCBs and SOEs, improving the private sector investment climate, securing WTO
accession, and enhancing governance and transparency of policy making.
48.
SOCBs are an important source of vulnerability in the economy, given their
dominance and uncertain asset quality. The authorities’ decision to equitize the VCB is a
welcome development and could provide impetus to SOCB reform provided that the
equitization ultimately shifts the bank’s operations to a more commercial basis. In light of

- 22 -

country experiences, which indicate the importance of the active involvement of foreign
strategic partners in improving the performance of state-owned banks, consideration should
be given to selling a large share of the bank to a foreign strategic partner. In addition to
equitization, the more active ownership role by the Ministry of Finance and measures to
strengthen the SBV’s supervision are important elements of SOCB reform.
49.
SOE reform also remains a key policy priority. The authorities are encouraged to
implement the new initiatives aimed at reducing the number of strategic sectors in which
SOEs will remain under full state ownership and expanding the equitization program to
include several large SOEs. In designing the equitization plans, consideration should be
given to increase commercial incentives for managers and improve performance. Assessing
and assigning performance ratings to SOEs is also a welcome development, but needs to be
followed by strict enforcement of timely reporting requirements.
50.
Further development of the private sector is key to a successful transition to a
more market-oriented economy. The elimination of regulations discriminating against the
private sector and measures supporting SMEs have helped the private sector expand rapidly.
The full implementation of the amendment to the Land Law would speed up land registration
and allocation to private businesses, facilitating private investment. The plans to unify the
enterprise law with SOE law and the domestic investment law with the foreign investment
law would also promote a level playing field.
51.
WTO accession is crucial to maintaining market access and sustaining
integration into the international economy and FDI inflows. The staff welcomes the
authorities’ intention to achieve WTO accession in 2005, which requires significant actions,
including putting in place necessary legislation.
52.
Vietnam is urged to accept the obligations of Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles
of Agreement as soon as possible, and eliminate remaining exchange restrictions. Since
there is no timetable for removing the restrictions, the staff does not recommend their
approval.
53.
Vietnam needs to improve transparency as well as reliability and timeliness of
data. Improvements are needed particularly in the areas of balance of payments, banking and
enterprises, fiscal data, and national income accounts. Passage of the new Statistics Law,
which would improve data collection by strengthening inter-agency coordination, is a
welcome development, but more timely data provision to the Fund and publication of more
economic and financial data are warranted.
54.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Vietnam take place
on the standard 12-month cycle.

Exchange Rate Arrangement and Exchange Restrictions:

On February 25, 1999 the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) revised the operation of the
interbank foreign exchange market. Under this de facto managed floating regime, the SBV allows
interbank foreign exchange market rates to fluctuate by a maximum of ±0.25 percent a day (effective
July 2002) from the previous day’s average interbank market rate.
Vietnam currently maintains the following exchange restrictions subject to Fund jurisdiction
under Article VIII: (i) a foreign exchange balancing requirement applying to foreign invested

- 35 -

ANNEX I

companies—i.e., enterprises whose capital is fully or partially owned by foreigners—such that the
ability of the companies to make payments and transfers for current international transactions is
contingent on their capability of generating foreign exchange and not on their foreign exchange
needs; (ii) limitations on the availability of foreign exchange for payments of moderate amounts of
amortization of loans or for depreciation of investment under the definition of current international
payments, which is not aligned with the definition of current international payments in Article XXX
(d) of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement; (iii) the existence of a group of “non-priority” import
payments corresponding to non-priority import goods, implying that banks would require such
customers to generate their own foreign exchange for such import payments, even though the
underlying import transaction would be allowed; and (iv) a requirement that residents and nonresidents fulfill all tax obligations before payments and transfers for current international
transactions may be made. The exchange restrictions described have not been approved by the
Executive Board.
VIII. Article IV and XIV Consultations:
Vietnam is currently on a 24-month consultation cycle, subject to provisions of Board
Decision No. 12794-(02/76) of July 15, 2002. The last Article IV and Article XIV consultations
were concluded by the Executive Board on October 3, 2003. Since the PRGF has expired, it is
expected to be on a standard 12-month cycle.
Vietnam continues to maintain restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions under the transitional arrangements of Article XIV, Section 2.
The Fund encourages Vietnam to eliminate these restrictions as soon as circumstances permit.

Vietnam— Relations with the World Bank11

V. PARTNERSHIP IN VIETNAM’S DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY
The government of Vietnam’s development strategy is set forth in its Comprehensive Poverty
Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS). The CPRGS focuses on: (i) high growth through a
transition to a market economy, (ii) an equitable, socially inclusive, and sustainable path of
growth, and (iii) the adoption of a modern public administration, legal, and governance
system. A Joint Staff Assessment of the CPRGS was discussed by the Boards of the IMF and
the World Bank in June and July 2002, respectively. A Joint Staff Assessment of the first
Progress Report of the CPRGS was discussed by the two Boards in February, 2004.
The World Bank has taken the lead in supporting the Government’s structural and
institutional reforms in a number of sectors, and has backed the reform program through a
series of Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSCs). The first PRSC, for US$250 million,
included measures to: (i) liberalize foreign trade; (ii) restructure or divest SOEs;
(iii) strengthen the banking system; (iv) create a better climate for the development of the
domestic formal private sector; and (v) improve the efficiency, equity, and transparency of
public spending. The final tranche was disbursed in December 2002. This PRSC was cofinanced by the UK, Netherlands, Denmark, and Sweden.
The second PRSC, signed in August 2003, was broader in scope. It extended beyond the
structural reform agenda and included measures related to socially inclusive development
and to modern governance. This second PRSC translated the development vision of CPRGS
into a series of concrete policy measures, and laid the foundation for a series of annual
PRSCs, until the revision of CPRGS, currently expected in 2006. It also established a series
of triggers to assess the pace of policy reform, and linked this to the size of subsequent
budget-support operations. The second PRSC, for US$100 million, was co-financed by the
UK, Netherlands and Denmark.
The third PRSC, approved by the Board in June 2004, endorses policy actions that are firmly
rooted in the CPRGS and other development plans and strategies with a strong Government
ownership. In so doing, it further deepens the reforms supported under the previous two
PRSCs and the PRGF. The credit identifies actions to support the unfinished reform agenda,
including the preparations for Vietnam’s early accession to the WTO, SOE and SOCB
reform, further progress in planning processes, and public financial management, and the
move towards a more systematic approach to fighting corruption. The third PRSC, for US$
100, is co-financed by seven bilateral and multilateral donors: the Asian Development Bank,

11

Contact person: Ms. Keiko Sato

- 39 -

ANNEX II

the Canadian International Development Agency, Denmark, the European Commission, the
Japan Bank for International Cooperation, Netherlands, and the United Kingdom’s
Department for International Development. Combined, this co-financing exceeds the amount
of the credit itself.
VI. WORLD BANK GROUP STRATEGY AND LENDING
The World Bank Group is combining all of its instruments of assistance to support the
objectives laid out by the CPRGS. Those instruments include analytical and advisory
activities, IDA project support, IFC, Mekong Project Development Facility (MPDF) and
MIGA activities, a series of PRSCs, and partnerships and ODA coordination. An update of
the Country Assistance Strategy, presented to the World Bank Board in January 2004, sets
out the planned support of the CPRGS objectives until the Bank’s FY06..
Virtually all IDA credits will support policy, institutional and infrastructure development for
Vietnam’s ongoing transition, with the planned series of PRSCs being used as vehicles for
the policy dialogue.
Several priorities are identified by the CPRGS to enhance equitable, inclusive, and
sustainable development. They refer to disadvantaged and lagging areas, to the living
standards of ethnic minorities, to gender equality, to access and affordability of social
services for the poor, to the mitigation of impacts from natural disasters, and to enhancing
environmental management. The World Bank favors a sector-wide approach for two projects
supporting this agenda, Rural Roads III and Education for All. Sectoral budget support
requires significant progress in the preparation of medium term expenditure frameworks, as
well as improved transparency and financial management.
Efforts to improve governance will focus on public financial management, information and
transparency, and legal development. Major technical assistance will be provided by the
World Bank in each of these areas. An IDA project is being implemented in Public Financial
Management and one on Customs Modernization is under preparation. So far, AsDB, UNDP,
and a number of donors have taken the lead on public administration and civil service reform,
whereas the World Bank plays the leading role in public financial management.
The CPRGS is widely recognized as a blueprint for development with strong national
ownership. It is now clear that the CPRGS approach will be mainstreamed into the 2006-10
five year-plan. At the same time, the momentum of reform has been energized by the
ongoing preparation for WTO accession. Over the past twelve months, the Government has
been actively working on the preparation of roadmaps for WTO accession for key sectors of
the economy. This work was supported by the World Bank. Securing compliance with WTO
rules, will be a powerful mechanism to lock-in reforms, especially on “behind-the-border”
issues.
The scale of the lending program depends on the pace of the policy and institutional reform
agendas, as well as on progress in project preparation and implementation. A CAS Progress
Report was endorsed by the Board in February 2004 with a revised and expanded operational

- 40 -

ANNEX II

program for FY04-06 of $750 million per year in the base case and $900 million in the high
case. In FY04, Vietnam was the largest recipient of IDA funds with total commitments of
$705 million. The IFC and MIGA programs are also expected to grow significantly as the
investment climate improves.
In addition to its lending program, the World Bank will work in capacity-building and
knowledge-sharing in key areas of emphasis. A Banking Sector Review was completed in
2002. A new household survey, the 2002 Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey, was
used as the basis for the Vietnam Development Report, titled“Poverty” in FY04. An
integrated Public Expenditure Review-Integrated Fiduciary Assessment was launched in
FY04 and is due to be finalized in FY05. Annually, the Vietnam Development Report, coauthored by a number of donors and NGOs, summarizes the accumulated knowledge and
fosters the policy and institutional reform agenda.
The World Bank has worked closely with the Ministry of Finance, the National Steering
Committee on Enterprise Reform and Development and the Ministry of Labor, Invalids and
Social Affairs in all areas of the SOE reform program. In parallel it has mobilized resources
from various donors to carry out the various activities. The World Bank plays a key role in
the monitoring of ownership transformation (especially equitizations, sales and liquidations)
and SOE creation. A series of operational reviews of large enterprise groupings are being
implemented with the objective of assessing SOE viability and financial position.
Restructuring three General Corporations (large SOE groupings) in sectors where Vietnam
has comparative advantage in world markets is also a priority. The design and
implementation of the social safety net for redundant SOE workers has been an integral part
of the World Bank’s work program. The World Bank is now turning its attention to assisting
in setting up the operations of the Debt Asset Trading Company (DATC), and towards
improving the monitoring SOE performance.
In the area of public expenditure management, key remaining challenges include:
(i) integrating formulation of the recurrent and capital budgets within a medium-term
expenditure framework; (ii) improving budgetary data and increasing the transparency of
data and information flows; and (iii) ensuring an effective process for prioritizing and
reallocating public expenditures to improve sector outcomes, reduce poverty and limit the
prospective increase in inequality. To meet these challenges, the Government launched the
Public Financial Management Reform Initiative (PFMRI), a medium-term program for
strengthening public financial management. This overarching program deals with reforms in
five areas: public expenditure management (including state budget management, investment
planning, and financial management information); public debt management; revenue
management; SOE fiscal risk management; and public asset management.
Jointly with other donors, the World Bank is also supporting an effort to modernize planning
and budgeting processes at the provincial level. This effort is part of a broader attempt by the
Government of Vietnam to “roll out” CPRGS to the provinces. The goal of the exercise is
for local policy makers to identify monitorable targets related to growth and poverty

reduction, to align resources to the attainment of those targets, and to introduce mechanisms
for consultation with the local population.
The World Bank, which has had a long-term role in the modernization of the financial sector,
has taken the lead in the effort to strengthen the banking system. Input has been provided by
way of direct technical assistance and policy dialogue, with the aim of rationalizing the Joint
Stock Banks, strengthening of State-Owned Commercial Banks (SOCBs), improving the
supervision of the system, and modernizing the infrastructure for banking. The areas of work
with the SOCBs have included the resolution of Non-Performing Loans (NPLs), provisioning
for loan loss, re-capitalizing banks as they meet their restructuring targets, introducing
internal auditing, and developing a viable payments system. Current efforts aim at improving
the regulatory framework for policy lending, and at developing more effective mechanisms
for NPL resolution.
The IMF and the World Bank currently collaborate to strengthen the capacity of the General
Statistics Office in the area of economic statistics. The IMF focuses on improving balance of
payments, national accounts, and price statistics while the World Bank concentrates on issues
related to the production of high-quality household and enterprise surveys, and to access to
data.

Vietnam—Relations with the Asian Development Bank
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) resumed its operations in Vietnam in October 1993.
The new Country Strategy and Program (CSP), endorsed in January 2002, proposes a focus
on four pillars to align ADB operations in Vietnam to the overarching objective of poverty
reduction: (i) sustainable growth through rural development and private sector development,
with a focus on small and medium enterprise development; (ii) inclusive social development,
by mainstreaming poverty, gender, and ethnic dimensions in ADB operations, with an
emphasis on human capital development through secondary education and health; (iii) good
governance, with special emphasis on public administration and civil service reform; and
(iv) geographic focus on the impoverished central region.
From October 1993 to June 2004, ADB approved 44 loans totaling about US$2.6 billion
from the concessional Asian Development Fund (ADF) and US$40 million from Ordinary
Capital Resources (OCR). Disbursements in 2003 totaled US$233.1 million, and in the first
six months of 2004, US$54.2 million. Since December 1998, Vietnam has been classified as
a B-1 country by ADB, which makes it eligible to supplement borrowing at ADF terms with
borrowing at non-concessional (OCR) terms. Loans have been provided mainly for
(i) rehabilitating physical infrastructure in the agricultural, energy, and transport sectors;
(ii) financial sector reform with focus on non-banking sector; (iii) public administration
reform; and (iv) preventive heath care and secondary education. In addition, ADB has
extended technical assistance (TA) amounting to US$101.21 million for 148 projects as of
end June 2004.
Support for policy and structural reforms to improve public sector efficiency and to
encourage the development of the private sector is a vital component of ADB operations in
Vietnam. So far, ADB has approved seven policy-based program loans in the agricultural
sector (US$80 million in 1994 and US$60 million in 2002), the financial sector
(US$90 million in 1996 and US$50 million in 2002), for SOE reform and corporate
governance (US$100 million in 1999, of which US$40 million was from OCR), and for
public administration reform (US$45 million in 2003). In addition to program lending, policy
dialogue is an important feature in all of ADB’s loan projects in Vietnam. This includes
support for private sector development and increased efficiency of state-owned utilities
through reforming their rate structure and other measures to increase cost recovery and to
strengthen financial management, policy analysis, and planning.
ADB was reorganized in 2002, and Vietnam belongs to the Mekong Department, along with
Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Thailand. The Vietnam Resident Mission has been
strengthened and has been performing programming functions. During the past year, ADB
has helped the government organize regional consultations and poverty assessments to
analyze Vietnam’s achievements against development targets in the areas of public service
delivery to people and business and good governance as part of the roll-out process of the
national strategy for growth and poverty reduction. ADB and Fund staff work closely
together to support the process of economic reforms in Vietnam. ADB staff participate in
Fund missions, exchange information, and consult on macroeconomic developments and
policy matters. The resident missions of the two institutions also cooperate closely.

ANNEX IV

Vietnam—Statistical Issues
The reliability and coverage of macroeconomic statistics have significant deficiencies. The
methodology for compilation and dissemination of these statistics continues to need substantial
improvement, so that data properly reflect economic developments and assist policy formulation,
implementation, and monitoring. The authorities are cooperating with the Fund, but work is
hampered in some areas by the lack of authorization to release data. Vietnam has few official
statistical publications that provide coverage beyond the real sector. A Vietnam page was
introduced in the GFS Yearbook in 1999 and in IFS in 2001.
Vietnam has become a subscriber to GDDS participant, with its metadata posted on the IMF’s
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board since September 2003.
National accounts
The General Statistical Office (GSO) disseminates quarterly and annual data on gross domestic
product (GDP) by type of economic activity and annual data by category of expenditure12 (both
in current and constant prices). While the methodology for producing national accounts is
broadly consistent with the System of National Accounts 1993, the compilation process suffers
from poor data collection practices and a lack of coordination and communication between data
collection agencies.
Estimates of GDP by expenditure have been produced since 1993, but they are in highly
aggregated form. Although coverage has been broadened recently, the authorities need to focus
on improving data collection from the nonstate sector (including non-observed activities), which
remains quite weak. The lack of frequent surveys on consumption and investment severely limit
the calculation of GDP by type of expenditure. In addition, much of the data on national accounts
are compiled before the end of the reference period, requiring data providers to resort to
forecasting data in the remaining period in order to derive relevant estimates.
Under the current project the expert will assist the GSO in the following areas: promoting the
effective use of enterprise and economic census data in compiling the national accounts statistics,
improving estimates of GDP at constant prices, estimates of household final consumption
expenditure, and estimates of quarterly GDP; developing foreign trade and producer price
indices, and wage indices. The consultant has noted steady progress by the GSO in these areas.
Fund staff considered that there was no need to keep a different GDP series from official GDP
figures after discussions held in a May 2004 visit on national accounts. The enactment of a

12

Quarterly GDP by type of expenditure was calculated for the period between 2002Q1 to
2003Q2, but has since been discontinued due to lack of resources.

- 45 -

ANNEX IV

Statistics Law in January 2004 to strengthen the coordination among GSO and ministries and
agencies is expected to improve data collection. Two new handbooks on sources and methods for
the Vietnam System of National Accounts and the Quarterly National Accounts were published
in 2003 in Vietnamese aiming to increase the quality of the estimates and transparency. The GSO
has improved its capacity building and is participating in the International Comparison Program
in order to produce GDP estimates comparable across countries.
Prices
The GSO has compiled and published a monthly consumer price index (CPI) in line with
international standards since January 1996. Effective July 2001, the GSO changed the CPI to
reflect a larger nonfood weight and broader consumption basket based on data from the 1998
Vietnam Household Living Standard Survey (VHLSS) rebased to 2000. The GSO plans to revise
the weights when the for 2004 VHLSS becomes available. The publication of a producer price
index was planned in late 2001, but has been delayed for technical reasons. Trade price indices
are also compiled, but are not used in the national accounts estimation process because the
sample size is deemed too small. The recent spike in inflation has greatly increased the
authorities’ interest in improving Vietnam’s price indices, in particular constructing a core
inflation index. The authorities requested Fund technical assistance in this area.
Government finance statistics
The Ministry of Finance’s (MoF) State Budget Department produces provisional monthly,
quarterly, and annual fiscal data on government operations shortly after the end of the reference
period; final data for the fiscal (calendar) year are produced after a delay of about six months.
These data reflect the consolidated operations of the state budget, which covers all four levels of
government: central, provincial, district, and commune. They exclude data on quasi-fiscal
activities of SOEs and non-budgetary funds, among which are the Social Security Fund,
Enterprise Restructuring Fund, Development Assistance Fund, Export Support Fund, and
Sinking Fund (for repayment of onlent funds), for which no regularly reported data are currently
compiled.
Recording is mainly on a cash basis for final annual data, but provisional data differ depending
on their source. As a result, government financing data, in particular domestic bank financing,
cannot be reconciled as reported in the fiscal and monetary accounts. Like the national accounts,
provisional data are compiled before the end of the reference period and thus involve a
forecasted component. The quarterly data are only revised when data are compiled for the same
quarter of the following year. The MoF’s External Finance Department maintains a centralized
record of all general government external debt, excluding guarantees issued on behalf of stateowned enterprises. The MoF, with support from the UNDP, aims to strengthen the external debt
management system, particularly the recording of disbursements and multiple currency loans.
Despite these shortcomings, the authorities have made progress in a number of other areas
related to fiscal transparency, including implementation of an improved budget management law
and adoption of a 1986 GFS-consistent budget classification at all levels of government. The

- 46 -

ANNEX IV

authorities published for the first time in late 1998 the fiscal outturn for 1997 and the approved
budget for 1999, although both in highly aggregated form. Starting in late 2001, the MoF began
posting annual budget outturns and plans on its external website, including by major revenue and
expenditure items. However, considerable actions remain to be taken to improve the coverage of
fiscal data as recommended in the 1998 Bank-Fund report on fiscal transparency, the 2000
Public Expenditure Review, and, most recently, the STA multisector statistics mission.
In this context, the government continues to work toward gazetteing and publishing the annual
national budget, as well as having commune-level budgets, implementing the GFS-based
functional budget classification system, initiating work on revising government accounting
standards, and introducing an integrated financial management system (IFMS) for improving
treasury management and fiscal reporting. The STA mission found that the functional
classification had not yet been fully aligned with internationally recognized classification
standards, which might hamper formulation, execution, and monitoring of fiscal policy. The
IFMS will allow a detailed classification of provisional budget data (as well as final accounts). In
addition, it will incorporate data on extrabudgetary funds into the Treasury database.
Monetary and financial statistics
Since the expiration of the PRGF in April 2004, there have been considerable delays in monetary
and financial data reporting. Under the PRGF, the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) used to
regularly report monetary and financial data to the Fund, including: (i) the monetary survey and
the central bank balance sheet (both on a monthly basis and typically with a six-week lag);
(ii) detailed consolidated balance sheets (“derivation tables”) for six state-owned and 78 nonstate
deposit money banks and individual balance sheets for the four large state-owned commercial
banks (SOCBs) (since the beginning of 2001 on a monthly basis and typically with an eightweek lag); (iii) deposit and lending rates of the large SOCBs (on a monthly basis and for various
maturities), and (iv) gross and net international reserves data (on a monthly basis and typically
with a six-week lag). The 2004 Article IV mission urged the authorities to provide data on a
more timely basis.
In January 1999, the SBV and commercial banks began implementing new charts of accounts for
compiling money and banking data, developed with STA assistance. The new charts of accounts
were formally adopted in April 1999. However, they do not adequately sectorize credit for
monetary programming purposes, in particular failing to distinguish between bank credit to stateowned enterprises (SOEs) and to other nonstate sectors of the economy. Therefore, in addition to
its regular monthly reports, the SBV has designed a new monthly report form for the four large
SOCBs for submitting sectorized credit data to the central bank. Moreover, the STA mission in
July 2001 encouraged the SBV to develop a reporting scheme for a comprehensive breakdown of
banks’ credit to the economy by borrowing sectors, subsectors, and ownership of enterprises.
External sector statistics
The SBV compiles quarterly and annual balance of payments (BOP) data with a one- to twomonth lag, although the data reported to the Fund for publication are less timely – the data

- 47 -

ANNEX IV

published in the August 2004 issue of the IFS are for the fourth quarter of 2002. Since 1995,
monthly and annual trade data have been compiled using customs reports, but the coverage and
accuracy of these data need to be improved. In particular, the commodity breakdown of a large
share of monthly reported exports (approximately 30 percent) is unknown. Published trade data,
however, contain a number of adjustments to the customs reports, which have been difficult to
reconcile, as the staff is only provided data at a relatively high level of aggregation. Data on
invisibles continue to be based largely on banking records, which provide incomplete coverage
and identification of the types of transactions. Improvements in BOP statistics, in particular
foreign direct investment (FDI), also continue to be hampered by interagency coordination
problems.
Data on FDI are now compiled by the SBV based on quarterly and semi-annual survey reports
received from foreign-invested enterprises operating in Vietnam and supplemented by reports
from SBV branches. The Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) also collects administrative
data on FDI. However, at the September 2000 ASEAN Workshop on Improving the Quality of
FDI Data, the Vietnamese authorities indicated that problems persisted with the survey response
rate, as not all FDI enterprises were providing the requested information. Moreover, the 2001
STA GDDS mission noted that no effort was made to distinguish head office and other
nonresident liabilities in the reported data.
Data on contracting of commercial debt (by SOEs and privately owned firms) are maintained by
the SBV. Some loans are reported only after an extended delay, and the reporting of
disbursements and repayments remains poor. Data on contracting, disbursement, and service of
official debt are maintained by the MoF. The MPI also reports the loan obligations of foreign
investors. The STA mission found that the overlapping responsibility for debt statistics has at
times resulted in some deficiencies in coverage, including the lack of monitoring certain leasing
arrangements (e.g., for aircraft).

Vietnam—Debt Sustainability Analysis
Under the baseline scenario, public debt increases from 50 percent of GDP in 2003 to
59 percent of GDP in 2009, and declines thereafter (Table 1a).13 In net present value (NPV)
terms, public debt peaks at 56 percent of GDP in 2021, up from 40 percent of GDP in 2003.
The exercise assumes (i) real growth of 7 percent, (ii) a budget deficit including net lending
of 4.7 percent of GDP, equal to the 2005 budget target and close to the historical average,
(iii) recognition of SOCB contingent liabilities equivalent to 15 percent of GDP at end-2003
as estimated by the staff, and (iv) significant progress in SOCB reform which would allow
SOCBs to begin generating sufficient profits to cover additional provisioning requirements
over the medium term. The deficit is increasingly funded domestically and, starting in 2010,
through foreign borrowing on commercial terms. As a result, the share of concessional debt
falls from about 45 percent in the years 2003–07 to 7 percent in 2023.
The extent of existing SOCB liabilities and the pace of SOCBg reform are subject to
considerable uncertainty. Nevertheless, the assumption that the quality of SOCB lending will
improve as assumed in the baseline scenario could be optimistic and thus the medium-term
deficit target of 4.7 percent of GDP should be considered an upper bound estimate for a
sustainable fiscal stance. This is further underlined by the stress tests (Table 1b); a less
ambitious fiscal adjustment (tests A1 and A2) or a permanent reduction of growth by a mere
½ percentage point (test A3) would lead to steady increases in the NPV-to-GDP ratio.
Vietnam’s external debt level is deemed sustainable under the baseline scenario, with
external debt projected to increase moderately through 2006 before steadily declining over
the long term. As of end-2003, it is estimated that Vietnam’s external debt is around
34 percent of GDP, or its NPV is 39 percent of exports. They are projected to be about
35 and 29 percent, respectively, by 2008. The external debt accumulation over the medium
term would mainly result from sizable external trade deficits, a large part of which is
envisaged to be offset by strong net current transfers (i.e., private remittances). The debt
build-up is also expected to be mitigated by sustained net FDI inflows.
Alternative scenarios and bound tests are constructed to examine the sensitivities of the
baseline projection of public and publicly guaranteed external debt to a range of potential
shocks (Tables 2a and 2b). Several factors that may potentially jeopardize Vietnam’s external
debt sustainability are identified, including: i) a significant deterioration in the terms of
Vietnam’s external financing (alternative scenario A2); ii) a substantially weaker export
performance due to, for example, a sudden loss of market access to major markets (bound

deterioration of domestic business environment or external shocks (bound test 4).

2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that NPV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments devided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation
with Vietnam
On November 22, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Vietnam.1
The three-year PRGF arrangement expired in April 2004. During the arrangement, Vietnam
maintained strong economic growth and low inflation and achieved further poverty reduction,
supported by favorable macroeconomic conditions and increasing integration with the world
economy facilitated by trade liberalization.
Since the last Article IV Consultation, Vietnam’s economy has performed well. Real GDP grew
by 7¼ percent in 2003, led by strong investment and export growth. Growth slowed in the first
quarter of 2004 mainly due to the impact of the avian flu outbreak and droughts on agricultural
production, but began to rebound in the following months; agricultural production has
recovered and industrial production has picked up. Inflation rose from 3 percent at end-2003 to
10 percent in September 2004 (both year-on-year), reflecting the jump in food prices, which
comprise about half of the CPI basket. Since July, however, annualized monthly inflation has
fallen rapidly.
Vietnam’s overall balance of payments has strengthened notwithstanding the widened current
account deficit. Although exports grew rapidly, surging imports driven by strong investment
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.
1

-2increased the current account deficit to 4¾ percent of GDP in 2003. With the deficit more than
fully financed through a combination of higher long-term capital inflows and a substantial rundown of domestic banks’ foreign assets, Vietnam’s international reserves significantly
increased, reaching US$5.6 billion at end-2003 (about nine weeks of imports). This increase,
however, slowed considerably in the first seven months of 2004, despite continued strong
export growth and a slowdown in import growth.
Credit growth has accelerated, and monetary aggregates continue to grow rapidly. Credit
growth accelerated to 28 percent at end-2003 and further to 36 percent in July 2004. The
sharp increase in credit growth in 2004 was led by the state-owned sector. Broad money
growth rose to 25 percent in 2003 and stayed at about the same level in the first seven months
of 2004, reflecting the ongoing monetization. Short-term dong deposit and lending rates rose
only slightly in recent months.
In response to rising inflation and higher credit growth, the authorities have taken a series of
measures. They substantially increased reserve requirements and adjusted several
administered prices, including a lowering of tariffs on petroleum and steel products. More
recently, the Prime Minister issued a directive calling for a cut in government expenditure and
lending by state-owned banks, a strengthening of enterprises’ efforts to reduce production and
distribution cots, and a tightening of price control enforcement.
For 2004 as a whole, economic growth and the external current account are likely to be
broadly unchanged from 2003, with inflation falling toward the end of the year and the budget
deficit narrowing. Real GDP growth in 2004 is likely to be at 7–7½ percent, aided by a
recovery in agriculture and a pick up in industrial production in the second half of the year.
Inflation is expected to fall to 9½ percent (year on year) by the end of the year. The current
account deficit is projected to be at 4½ percent of GDP, financed by a combination of official
development aid and foreign direct investment inflows. Reduced short-term capital inflows,
however, would allow for only a modest accumulation of international reserves. Initiatives to
tighten projects’ eligibility requirements for domestically-financed on-lending and reduced
expenditure are expected to lead to a significant fiscal tightening compared to 2003.
Vietnam’s economic growth is projected to remain strong in 2005 and beyond, with real GDP
growing at about 7 percent per year. Achievement of this outlook, however, depends on
progress in private sector development and structural reforms, especially in the areas of stateowned banks and enterprises to contain the build-up of public sector debt, and WTO
accession—which is key to sustained strong export growth. While there has been continued
progress in the areas of private sector development and trade reform, progress in reforming
the state-owned sector continues to be slow.

-3Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their strong record of success in achieving
high growth and poverty reduction over the past years, their prudent macroeconomic
management, and Vietnam’s increasing integration into the global economy. Directors
encouraged the authorities to build on these achievements in order to sustain the momentum
of strong growth and poverty reduction into the medium term. This will hinge on structural
reforms in key areas, including restructuring of state-owned banks and enterprises, improving
the private sector investment climate, securing WTO accession, and enhancing governance
and the transparency of policy making.
Directors noted that the near-term economic outlook appears favorable, provided that the
authorities can contain second-round inflationary effects from the recent supply-side price
shocks. They welcomed the authorities’ aim to contain these effects, as indicated by recent
monetary policy actions supplemented by a number of administrative and fiscal measures.
Directors encouraged the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) to tighten monetary conditions further
using more conventional means, especially by raising interest rates, if these measures prove
insufficient. They advised that the central bank eliminate conflicting policy objectives and move
toward increased reliance on indirect policy instruments.
Directors cautioned that the currently rapid rate of credit growth should be reduced significantly
in light of uncertain loan quality and the banks’ weak balance sheets. While noting that the
significant increase in the reserve requirement ratios has reduced liquidity in the banking
system, Directors urged the SBV to take further measures if the pace of credit growth does not
fall significantly. They cautioned that maintaining rapid credit growth to meet the government’s
short-term growth target could lead to mounting quasi-fiscal liabilities, which could threaten
fiscal sustainability and long-term growth.
Directors encouraged the authorities to move cautiously toward greater exchange rate
flexibility, which would facilitate adjustments to external shocks and rapid structural changes.
Accordingly, Directors urged the authorities to limit foreign exchange intervention to
addressing disorderly conditions. This will help strengthen Vietnam’s modest reserve position.
They noted that increased exchange rate flexibility would also encourage market participants
to manage exchange rate risks, thereby avoiding excessive foreign exchange exposure in the
economy. Directors also encouraged the authorities to eliminate remaining exchange
restrictions and to accept Article VIII obligations.
Directors commended the authorities for their prudent fiscal management in 2004. They
emphasized the importance of setting budget targets for 2005 and beyond consistent with
medium-term public debt sustainability, taking into account the existing stock of quasi-fiscal
liabilities and the costs associated with the financial sector reforms. In this regard, Directors
highlighted possible budget pressures from the fiscal costs of state-owned bank and enterprise
restructuring, stagnating oil revenues, and revenue pressures from further trade liberalization.
Directors encouraged the authorities to begin identifying possible tax measures in addition to
ongoing tax administration efforts to achieve their goal of holding revenue steady as a share of
output over the medium term. They called for discontinuation of price subsidies as soon as
possible.

-4Directors emphasized that Vietnam’s state-owned commercial banks are an important source
of vulnerability in the economy, given their dominance and uncertain asset quality. They urged
faster progress in reforming these banks. Directors welcomed the authorities’ decision to
equitize one of the four large banks, noting that this initiative could provide impetus to state
bank reform provided that the equitization ultimately shifts the bank’s operations to a more
commercial basis. In this regard, Directors recommended that consideration be given to selling
a large share of the bank to a foreign strategic partner, which, country experiences suggest,
can be an effective way to improve the performance of state-owned banks. In addition to
equitization, they underscored that a more active ownership role by the Ministry of Finance
and measures to strengthen the SBV’s supervision are important elements of state bank
reform. Directors considered that further developing money and capital markets and the stock
exchange should be an integral part of financial sector reform. They also called for
independent audits at the central bank and swift progress in establishing effective means of
combating money laundering and terrorism financing.
Directors emphasized the importance of further developing the private sector and improving
the efficiency of state-owned enterprises for Vietnam’s successful transition to a more marketoriented economy. In this regard, Directors welcomed initiatives to reduce the number of
strategic sectors in which state-owned enterprises remain under full state ownership and to
expand the equitization program to include large state-owned enterprises. They emphasized
the importance of focusing the design of the equitization plans on strengthening commercial
incentives for managers, increasing accountability, and improving performance. Directors
noted that the elimination of regulations discriminating against the private sector and measures
supporting small and medium enterprises have helped the private sector expand rapidly, and
urged further improvements through full implementation of the Land Law to facilitate private
investment, and unification of the investment and enterprise laws to promote a level playing
field.
Directors supported Vietnam’s objective of achieving early WTO membership, emphasizing its
importance for Vietnam in maintaining market access, sustaining foreign direct investment
inflows, and furthering integration into the international economy. They noted, however, that
early entry requires significant actions, including putting in place necessary legislation.
Directors emphasized the need for Vietnam to improve transparency as well as reliability and
timeliness of data. They welcomed the passage of the new Statistics Law, which would
improve data collection by strengthening inter-agency coordination, but noted that Vietnam’s
macroeconomic statistics had significant weaknesses, and supported the provision of Fund
technical assistance to improve the statistical base.
Directors welcomed the opportunity to review the Fund’s past engagement with Vietnam,
focusing on the three-year PRGF arrangement that expired in April 2004. They observed that
Vietnam achieved further poverty reduction through maintaining strong economic growth and
low inflation throughout the PRGF period. Nevertheless, valuable lessons of the ex post
assessment are that sufficient time should be allowed for the institutional changes that
underpin structural reforms, and that coordination between the Fund and the World Bank and
other bilateral donors needs to be improved. While commending the impressive progress in
trade liberalization, Directors noted that the pace of reforming state-owned commercial banks

-5and enterprises has been slow and highlighted the need for fundamental institutional changes
to address weaknesses in these areas. Fund technical assistance will be important in this
regard.

Statement by Made Sukada, Alternate Executive Director for Vietnam
and Worawut Wesaratchakit, Advisor to Executive Director
November 22, 2004

Introduction
1.
On behalf of the Vietnamese authorities, we would like to express their appreciation
to the staff, management and the Executive Board as well as to other development partners
and the donor community for their advice and continued support. The authorities would also
like to thank the staff for a balanced Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation as well
as the useful policy advice. The authorities also find that the Ex Post Assessment of LongerTerm Program Engagement paper is well-written and balanced, highlighting Vietnam’s
various achievements during the Fund supported program.
2.
The Vietnamese authorities have succeeded in laying down a conducive platform for
the economic transformation from a centrally-planned to a market-based economy. A
combination of favorable macroeconomic conditions and increasing integration with the
world economy, facilitated by speedy trade reforms, have contributed to strong economic
growth, low inflation and impressive poverty reduction in recent years. With these
achievements, the Vietnamese authorities are strongly committed to acquiring WTO
accession in 2005. The authorities also recognize that there remain some challenges ahead. In
this respect, they are committed to continue the implementation of structural reforms to
ensure the country’s sustainable development.
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
3.
Real GDP growth in 2003 continued to be strong, led by robust investment, exports,
and private consumption. In the first quarter of 2004, however, agricultural production fell,
mainly due to the avian flu outbreak and drought. At the same time, manufacturing and
construction activities slowed, induced by higher world commodity prices, notably for steel.
As a result, the consumer price index rose from a moderate rate in 2003, driven largely by
these supply shocks. Following the adoption of a number of stimulus measures by the
authorities, economic activity began to pick up, and the economic slowdown earlier in the
year proved to be only temporary.
4.
For 2004 as a whole, GDP growth is expected to remain favorable. The current
account deficit that widened in 2003 due mainly to imports of machinery and intermediate
products, was more than offset by strong capital inflows in the forms of both ODA and FDI.
This has resulted in a generally satisfactory balance of payments in 2003, and the State Bank
of Vietnam (SBV) has managed to increase its international reserves. The current account
deficit ratio to GDP has begun to improve in 2004 and the gross official reserves is projected
to reach over $6 billion (equivalent to around 10 weeks of imports).
5.
In line with the staff's projections, the Vietnamese medium-term outlook appears
favorable with real GDP growth expected to be around 7 percent per year, supported by

-2export expansion—notably from the manufacturing sector, presuming a successful WTO
accession by end-2005. The external position is expected to remain manageable as the
current account deficit is expected to decline gradually, while capital inflows are expected to
increase, led by strong FDI on account of the WTO accession.
Fiscal Policy
6.
Recognizing the importance of and the key role played by fiscal policy in achieving
macroeconomic stability, the Vietnam authorities have continued to pursue a prudent fiscal
policy to ensure a favorable macroeconomic and financial environment, as a foundation for
sustainable growth. The fiscal stance was loosened slightly in 2003, to focus on the long-term
critical objectives including higher spending on education, increased capital spending on
important transportation and irrigation projects, and net lending. However, the fiscal deficit
was contained at around 4.4 percent of GDP.
7.
In 2004, the issuance of Government bonds for the investment in the important
transportation and irrigation projects has continued, but the above-mentioned deficit has not
increased. At the same time, budget revenue has been on an upward trend, at 22-23 percent
of GDP, thanks to the improved revenues from crude oil and land use, and improvements in
tax administrative measures, e.g. a self-assessment process for potential and new tax payers
to be completed by January 2005.
8.
On the expenditure side, the Government issued a State Development Investment
Credit Decree on April 1, 2004, to scale down the list of enterprises that may be eligible for
on-lending, and to impose specific limits on the total state support not to exceed 85 percent
of total project costs. This, along with the authorities’ long-standing efforts to bring interest
rates on these projects more in line with market rates, will keep domestically financed onlending in check, such that they would begin to decline steadily relative to GDP over the
medium term.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
9.
The consumer price index, which was moderate in 2003, rose in the first half of 2004
as a result of temporary supply shocks. Since July, the food consumer price index has fallen
rapidly, causing the annualized monthly core inflation for September to fall to 4 ½ percent.
Given that the unexpected increase in the inflation rate did not stem from monetary policy,
the authorities perceived that using this policy to contain inflation will be less effective.
Instead, the authorities prefer to use more indirect instruments. To curb inflation, the
authorities temporarily reduced tariffs on key commodities, in particular, petroleum and steel
products. They, however, acknowledge and agree with staff that additional measures may be
needed to contain inflation, as well as to safeguard against any further rise in NPLs.
10.
The SBV understands the staff’s concern on the impact of the credit growth on NPLs.
However, it should be noted that the growth in bank credit reflects bank financing for
medium-term investment projects that would otherwise not be undertaken. In this context,
due to the segmentation of the financial sector, the reserve requirement is considered to be a

-3more effective tool than interest rate policy. Besides being unobtrusive in its implementation,
an increase in the reserve requirement should have relatively milder impacts on commercial
banks’ balance sheets.
11.
On exchange rate policy, the authorities are committed to provide continuous support
and to facilitate international trade and investment and address any effect of possible shocks,
including the second-round effects of inflation. Over the longer term horizon, steps towards a
more flexible exchange rate regime will be taken cautiously and gradually, if and only when
the markets are perceived to be able to manage the additional risks and volatilty more on
their own in an effective and sustainable manner. In the meantime, certain administrative
measures will remain essential for the protection of the domestic economic and financial
systems.
12.
In the medium-term, as the Vietnamese economy becomes more integrated into the
global and regional economies, the authorities are aware that present constraints (in particular
financial sector segmentation and exchange controls) inherent in the system will need to be
addressed. Nevertheless, the authorities would like to reiterate their intention that, in order to
be able to accept Article VIII obligations, the authorities would like to request the Fund to
continue providing technical assistance to assist the completion of the revision of current
relating regulations.
Structural Reforms
13.
The authorities are aware that sustained economic growth and lasting poverty
reduction would hinge on the pace of structural reform, aimed at improving efficiency of the
state-owned sector, ensuring public debt sustainability, and encouraging private investment.
Measures implemented so far are in line with the Communist Party Plenum which was held
in January 2004 which called for an acceleration in several structural reforms, including the
initiative of equitizing state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs), increasing the pace of
equitizing major state-owned enterprises (SOEs), securing WTO accession, and enhancing
governance and transparency of policy making.
14.
On the financial sector, to enhance the operations of the financial sector, the
authorities issued credit manuals for SOCBs early this year, so that they will function on a
more commercial basis. Furthermore, the authorities have decided to equitize the Vietcom
Bank (VCB). Here, foreigners are welcome to participate through the domestic capital
market within the supervisory framework of the authorities. For further steps on this front,
the authorities will adopt a gradual approach to minimize social costs of reform and to pick
the best timing to approach the investors.
15.
The equitization plan, originally scheduled for submission to the Prime Minister by
end-June 2004, has been delayed. This was due to some constraints in the prevailing legal
framework, such as the lack of specific regulation suitable to the characteristics of the
SOCBs in the current Decree on SOE equitization, as well as some technical difficulties. The
SBV and the SOCBs concerned have actively cooperated with the relevant agencies to
complete this plan for prompt submission to the Prime Minister. An important feature of the

-4plan is the sale of shares, possibly through public auction, with the Government retaining a
reasonable shareholding. In a number of cases e.g. Mekong Housing Bank, more direct
involvement by foreign strategic partners are also under consideration.
16.
With regard to transparency, the authorities have continued their effort in improving
the reliability and timeliness of data, in a number of areas. Towards this end, a new Statistics
Law was passed in January 2004 to enhance data collection by strengthening inter-agency
coordination. In addition, with technical assistance given by the Fund since September 2004,
the country’s national income account statistics can be further improved.
17.
On NPLs, the SBV has also initiated a compilation of financial indicators on banks’
large borrowers through a survey in April 2004, as a step toward obtaining a more accurate
assessment of the SOCBs’ balance sheet problems. However, due to the lack of capacity, as
well as both statistical and technical difficulties, the report is yet to be completed. Once these
constraints have been addressed, the survey could be replicated on a regular basis to provide
an effective monitoring framework on banks’ performances.
Ex Post Assessment
18.
On the Ex Post Assessment of Longer-Term Program Engagement, the authorities
welcome the report as both candid and balanced. As noted by staff, despite the limitations
and issues in developing and implementing the ESAF and PRGF programs, the authorities
remain committed to continue the reform process.

On certain issues, however, a more flexible implementation of the Fund’s
conditionality could have better assisted Vietnam in sustaining its reform efforts within the
program context. The speed of adjustment in quota and tariff rates under the ESAF program,
should be kept in line with WTO principles and consistent with other multilateral and
bilateral trade agreements. The scope and schedule of SOE reforms should also give due
consideration to domestic economic and political feasibility, as well as readiness.

Overall, the authorities greatly appreciated the Fund’s advice and technical assistance,
which are useful in assisting Vietnam to achieve significant macroeconomic stabilization,
creating conditions for high and sustainable economic growth, and accelerating structural
reforms well beyond the PRGF program. This being the main features that attracted Vietnam
to the Fund’s program in the first place. The Fund’s policy advice and technical assistance
will continue to be highly valued by the authorities either within or outside the program
context.
Conclusion
21.
With continuous support from the international community as well as the authorities’
efforts to implement structural reforms and pursue sound macroeconomic policies, Vietnam
has made considerable progress. Nevertheless, the authorities are also aware that some
challenges remain in a number of areas such as the improvement of investment quality
(ICOR), WTO accession, and the resolution of SOCBs’ NPLs. As such, the authorities are

-5firmly committed to pursue a sound macroeconomic policy framework and to continue
reforms, particularly on SOCBs and SOEs as deemed essential for Vietnam’s strong growth
path over the medium term. The Vietnamese authorities look forward to the continuation of
the close and effective cooperation, as in the past, with the Fund through the communication
and consultation on macroeconomic policies.
