Executive Summary
•

The Czech economy continues to perform well and external vulnerabilities are
limited. The growth momentum has been sustained and the economy has so far weathered
the recent market turmoil well. External debt is low and the modest current account deficit
is comfortably financed by direct investment flows. While the koruna has appreciated
sharply in recent months, it is estimated to be broadly in line with fundamentals.

•

Growth, while still robust, is likely to slow in 2008 and inflation expected to rise
sharply. Downside risks to growth stem primarily from external sources. Headline
inflation is set to double due to a series of shocks arising from indirect taxes as well as
food and energy price increases. Strong demand on resources is also increasing underlying
inflation.

•

Monetary policy needs to be on a sustained tightening path. The appropriate pace of
tightening will depend on the degree of koruna appreciation and second-round effects of
indirect tax and energy price increases. The Czech National Bank’s high credibility, and
recent steps to enhance transparency of policy communication, should serve to anchor
inflation expectations. This would also facilitate the transition to the lower inflation target
of 2 percent from 2010.

•

The main medium-term policy challenge centers on achieving sustainable fiscal
consolidation. The authorities plan to lower the deficit below the Maastricht threshold
limit from 2008 onwards. Building on the considerably better-than-budgeted outcome in
2007, the authorities should maintain the originally targeted adjustment for 2008. Beyond
that, there was broad consensus that the recently approved tax and welfare reform
package, while introducing some welcome changes in the tax structure, does not
sufficiently advance fiscal consolidation. Comprehensive pension and health care reforms,
implemented early, will be essential for sustainable public finances. Absent such reforms,
tax cuts can be ill afforded. Labor market reforms could also help alleviate fiscal
adjustment.

I. INTRODUCTION1
1.
Reaping the benefits of EU integration and prudent macroeconomic policies, the
Czech Republic has made solid strides toward convergence with the EU-15. Over the
past few years, growing trade linkages fostered by strong direct investment inflows, coupled
with a regional cyclical upswing, have underpinned an export-led boom, accompanied by low
inflation and an improving external balance. Reassured by these strong fundamentals, market
sentiment has remained benign, allowing the economy to tide over an extended political
gridlock2 and global market turmoil with fairly low financial market and exchange rate
volatility.
2.
Sustaining this growth momentum with external stability will require addressing
the key challenge of fiscal consolidation. This is also a prerequisite to ensuring smooth euro
entry. With one of the highest primary fiscal deficits in the region and large demographic
shifts underway, structural fiscal and pension reform remains a key priority to restore longer
run debt sustainability and improve incentives to work. Labor market reforms to reduce
structural unemployment, and increase flexibility and participation could make a substantial
contribution to reducing the fiscal gap and enhancing income convergence. Given the
importance of building a social consensus on durable fiscal consolidation measures, staff
organized, jointly with the authorities, a conference on the fiscal reform agenda with
participation by representatives from the public and private sectors and the academic
community.

A staff team comprising Mr. Thakur (head), Mr. Dalsgaard, Ms. Muñoz, and Ms. Tuladhar (all EUR) held
discussions in Prague during November 8–20. Mr. Polak (Senior Advisor to the Executive Director) joined the
discussions. Messrs. Rosenberg and Tirpak from the Regional Representative’s office also participated. The
Czech Republic has accepted the obligations of Article VIII of the Articles of Agreement and maintains an
exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions and subscribes to the SDDS.

Following an indecisive election outcome in June 2006, a center-right coalition took office in January 2007
with the support of two opposition members.

II. BACKGROUND
3.
A strong cyclical upswing continued apace in 2007. GDP growth is likely to be
sustained at close to 6 percent for the third year in a row, driven by domestic demand
(Figure 1 and Table 1). While export growth has remained robust, led by the automobile
sector, strong corporate profitability has fuelled fixed investment. Consumption has remained
strong, reflecting rising disposable earnings from strong wage gains, higher social transfers
and rapid credit expansion.
Domestic demand is increasingly

Rapid growth has begun to stretch capacity limits (Figure 2). The unemployment
rate has declined to the lowest level this decade, marked by a decline in both short and long
term unemployment. With labor shortages emerging despite a steady rise in immigration,
wage gains are rapidly catching up with strong productivity growth, squeezing profitability
margins. Capacity utilization rates in industry also stand at record high levels. Estimates of
output gap measures also point to a positive gap in 2007.

5.
The current account deficit has widened, but
remains largely financed by inflows of direct
investment (Figure 3). Although the saving rate
remains relatively high, the pickup in investment led to a
rise in the current account deficit to around 3½ percent
of GDP in 2007 from about 3 percent in 2006 (Table 2).
Trade and services balance surpluses continued to
improve on account of strong exports of the automobile
and electronic sectors. However, with record profits,
these were offset by a sharp rise in repatriation of
dividends by foreign investors.

The current account deficit has widened in
2006-07 as profit repatriations rose but has
been adequately financed by FDI flows.

6.
Underlying inflation has picked up from
the low levels of recent years. Core inflation, which
had remained subdued at around 1 percent, has risen
steadily since late 2006, fuelled by higher domestic
demand amid tightening labor markets, strong credit
expansion, and rising food and regulated prices. The
depreciation of the koruna during the first half of
2007, precipitated by the negative carry trade vis-àvis the euro area also added to inflation. Although the
liquidation of these carry trades amid the global
financial turmoil in August contributed to reversing
the depreciation, strong consumption demand and
rising food and oil prices pushed headline inflation to
5 percent in the year to November 2007, well above
the upper margin of the Czech National Bank’s
(CNB) tolerance band of 1 percent around the target
of 3 percent.

Strong domestic demand has fuelled a rise
in core inflation.

7.
Consistent with the inflation targeting framework, monetary policy was
tightened in recent months to counter rising inflation pressures (Figure 4). Monetary
conditions eased in early 2007 as the policy rate was kept unchanged, rising inflation lowered
real interest rates, and the koruna depreciated. Against a backdrop of strong domestic
demand and a widening of the interest rate differential vis-à-vis the euro area—already at
125 basis points in May 2007—the CNB raised its policy rate in steps from 2 ½ percent to 3
percent in early summer. Despite tightening credit conditions in European financial markets,
the CNB raised the rate further to 3 ¼ percent in August and to 3 ½ percent in November
2007. Although real rates have turned negative, the rapid appreciation of the koruna in recent
months—about 5 percent since October—has contributed to tightening monetary conditions.
The Czech policy rate remains among the lowest in the EU.

III. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
11.
Economic growth is expected to slow in 2008 but should remain solid on the
back of continued strong domestic demand. Staff projects growth to decline to about
4½ percent, in line with the consensus, as recent fiscal measures to raise VAT and reduce
social benefits weigh on private consumption

12.
The risks to this forecast are on the downside, stemming primarily from fragility
of growth in major export markets.4 There is so far no discernible spillover through credit
channels from the ongoing financial market turbulence abroad. However, if the turmoil were
to persist leading to a more pronounced slowdown in the euro area and the United States, it
could adversely affect Czech exports. Continued high oil prices could also place a further
drag on growth. Labor supply constraints at home add to these risks. Despite these risks,
stress tests suggest that external debt will remain stable over the medium term (Figure 7 and
Table 6).
13.
Inflation is set to rise sharply against a backdrop of demand and wage pressures
as well as rising food and energy prices and increases in indirect taxes. Headline inflation
is forecast to rise above 5 percent in 2008, well above the upper margin of the Czech
National Bank’s tolerance band around the target of 3 percent, mainly on account of the first
round effects of increases in VAT and excises. Core inflation is also expected to rise in the
face of a positive output gap and a tight labor market. Following a lengthy period of low
inflation, there is a risk of such a rapid doubling of headline inflation feeding into inflation
expectations with knock-on effects on wage and price setting. A slower pace of koruna
appreciation could also remove a recent significant anti-inflationary influence, placing a
greater burden on monetary policy.
14.
Medium-term growth prospects hinge on deeper structural reforms. Aging will
increase pressures on the public finances and the labor market. The tax-benefit system has
created low-wage and unemployment traps. Labor supply constraints despite high long term
unemployment, skill mismatches and sizable regional disparities point to low labor market
flexibility, exacerbated by strict employment protection regulations (Figure 8). Rankings of
business competitiveness have slipped, reflecting concerns regarding growing scarcity of
skilled labor, slow judicial processes, and corruption. Rising wage pressures could erode

utilization and investment, reducing growth prospects in the face of intensifying regional
competition. Against this background, staff projects potential growth to slow to around
4½ percent.

IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
15.
The central theme of the discussions was the imperative of strong fiscal
consolidation as a prerequisite to ensuring smooth euro entry and sustained long-term
growth with external stability. Although the longer-term structural challenges formed the
backdrop for the fiscal reform strategy, the consultation centered on three key topics seen as
pivotal to sustained and balanced growth:
•

the need for a restrictive policy stance in 2008, in view of a still positive output gap
and rising inflation pressures, with an appropriate mix between fiscal and monetary
policy;

•

implications of the recently adopted fiscal package, and the importance of setting
clear priorities between competing objectives of fiscal consolidation and tax relief;

•

the need for vigilance over the financial sector in the current uncertain market
environment.
A. Ensuring Sustainable Public Finances

16.
Durable fiscal reform remains the primary policy challenge. Seeking to reverse
the trend toward fiscal relaxation afforded by the gains from the economic upswing, the
authorities recently unveiled a tax and welfare reform package (Box 1). It aims to reduce
excessive deficits5 and stabilize the medium-term budget while lowering the tax burden. The
authorities plan to reduce the deficit from the officially projected 3.4 percent of GDP in 2007
to 2.9 percent in 2008. They plan to further lower the deficit to 2.3 percent of GDP by 2010,
entailing a cumulative fiscal effort of about 1½ percent of GDP over the next three years.
However, they acknowledge that underlying expenditure measures to achieve these goals are

yet to be fully spelled out and pressure from the coalition partners for further tax cuts remain.
Although public debt remains low and stable (Figure 9 and Table 7) owing to the favorable
growth and financing from privatization revenues, the authorities recognize the crucial role
of expenditure consolidation to address challenges created by a rapidly aging population.
Box 1. The Tax and Welfare Reform Package: Key Measures

burden while also promoting growth and employment. Key measures include:

(casualty and sickness insurance).

An analysis of the fiscal reform package suggests
some desirable features.1 The Czech tax system
currently relies heavily on social security
contributions and corporate income taxes. A shift in
the tax structure away from direct towards indirect
taxes will likely contribute to enhanced savings and
investment.

The cap on social security contributions would also reduce revenue efficiency.

Furthermore, the package does not address the critical task of fiscal consolidation in the medium- to longterm since the permanent tax cuts are offset by spending measures which are of a temporary nature or yet to
be defined.

commensurately lower deficit target, of around 2¼ percent of GDP, in 2008. Attaining this
target would require that additional discretionary spending—from accumulated reserves of
prior years—does not offset this adjustment; automatic stabilizers should however be
allowed to play around this path. This adjustment was deemed appropriate given the still
positive output gap and risks to achieving the planned consolidation in 2009–10.

The authorities concur that fiscal consolidation, centered on pension and health
care reforms, needs to be sustained beyond 2008, although political constraints could
limit its scope. The authorities’ Convergence Program plans an annual consolidation of

noted that despite recent progress, political
constraints remained.
19.
The authorities stressed that the fiscal package represented a delicate
compromise within the governing coalition. The tax reform proposals, although revenue
neutral in 2008, will lead to a loss of revenues in 2009 and beyond. Officials also
acknowledged that the expenditure measures only slow down rather than arrest the current
rapid pace of growth in mandatory spending. Significant risk remains that measures such as
compression of public sector wages and the freezing of social benefits will not be

13
sustainable. In their view, the package contained positive features such as greater
discretionary scope in the budget through deindexation of social benefits and improved
targeting of some parental and child benefits. Staff noted that these measures nevertheless did
not fully claw back the large social spending approved ahead of the 2006 elections.
20.
Looking ahead, the fiscal strategy needs to (i) strike a balance between spending
and revenue measures; (ii) achieve systemic reforms in pensions and healthcare; and
(iii) promote complementary reforms in the labor market.
•

The authorities agreed that spending measures are a priority not only to achieve the
needed consolidation but also to enhance efficiency and budgetary flexibility. Staff
cautioned that without durable offsetting expenditure measures, the Czech Republic
cannot afford the planned tax cuts and may even have to consider tax increases.

•

On pension reform, political consensus has been
reached on raising the retirement age to 65 years,
but since it is unlikely to restore pension system
viability, creation of pension reserves to ensure
greater intergenerational equity is being planned.
Increased reliance on private pension savings,
including through a partial voluntary opt-out is
also being considered. In health care, the
introduction of co-payments has marked an
important step towards containing excess
demand pressures. Further efforts to contain
costs and reduce distortions in the system are
being debated by the political parties.

•

Extending the statutory retirement age would help
alleviate fiscal pressures but would not ensure
pension system viability.

The officials were receptive to the staff’s view that labor market reform to lower
structural unemployment and tax-benefit reform to reduce disincentives to work can ease
fiscal adjustment. However, they were not optimistic on the near-term prospects of
changes to the employment protection regulations, following closely on the heels of the
new labor code passed in 2006.
B. Monetary Policy Conduct and Communication

21.
With inflation projected to be above target, monetary policy would need to
remain on a sustained path of tightening. CNB officials noted that in deciding the precise
pace of tightening in the face of the projected sharp rise in inflation, they will need to weigh
factors such as the developments in the koruna, recent evidence of weaker European growth
and the stance of fiscal policy.7 While recent wage negotiations suggest continued wage

moderation, the behavior of the exchange rate, driven in recent months largely by movements
in the U.S. dollar, could complicate monetary management (Box 2). Inflation expectations
pose another significant source of uncertainty. They further noted that in the recent period of
low inflation since 2004, the inflation process had exhibited considerable persistence, easing
the task of monetary policy. With a series of upward shocks to inflation in the period ahead,
against a backdrop of tightening labor market conditions, staff and CNB officials agreed that
it was important to ensure that expectations remained well anchored to the inflation target
through timely policy tightening.

22.
The planned downward shift in the inflation target to 2 percent from 2010
further underscores the importance of preserving credibility and enhancing
transparency of policy communication. The decision to lower the target is based on the
assessment that low inflation has taken firm roots in the Czech economy and that any real
appreciation in the remaining process of convergence would continue to manifest itself
through koruna appreciation rather than higher inflation. With the onset of a spike in headline
inflation reflecting a number of one-off shocks, shaping expectations was critical in
achieving the target with minimal output losses. In this context, officials felt that the recent
decision to publish a forecast-consistent interest-rate path and make public the voting records
of the Executive Board meetings, beginning in 2008, should enhance transparency and policy
credibility and smooth the transition to a lower inflation target.

The use of the Czech koruna as a funding currency for carry trades has been an important driver
of the exchange rate movements in 2007. Low interest rates and exchange rate volatility, and
increasing liquidity in local foreign exchange markets made the koruna an attractive currency for carry
trades leading to a depreciation by

The appetite for carry trade using koruna as a funding currency has since disappeared. The

C. Competitiveness and External Stability
23.
The staff and the authorities agreed that the koruna had remained broadly
in line with fundamentals, with limited risks to external stability. The real effective
exchange rate, measured by consumer prices as well as by unit labor costs, has been broadly
stable over the past year (Figures 10 and 11). Staff estimates the underlying current account
deficit (excluding temporary factors such as cyclical fluctuations, one-off shocks, and
adjustment lags) in 2007 at around 3 percent of GDP, slightly below the expected deficit and

16
in line with its estimated equilibrium level. These estimates imply that the koruna has been
close to its equilibrium level.8 Since the consultation discussions, the koruna has appreciated
by about 5 percent against the euro by mid-December. Trade performance has remained
robust, with double-digit growth in exports volume, rising export market shares in both the
EU and world markets, and strong profitability of large exporters. Net foreign liabilities,
mostly FDI, account for 30 percent of GDP and are projected to remain broadly stable. Since
2003, intervention has been limited to conversion of a large one-off privatization receipt in
2005, portfolio gains, and proceeds of EU transfers. CNB officials stressed that the koruna is
floating independently since intervention was not intended to influence the exchange rate. In
view of the large, albeit off-market, transactions, the exchange system is classified by the
staff as a managed float with no predetermined path (see informational annex).
Koruna appreciation continues.

Productivity remains strong.

Financial stability indicators suggest that risks are contained. The Czech

cross-border bank borrowing and virtual absence of securitization. Capital adequacy ratios

V. STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
Over the past year, the Czech economy has maintained the momentum of rapid
growth and made further strides toward convergence with the EU-15. However,
sustaining this success through a less benign global environment and tighter supply
constraints at home calls for a tight policy stance. Over the medium term, ensuring
sustainable public finances would call for a higher political priority for pensions, healthcare
and labor market reforms.
29.
The economy is currently at a fairly advanced stage of a strong cyclical upswing
and a slowdown in growth is likely in 2008. Growth is nevertheless expected to remain
solid on the back of continued strong domestic demand and unemployment low. The risk to
this central forecast is mainly on the downside, stemming primarily from a possibly weaker
external environment.
30.
With inflation set to rise sharply well above the target of 3 percent, monetary
policy would need to be on a sustained tightening path. The projected increase in inflation
to 5 percent in 2008 is driven by demand and wage pressures as well as rising food and
energy prices and increases in indirect taxes. Following a lengthy period of low inflation, the
risk that a rapid rise in inflation gets embedded into expectations will require further timely
increases in the policy rate. The planned downward shift in the inflation target to 2 percent
from 2010 onwards also underlines the importance of preserving the CNB’s high policy
credibility, inter alia, by enhancing the clarity of policy communication. In this context,
recent steps to improve transparency are welcome.
31.
The external competitive position remains comfortable and vulnerabilities
limited. The favorable indicators include a stable real effective exchange rate over the past
year, robust export performance with rising export market shares and a moderate current
account deficit, financed by direct investment inflows. These indicators suggest that the
koruna has been broadly in line with fundamentals and consistent with external stability,
although the recent sharp appreciation, if continued, would weigh on competitiveness.
32.
Financial stability indicators suggest that risks are contained. Limited exposure to
foreign markets and strong fundamentals have helped insulate the financial sector from the
recent turmoil. Nevertheless, in an environment of rising interest rates and house prices,
supervisory vigilance is needed to ensure that household credit risks do not build up,
particularly for low-income borrowers.
33.
The tax and welfare reform recently passed by Parliament promotes a number
of desirable modifications to the structure of the tax regime. These include the shift from
taxation of income to that of consumption, the introduction of excises on energy consumption
and the planned cut in the corporate income tax rate which will help maintain the
attractiveness of Czech Republic as an investment location. However, given the advanced

20
cyclical position of the economy and the need to strengthen public finances, the tax cut could
have been phased in more gradually.
34.
The fiscal reform package is, however, insufficient to advance the critical task of
fiscal consolidation in the medium term. Indeed, the package is likely to add to long-term
fiscal pressures since the proposed tax cuts are permanent and well-defined, while some of
the offsetting spending measures are of a temporary character and as yet undefined.
35.
Against the backdrop of the recent procyclical fiscal stance, cyclical gains for
the 2008 budget should be saved and the planned fiscal adjustment implemented in full.
A more ambitious deficit target than that implied by the budget should be feasible in view of
the favorable outcome in 2007. Such prudence in 2008 is all the more advisable in view of
the absence of specific expenditure measures underlying the planned fiscal adjustment in
2009-10. With a tightening monetary policy cycle underway and the need to anchor inflation
expectations, a tight fiscal stance is also essential to ensuring a balanced policy mix.
36.
Fiscal consolidation needs to be sustained beyond 2008 to meet the challenges
posed by the aging population and to ensure smooth euro entry. An annual structural
consolidation of at least ½ percent of GDP would help stabilize debt over the medium term
and provide a safety margin in respecting the Stability and Growth Pact limit of 3 percent of
GDP under more adverse cyclical conditions, and create fiscal space for accommodating agerelated spending. Recent changes in budgetary rules limiting rollover of unspent allocations
should alleviate risks in attaining these budget targets.
37.
Durable fiscal consolidation calls for a strategy that sets clear fiscal priorities
with adequate balance between spending and revenue measures. Precedence should be
given to expenditure rationalization. Absent expenditure restraint, tax cuts can be ill afforded
and even tax increases may have to countenanced as part of a more sharply defined strategy
to set fiscal priorities. Possible options include raising the low VAT rate further, reducing
corporate loopholes, pruning personal tax credits, and increasing environmental taxes.
38.
Pension and healthcare reforms should clearly be key pillars of the mediumterm fiscal strategy. They should be implemented sooner rather than later, given the long
lags with which especially pension reforms have their impact. Along with the welcome
increase in the retirement age to 65 years, complementary reforms to raise the effective
retirement age and reliance on private pensions will also be needed. In health care, the
introduction of co-payments should help contain excess demand pressures and enhance
efficiency of health care spending. Early consensus on more comprehensive reforms would
be vital.
39.
Labor market reform can help alleviate fiscal adjustment. The recent fiscal
package fails to fully offset the adverse impact of the pre-election increase in social benefits
on incentives to work. The substantially enhanced tax credits are not targeted and their
effects on labor supply uncertain. Higher labor market participation and lower structural

21
unemployment could be achieved through better targeted active labor market policies, less
rigid regulations regarding hiring and dismissals, and an improved design of the tax-benefit
system. More flexible labor markets would also help position the Czech economy for a
smoother path to euro adoption.
40.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

Sources: Czech Statistical Office, Czech National Bank, Ministry of Finance, and IMF staff estimates.
1/ Hyundai is expected to start a major new automobile plant in late 2008 which could contribute nearly a percentage point to GDP growth. These
considerations explain the volatility in staff’s medium-term projections for GDP growth and trade balance.
2/ In percent of GDP.
3/ On ESA-95 basis.
4/ Changes in reserves reflect off-market conversion of large privatization receipts, EU transfers, and sales of accumulated interest. The projected increase in
reserves in 2008-12 is based on the expected increase in EU-fund transfers and the level of absorption of these transfers.

g = real GDP growth rate,

ε = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and α = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0) and rising
inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their
levels of the last projection year.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
The currency of the Czech Republic is the Czech koruna, created on
February 8, 1993 upon the dissolution of the currency union with the
Slovak Republic, which had used the Czechoslovak koruna as its currency.
From May 3, 1993 to May 27, 1997, the exchange rate was pegged to a
basket of two currencies: the deutsche mark (65 percent) and the
U.S. dollar (35 percent). On February 28, 1996, the Czech National Bank
widened the exchange rate band from ±0.5 percent to ±7.5 percent around
the central rate. On May 27, 1997, managed floating was introduced. In
the Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions,
the de facto exchange rate regime of the Czech Republic is classified as
managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate. Since
2002, the CNB has not engaged in direct interventions in the foreign
exchange market. International reserves have been affected by the offmarket purchases of large privatization receipts and EU transfers and the
sales of the accumulated interest. On December 13, 2007, the exchange
rate of the Czech koruna stood at CZK 17.978 per U.S. dollar.

3
The Czech Republic has accepted the obligations of Article VIII and
maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions. The Czech
Republic maintains exchange restrictions for security reasons, based on
UN Security Council Resolutions and Council of the European Union
Regulations, that have been notified to the Fund for approval under the
procedures set forth in Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51).

Appendix II. Czech Republic: Statistical Issues
The Czech Republic subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) in April
1998 and metadata and an annual observance report for 2006 are posted on the Fund’s
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. Data on core surveillance variables are available to
the Fund regularly and with minimal lags (reporting to STA is less current, especially for
foreign trade and the national accounts). Exchange rates and interest rates, set by the Czech
National Bank (CNB), are reported daily with no lag. Gross and net international reserves are
reported on a monthly basis with a one-week lag, as well as on a 10-day basis (with the
CNB’s balance sheet) with a one-week lag. Consumer prices, reserve money, broad money,
borrowing and lending interest rates, central government fiscal accounts, and foreign trade
are reported monthly with a lag of between one and four weeks. Final monetary survey data
are available with a lag of about one month. GDP and balance of payments data are made
available on a quarterly basis with a lag of two to three months. Since 2003, the main
components of the balance of payments are also available monthly. Annual data published in
the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook cover all operations of the general government,
including the extrabudgetary funds excluded from the monthly data. These annual data are
available on a timely basis. Monthly fiscal data published in International Financial
Statistics (IFS) cover state budget accounts and are available with a two- to three-month lag.
1.
While data quality is generally adequate, some deficiencies remain in certain areas
and the authorities are taking measures to improve data accuracy.
•

National accounts data are subject to certain weaknesses. Value added in the
small-scale private sector is likely to be underestimated, as the mechanisms for data
collection on this sector are not yet fully developed and a significant proportion of
unrecorded activity stems from tax evasion. Discrepancies between GDP estimates
based on the production method and the expenditure method are large and are
subsumed under change in stocks. Quarterly estimates of national accounts are
derived from quarterly reports of enterprises and surveys. The estimates are subject to
bias because of nonresponse (while annual reporting of bookkeeping accounts is
mandatory for enterprises, quarterly reporting is not) and lumping of several
expenditure categories in particular quarters by respondents. Large swings in
individual components of spending and the overall GDP from quarter to quarter bring
into question the reliability of the quarterly data and hamper business cycle analysis.

•

Recently, revisions to procedures for processing export data have brought external
trade statistics close to the practice in the EU. However, a continued weakness of
foreign trade statistics is the unavailability of fixed base price indices for exports and
imports; these indices are currently presented on the basis of the same month of the
previous year.

•

Monetary survey data provided to the European Department are generally adequate
for policy purposes. However, large variations in the interbank clearing account float,
especially at the end of the year, require caution in interpreting monetary

6

developments. The CNB has made a major effort to identify the causes of these
variations and adjust the data. In 2002, to meet EU statistical conventions, the CNB
implemented the European Central Bank’s (ECB) framework for collecting,
compiling, and reporting monetary data. The data published in IFS are based on
monetary accounts derived from the ECB’s framework. The same set of accounts also
forms the basis for monetary statistics published in the CNB’s bulletins and on the
website, which are thereby effectively harmonized with the monetary statistics
published in IFS, although the presentation in IFS differs somewhat from the CNB’s.
•

Annual fiscal data on ESA-95 basis has been prepared by the Czech Statistical Office.
Quarterly data for non-financial accounts have also been compiled and quarterly
financial accounts are being prepared. The Ministry of Finance uses the ESA-95
methodology for the Convergence Program targets. The ESA-95 methodology differs
from the national (fiscal targeting methodology) in terms of the coverage of the
institutions (for example, the CKA is included in the central government under ESA
definition) and inclusion of financial transactions and other accrual items (for
example, called guarantees). The Ministry of Finance participated in the Fund’s pilot
project to transition to the statistical methodologies outlined in Government Finance
Statistics Manual, 2001.

Statement by Willy Kiekens, Executive Director for the Czech Republic
and Stanislav Polak, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
January 23, 2008
The Czech authorities would like to thank the IMF staff for another comprehensive and
useful report. Salient features of this consultation include comprehensive tax and spending
reforms decided by the government and the new monetary policy communication strategy
adopted by the Czech National Bank (CNB).
The dialogue between the authorities and staff was constructive and candid. The joint
conference on fiscal reforms, in which the public and private sectors and the academia
participated, enabled an exchange of views with a broad professional audience on the staff's
analytical work, which is included in the Selected Issues Paper. The involvement of experts
from different areas was helpful in building consensus on fiscal reforms.
Recent macroeconomic developments
With output growth of 6 percent, the third quarter of 2007 was the 10th consecutive quarter
during which real GDP grew by at least 6 percent. GDP growth is now estimated to have
been 6.2 percent in 2007, considerably better than the 4.8 percent projected by staff or the
5.3 percent projected by the CNB last year.
Less positive is that annual inflation which reached 5.4 percent in December 2007, a peak
since August 2001 and more than 2 percentage points above the projections made by the
Fund and CNB one year ago.
The acceleration in inflation was the result of higher prices for food, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, tobacco, transportation, restaurants and hotels. Rising food and energy
prices worldwide make the surge in Czech inflation largely an exogenous cost-driven shock.
The hike in food prices in the Czech Republic was however higher than that in neighboring
countries. One factor could be that these prices were adjusted upwards in anticipation of the
VAT increases that were to be implemented on January 1, 2008. The inflation outturn in
January 2008 may confirm this analysis or indicate other factors that resulted in these late
2007 price increases such as higher demand pressures than those in neighboring countries or
a weakening in competition. In any case, the CNB expects a further tightening of monetary
policy. How much will the interest rates increase will depend on the size of the nominal
exchange rate appreciation which effectively tightens monetary conditions. The most recent
appreciation of the Czech Koruna overshoots the equilibrium exchange rate path estimated
by the CNB.
High growth and lower unemployment have contributed to a favorable budget outcome,
estimated to be a deficit of CZK 66.4 billion in 2007, or 1.9 percent of GDP. This was
CZK 30 billion less than the deficit in the previous year and CZK 25 billion less than
budgeted for 2007. Unused budget appropriations of CZK 79 billion were transferred to the
reserve funds.

2
For 2008, the Ministry of Finance has projected a general government budget deficit of
2.9 percent of GDP. However, in light of the 1.9 percent fiscal deficit in the previous year,
the authorities are now considering to implement fiscal measures which will ensure more
balanced macroeconomic conditions.
Challenges of fiscal policy
Since the new government took office in January 2007, it has expressed its commitment to
bringing public finance to the original trajectory of a declining deficit and to closing
the Excessive Deficit Procedure of the EU in a credible and sustained manner. With these
goals, the September 2007 Act on Stabilization of Public Finances, primarily curbs
mandatory expenditures by amending 49 laws and regulations. However, the authorities are
aware of the need for further expenditure cuts in order to prepare the public finances for the
cost of aging. Therefore, pension and health care systems and other mandatory expenditures
will be further reformed before the next election in mid-2010. This will be a politically
challenging task, because the government is supported by just 100 out of the 200 members of
Parliament. Moreover, the better than expected fiscal outcome in 2007 carries the risk that
Parliament becomes more complacent about the need for further fiscal consolidation.
Despite the cyclical improvement in the 2007 budget outcome, long-term fiscal sustainability
remains a challenging policy issue. The government remains fully engaged in the
preparations for reforming the pension and health care systems.
There is a three-pronged strategy for reforming the pension system. The first phase has been
stabilizing the current pay-as-you-go system by parametric adjustments such as a gradual
increase in the retirement age to 65. The second phase aims at improving the protection of
participants in second voluntary pension schemes, making them more attractive for workers
and employers alike. The third phase of the strategy is to establish a voluntary savings pillar
to which people could save and direct either full or part of their contributions under the staterun pay-as-you-go first pillar system. The political debate over the strategic issues with
regard to the pension system, which was reopened in June 2007, is still ongoing.
The reform of the health care system will also be undertaken in several stages. The first
phase is underway and aims at reducing the cost of the system for the public finances by
introducing charges for doctors' visits, prescription drugs, hospitalization, and by curtailing
the cost of medicines. The budget transfers to the health care system are now temporarily
frozen. A panel of independent experts, set up in June 2007, is assessing the current state of
the health care system and its viability. It remains to be seen, how soon it will be politically
possible to implement that committee's recommendations.
The new government continues to improve transparency of public finances and to implement
other institutional reforms needed to achieve its fiscal objectives. Key among them is the
closing or integration of off-budget institutions. Tax and custom administrations will be
gradually integrated, as will be the collection of social security and health insurance
contributions. Both measures will reduce administrative costs.

3
Refinements of monetary policy communications
The CNB's current inflation target of 3 percent was announced in March 2004 and took effect
in January 2006. It was set marginally above the price stability level of the European Central
Bank (ECB) for the euro area. The target level of 3 percent reflected specific features of a
transforming economy converging towards the advanced countries. In March 2007, the CNB
has announced a new inflation target of 2 percent with a tolerance band of ± 1 percent,
effective January 2010.
In recent years, the Czech economy has stabilized around its steady state. Given the gradual
stabilization of the structure of consumption and the completion of the main "transformation"
changes in the quality of consumer goods, the extent of statistical overestimation in
the measurement of inflation is expected to decline gradually. Lower measured inflation
should also be fostered by the fact that the new consumer basket, used since January 2007,
has increased the weight of tradable unregulated commodities, whose prices are rising only
slowly or even falling in the Czech Republic over the medium term. Also, inflation
expectations have been anchored just below the CNB's current target of 3 percent. In this
situation, moving to a lower inflation target will help achieve the Maastricht inflation
criterion.
Since the launch of its inflation targeting strategy, the CNB has gradually increased the
transparency of the Bank Board's monetary policy decision-making. Beginning 2008, the
CNB will publish, in numerical form, the forecast-consistent path of its policy interest rates.
This step will further enhance the transparency of the CNB's inflation forecast and will give
external observers a better understanding of the CNB's monetary policy. However, this
forecast is not a commitment by the CNB to future evolution of rates. Developments and new
information that becomes available since the preparation of the forecast can cause the actual
interest rate path to deviate from the previously forecast path. Like the forecast for other
main variables, this uncertainty will be illustrated in a fan chart.
The CNB has decided to release the voting results of individual Board members on interest
rate decisions. This will allow observers and the general public to better identify the opinions
of each Board member and thus better understand the decisions of the Board as a whole. It
will also give Board members more freedom to express their views in public. Increasing the
accountability of individual board members will strengthen the principle of majority in the
decision-making process of the Board.
Prospects of euro adoption
As an EU member without derogation, the Czech Republic is committed to adopting the euro
once the Maastricht criteria are met. Its strategy for adopting the euro anticipated the
country's joining the euro area in 2009 or 2010.
The Czech authorities annually assess whether economic conditions and nominal and real
convergence are sufficiently aligned with the euro area. Based on an overall assessment,
the Czech government has now concluded that only some of the preconditions for benefiting

4
from the adoption of a single currency have already been met. The main obstacle to the
fulfillment of the Maastricht criteria continues to be the medium-term prospects for public
finances. The still limited flexibility of the labor market and an unsatisfactory entrepreneurial
business environment represent a continuing risk for the smooth performance of the Czech
economy within the European monetary union.
The euro adoption date will depend on the resolution of these obstacles. The Czech
government is committed to making maximum reform efforts to resolve these problems by
the end of its term. Only after successfully establishing the conditions for benefiting from
adopting the euro will the Czech authorities announce the targeted adoption date and enter
the ERM II for the minimum required length of time.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with the
Czech Republic
On January 23, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Czech Republic.1
Background
Economic performance remained strong in 2007, supported by continued robust growth of
domestic demand. The current account deficit widened, but remained largely financed by inflows of
direct investment. With vulnerabilities limited, the economy weathered the international financial
market turmoil with minimal spillover impact. The strong economy boosted job creation while
unemployment declined and capacity utilization reached record high levels. In this environment,
inflation pressures mounted on account of higher domestic demand amid tightening labor
markets as well as food and regulated price increases. Monetary policy was tightened in the
second half of the year, although policy rates remain among the lowest in the EU.
Growth is projected to remain favorable, although its momentum will slow as the consumption
boom decelerates and growth in the euro area weakens. Domestic demand will nevertheless
remain the primary driver of growth as fixed investment rises. Risks to this growth outlook are
mainly on the downside, stemming primarily from fragility of growth in major export markets
following the ongoing financial market turbulence and continued euro appreciation.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
Inflation is expected to almost double to above 5 percent, owing to food, energy and indirect tax
increases, as well as demand and wage pressures. Risks of higher inflation expectations
feeding into wage and price-setting remain while a slower pace of koruna appreciation could
also increase inflation pressures. Shaping expectations is thus critical, especially with the
planned lowering of the inflation target to 2 percent by 2010.
Strong growth has resulted in a more favorable fiscal outturn than budgeted in 2007. Buoyant
tax revenues have helped offset the large increase in spending on social benefits stemming
from pre-election commitments. Starting in 2008, the government is implementing a fiscal
reform program, which will introduce a flat tax on personal income and lower corporate income
taxes, planned to be offset with VAT and excise tax increases, and a tightening of the wage bill
and social benefits including through health care reforms. The fiscal stance is thus expected to
turn restrictive in 2008 with the general government deficit budgeted at 2.9 percent of GDP.
Over the medium term, the authorities plan to lower the structural deficit to 2.3 percent of GDP
in 2010 and to 1 percent of GDP by 2012.
Competitiveness remained strong. Although the koruna has appreciated rapidly in recent
months, it has remained broadly in line with fundamentals. Trade performance has been
robust, with double-digit growth in export volume and rising export market shares in both the EU
and world markets. The current account deficit has widened slightly owing to the repatriation of
profits by large exporters.
Credit growth has continued at a brisk pace, albeit from a low base. High demand for mortgage
loans, supported by the low interest environment and increasing household repayment capacity
led to sustained household credit growth. The authorities plan to further integrate supervisory
functions to strengthen the efficiency of supervision.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for the Czech economy’s strong fundamentals,
which have helped sustain the growth momentum with low unemployment, and underpin further
strides toward convergence with the EU-15. Directors considered that sustaining this success in
the face of a less benign global environment and rising supply constraints calls for a tight policy
stance in the near term and steadfast commitment to sustainable fiscal consolidation and
complementary structural reforms. Directors welcomed the authorities’ updated euro accession
strategy and their commitment to a sustained implementation of the Maastricht criteria, which
would provide a solid foundation for euro adoption.
Directors commended the authorities on their prudent monetary policy, and supported the
recent policy tightening to counter rising inflation pressures. With inflation set to rise to well
above the target of 3 percent, Directors stressed the importance of ensuring that expectations
remain well anchored to the inflation target through further timely monetary policy action. The
appropriate pace of monetary tightening will depend, inter alia, on the degree of koruna
appreciation and second-round effects of indirect tax and energy and food price increases. The

3
planned downward shift in the inflation target to 2 percent from 2010 underscores the
importance of preserving the Czech National Bank’s high credibility. In this context, Directors
encouraged the authorities to build further on welcome recent steps to enhance the
transparency of monetary policy communication.
Directors welcomed the staff’s assessment that the exchange rate of the koruna is broadly in
line with fundamentals and consistent with external stability. Trade performance has been
robust with rising export shares and the moderate current account deficit is financed largely by
direct investment inflows.
While encouraged by the better-than-expected fiscal outturn for 2007, Directors noted that it
largely reflected strong cyclical revenue gains. They recommended that such cyclical gains be
saved and the underlying fiscal adjustment planned in the budget for 2008 implemented in full,
leading to an appreciably better-than-budgeted deficit. Such prudence in 2008 would support
the anti-inflationary stance of monetary policy and minimize the risk of breaching the targets for
fiscal consolidation in 2009–10.
Directors broadly welcomed the modifications to the tax regime contained in the tax and welfare
reform package recently approved by parliament—most notably the shift from direct to indirect
taxation. At the same time, they considered that further measures would be needed to advance
the goal of fiscal consolidation. Directors stressed that, in setting their fiscal priorities, the
authorities will need to strike a careful balance between spending and revenue measures, and
assign priority to the formulation of durable expenditure measures, since in the absence of such
measures tax cuts could be ill-afforded.
Directors highlighted the important role of measures to promote labor participation and lower
structural unemployment in alleviating fiscal adjustment. Directors therefore called for the
adoption of targeted active labor market policies, easing regulations regarding hiring and
dismissals, and an improved design of the tax-benefit system to enhance incentives to work.
Directors noted that a more flexible labor market would also facilitate a smoother entry into the
euro area. In this regard, they also encouraged further efforts to enhance business
competitiveness.
In view of the coming challenge of population aging, Directors reiterated the importance of early
and comprehensive pension and health care reforms. Along with the welcome increase in the
retirement age to 65 years, complementary reforms to raise the effective retirement age and
promote reliance on private pensions will also be needed. Directors welcomed the introduction
of co-payments in health care as a step that should help contain excess demand pressures.
Directors viewed the Czech financial system as generally sound. They encouraged the
authorities to ensure that household credit risks do not build up in an environment of rising

4
interest rates and house prices. The large foreign presence of banks as well as the expected
implementation of Basel II and the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive in 2008 call for
enhanced coordination with foreign supervisors. Directors welcomed the financial authorities’
efforts to further integrate supervisory functions.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
Reader to view this pdf file) for the 2007 Article IV Consultation with the Czech Republic is also
available.
