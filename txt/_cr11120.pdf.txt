STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
April 8, 2011

KEY ISSUES
A gradual rebound. GDP growth is expected to pick up to 3¾ percent this year on the
back of stronger investment growth, expanding tourism arrivals, and higher copra
production. Key downside risks are delays in infrastructure investment and a longer-thanprojected impact of natural disasters in Australia and New Zealand on tourism. The surge
in global commodity prices is projected to push inflation up to 4 percent in 2011.
Managing the rebound. The key near-term challenge is to support economic recovery,
while moving toward fiscal consolidation and guarding against high inflation.
•

In 2011, it will be important to stick to the overall budget expenditure ceiling to

underscore the government’s commitment to fiscal consolidation. If output growth falls
below projections, revenue should be allowed to function as an automatic stabilizer. A
broadly balanced budget in 2012 will restore the much needed fiscal space to respond to
future shocks.
•

It is time to begin tightening monetary conditions. Inflation pressures have

emerged, and banks have ample liquidity for lending.
•

Pressures on foreign exchange reserves are building and if they persist the vatu—

which is moderately overvalued according to staff analysis—should be allowed to
depreciate.
Enhancing resilience to shocks. Maintaining large fiscal, external, and financial buffers
will help Vanuatu’s economy be more resilient to shocks. On the fiscal side, this will
require the government to mobilize revenue, facilitate smoother donor financing, reduce
the wage bill, and improve state-owned enterprise efficiency and transparency. On the
external side, the government should be vigilant in keeping its foreign reserves at an
adequate level. In the financial sector, banking supervision should be intrusive and the
regulatory framework and supervisory skills should be strengthened.

Other indicators are mixed but on balance also point

Box 1

Exchange Rate Assessment1

Vanuatu’s exchange rate is assessed to be moderately
overvalued relative to its medium-term fundamentals
based on standard analytical approaches. Other
indicators are more mixed. There is considerable
uncertainty in these results mainly because external
balances are heavily influenced by a small number of
factors (tourism and foreign aid) and these factors
could be quite volatile going forward.

Other indicators


Foreign reserves are currently at an adequate
level, but are projected to decline as a share of
GDP over the medium term as the economy
grows. Moreover, net foreign assets of the
banking system declined by 35 percent
(20 percent of broad money) in 2010, primarily
reflecting the decline in foreign assets and the
increase in foreign liabilities held by banks,
suggesting that pressures on foreign assets are
building up in the financial system. Reflecting
these pressures, the vatu depreciated close to
2 percent in effective terms in the first two
months of 2011 and official reserves declined by
1.2 percent in December 2010.



While the goods trade deficit is large (29 percent
of GDP), surpluses in the service sector, and
grants compensate for this deficit. However, to
reduce this dependency on grants in the medium
run, the goods trade deficit should be reduced
and the services surplus increased.



Tourism receipts are projected to pick up. In the
short run, there are downside risks from floods in
Australia and the earthquake in New Zealand, but
in the longer run this sector is expected to be an
engine of growth in Vanuatu.



Inflation has been moderate. There are no signs
of sustained downward pressures on goods prices
that would bring about a depreciation of the vatu
in effective terms.

Standard Exchange Rate Assessment Methods
The macroeconomic balance approach suggests
that a depreciation of about 13 percent in real
effective terms could bring the current account deficit
to its equilibrium level of around 2½ percent of GDP,
which is determined as a function of fundamentals
relative to Vanuatu’s trading partners. These
fundamentals include the fiscal balance, economic
growth, income, foreign aid, and demographics.
The equilibrium real exchange rate approach
suggests that vatu is above its equilibrium level by
around 8 percent in real effective terms. The
equilibrium value of the real effective exchange rate is
estimated as a function of factors that affect long run
purchasing power parity,2 including the terms of
trade, net foreign assets, and foreign aid.

Key Elements of Revenue Mobilization1

Box 2

Vanuatu’s tax revenue to GDP ratio, at
18 percent, is one of the lowest within the PICs
and on par with the average for low-income
countries. VAT, excises, and import duties account
for about 80 percent of tax revenue in Vanuatu and
there is no corporate or personal income tax. The
main characteristics of the current tax system and
revenue performance are as follows:


VAT. The VAT rate is 12.5 percent. The current
rate is broadly in line with peers in the region,
where the maximum VAT rate is 15 percent.
Exemptions are relatively limited.



Excises. Excises are levied on alcohol, tobacco,
fuels, seafood, meat, flour and sugar related
products. The rates have been increased from low
levels in recent years to partially compensate for
the decline in import duties.



Import duties. Import duties are levied on a large
range of goods. They account for about 6 percent
of GDP, which is broadly in line with peers in the
region. Although import duties are currently one
of the major components of tax revenue, they are
expected to decline gradually due to trade
liberalization in the region.

In particular, the following elements could be
considered when taking measures such as introducing
an income tax, raising current tax rates, and improving
tax administration: 2


Efficiency. An efficient tax system leaves
economic choices the same as they would have
been without taxes. A VAT is generally considered
more efficient, as a single rate VAT with a broad
base could raise revenue without distorting
economic decisions. Minimizing exemptions
would also help promote efficiency. An income
tax, on the other hand, is considered less efficient,
as it could distort economic choices.



Equity. An equitable tax system can be achieved
by promoting both horizontal equity (taxpayers
with similar incomes pay similar amount of taxes)
and vertical equity (those with higher incomes pay
higher amount of taxes). A progressive income tax
is generally considered suitable to promote
vertical equity. Some progressivity can also be
achieved under a VAT by allowing exemptions for
necessity goods and/or setting higher rates for
luxury goods, but these approaches may
undermine efficiency.



Feasibility. A well-designed tax system should be
aligned with the tax administration capacity to
collect revenue. Given the authorities’ capacity
constraints, enforcement resources should be
focused on large taxpayers rather than small
taxpayers whose monitoring generally requires
significant resources.

Reserves relative to broad money. Reserves
are around 25 percent of broad money,
suggesting that the RBV has the ability to meet
large requests for foreign currencies in the
unlikely event of capital flight, with residents
switching from the vatu to foreign currencies. The
ratio, however, is lowest among peers in the
region because Vanuatu’s economy is more
monetized.



Continuous decline in banks’ net foreign
assets. Banks’ net foreign assets have eroded in
recent quarters, reflecting borrowing from abroad
to lend domestically and provision of foreign
exchange to depositors who withdrew foreign
exchange deposits. If this trend continues, banks
will eventually run out of foreign exchange and
official reserves will have to be used to make
payments abroad. Net foreign assets of the entire
banking system—including official reserves—
would be depleted in about two years.



Only domestic-sector led growth. If policies
were reoriented to support domestic demand
only, export receipts would begin to weaken and
the potential growth rate would decline. In this
scenario, reserves would shrink gradually and be
depleted in the medium term.

Country

Partnership Strategy for 2010–14 is aligned with
the government’s poverty reduction strategy and
aims to assist the government to address
constraints in (i) transport—by providing support
for improved connectivity to markets and social
services; (ii) urban development—by improving
access to sanitation and drainage facilities and
improve urban infrastructure with a particular
focus on Port Vila; and (iii) energy—by supporting
greater energy efficiency, rural electrification, and
renewable energy sources. Consistent with the
government’s strategy of fostering private-sectorled growth, AsDB also focuses on improving the
enabling environment for the private sector
through updating the legal and regulatory
environment, better access to finance, and the
reform

ANNEX V. VANUATU: STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of January 31, 2011
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. In
particular, data on national accounts, government finance, and external sector statistics need to be
further improved.
National Accounts: While there have been improvements in methodology and the development of
additional data sources, expenditure-based GDP estimates are not yet available. Also, data are
compiled only on an annual basis. Constant price GDP estimates still use 1983 as the base year,
although work on rebasing the estimates to 2006 are underway.
Price statistics: The CPI weights are based on 1998 household surveys, and only cover the two
urban centers of Port Vila and Luganville. The CPI basket does not reflect the recent structural
changes in the consumption basket, for example telecommunication prices and related utilities.
Government finance statistics: Budget classification is broadly consistent with the 1986 GFSM.
Government operations data include all central government agencies. However, they exclude public
enterprises and operations of provincial governments and the two municipalities. The operations of
the budget are recorded on a cash plus invoice basis.
Monetary statistics: The Reserve Bank of Vanuatu (RBV) reports monthly monetary data, including
the accounts of the monetary authorities, commercial banks, and interest rates in its monthly
bulletin posted on its website. The RBV also publishes a quarterly report with the coverage of wider
financial data including fiscal transactions and financial soundness indicators (e.g., amount of nonperforming loans and earnings).
External sector statistics: Quarterly and annual balance of payments data are compiled according
to The Balance of Payment Manual, Fifth Edition. Trade data have been compiled using customs
declaration forms collected from the two shipping ports of entries, Port Vila and Santo. Imported
items by air are also captured, but imported goods and services through the post office have not
been captured. Data on capital account also need further improvements. Errors and omissions
remain quite large.

System (GDDS) since April 2004.
III. Reporting to STA
Exchange rate and reserves data are only available through August 2010. Monthly monetary
statistics data have been reported through December 2010. Annual balance of payments data have
been published through 2007. Quarterly consumer price data have available through Q2 2010.
Imports and exports annual trade figures are available only through 2007. Both the trade and price
data are gathered from other sources; no data are sent by the authorities. Annual GFS data through
1999 have been reported for publication in the GFS Yearbook, using the 1986 GFS format. No subannual fiscal data have been reported for publication in International Financial Statistics since 2001.

Thomas Dorsey (IMF),
Jeffery D. Lewis and
Vikram Nehru (IDA)

Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund and the
International Development Association

Vanuatu remains at a low risk of debt distress based on the Low-Income Country Debt
Sustainability Assessment (LIC DSA). Vanuatu’s overall public debt level is low and should
remain manageable, provided the fiscal deficit is reduced substantially as planned from the
2010 level. The level of public debt distress may rise if potential GDP growth slows or large
contingent liabilities materialize.

1

This DSA was prepared jointly with the World Bank, in accordance with the Debt Sustainability

Framework for low-income countries approved by the Executive Boards of the IMF and IDA. The debt
data underlying this exercise were provided by the Vanuatu authorities.



Real GDP growth is projected to average around 4 percent in the long term, significantly below the
levels observed before the crisis, but somewhat higher than the longer-term historical average,
assuming that infrastructure projects will elevate the long-term growth potential of Vanuatu.



GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms) is projected to be around 5¾ percent over the period 2010–15 and
3 percent over the long term, which is below the upper limit of the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu’s policy
target band.



Primary deficit is projected to decline to ¼ percent of GDP by 2012 and close to zero over the long
term. This is because Vanuatu’s fiscal responsibility law requires the government to maintain its debt at
prudent levels and the 2011 budget already envisages a small primary deficit.



The present of value of contingent liabilities is assumed to be 10 percent of GDP for the whole
projection period, broadly in line with levels observed in the region.



Foreign aid is projected to remain stable in Australian dollars over 2011–16 and gradually drop to
below 1 percent of GDP over the long term as Vanuatu’s per capita income level rises significantly.



The current account deficit is expected to remain below 6 percent of GDP over the medium term,
reflecting the relatively undiversified export base. Tourism remains the main source of foreign exchange
earnings. Over the long term, as Vanuatu’s economy matures the current account deficit is projected to
decline to below 5 percent of GDP. The deficit is projected to be financed mostly by net FDI, and new
external borrowings are assumed to grow gradually in the long run (around half a billion vatu during
2012–16 and double during 2017–30).

1/ Includes central government external debt and foreign liabilities of commercial banks.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
4/ Debt service includes PPG debt service and that related to foreign liabilities of commercial banks assuming that the latter would follow the same amortization schedule as PPG debt.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
7/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).
8/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.

Debt service-to-revenue ratio

Memorandum item:
Grant element assumed on residual financing (i.e., financing required above baseline) 6/

Sources: Vanuatu authorities; and IMF staff estimates and projections.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline, while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 11/59
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 23, 2011

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with Vanuatu
On April 22, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Vanuatu.1
Background
Economic activity is showing signs of a moderate rebound after both external and domestic demand
slowed down in 2009–10. Private investment is picking up, tourism is gradually expanding, and
agricultural production is increasing partly in response to sharp rises in copra prices. The key
downside risks are delays in infrastructure investment and slower tourism growth owing to recent
natural disasters in the region. Inflation is ticking up and is expected to reach 4 percent on the back
of higher food and oil prices, as well as rising domestic demand.
The balance of payments has been stable. The current account deficit remained high at about 6
percent of GDP in 2010, but was fully financed by FDI inflows and official grants. Official reserves
remained around $160 million (covering six months of imports) in 2010 after rising throughout 2009
(helped by the SDR allocation).

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and
discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters,
the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the
conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any
qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
The fiscal deficit deteriorated to 2.7 percent of GDP in 2010 as revenue fell short of budget
projections. Total revenue excluding grants shrunk 2.4 percent from 2009, compared with a
budgeted increase of 17 percent, reflecting weaknesses in revenue from both external trade and
domestic activity. For 2011, the authorities are targeting a substantial reduction in the deficit to
0.7 percent of GDP. They expect to achieve this reduction by maintaining the nominal wage bill
broadly at the 2010 level and lowering capital expenditure.
The Reserve Bank of Vanuatu (RBV) maintains an easy monetary stance established at the onset of
the global financial crisis. There is ample liquidity in the banking system, and bank lending grew by
12 percent (y/y) in 2010, with loans to households and foreign exchange denominated loans
increasing significantly. The vatu has changed little in effective terms since 2009.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for implementing appropriate policies, leading to a
strong rebound in economic activity. The challenge now is to support the recovery while guarding
against inflation risks and pushing ahead with fiscal consolidation. Over the medium term, rebuilding
fiscal, external, and financial buffers is crucial to enhance Vanuatu’s resilience to shocks.
Directors considered this year’s budget expenditure target to be appropriate. They stressed the
importance of limiting total expenditure to the budgeted level, particularly by containing the wage bill,
but encouraged the authorities to allow free play of the automatic stabilizers on the revenue side, if
needed. Directors recommended a broadly balanced budget for 2012, which would restore room for
policy maneuver against future shocks. Further efforts to mobilize revenue, improve tax
administration, and reduce contingent liabilities at public enterprises will also strengthen fiscal
buffers.
With rising inflation risks, Directors encouraged early action to unwind the accommodative monetary
stance. Rapid growth in credit to households and foreign currency loans calls for continued vigilance
and, if necessary, additional prudential measures. Directors saw scope for some exchange rate
depreciation as part of a broader macroeconomic response to persistent pressures on Vanuatu’s
official foreign exchange reserves. More broadly, they underscored the need to safeguard external
buffers by maintaining an adequate level of foreign exchange reserves.
Directors welcomed progress in bolstering the soundness of the banking sector, particularly the
recent decision to tighten capital and liquidity requirements. They encouraged further efforts to
strengthen the regulatory and supervisory framework that covers the whole financial system,
including micro lenders and offshore banks.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
