STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND FIRST REVIEW UNDER THE STAFF-MONITORED
PROGRAM

KEY ISSUES
Context: Against a background of political liberalization, the government is pursuing
comprehensive economic reforms to open Myanmar to the global economy, boost
growth, and reduce poverty. Nonetheless, challenges are formidable. Confidence has
been bolstered by international re-engagement and domestic reforms, but the capacity
for managing change and absorbing international assistance is being stretched.
Staff-Monitored Program: The program focuses on maintaining macroeconomic
stability throughout the reform process and building the institutions and tools needed
for the medium term. The SMP, which runs through end-2013, is on track. Quantitative
targets and structural benchmarks for March 2013 were met. Wider structural reforms
have proceeded broadly in line with the authorities’ plans, although progress on
establishing monetary control has been hampered by the delay in passing the Central
Bank of Myanmar law.
Macroeconomic situation and outlook: Growth is accelerating, driven by gas
production, construction and services, while inflation climbed to 4.7 percent (y/y) in
March 2013. External balances remain stable even as the current account deficit has
widened due to large inflows of foreign direct investment. The short-term economic
outlook remains favorable, with growth expected to accelerate slightly in 2013/14, and
inflation to remain contained. International reserves are projected to continue to rise.
Fiscal policy is striking an appropriate balance between providing for much-needed
investment and social spending, and supporting macroeconomic stability. Risks to the
outlook are tilted slightly to the downside.
Longer-term prospects: The outlook is bright, if key institutional constraints are
addressed. Myanmar has significant economic potential, which could yield sustained
high growth with a stable external balance. However, to translate favorable
endowments into high, sustained and inclusive growth, institutions and policies to
manage the economy and supervise the financial system need to be built rapidly. In
addition, policies supportive of private-sector investment, as well as public spending on
infrastructure, health, and educations are required.
Exchange regime. Following the introduction of a managed float on April 1, 2012, the
de-facto exchange rate regime is classified as “other managed arrangement.” Myanmar
continues to avail itself of the transitional arrangements of Article XIV, Section 2, but it
no longer maintains restrictions under such arrangements. The authorities intend to
accept the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3 in 2013.

INTRODUCTION
1.
Myanmar is rapidly emerging from a long period of isolation. Against a background of
political liberalization, the government is pursuing comprehensive economic reforms to open
Myanmar to the global economy, boost growth, and reduce poverty. Concomitantly, the
international community has suspended or abolished most sanctions. Relations with the Asian
Development Bank (AsDB) and World Bank have been normalized, and an agreement has been
reached with the Paris Club on rescheduling of arrears.
2.
The authorities’ Staff-Monitored Program (SMP), which runs through end-2013, is on
track. The program focuses on maintaining macroeconomic stability throughout the reform process
and building the institutions and tools needed for the medium term. A key focus is achieving
Article VIII status in 2013. Quantitative targets and structural benchmarks for March 2013 were met.
Wider structural reforms have proceeded broadly in line with the authorities’ plans, although
progress on establishing monetary control has been hampered by the delay in passing the Central
Bank of Myanmar (CBM) law.
3.
Nonetheless, challenges are formidable. Confidence has been bolstered by international reengagement and domestic reforms. However, the capacity for managing change and absorbing
international assistance is being stretched as the demands on economic policy formulation and
institution building grow more complex. In addition, addressing widespread poverty and promoting
broad-based growth will require comprehensive and wide-ranging reforms.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK AND RISKS
A. Recent Developments
4.
The course of political and economic reforms is becoming increasingly secure, despite
ethnic and religious tensions. Political reconciliation continues, with the parliament set to review
the constitution. This will set the tone for the 2015 general election, which is increasingly shaping
political (and economic) calculations. Recent reshuffles of ministers and high-ranking officials are
widely seen as moves to strengthen governance.
5.
Relations with bilateral and multilateral creditors have been normalized. In April 2012,
Myanmar agreed with Japan, its largest creditor, on a debt restructuring plan to resolve its arrears.
Furthermore, Myanmar resolved its arrears held by the World Bank and the AsDB in January 2013. In
late-January 2013, agreement was reached with the Paris Club on a concessional debt treatment
that will write off 50 percent of all arrears and reschedule the remainder over 15 years with a 7-year
grace period. The phased treatment will be completed in early 2014.
6.
Growth is accelerating and external balances remain stable. Growth is estimated to have
risen to 6½ percent in 2012/13, driven by gas production, construction and services. Inflation
climbed to 4.7 percent (y/y) in March 2013. The current account deficit is estimated to have widened
4

MYANMAR

to around 4½ percent of GDP in 2012/13, but to have been financed by foreign direct investment.
After a period of appreciation, the exchange rate has been depreciating markedly recently, by
6 percent in May alone. International reserves, some of which are still held by state banks, have
increased to US$4.6 billion at end-March, covering 3¾ months of prospective imports. Broad money
and private sector credit are growing rapidly at 58 and 48 percent (y/y), respectively, in February.
The fiscal deficit in 2012/13 is estimated to have declined to 3¾ percent of GDP, lower than
envisaged earlier, on account of higher tax revenues and lower than anticipated capital expenditure.
7.
Over the past year, the government has pursued wide-ranging economic reforms, in line
with previous staff advice, including under the SMP. Central elements have been the adoption of
a managed floating exchange regime, which replaced a highly overvalued official exchange rate, and
the establishment of a functioning formal foreign exchange market. The government has also
liberalized imports and removed exchange restrictions, and steps to liberalize bank lending have
been taken. In 2012/13, budget allocations for health and education have been increased
substantially, from low levels, and efforts to reform tax policy and strengthen tax administration are
underway. Legislation to improve the business climate and boost investment has also been passed.1

B. Outlook and Risks
Staff Views
8.
The short-term economic outlook remains favorable. Growth is expected to accelerate
slightly in 2013/14, led by rising gas production and investment, including in the transport and
telecommunications sectors, and a recovery in agriculture. Pressures from wage increases and asset
prices are building, but inflation is expected to remain contained at around 6½ percent (y/y),
assisted by global commodity prices, which are forecast to decline. International reserves are
projected to continue to rise. Financial intermediation is forecast to increase further, with broad
money and credit to the economy continuing to expand at double-digit rates. Following a mid-year
supplementary allocation, the budget deficit is projected at 5 percent of GDP.
9.
Medium term prospects are bright, if key institutional constraints are addressed.
Myanmar has significant economic potential, which could yield growth of around 7 percent in the
medium term, with a stable external balance. In addition to abundant natural resources, it has fertile
land; a young, cheap labor force; and a strategic geographic position, which could provide an entry
point into Asian supply chains. Investor interest is high. However, to translate these favorable
endowments into high, sustained and inclusive growth, institutions and policies to manage the
economy and supervise the financial system need to be built rapidly. In addition, policies supportive
of private-sector investment, as well as public spending on infrastructure, health, and education are
required.

10.
Risks to the outlook are tilted slightly to the downside (Box 1). The main risks stem
from the authorities’ limited macroeconomic management capacity, which is being strained by the
rapid, broad-based economic transition and emerging domestic price pressures. In particular,
meeting the policy challenges brought about by the liberalization and opening of the economy will
require faster introduction of monetary policy tools. Nonetheless, progress so far has been
impressive and, if the pace of reforms were to exceed expectations, growth could rise beyond
baseline projections.

Authorities’ Views
11.
The authorities broadly concurred with staff’s views on the economic outlook. They
stressed that the implementation of measures to improve agricultural productivity, support
industrialization and foster small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) should further strengthen the
growth outlook. The authorities were optimistic about the implementation of the macroeconomic
reform program, but acknowledged the need to appropriately prioritize and sequence reforms in
line with their capacity to implement and absorb technical assistance (TA). They stressed the
importance of IMF TA in key areas of macroeconomic management.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Maintaining Stability
The key short-term macroeconomic policy challenge facing the authorities is to maintain stability in a
rapidly changing economy with still relatively weak policy frameworks and limited instruments.
Maintaining low inflation is vital to retain public confidence in the reform program and safeguard
external stability.

Background
12.
External balances remain stable. Notwithstanding a widening of the current account
deficit, international reserves have increased, and are expected to rise further as direct investment
and capital inflows (both through formal and informal channels) strengthen. While total reserves (i.e.
including those held by state banks) are still above traditional adequacy metrics, those under the
direct control of the CBM are only just sufficient to safeguard external stability, despite a faster
increase than envisaged in the SMP (Box 2). A debt sustainability analysis indicates that Myanmar is
now at low risk of debt distress after clearance of arrears to the AsDB and the World Bank in early
2013, and assuming completion of the full debt rescheduling agreed with the Paris Club in early
2014 upon successful completion of the SMP (Supplement 1).

managed float in April 2012. The depreciation has
taken place largely due to higher import demand, seasonality in foreign exchange inflows stemming
in part from agriculture, and fluctuations associated with a thin market. In foreign exchange
auctions, the CBM has sought to smooth fluctuations, meet demand for foreign exchange and align
the reference with the informal market rate without targeting a specific level of the exchange rate,
and has, as a result, in recent weeks sold significant amounts of reserves.

2

The foreign exchange auction is a multiple-price auction, consistent with staff advice. It gives rise to a multiple
currency practice (MCP) because foreign exchange is sold at a multiplicity of exchange rates, which may differ by
more than two percent without a mechanism in place to prevent that such deviations arise. The IMF’s Executive
Board approved this MCP on January 10, 2013 until the next Article IV consultation.

Box 2. Reserve Adequacy
Myanmar’s total official reserves are held both in state
banks and in the CBM. Based on traditional reserve
adequacy metrics, total reserves appear sufficient to
provide buffers, but reserves under direct CBM control
are only just adequate to safeguard external stability. All
reserves held by state banks are projected to be
transferred to the CBM by 2014/15.

14.
Inflation has increased significantly but remains moderate. Prices in December 2012
were 6 percent higher than a year earlier (after negative inflation in the first half of 2012), but
inflation has since fallen back to 4.7 percent (y/y) in March. Key drivers have been increases in prices
for fuel and rent, and food. Exchange rate developments have so far had only a small impact,
though the recent depreciation is expected to partially feed through to domestic prices in the
course of 2013/14. Asset price increases in urban centers and public sector wage rises could also
add to price pressures.
15.
Money and credit have been growing rapidly, though from a low base. About onefifth of broad money growth reflects revaluation of foreign-currency deposits following the float.
Increased inflows, from gas revenues as well as repatriations of capital through the informal market,
and strong reserve money growth account for the remainder. At the same time, the CBM’s deposit
auctions, which were intended to sterilize the impact of its foreign exchange operations, were held
only intermittently due to budgetary constraints. Excess reserves, held mostly by the Myanma
Economic Bank (MEB), remain large, and the ratio of private sector credit to deposits has declined
(and remained stable for private banks). Overall, the financial sector remains small, with broad
money and credit to the private sector accounting for only 42 and 10 percent of GDP, respectively.

Box 3. Exchange Rate Assessment

The recent significant depreciation of the kyat,
however, suggests that the exchange rate is moving
toward alignment with longer-term fundamentals.
Nonetheless, the projected increases in natural
resource revenues and aid inflows are likely to exert
upward pressure on the real exchange rate in the
future. There are only limited macroeconomic tools
to address this: in the short term, given the absence
of monetary policy tools, only fiscal policy can be
employed, but with large development needs, fiscal
tightening would be inappropriate. Therefore,
structural policies to boost productivity in the
nonresource sector are critical, both for growth and
competitiveness.

The CBM’s policy of smoothing exchange rate fluctuations while not targeting a
specific rate is appropriate. Attempting to target a specific exchange rate level could be costly,
and given significant analytical uncertainty both due to a thin data base and the structural
transformation of the economy, would be fraught with risk. Given the scale of the economic
transition underway, the CBM should also strive to build further reserves to achieve at least
5 months of prospective import cover. This should take place both through further transfers from
state banks and net purchases at auctions, but not at the expense of the stability and further
development of the foreign exchange market. Expected higher foreign exchange inflows over the
next year provide an opportunity to do so, though tools to sterilize foreign exchange inflows remain
underdeveloped (see below). In addition, building capacity to better understand seasonality could
serve as a precursor for smoothing exchange rate fluctuations over time horizons of months rather
than days or weeks.
17.
With monetary policy tools still being developed, fiscal policy is the main instrument
for macroeconomic management. However, it also has to bear the burden of addressing
Myanmar’s large development needs. The 2013/14 budget and projected additional spending in the
mid-term supplementary budget strike an appropriate balance between these two key goals of fiscal
policy and are consistent with maintaining a low risk of debt distress (Box 4). At the same time,
monetization of the fiscal deficit should be reduced and eliminated over the next few years. Over the
medium term, the authorities’ strategy of keeping deficits of around 5 percent of GDP while
increasing nonresource revenue, boosting allocations to priority sectors, and increasing access to
concessional finance is also appropriate to maintain debt sustainability while meeting pressing
spending needs. This target may, however, have to be adjusted according to the macroeconomic
environment and particularly so until effective monetary policy tools are developed.
18.
Rapid credit growth is a welcome sign of financial deepening. It does not, at present,
pose significant macroeconomic risks, but should be monitored carefully, and further relaxation of
lending constraints should not be considered. Experience elsewhere has shown that sustained high
levels of annual credit growth tend to lead to macroeconomic instability, particularly when
accompanied by rapidly rising real estate prices. This should be factored into the authorities’
monetary policy settings once effective tools are established.

Authorities’ Views
19.
The authorities broadly concurred with staff’s views. They stressed their commitment
to a flexible exchange rate policy that does not target a specific level, while smoothing fluctuations
and maintaining adequate international reserves. They also agreed that further transfers of reserves
to the CBM were needed, but noted that declining reserves at state banks limited the scope for
further growth from that source. They were also conscious of their limited ability to control
monetary aggregates and credit developments. With regard to fiscal policy, the authorities
reaffirmed their commitment to a medium-term deficit target of around 5 percent of GDP to
maintain a low risk of debt distress and support macroeconomic stability. In this regard, they

Box 4. The 2013/14 Budget
The 2013/14 budget reflects the government’s policies to reduce poverty, increase priority spending, and
granting greater financial autonomy to state economic enterprises (SEEs). Key expenditure measures include:
 A 23 percent salary increase to public sector workers and pensioners intended to reduce the gap
between public sector salaries in Myanmar and peer countries. With significant additional hiring planned, in
particular in priority sectors, the wage bill is expected to increase by 50 percent. The wage bill, however,
remains low by regional standards and still only accounts for 11 percent of current expenditure.
 Higher current spending in education and health, which has been increased by 30 and 78 percent,
respectively, compared to 2012/13. Exceptional overheads are budgeted for the nationwide census.
 Allocations for capital are reduced as preparations for the South East Asian Games are being completed,
and the focus in the health sector is shifting increasingly to primary health care and prevention (which
requires less capital and more current spending).
 Increasing financial autonomy of SEEs. In 2013/14, profitable SEEs are expected to self-finance
100 percent of their working capital, while the government will cover 20 percent of working capital expenses
of loss-making SEEs (in 2012/13, all SEEs were expected to self-finance 78 percent of the working capital).
On the revenue side, once the surge in tax revenues
in 2012/13 is taken into account (which the budget,
drafted before detailed revenue figures were
available, does only to a limited degree), the budget
deficit is projected at about 3¾ percent of GDP.
However, the supplementary budget in mid-year is
expected to introduce significant increases in
spending, including on security due to continued
ethnic and religious unrest, and also for the
establishment of a Large Taxpayer Office (LTO), CBM
open market operations and other priority areas.
These additional expenditures, many of which are
structural, are projected to result in a fiscal deficit of
around 5 percent of GDP.

B. Forging the Tools for Monetary Control
The liberalization of the foreign exchange market necessitates the establishment of monetary
control. Without an adequate framework and instruments to conduct domestic monetary policy,
the CBM is unable to maintain domestic stability and build external buffers.
Background
20.
The authorities have made rapid progress toward a unified exchange rate and an
open current account. Flows through the formal exchange auction have increased markedly since
its introduction in April 2012, and the official rate is now closely aligned with informal market rates.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MYANMAR

A foreign exchange management law freeing all current transactions has been enacted in August
2012, and implementing instructions issued over the course of the past months. Payment
restrictions on invisibles have been mostly lifted, and private banks enabled to offer foreign
exchange operations at par with state banks. A plan to phase out Foreign Exchange Certificates
(FECs) (SMP benchmark) is being implemented, with more than half of FECs outstanding already
exchanged. Nonetheless, a small number of restrictions on current transactions arising from
provisions in the foreign investment law remain. In addition, the recent cessation by the state banks
of timely transfers of foreign exchange on behalf of the private banks is limiting development of the
formal foreign exchange market as most suppliers of foreign exchange to the market hold their
funds at one of the state banks.
21.
Final enactment of the new law to give greater autonomy to the CBM has been
delayed. While the CBM bill—drafted with IMF TA support—was approved by the legislature in
March 2013, legal considerations necessitate revisions before it can be enacted. Furthermore,
uncertainty remains over its provisions in key areas, notably budgetary and operational autonomy.
The delay of the law has impeded the development and use of monetary policy tools, in particular
deposit auctions, since the CBM currently operates under a budget appropriated by the parliament,
which constrains its expenditure on open market operations. Regulations to establish effective
reserve requirements have also not been issued. However, the CBM has removed the ban on
interbank trading, and is considering further steps to help market development.

Staff Views
22.
Remaining restrictions arising from provisions in the foreign investment law are
minor, but need to be removed to achieve full compliance with Article VIII and ASEAN
Economic Community obligations. The current policy of allowing profit transfers abroad after
payment of profit taxes without further restriction should be continued and instructions issued to
formalize the practice. At the same time, the deduction of living expenses from permissible transfers
of salaries will need to be abolished. Also, the instructions issued to implement the foreign exchange
management law over the last year by the CBM should be replaced and, where necessary, amended
by a set of comprehensive regulations.
23.
The wider foreign exchange market is still in its infancy, and requires active support
for its development. To avoid jeopardizing hard-won gains in market formalization and exchange
rate convergence, the CBM should further facilitate the replenishment of private banks’ overseas
accounts by placing their purchases of foreign exchange from the formal auction, upon request,
directly into these accounts. Additionally, the Ministry of Finance and Revenue (MoFR) and CBM
should together instruct the state banks to make foreign exchange payments on behalf of private
banks in a timely manner as long as the private banks have sufficient funds in their accounts. The
CBM should also reactivate its U.S. dollar account at the U.S. Federal Reserve so that it can make and
receive foreign exchange payments on behalf of private banks that are purchasing foreign exchange
in the auctions without recourse to one of the state banks. The development of a sufficiently deep
and developed interbank market will also be important—price discovery of the exchange rate can
then take place there, replacing the current multiple-price auction system.
12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MYANMAR

24.
Enactment of the CBM law and issuing implementing regulations are critical, and
need to be achieved as soon as possible. The authorities need to ensure that the law contains key
provisions for budgetary and operational autonomy, and authority to conduct monetary policy and
supervise the financial sector, including state banks. Concrete supervisory powers will need to be
specified in a new financial institutions law.
25.
At the same time, the CBM should press ahead with a number of measures, while
waiting for the CBM law, to prepare for its new mandate and move toward a reserve money
targeting framework. Key immediate steps are (i) maintaining regular deposit auctions which have
recently been resumed (new SMP benchmark); (ii) continuously improving the CBM’s reserve money
and liquidity projections; and (iii) recalibration of reserve requirements in line with previous IMF TA
(Box 5). Finally, the CBM needs to further develop its internal organization, management and
information dissemination so as to be able to fulfill its new mandate effectively.

Authorities’ Views
26.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to full liberalization of current account
transactions and fully accepting their Article VIII obligations during 2013. They outlined their
policy of helping to develop the interbank foreign exchange market. They noted, however, that,
given capacity constraints, it is expected to take several years until the CBM will be able to forego
their current auction system, and requested an extension of the Fund’s approval for this MCP, along
with continued TA for building the foreign exchange market. They also indicated that they viewed
CBM support for private banks’ foreign transactions as a transitory measure until banks could rely
on their own infrastructure and correspondent banking relations.
27.
The authorities broadly shared the staff’s views on monetary policy, but explained
that delays had in part occurred due to the uncertainty surrounding the new CBM law. They
indicated their intention to resume regular deposit auctions, even if initially on a small scale, but
hoped to be able to increase volumes at a later stage, when they would seek increased budget
allocations for this purpose. They explained that once the CBM law was passed, budget restrictions
would be lifted. The authorities also pointed out that they had already drafted instructions to
introduce new reserve requirements, which were currently in the final stages of internal consultation.

C. Financial Sector Modernization
Development of a modern, well-regulated and supervised financial sector is critical to finance
investment, reduce monetization, and transmit the CBM’s monetary policy.
Background
28.
The financial sector is small, segmented, partly dollarized, and repressed due to
administrative controls that limit intermediation. State-owned banks continue to dominate and

Box 5. Moving Toward Reserve Money Targeting
Currently, the CBM has no nominal policy anchor. While its ultimate monetary policy goals—domestic
price and external stability—will be established by the new CBM law, to achieve them, the CBM will
need to develop a reserve money targeting framework to establish an intermediate policy target. To
reach this objective, careful sequencing of reforms is needed:
Regular deposit auctions, even at low volumes, serve to establish the practice and develop the
market, even if current budgetary constraints do not permit operations on a meaningful scale. Once
budget constraints are relieved through larger allocations in the mid-term supplementary budget and
eventually removed when the CBM law enters into force, volumes should be stepped up. This also
requires continuous refining of the CBM’s reserve money projections, which will be supported by IMF
TA.



 Recalibrating reserve requirements is a critical keystone in the monetary reform process, and should
be implemented as soon as possible. This reform will give the CBM leverage over monetary conditions
by creating a demand for CBM current account balances.

This will support the development of an interbank market, which is critical to improve the
transmission of monetary policy and permit the eventual liberalization of lending rates.


 These elements will enable the CBM to introduce a reserve money target in 2014. Reforms to
standing facilities will help manage interest rate volatility.

Development of liquidity forecasting and the integration of state banks into the monetary regime
are medium-term issues. Liquidity forecasting can initially be focused on the factors the CBM knows
best and then be developed over time.



Once state bank reforms lead to competition with commercial banks, state banks will need to be
subject to reserve requirements. The significant excess liquidity of the MEB needs to be mopped up to
prevent a liquidity overhang in the banking system.



Direct controls on retail interest rates should be retained until the CBM has established a track
record of maintaining the reserve money target. Once the CBM has established control over wholesale
interest rates, direct controls can be phased out.

public confidence is low. There is currently no operational foreign bank presence and governance
and supervision of local banks is far behind international standards, including on AML/CFT issues.
29.
However, the sector is growing and modernizing rapidly. Eligible collateral has been
expanded to include key agricultural export goods, deposit rates have been liberalized within a fixed
corridor, and the Myanma Agricultural Development Bank has raised credit limits for farmers. The
authorities have also recently abolished the capital-to-deposit requirement, and eased capital
requirements for the opening of new branches. Credit cards and automated teller machines have
been introduced, and a payment union for interbank settlements established. There has also been a
rapid increase in microfinance providers, but they are effectively unsupervised.
30.
The sector is set to expand further. Applications for opening new bank branches have
more than tripled relative to 2012/13. The establishment of a stock exchange is planned, several
private insurance companies have recently been licensed, and the microfinance sector is projected
to grow further. In addition, the authorities are in the process of finalizing their policy for admitting
foreign banks, initially through joint ventures.

Staff Views
31.
Increasing access to financial services is important for broad-based growth. In this
regard, the expansion of microfinance institutions, the abolishment of the capital-to-deposit ratio,
the expected licensing of private insurance companies, and the easing of capital requirements for
opening new bank branches are steps in the right direction (though capital requirements for new
branches should soon be removed completely). However, particular care will need to be taken to
effectively supervise the increasing number of operators in the microfinance and the hitherto statemonopolized insurance sector (see below).
32.
The transition to a modern financial system is complex. The changes required in the
financial sector are wide-ranging, will take time, and require significant capacity building (in the CBM
as well as in private and state-owned banks), in particular in regulation and supervision. Key
priorities are:


Licensing and foreign bank entry. Licensing policies and procedures need to be adequate to
regulate the anticipated entry of international banks into Myanmar. Staff support the authorities’
careful approach and their intention to allow domestic banks time to catch up with international
banking standards. However, the proposed structure of joint-venture banks separated from
wholly-owned domestic entities would create a parallel banking system which runs against
international good practice, creates corporate governance risks and presents significant
supervisory challenges.



Regulating foreign exchange positions. To guard against the build-up of foreign exchange risk in
the banking sector, supervision needs to be strengthened, and instructions limiting banks’ net
open foreign exchange positions, as well as other prudential regulations that may be needed,
should be issued soon, with IMF TA support.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

MYANMAR



Establishing market-determined interest rates. Establishment of deposit/credit auctions and of
treasury securities auctions are the first steps toward market-determined interest rates.
Regulations to govern such auctions are being prepared (SMP benchmark), and the IMF will
provide TA to help implement them.



Modernizing prudential regulations and developing supervisory capacity. In particular, bringing
the definitions of bank capital and nonperforming loans closer to international standards;
strengthening the enforcement of connected lending limits; and improving banks’ risk
management are needed before lending rates and maturities are liberalized. This requires not
only the enhancement of supervisory capacity, for which the IMF will provide a resident advisor,
but also the strengthening of banks’ capacity and improvement in their reporting of key data
and, given developments in the financial sector, a framework for consolidated supervision. In
this regard, strengthening the legal framework through revision of the financial institutions act
will be an important step. State banks also need to be brought under the CBM’s supervision.
Furthermore, supervision of the microfinance and the insurance sectors is in its infancy and
needs urgent strengthening.



Addressing AML/CFT deficiencies. Myanmar is classified by the Financial Action Task Force as
having strategic AML/CFT deficiencies and not having made sufficient progress in addressing
them, and could face countermeasures after October 2013, which could reverse recent progress
in integrating with international financial markets. To avoid these, the authorities should act
urgently to strengthen both the legal framework and supervisory arrangements for AML/CFT.

33.
As private banks play an increasing role in the financial system, the role of stateowned banks will need to be considered (Box 6). State banks are effectively beyond the CBM’s
supervisory remit. In addition to subjecting these banks to CBM supervision once the CBM law is
passed and the financial institutions law revised, reform options, in particular for the Myanma
Foreign Trade Bank (MFTB) and the MEB, need to be developed, particularly as the process is
complex and the transition must be carefully considered and managed.

Authorities’ Views
34.
The authorities broadly agreed with the staff’s assessment and recommendations,
but pointed to the need for significant additional TA.


With regard to their planned policies on joint ventures, they emphasized the need to provide
sufficient room for domestic banks to develop capacity to be able to effectively compete with
foreign entrants, and pointed to the strong interest of foreign banks in establishing a presence
in Myanmar, including through joint ventures.



With regard to strengthening supervision and regulating net open foreign exchange positions,
they explained that they had no experience in this area and were looking forward to
forthcoming TA from the IMF, World Bank and other partners. They also requested comments
on their draft regulations on treasury securities auctions and TA for implementing them.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND



While acknowledging the challenges for supervision arising from the expansion of microfinance,
they also stressed the need to rapidly boost credit availability in rural areas, in line with their
emphasis on rural development, and counted on donor support, in particular form the World
Bank and AsDB, to assist in building up supervision of these institutions.



With regard to addressing AML/CFT deficiencies, they explained that, with IMF TA, they had
brought key bills—a countering of money laundering law, and a counter terrorism bill—on their
way to submission to parliament. They agreed that urgent action in this area was needed, but
pointed to the parliament’s crowded agenda as reforms were advancing in many areas.
Box 6. Reforming State-Owned Banks
There are four state-owned banks that carry out not only commercial operations but, to varying degrees,
also state functions. The largest and most important banks are MFTB and MEB.
The MFTB has until recently held most of the government’s foreign reserves and carried out most foreign
exchange transactions also for state-owned companies and the private sector. However, the increasing role
of private banks in foreign exchange operations and the ongoing transfer of reserves to the CBM necessitate
a reconsideration of its role in the financial system. Its current role as an agent for foreign exchange
operations is not a viable business model in the longer run, in particular after the normalization of
international financial relations. Therefore, options need to be explored to absorb the MFTB (or all or parts
of its staff) into the CBM, merge it with another state-owned bank, or unwind it.
The MEB, in addition to its commercial relations with the private sector, also acts as the public sector’s
treasury. Despite some net purchases of treasury securities over the last year, it holds large balances of
structural excess liquidity. Reducing this (e.g. through a swap against treasury bills held by the CBM) would
open the way for allowing the MEB to participate freely in treasury securities auctions on a regular basis and
integrate more fully with the nascent market-based financial system.

D. Fiscal Reforms

A large share of government revenue
is directly or indirectly related to natural
resources, in particular gas. New fields coming
on stream in 2013/14 will boost gas revenues in
the next few years, with a peak of 6.5 percent of
GDP projected in 2014/15. In the medium term,
however, gas production is expected to level.
Under current projections, which exclude revenues
from potential new discoveries, all gas revenues
are needed to finance the public sector budget

(which would still leave fiscal deficits of around 5 percent of GDP, in line with the government’s fiscal
strategy). Windfall receipts may also occur as the government licenses the use of state-owned
assets, such as the telecommunications spectrum, and oil and gas blocks, or privatizes productive
enterprises.
36.
The government has begun to develop a far-reaching fiscal reform strategy to
mobilize nonresource revenues and revamp public financial management (PFM) (Box 7). Key
goals are broadening the tax base and improving accountability and public service delivery, as well
as decentralization to state and regional governments and increased autonomy of SEEs.
Box 7. The Government’s Fiscal Reform Strategy
Achieving the government’s strategic goals requires reforms in tax administration, tax policy, and PFM.
Tax administration. A strategic reform plan has been adopted by the Internal Revenue Department (IRD).
The plan envisages the establishment of a LTO in September 2013 (SMP structural benchmark) that will
become fully operational from April 1, 2014. The LTO will also introduce taxpayer self-assessment and issue
unique taxpayer identification numbers. In the longer term, the LTO will serve as a model to establish a
number of medium taxpayer offices and ultimately for the reform of small taxpayer compliance methods.
The IRD has initiated the staffing of LTO, compiled a list of the 1,000 largest taxpayers by turnover, and is in
the process of selecting an accommodation for the LTO in Yangon. The selection of large taxpayers to be
managed by the LTO and the design of staff training will be assisted by IMF TA.
Tax policy. The government’s long-term objective is to introduce a full value-added tax (VAT) as the main
broad-based consumption tax. In the interim, the focus is on reforming the taxation of special consumption
goods into a separate tax and expanding the taxation of services. The government is also discussing the
merits of tax incentives to promote investment, and has established a broad-based high-level committee to
consider these issues.
PFM. The MoFR has established a working group to develop PFM reform strategies and help coordinate
donors. The PFM strategy will be finalized in the next few months. The strategy focuses on key priorities
including: (i) budget formulation; (ii) strengthening fiscal discipline and expenditure control; and (iii) fiscal
accounting and reporting. Establishing a treasury department in the MoFR with cash and debt management
functions will be a critical initial step (which will also facilitate the introduction of treasury securities auctions)
and will be supported by TA from the IMF and other partners. A public expenditure review (PER) coordinated
by the World Bank has been launched which aims to improve the efficiency of public spending and inform
policies on fiscal decentralization. The government has also committed to implementing the Extractive
Industry Transparency Initiative, which will support revenue transparency.

Staff Views
37.
Higher nonresource revenues are needed to boost much-needed development
expenditure and reduce dependence on natural resources. To this end, reforming tax policy and
strengthening tax administration are critical.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MYANMAR



Tax policy should aim at broadening the tax base and simplify the existing rate structure. Key
priorities in the short term are (i) reforming the taxation of special consumption goods into a
separate tax as a precursor to introducing a VAT; (ii) expanding the taxation of services as soon
as administrative capacity allows; and (iii) clarifying policy on tax incentives, including in the
forthcoming small and medium enterprise and special economic zone laws, with a view to
limiting such incentives to the largest extent possible so as not to undermine the tax base and
place a larger burden on nonexempt taxpayers. In this regard, while providing an attractive
investment environment is important, tax incentives should play only a minor role. Instead, other
options to attract investment should be emphasized, such as streamlining bureaucracy, and
providing key infrastructure and effective social services. Exemptions, to the extent they are
retained, should be streamlined and time-limited.



Improving tax administration will also be crucial to increasing revenue performance. The
significant gains made in 2012/13 are encouraging in this regard. Going forward, the
establishment of the LTO should see revenues increase further and will pave the way for
subsequent reforms. It is therefore important that sufficient resources are allocated in the
forthcoming supplementary budget to enable the LTO to establish operations.

38.
Modernized fiscal systems are essential to improve public service delivery and
accountability. The emerging priorities of the government’s PFM strategy are appropriate, and the
strategy should be finalized soon and disseminated to development partners to facilitate donor
coordination. Early results from the PER should, if possible, be used to inform the preparation of the
2014/15 budget. A key first step will be the establishment of a treasury function.
39.
Over the medium term, the authorities should develop a fiscal framework that
ensures macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability. Key principles underlying such a
framework include (i) smoothing of expenditures in the face of potentially volatile resource
revenues; (ii) prudent projections of resource revenues to avoid a deficit path that leads to an
unsustainable build-up of debt; and (iii) utilization of nonrecurring revenues (whether from
nonrenewable resources or one-off revenues from asset sales) for investment, at least once a broad
tax base is developed that can finance recurrent spending needs. The fiscal framework would also
need to be supported by appropriate fiscal institutions for a transparent and efficient management
of resource wealth, and a fiscal regime for extractive industries to better realize the revenue
potential of natural resources. The framework will also need to take into account the impact of
changing financial relations between the Union government, states and regions, and SEEs.
Authorities’ Views
40.
The authorities underlined their commitment to broad-based fiscal reforms. With the
development of many reform plans supported by IMF TA, they concurred with staff on key priorities.
While they agreed that a reform of taxation of special consumption goods was important, they did
not commit to a timetable, in part because of ongoing internal policy debates. On the key issue of
tax incentives, officials from the MoFR also pointed to discussions within the government, but
stressed their commitment to limiting exemptions to the extent possible.

E. Boosting Broad-Based Growth
Background
41.
The authorities have developed a high-level reform plan outlined in their Framework
for Social and Economic Reform (FESR). Poverty has decreased from 32 percent in 2005 but
remained high at around 25 percent in 2010; there are also large regional disparities. The FESR
therefore outlines a medium-term growth strategy that is focused on reducing poverty and
diversifying sources of economic growth to provide income and employment, particularly in rural
areas. The FESR was endorsed by donors in the Nay Pyi Taw Accord in January 2013, and envisages
comprehensive reforms in priority sectors including agriculture, health care, education, industrial
development, and infrastructure. The agenda is daunting, both on account of its wide range and the
limited capacity of the administration.
42.
The authorities are advancing reforms in priority areas and are opening the
economy. Laws to promote foreign investment, access to land (including through titling), and
microfinance have been passed and are being implemented, and others to promote the
development of special economic zones and small enterprises are under consideration.
Telecommunications licenses are in the process of being awarded, and new offshore blocks for oil
and gas exploration are being tendered transparently (onshore blocks are being awarded shortly
after tender). To address electricity shortages, the authorities are planning to double generating
capacity within the next three to four years (largely in gas-fired plants fueled by the domestic share
of new gas fields), and have earmarked future gas discoveries for domestic use.

without spillovers to the wider economy, and that they
do not undermine the tax base. At the same time, agricultural productivity needs to be boosted to
raise rural incomes. In this regard, policies to ensure that productivity gains as well as increases in
final sales prices benefit farmers should be actively developed. Key among these are seed
development and measures to increase competition among rice traders.

44.
To reduce the human effects of poverty and improve the productivity of the
workforce, expenditures on education and health need to be raised further. The recent large
increases in budgetary allocations in these sectors are appropriate, but expenditures (and outcomes)
remain far below those of Asian peers. Furthermore, allocations need to be made with a view of
achieving high spending productivity and equitable outcomes. In this regard, the reallocation of
health expenditures toward more current spending in the 2013/14 budget is welcome.
45.
Statistics need to be improved urgently to enable effective economic planning and
management. Weak capacity and data shortcomings are a significant obstacle to macroeconomic
policymaking and hamper effective IMF surveillance. The coverage and timeliness of key series such
as national accounts, prices and balance of payments need urgent improvements and more timely
fiscal and monetary statistics are also required. The importance of improving economic statistics is
recognized by the prominence it has been given in the authorities’ economic reform strategy. At the
same time, the authorities are seeking technical support from a wide range of partners, including the
IMF.

Authorities’ views
46.
The authorities agreed on the need for broad-based reforms across sectors. They
pointed to ambitious plans for electricity generation and industrialization, and stressed the emphasis
in their plans on the development of rural areas where the large majority of the population lives.
They also agreed that improving statistics is a high priority, and requested TA in several areas.

SMP ISSUES
47.
The authorities have made good progress in implementing their SMP. All quantitative
and structural benchmarks for end-March 2013 were met. Reserve accumulation of the CBM
significantly exceeded the target, and fiscal targets were met comfortably. Payment restrictions on
invisibles have been lifted, private banks enabled to offer foreign exchange operations at par with
state banks, and a plan for withdrawing FECs has been announced and is being implemented.
48.
The authorities are also on track to meet the quantitative and structural benchmarks
for September 2013. Fiscal deficit financing targets remain appropriate for the projected deficit
outturn of 5 percent of GDP. This does not take into account proceeds from the sale of licenses for
telecommunications and oil and gas blocks, which should be used to build fiscal buffers and to
finance spending on priority areas over the medium-term in a manner consistent with maintaining
macroeconomic stability. Targets for reserve accumulation also remain appropriate, and progress
has been made to meet the structural benchmarks for September 2013 relating to the establishment
of the LTO and treasury securities auctions. The next and final review is expected to be completed in
early 2014.
49.
Developing monetary policy tools is critical for achieving the SMP’s goals. To
reinforce progress even in advance of the passage of the CBM law, the authorities have resumed bi-

weekly deposit auctions and included their continuation as a new structural benchmark in the
revised Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies. Volumes are currently small, but are
expected to increase to sterilize the impact of foreign exchange operations once budget constraints
are eased.

STAFF APPRAISAL
50.
The authorities have made impressive strides in opening and liberalizing the
economy, despite limited capacity. Import restrictions have been removed, import monopolies
abolished, administrative procedures eased, and, not least, the exchange rate regime
comprehensively overhauled. The financial sector, a year ago confined to domestic operations, has
begun to modernize and integrate with the world economy. Legislation has been passed to lay the
foundations for growth in key economic sectors. Social spending has been increased, and the
government is moving to formulate new policies for more effective poverty alleviation. Nevertheless,
the challenges ahead are daunting. In particular, administrative capacity is strained by rapid change
and the need to catch up to international practices and standards.
51.
Myanmar has come a long way in liberalizing its foreign exchange regime. With few
exceptions, the current account is open and the formal and informal markets have converged. The
recent depreciation of the kyat is contributing to aligning the exchange rate with its longer-term
fundamentals, after some apparent overvaluation up to 2012. The CBM’s policy of smoothing
exchange rate fluctuations while not targeting a specific rate remains appropriate. Continuing to
increase the CBM’s international reserves is also crucial to provide a more comfortable external
buffer to the reform process.
52.
Macroeconomic stability has been preserved so far, but tools to manage the macroeconomy need to be forged. Fiscal policy has struck an adequate balance between underpinning
stability and supporting development, and is consistent with maintaining a low risk of debt distress
following the recent rescheduling of external arrears. However, mounting price pressures indicate
that additional instruments are needed. In this regard, it is critical that monetization of the fiscal
deficit be reduced further.
53.
The liberalization of the exchange rate and of the wider economy makes the
deployment of monetary policy tools an urgent task. Establishing monetary control should be
given the highest priority. Enactment of the new CBM law will be a vital step in establishing an
appropriate legal foundation, but the CBM can and should be putting in place instruments in
advance of the law’s enactment. In this regard, the resumption of regular deposit auctions is
welcome even if volumes are still constrained, and the authorities should continuously seek to
improve their forecasting capability. Furthermore, reserve requirements should be recalibrated soon
to gain additional levers of monetary control, and financing constraints on open market operations
removed.

Development of a modern financial sector will support growth and assist in
transmitting monetary policy. This will take some time, given capacity constraints, but requires
immediate action to accelerate the process. A careful and well-sequenced approach is required. Key
priorities are establishing an effective supervisory regime, including for foreign exchange operations,
and developing a clear licensing regime for foreign banks.
55.
Fiscal deficit targets should be applied judiciously. Volatility in natural resource
revenues or lumpy inflows from asset and license sales should not lead to unwarranted volatility in
expenditure. Rather, the authorities should move toward developing a medium-term fiscal
framework that promotes the build-up of fiscal buffers through saving in good years that can then
be spent prudently over the medium term. Such a framework will require development of a wellenforced broad-based tax system and strengthened public financial management.
56.
Intensive hands-on technical assistance and capacity building tailored to Myanmar’s
specific needs will be critical for a successful reform process. Coordination, prioritization and
adaptation to Myanmar’s circumstances will be essential given the scarce administrative capacity
and the breadth of the agenda. IMF TA is expected to continue to be intensive and will be led by
government demand and delivered in close coordination with other development partners. In this
regard, improving statistics to underpin economic management and strengthen IMF surveillance will
be critical.
57.
Staff supports the authorities’ request for approval of a multiple currency practice
(MCP) subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII, Section 3. The MCP is maintained
principally for nonbalance of payments reasons. Since the MCP does not materially impede the
member’s balance of payments adjustments, does not harm the interests of other members, and
does not discriminate among members, and the authorities are unable at present to replace it, staff
recommend Executive Board approval for its retention until June 28, 2014 or the next Article IV
consultation, whichever is earlier.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

Appendix I. Myanmar—Letter of Intent
Nay Pyi Taw, June 12, 2013

Ms. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431

Dear Ms. Lagarde,
The outlook for Myanmar’s economy continues to improve. Macroeconomic stability, strong
growth, and high investor interest are signs that the implementation of our ambitious reform
program to improve the economic and social well-being of Myanmar’s citizens is bearing fruit.
Continued regularization of our international financial relations, aided by successful arrears
rescheduling agreements with multilateral and bilateral creditors, should underpin continued growth
and economic integration. Nonetheless, the liberalization of the economy and the expected inflows
of capital will provide challenges to our macroeconomic management capacity and we will press
ahead with rapidly building our macroeconomic management tools.
We remain strongly committed to the program of reforms detailed in our Letter of Intent
(LOI) of December 28, 2012. This letter reports on the outcome of our first review of progress
against the objectives of the supporting jointly-monitored program—called a Staff Monitored
Program (SMP) by the IMF. The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP)
details our updated economic and institutional reform priorities through December 2013.
We have made good progress in implementing our program. All SMP quantitative and structural
benchmarks for end-March 2013 were met. Reserve accumulation of the CBM significantly exceeded
the target and fiscal targets were met comfortably. Payment restrictions on invisibles have been
lifted, private banks enabled to offer foreign exchange operations at par with state banks, and a plan
for withdrawing Foreign Exchange Certificates has been announced and is being implemented.
Our government is also on the right track to meet the quantitative and structural benchmarks
for September 2013. Fiscal deficit financing targets remain appropriate for our projected deficit
outturn of 5 percent of GDP. This does not take into account proceeds from the sale of licenses for
telecommunications and oil and gas blocks, which we will use to build fiscal buffers and to finance
spending on priority areas over the medium-term in a manner consistent with maintaining
macroeconomic stability. We also expect to attain the structural benchmarks for September 2013
relating to the establishment of the Large Taxpayer Office and treasury securities auctions.

We expect the law to establish an autonomous Central Bank of Myanmar to be enacted soon.
Developing monetary policy tools is critical for achieving our program goals and we intend to
accelerate progress in this area in advance of the law’s enactment. In particular, we have begun
holding bi-weekly deposit auctions and propose to include their continuation as a new structural
benchmark.
We remain strongly committed to reaching the objectives of our reform program, including
the SMP objectives. This is also reflected in our dialogue with development partners and creditors,
and in their endorsement of our Framework for Economic and Social Reform in the Nay Pyi Taw
Accord in January 2013, as well as in the agreement reached with the Paris Club on rescheduling of
arrears in the same month.
We believe that the policies and measures set forth here and in our LOI dated December 28,
2012 and the accompanying MEFPs, will allow us to achieve the objectives of our program.
However, we will take any additional measures that may become necessary for this purpose. We will
continue to consult closely with IMF staff on our adoption of such measures, and in advance of any
revisions to the policies contained in the MEFP. The government will provide IMF staff with all the
information it requests to assess implementation of the SMP.
Our government authorizes the IMF to publish this Letter of Intent, and the attached MEFP.

Sincerely yours,

Attachment I. Myanmar—Memorandum of Economic and
Financial Policies
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Economic activity in Myanmar has been robust. Growth is estimated to have risen to
6½ percent in 2012/13, driven by gas production, construction, and services. Inflation rose to
6 percent (y/y) in December 2012, but has since declined to 4.7 percent in March 2013. International
reserves, some of which are still held by state banks, have increased to $4.6 billion at end-March
2013, covering 3¾ months of prospective imports. The fiscal deficit in 2012/13 is estimated at
3¾ percent of GDP, slightly lower than envisaged earlier, largely as a result of large increases in tax
collections.
2.
The outlook for Myanmar’s economy continues to improve. Growth in 2013/14 is
expected to accelerate slightly, led by rising gas production and investment, including in the
transport, energy and telecommunications sectors. Inflation is projected to remain contained at
around 6½ percent (y/y). International reserves are forecast to continue to rise. Financial
intermediation is expected to increase further, with broad money and credit to the economy
continuing to expand at double-digit rates. Over the medium term, we expect Myanmar’s significant
economic potential to be realized, with sustained growth of around 7 percent. We will continue to
increase our investment in health, education and infrastructure to ensure that growth is broad based
and supports poverty reduction.
3.
Our Government’s overarching development goals are outlined in the Framework for
Economic and Social Reforms. To achieve these goals we have identified as policy priorities
(i) sustained industrial and agricultural development to attain poverty alleviation and rural
development; (ii) equitable sharing of resources among regions and states while promoting local
and foreign investment; and (iii) effective implementation of people-centered development, through
community-driven, participatory approaches to improve education, health, and overall living
standards. Full economic integration with ASEAN in accordance with the ASEAN Economic
Community schedule will reinforce these policies. Key measures to implement our policies are land
reform, improving access to credit, and supporting access to both domestic and overseas job
markets, as well as industrial development to provide job opportunities.

II. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
4.
We recognize that to achieve our broader goals ensuring macroeconomic stability
during the reform process is critical. Our program therefore aims to (i) maintain low and stable
inflation, increase our international reserves to provide a buffer against external shocks during the
reform process, and ensure debt sustainability; and (ii) lay the foundations for sustainable growth by
building a macroeconomic framework and develop the institutions and instruments to use it
effectively.

34

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MYANMAR

5.
As we continue with our reforms, we have requested IMF staff to assist us in
monitoring our economic policies through December 2013. Our work with IMF staff will focus on
the following areas: (i) eliminating remaining exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices
(MCPs); (ii) developing monetary policy institutions and tools to support price stability;
(iii) modernizing the financial sector to facilitate macroeconomic management and growth; and
(iv) laying the foundations for improving our fiscal revenues in the medium term for sustainable
development spending. In all of these areas, we are requesting continued IMF technical assistance
(TA).

A. Foreign Exchange Policies
6.
We have taken significant steps to improve the operation of the foreign exchange
market. We have ensured through increased interventions and the consequent deepening of the
foreign exchange market that the informal market rate and the reference rate have converged
further. To complement authorized dealer banks and encourage the move from informal to formal
markets, we have also licensed a number of non-bank money changers. Payment restrictions on
invisibles have been lifted, private banks enabled to offer foreign exchange operations at par with
state banks, and a plan for withdrawing Foreign Exchange Certificates is being implemented (all
structural benchmarks).
7.
We remain committed to accepting the obligations of Article VIII Section 2(a), 3 and 4
of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement and level the playing field for private banks. To further
facilitate the replenishment of private banks’ overseas accounts, the CBM is preparing to place
banks’ purchases of foreign exchange from the formal auction, upon request, directly into these
accounts. We will also continue allowing profit transfers abroad after payment of profit taxes
without further restriction. Furthermore, we will consolidate recently issued instructions into a
consolidated set of implementing regulations for the Foreign Exchange Management Law, which will
be issued by the end of 2013. We will also continue our policy of supplying sufficient liquidity to the
foreign exchange auctions to avoid large deviations from the informal market, and not target any
specific exchange rate level. Finally, we will seek continued approval of the IMF’s Executive Board for
the multiple currency practice arising from our multi-priced foreign exchange auctions, which is
nondiscriminatory and will be maintained on a temporary basis until the foreign exchange market
develops.

B. Monetary Policy and Operations
8.
Strengthening our capacity to conduct monetary policy is a critical prerequisite for
macroeconomic management. To this end, we are in the process of preparing a revision of the
definition of required reserves to include only current account balances with the CBM, lengthen the
reserve maintenance period to two weeks, and adjusting the required reserve and liquid asset ratios,
in line with previous IMF TA recommendations. We have also begun to forecast liquidity and reserve
money, and conducted several deposit auctions, but our ability to conduct monetary operations is
constrained by the limited budget allocated by the Hluttaw for this purpose. Nonetheless, we have
begun holding deposit and credit auctions regularly every two weeks with small volumes, and will

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

35

MYANMAR

step up volumes to sterilize our foreign exchange operations once budget constraints are eased. To
strengthen monetary policy transmission, we have also removed the ban on interbank trading.
9.
Final enactment of the new law to give greater autonomy to the CBM has been
delayed. While the law was approved in March 2013, legal considerations necessitate revisions
before it can be enacted. Once the law is passed, we intend to fully use our monetary policy tools.
10.
We will reinforce our efforts to establish effective control over monetary conditions,
even ahead of the implementation of the new CBM law. To this end, we will continue to
gradually transfer international reserves from state banks to the CBM. We will also continue our biweekly deposit auctions (continuous structural benchmark), and will ease budget constraints in the
supplementary budget until they are lifted with the implementation of the CBM law. We will also
further strengthen our capacity to forecast key monetary aggregates, making use of IMF TA. We
continue to aim to move to a reserve money targeting framework during 2014 following the
establishment of a track record of deposit auctions and the revision of reserve requirements for
private banks, which we intend to implement without waiting for the CBM law to come into force.
The revised reserve requirements will be extended to state banks when sufficient capacity is
developed. To better manage foreign exchange risk, we have abolished the mandatory surrender
requirement for foreign exchange and, with IMF TA, will develop instructions on limiting banks’ net
open foreign exchange position

C. Financial Sector Modernization
11.
A modern well-regulated financial sector is important to support monetary policy
transmission and finance public sector deficits without recourse to monetization. To promote
the expansion of financial services, we have eased capital requirements for opening new bank
branches, and abolished the capital-to-deposit ratio. We have also permitted the Myanmar
Economic Bank (MEB) to purchase treasury bills to reduce its excess liquidity, but this has not been
sufficient to eliminate it. We have begun to develop a draft regulation that will establish treasury
security auctions (structural benchmark) and will move toward implementation with IMF TA support.
12.
Modernizing prudential regulations and developing supervisory capacity are critical
prerequisites for further liberalization of the financial sector. Once IMF resident advisors on
bank regulation and supervision are in place, we will bring the definitions of bank capital and
nonperforming loans closer to international standards; strengthen the enforcement of connected
lending limits to contain risks to financial stability during the modernization process of the financial
sector; and improve banks’ risk management as a precursor to liberalization of lending rates and
maturities. These changes will be implemented step by step, in line with the development of needed
supervisory capacity.
13.
We will also prepare to integrate the MEB more fully into the nascent market-based
financial system. To this end, we will, once the new CBM law is promulgated, the new reserve
requirements are applied to the MEB, and treasury securities auctions started, consider options for

36

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MYANMAR

fully absorbing MEB’s remaining excess liquidity (e.g. through a swap against treasury bills held by
the CBM) and allowing the MEB to freely participate in treasury securities auctions.
14.
The increasing role of private banks in foreign exchange operations and the ongoing
transfer of reserves to the CBM necessitate a reconsideration of the role of the Myanma
Foreign Trade Bank (MFTB) in the financial system. We will therefore begin to consider options
for MFTB reform, and will request IMF TA to help us in developing and assessing alternatives.

D. Fiscal Policies
15.
Our fiscal policy is geared toward maintaining macroeconomic stability, especially as
monetary policy tools are still being developed, while addressing the large development
needs of our country. To this end, we have passed a budget for 2013/14 that envisages further
growth in education and health current expenditure. Reduced allocations for capital arise from the
near-completion of several projects for the 2013 South East Asia Games. We also expect the need to
increase spending on security, due to continued ethnic and religious unrest, and intend to increase
allocations for priority sectors in the forthcoming supplementary budget. Nonetheless, we will
ensure that the overall budget deficit (IMF definition) will remain around the 5 percent of GDP we
believe is consistent with macroeconomic stability. We aim to keep the deficit around this level over
the medium term while continuing to increase allocations for health and education as well as
infrastructure investment. Nonconcessional financing will be used only for economically viable
projects in priority sectors such as energy and infrastructure, at levels consistent with maintaining
debt sustainability and low risk of debt distress.
16.
Modernized fiscal systems are essential to improve public service delivery and
accountability. We have developed a comprehensive strategic plan to modernize our tax
administration, the centerpiece of which is the establishment of the Large Taxpayer Office (LTO). We
have also formed a working group to develop reform strategies for public financial management
(PFM) and serve as a tool for donor coordination, after receiving TA from the IMF and World Bank,
and launched a public expenditure review (PER) with the World Bank to better inform our fiscal
policies and improve the efficiency of public spending in our priority areas.
17.
We remain committed to broadening the tax base and improving compliance to raise
resources for development spending and to reduce our reliance on natural resources. We have
therefore formed a Scrutinizing and Monitoring Tax Collection Board, with government and private
sector participation, to advise on a tax reform action plan. Introducing a value added tax remains
our medium-term goal; in the interim, we are considering reforming the taxation of special
consumption goods (such as alcohol, tobacco, luxury items, and polluting goods) and expanding the
taxation of services. In our tax policy strategy, while conscious of the need to attract investment, we
will establish the principle of streamlining and limiting tax exemptions to ensure a broad revenue
base. This principle will also inform the implementation of other planned laws, including the small
and medium enterprises law currently being debated, and the revised law on special economic
zones, which is currently being considered by the Hluttaw. Our short-term priority in tax
administration is to ensure a successful establishment of the LTO (structural benchmark) which will

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

37

MYANMAR

pave the way for eventually rolling out taxpayer self-assessment across the tax system. We will
therefore allocate sufficient resources to the LTO in the forthcoming supplementary budget for it to
adequately prepare for taking over the administration of large taxpayers at the beginning of
2014/15.
18.
Improving public financial management is crucial for successful development
outcomes and enhancing transparency. To this end, we will finalize our PFM strategy and
disseminate it to development partners in July 2013. The strategy will focus on key priorities
including: (i) budget formulation; (ii) strengthening fiscal discipline and expenditure control; and
(iii) fiscal accounting and reporting. An early action will be establishing a treasury department with
cash and debt management functions in the Ministry of Finance and Revenue during 2013 with TA
from the IMF and other partners. We also expect to finalize the PER during 2014 and will use the
early analysis to inform the preparation of our 2014/15 budget.

E. Policies for Growth
19.
The ultimate goal of our economic policies is to attain sustainable growth and poverty
reduction. In addition to the institutional and macroeconomic policy reforms outlined above, the
focus of our reforms is on improving health and education, and attracting domestic and foreign
investment to enhance human capital and attain higher growth. In addition to increased allocations
for health and education in our budget, we are also working with our development partners to build
strategies to maximize the impact of our expenditure, and obtain additional funding. To promote
investment, we have issued implementing regulations for the foreign investment law passed last
year, and laws on special economic zones and small and medium enterprises, which are key to
supporting industrialization, are expected to be passed by the Hluttaw in 2013. We are also focusing
on attracting international investment to develop critical infrastructure, including energy, transport
and telecommunication. Transparent tendering processes have been adopted in these areas, as
demonstrated by the recent auctioning processes for telecoms licenses and oil and gas blocks. To
support agricultural development we are giving high priority to implementing the new land and
microfinance laws recently passed by the Hluttaw.

F. Statistics
20.
We continue to place high priority on improving the accuracy and timeliness of our
statistics. We have already accelerated the provision of monetary data to the IMF, and have reestimated GDP for 2010/11 and 2011/12. With assistance from our partners, including the IMF, we
intend to move forward in developing an updated national accounts series with broader coverage,
an updated CPI, and enhanced coverage of the balance of payments. We will also strive to improve
fiscal and monetary statistics, including through more timely provision.

III. PROGRAM MONITORING
21.
We will continue to closely monitor the implementation of our program. In addition to
the structural benchmarks for end-September already set in our MEFP of December 28, 2012, we

38

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MYANMAR

have also introduced one new benchmark to reflect the need for additional measures to ensure that
intended program outcomes are achieved (Table 2). The definitions of the relevant variables remain
as outlined in the Technical Memorandum of Understanding attached to our MEFP of December 2,
2012. However, the target for net domestic financing of the nonfinancial public sector deficit will be
adjusted downward by the amount of proceeds from telecommunications licenses, which we will
report to the IMF’s Asia and Pacific Department. Also, we will henceforth report to the IMF’s Asia
and Pacific Department the receipts, payments, and the balances of the State Fund Account and all
its sub-accounts on a monthly basis, no more than six weeks after the end of each month.
22.
Our SMP Monitoring Committee continues to monitor implementation of our
program. It includes senior representatives from the CBM, Ministry of Finance and Revenue and the
Ministry of National Planning and Economic Development and reports regularly to the Minister of
Finance and Revenue on progress in the implementation of our program. The Committee also works
with IMF staff in conducting formal reviews of progress; the next review is due to take place in
January 2014.

Myanmar is assessed to be at low risk of debt distress following the clearance of its
external arrears.1 2 The baseline scenario assumes the planned resolution of Myanmar’s
external arrears will be completed in 2013/14 as agreed with the Paris Club creditors.
The baseline scenario also assumes a gradual reduction in Myanmar’s reliance on
nonconcessional financing, as more concessional resources become available after the
resolution of arrears. Under the baseline scenario, public and publicly guaranteed (PPG)
external debt burden indicators remain well below their indicative thresholds. One
alternative stress test (export shock) leads to a temporary breach of the indicative
threshold for the debt-to-exports ratio. However, Myanmar’s good track record of
implementing large natural gas projects and contractual purchasing commitments of
project partners mitigate some of the risks. While Myanmar’s risk of debt distress can be
characterized as low despite the breach, it requires close monitoring, in particular
because of the relatively high levels of domestic debt. Maintaining the low risk
categorization will require continuation of the current prudent fiscal policy, improvements
in tax policy and public financial management, and increasing use of concessional
financing while limiting nonconcessional borrowing to only viable and growth-enhancing
projects.

1

External public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt and public domestic debt dynamics are assessed using
the LICDSA framework, which recognizes that better policies and institutions allow countries to manage higher
levels of debt, and thus the threshold levels are policy-dependent. The quality of a country’s policies and
institutions are normally measured by the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA).
Since Myanmar does not currently have a CPIA rating, the most conservative thresholds are applied for the
purposes of this DSA. The thresholds, which apply to external PPG debt, are: 30 percent for the NPV of debtto-GDP ratio, 100 percent for the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio, 200 percent for the NPV of debt-to-revenue
ratio, 15 percent for the debt service-to exports ratio, and 18 percent for the debt service-to-revenue ratio.
2

The DSA was jointly prepared by the IMF and the World Bank in consultation with the Asian Development
Bank.

MYANMAR

BACKGROUND
1.
The external and public debt sustainability analyses are based on the standard LIC DSA
framework. The DSA framework presents the projected path of Myanmar’s external and public sector debt
burden indicators, and draws some conclusions on the forward-looking sustainability of debt.
2.
Myanmar’s DSA builds on the macroeconomic assumptions presented in Box 1. Compared to
the previous DSA, the assumptions have been revised to take into account recent developments. In
particular, the medium term GDP growth has been revised upward to 7 percent from an average of about
6.6 percent in the previous DSA, reflecting robust FDI and related private investment in productive sectors,
as well as in public investment. The overall fiscal deficit remains the same as in the previous DSA in the
medium-term, although revenue collection is expected to improve, reflecting the better-than-expected
performance in 2012/13. Long-term growth and inflation, however, are expected to be approximately the
same as in the previous DSA.
3.
The current DSA incorporates the agreed resolution of Myanmar’s arrears with its
multilateral and bilateral creditors. In April 2012, Myanmar agreed with Japan, its largest creditor, on a
debt restructuring plan to resolve its arrears through a bridge loan operation and cancellation of principal
payments and overdue charges.3 Furthermore, Myanmar resolved its arrears held by the World Bank and
the Asian Development Bank in January 2013, with the help of a bridge financing operation by Japan. In
late-January 2013, the Paris Club reached agreement with the Myanmar authorities on a debt treatment
that will be completed in early 2014. Paris Club members agreed to write off 50 percent of all arrears and
reschedule the remaining arrears over 15 years with a 7 year grace period. The treatment will be phased,
with 25 percent of the write-off occurring immediately and 75 percent on a successful completion of the
SMP. Japan signed the minutes but will continue with the more generous treatment that it had previously
announced. Norway, in addition, wrote off 100 percent of its outstanding debt. In March 2013, Italy signed a
bilateral agreement with Myanmar to cancel 50 percent percent of all arrears and conduct a debt-for
development swap of the remaining arrears.
4.
Myanmar is expected to gradually reduce its reliance on external nonconcessional financing.
With the expected resolution of its arrears and the re-engagement of the international community,
Myanmar is expected to gradually regain access to concessional resources. As donors re-engage with
Myanmar, and gradually identify suitable projects, the share of nonconcessional financing is expected to
decline. The authorities aim to use nonconcessional external borrowing only to finance economically viable
projects in priority sectors such as energy and infrastructure, at levels consistent with maintaining low
external risk and debt sustainability. In order to limit the use of nonconcessional financing, the authorities
also aim to keep the fiscal deficit in FY2013/14 and over the medium-term broadly unchanged at around
5 percent of GDP.
3

In FY2012/13 Japan cancelled arrears on payments due after 2003. Principal and interest arrears on pre-2003
payments due were rescheduled on very concessional terms also before the end of FY2012/13. Before the end of
FY2013/14, Japan is expected to cancel late interest charges on pre-2003 arrears. The implementation of this
agreement was done in the context of the Paris Club framework.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MYANMAR

Box 1. Myanmar: Key Macroeconomic Assumptions Underlying the DSA for the
Baseline Scenario (FY2013/14–33/34)


Real GDP growth is assumed to average about 7 percent over the medium term, driven by commodity
exports and higher investment due to the implementation of Myanmar’s structural reform plans, with the
support of the international community, and suspension of sanctions. Over the long term, real GDP growth
is expected to increase to 7.5 percent in 2033/34, supported by prudent macroeconomic policies and
robust FDI and related investments.



Inflation (as measured by the change in the GDP deflator) is projected on average at 5.6 percent (y/y) in
the medium term and expected to continue trending down and reach around 4 percent in FY2033/34. This
is based on the assumption that deficit monetization will be replaced with bond financing, as well as
having a consistent monetary policy framework in place.



The primary fiscal deficit of the nonfinancial public sector in terms of GDP is expected to widen from
2.1 percent in FY2012/13 to 3.2 percent in the medium term. Revenues are expected to increase
significantly over the medium term, primarily due to a substantial increase in gas export revenues
expected with the completion of Shwe and Zawtika projects as well as planned improvements to tax
administration and efforts to broaden the tax bases. Expenditures are also expected to increase, reflecting
Myanmar’s significant development needs.



Exports as a percentage of GDP are assumed to average 24.7 percent in the medium term, reflecting
mainly new natural gas projects coming on stream. Over the longer term, export growth remains robust,
averaging around 30.7 percent during FY2019/20–FY2033/34, driven by export diversification beyond
commodity exports supported by higher investment, including foreign direct investment.



Imports as a percentage of GDP are assumed to average 27.8 percent in the medium term given the
authorities’ removal of exchange restrictions on current international payments and transfers and the
import content of higher investment including FDI. Over the longer term, imports as a percentage of GDP
are projected to average 35.7 percent during FY2019/20–FY2033/34, reflecting the need to for imported
capital goods to support growth.



The current account (including official grants), which in FY2012/13 registered a deficit of about 4.4 percent,
is expected to remain in deficit in the medium-term. Over the long term, the current account deficit is
expected to stabilize at around 5 percent of GDP.



As of end-FY2012/13, around 35 percent of public domestic debt was in the form of treasury bonds, with
the rest in the form of treasury bills (bearing a nominal interest rate of 4 percent). Treasury bonds are
issued in maturities of two, three, and five years, bearing nominal interest at fixed interest rates of 8.75, 9,
and 9.5 percent, respectively. Average real interest rates on domestic public debt turned positive in
FY2011/12 as inflation subsided but are projected to narrow in FY2013/14, due to rising inflation and fixed
nominal interest rates. Real interest rates are expected to remain positive in the short term, in line with the
government’s plan to further shift toward bond financing of the deficit and moderate inflation, and widen
in the medium term, as the government moves toward a market-based deficit financing.



Financing of the deficit is expected to be met by a combination of domestic public borrowing and foreign
loans, including from bilateral and multilateral creditors. In the short term, deficit financing will rely on
nonconcessional external financing and increasingly on the issuance of treasury bonds. Over the medium
term, the share of external financing is expected to increase, especially from concessional sources.
Nonetheless, treasury bond issuance is expected to continue over the medium term consistent with the
goal to develop a domestic treasury bond market. This will also facilitate the liberalization of interest rates
with the planned move to treasury security auctions.

Under the baseline scenario, all external debt
indicators will be below their indicative thresholds at end-FY2013/14, which assumes the completion of the
second phase of the resolution of Myanmar’s arrears. The impact of the debt rescheduling is evident in the
decline in the debt burden indicators between FY2012/13 and FY2013/14 (Table 1a). For example, the PV of
the debt-to-GDP ratio decreases from about 22 percent in FY2012/13 to 16 percent in FY2013/14.

6.
Standard stress tests indicate that Myanmar’s external debt sustainability is vulnerable to
export shocks and exchange rate depreciation. In particular, the export shock leads to a temporary
breach of the PV of debt-to-exports indicative threshold (Figure 1 and Table 1b).4 5 However, the temporary
breach (which is initially moderate, but quickly declining) reflects the introduction of the shock at the time of
the projected increase in exports due to the completion of the Shwe and Zawtika gas projects (introducing
the shock at any other point in time would eliminate the breach). These two projects are on track to start
exports in FY2013/14. Myanmar’s good track record of implementing natural gas sector projects (e.g. the
Yadana and Yetagun projects are fully operational) and contractual purchasing commitments by project
partners (who have agreed to purchase most of the production from these projects), mitigate some of the
risks of this particular shock, i.e. a significant slowdown in exports compared to the baseline scenario.
Accordingly, Myanmar can be classified at low risk of debt distress.

4

The typical historical scenario is not shown in this analysis. In the case of Myanmar, the historical scenario would
imply an unlikely return to pre-reform policies: low non-interest current account deficits (consistent with binding
international sanctions) and sustained real exchange rate pressures.
5

The PV of debt-to-GDP ratio is temporarily above the threshold due to a combination shock. However, this is only
temporary lasting FY15–17 and it marginally above the threshold.

PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
7.
Public debt burden indicators (including domestic public debt) are expected to improve
initially, reflecting the impact of the planned arrears resolution. The nominal debt stock would
decrease from 48.0 percent in 2012/13 to 41.9 percent in 2013/14, mainly due to the clearance of the
arrears. Thereafter, the public debt burden indicators are expected to remain broadly unchanged despite
robust and sustained economic growth (Figure 2 and Table 1c). This reflects the significant development
needs of Myanmar and the associated overall fiscal deficits assumed in the baseline scenario. It should be
noted that public sector domestic debt is high. However, risks are mitigated as the share of nonconcessional
financing is expected to decline. The authorities aim to use nonconcessional external borrowing only to
finance economically viable projects in priority sectors, which will also be crucial to growth.
8.
Stress tests indicate the presence of vulnerabilities. In particular, public debt sustainability is
vulnerable to lower real GDP growth, and large and persistent primary fiscal deficits (Table 1d). The
stabilization of the debt-to-GDP ratio at a relatively high level under the baseline scenario and the
vulnerabilities indicated by the stress tests highlight the need for a prudent fiscal policy, through
improvements in tax policy and public financial management including strengthening of debt management
functions, and project assessment (i.e. ability to identify projects with good economic returns) and capacity
to obtain more concessional financing.

STAFF ASSESSMENT
9.
Myanmar is assessed to be at low risk of debt distress given its planned resolution of arrears.
This is in line with the previous DSA, which was undertaken in November 2012. Developments since then,
including a successful arrears rescheduling process consistent with assumptions, and continued strong
economic performance with enhanced growth prospects, support that DSA’s analysis. Myanmar is therefore
evaluated to be at low risk of debt distress under the baseline scenario, which assumes a resolution of the
remaining arrears in 2013/14 as agreed with the Paris Club. This resolution of arrears with the Paris Club
creditors will improve all debt burden indicators. However, under the baseline scenario, the indicative
threshold for the PV of debt-to-export ratio is temporarily breached under the export shock. As explained
above, the risks associated with this shock are mitigated by the good track record of Myanmar in terms of
implementation of large natural gas projects as well as contractual purchase commitments of project
partners. However, it also underscores the importance of diversifying Myanmar’s export base. Overall public
debt sustainability is vulnerable to fiscal slippages and low real GDP growth, particularly given the relatively
high domestic debt levels. This highlights the need for prudent fiscal policy, as well as improvements in tax
policy to reduce reliance on nontax revenues from nonrenewable sources and public financial and debt
management.
10.
The authorities broadly agreed with these conclusions and with the thrust of the analysis.
They concurred with staff on the need to be cautious on nonconcessional borrowing. They acknowledged
the importance of the maintaining high exports in light of the temporary breach of the threshold.

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly
assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Exchange Rate Arrangement
The kyat had been pegged to the SDR at K 8.5057 per SDR since May 2, 1977. Myanmar applied
margins of 2 percent in respect of spot exchange transactions. In February 1993, the Central Bank of
Myanmar (CBM) started issuing foreign exchange certificates (FEC) at a rate of 1 FEC=US$1. FECs
were largely used as a proxy for U.S. dollars for limited transactions. In December 1995, the
authorities established FEC exchange centers where the FEC could be traded at K 450 per FEC, but
also allowed the FEC to be traded in parallel markets. The FEC counters were closed in April 2010.
Effective October 1, 2011, the Thein Phyu (TP) market was introduced as a retail foreign exchange
market. There are 17 private banks with money changer licenses to operate in TP counters. On
April 1, 2012, the authorities replaced the official peg to the SDR with a managed float. The Central
Bank of Myanmar (CBM) started daily two-way multiple-price foreign currency auctions with MCM
technical assistance (TA). The auctions provide a mechanism for the market to determine an
exchange rate that the CBM can use to set its new reference rate. However, the CBM reserves the
right to periodically intervene to mitigate undue exchange rate volatility and support the liquidity of
the kyat in the foreign exchange market. The CBM has no predetermined target for the level of the
kyat exchange rate or its trading range, and expects the value to fluctuate with supply and demand
in the market. The de jure exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to a managed float.
Due to the multiple exchange rates and divergence of these rates from the official rate, the de facto
exchange rate regime is classified as other managed arrangement.
Myanmar continues to avail itself of transitional arrangements under Article XIV, although it has
eliminated all Article XIV restrictions. Myanmar has made significant progress towards satisfying
Article VIII obligations. Almost all current account restrictions have been removed through the
implementation of the new Foreign Exchange Management Law. However, Myanmar still maintains
exchange restrictions and a multiple currency practice subject to Fund approval under Article VIII.1
Exchange restrictions subject to Fund jurisdiction arise from (i) requirement of tax certification for
authorizing transfers of net investment income abroad, (ii) limitations on the remittance abroad of
net salaries and (iii) a multiple currency practice arising from the formal FEC rate. The authorities are
committed to removing these in 2013. FECs, which represent a multiple currency practice, are being
phased out and will cease to be legal tender at end-June 2013. The authorities have sought
extension of IMF approval for the multiple currency practice arising from the two-way multi-priced
foreign currency auction.
Article IV Consultation
Myanmar is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation
discussions were conducted on January 10–25, 2012 in Yangon and Nay Pyi Taw. The Executive
Board concluded the 2011 Article IV consultation on March 19, 2012.

Technical Assistance
Previously the Fund’s TA to Myanmar was limited partly due to lack of ownership and poor
implementation of past advice. Starting in FY 2011/12, TA began to intensify and was prioritized to
focus on the authorities’ plans to unify the exchange rate and accept Article VIII Sections 2(a), 3, and
4 obligations.
In FY 2012/13, the Fund further intensified its TA activities with multiple missions from FAD, LEG,
MCM and STA (Table 1). An MCM resident advisor was also placed in the central bank, and a TA
Office for Lao and Myanmar (TAOLAM) was established.
In FY 2013/14, TA is expected to continue to be intensive and will be closely coordinated with
activities of other providers. Key areas of focus will be monetary policy and operations, financial
sector development, economic statistics, tax administration and policy, and public financial
management. There will be two resident advisors in the central bank, one focusing on foreign
exchange market development and the other on bank supervision. In addition, three resident
advisors based in TAOLAM will mainly focus on Myanmar. The Singapore Technical Institute plans
to offer financial programming courses and macroeconomic training program beginning in August
2013 in coordination with the TAOLAM macroeconomic advisor.
Resident Representative
Ms. Yu Ching Wong took up the first Resident Representative post of the country in Yangon,
starting May 2013.
A TA Office
IMF opened TAOLAM in Bangkok in October 2012. The new office, headed by Ms. Susan Creane, will
provide IMF technical assistance and training, in collaboration with the Bank of Thailand and the
Japanese Government.

WORLD BANK-IMF COLLABORATION
(May 2013)
The Fund and the Bank country teams for Myanmar, led by Mr. Davies (IMF) and by Ms. Dixon
(World Bank), maintain excellent working relations and dialogue on macroeconomic and structural
issues.
The level of cooperation and coordination is excellent, and is becoming more regular as both
institutions have been scaling up their engagement in Myanmar. Myanmar was in arrears to the
WB, which previously limited the WB’s level of engagement in the country. Following the clearance
of arrears to IDA in January 2013, the Bank has resumed normal lending relations to Myanmar. There
are currently four IDA lending projects in the pipeline scheduled for delivery within the next
12 months. The WB has also significantly scaled up its analytical and advisory services, and there is
already collaboration with the IMF. For example, in the financial sector, the Bank and Fund teams
have jointly prepared a note on collaborative IMF-WB Financial Sector Technical Assistance Plan for
Myanmar. The note specifies the areas where the two institutions will collaborate and the specific
areas in which each institution will take the lead. In this regard, the Bank’s Financial and Private
Sector Development (FPSD) team has already had joint missions with the IMF’s Monetary and
Capital Markets (MCM) Department team on the development of a financial sector strategy, bank
supervision, the Central Bank Law, and Financial Institutions Law. Similarly, there have been joint
missions in public financial management, including more recently, in delivering a PFM Foundational
Course and conducting a Debt Sustainability Analysis. The teams have also agreed to collaborate in
preparing the macro-fiscal analysis chapter of the Public Expenditure Review (PER) which is currently
underway. The two institutions have further agreed to collaborate in all other mutually relevant
areas. Staffs routinely share country documents prepared by both institutions for their respective
Executive Boards.
Recent key areas of cooperation and coordination include:


Macroeconomic policy advice to the authorities. Representatives from the WB participate in
IMF Article IV and SMP missions to Myanmar. In this context, staffs from both institutions
discuss macroeconomic policies and the main messages to the authorities.



Structural reforms. Fund and WB teams have worked together and have shared views on a
range of other issues, including structural reforms for a better investment climate and private
sector development, and social development. Representatives from the World Bank participate
in IMF Article IV and SMP missions, and provide their comments and inputs on important
structural issues that are incorporated in the IMF staff reports.

Based on the above partnership, the WB and the Fund share a common view about
Myanmar’s macroeconomic and structural reform priorities. Important reform priorities include:

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

MYANMAR



Promoting long-term growth and diversification. Modernizing Myanmar’s economy will
require removing impediments to growth by enhancing the business and investment climate,
encouraging financial sector development, and further liberalizing trade and foreign direct
investment (FDI). The new government’s recent efforts, supported by the IMF SMP, go in the
right direction and would benefit from coordination across government agencies, broader
consultation with stakeholders, and using best international practices distilled from other
countries’ experiences through substantial capacity building efforts.



Foreign exchange policy. The authorities have come a long way in liberalizing the foreign
exchange regime. Finalizing the unification of the exchange rate and removing any remaining
current account restrictions should continue to be given high priority. Important actions include:
developing an interbank foreign exchange market; removing the remaining restrictions arising
from provisions in the foreign investment law and issuing comprehensive regulations for the
foreign exchange management law, which will replace the instructions issued over the last year
by the CBM.



Monetary policy. Strengthening the CBM’s capacity to conduct monetary policy is a critical
prerequisite for macroeconomic management. To this end, the authorities need to give greater
autonomy to the CBM with enactment of the CBM law. Prior to that, continued attention is
required to building tools and capacity for monetary policy. Priorities include regularly
conducting basic open market operations, reforming reserve requirements, and developing a
reserve money forecasting and targeting framework.



Further liberalization of financial intermediation and strengthening regulatory and
supervisory framework. To promote the expansion of financial services, the authorities have
eased capital requirements for opening new bank branches, and abolished the capital-todeposit ratio. Setting definitions of bank capital and nonperforming loans closer to international
standards is critical. To contain risks to financial stability during the financial-sector
modernization process, the authorities need to strengthen the enforcement of connected
lending limits. Improving banks’ risk management is a necessary precursor to liberalization of
lending rates and maturities. In all, changes must be implemented step by step, in line with the
development of needed supervisory capacity. Liberalization of the financial sector should be
complemented with a stronger regulatory and supervisory framework to maintain financial
stability. Developing a plan to reform the state-owned banks is also required.



Fiscal discipline and transparency. Prudent fiscal policy is essential to maintain
macroeconomic stability. Staffs emphasize an urgent need to improve the quality, timeliness,
and transparency of government financial statistics, including those of the state economic
enterprises (SEEs). Strengthening public financial management, including by establishing a
treasury function, and defining institutional arrangements to delineate fiscal responsibilities
under the planned decentralization, are essential to safeguard financial discipline. The
government is commended for its strong commitment to adopting the Extractive Industry
Transparency Initiative (EITI).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MYANMAR



Prioritizing fiscal policies toward social and infrastructure spending. Continued increases in
budgetary allocations towards health and education are welcome, but there is still room for
reallocating further resources to social sectors where spending levels remain relatively low.
Further room remains for reallocating resources from other sectors towards infrastructure which
is currently in a poor state and negatively affecting the business climate.



Avoiding accumulation of a quasi-fiscal deficit in the energy sector. Staff welcomes recent
adjustments of electricity tariffs which will help reduce the quasi-fiscal deficit (QFD) in the power
sector resulting from tariffs below cost recovery. Elimination of QFD, which leads to
decapitalization of the asset base in the power sector, is essential for financial viability and
mobilization of necessary investments to reduce electricity shortages and promote inclusive
development.

The teams are committed to continue their close cooperation going forward. The table below
details the specific activities planned by the two country teams over the period June 2013–May
2014.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP2
(May 2013)
Myanmar became a member of the World Bank in 1952, IFC in 1956, and IDA in 1962. By 1987, the
Bank’s total portfolio amounted to US$804 million equivalent, of which US$752.8 million equivalent
had been disbursed. New lending ceased after 1987 due to a lack of dialogue on policy reform. The
last formal Consultative Group meeting was held in January 1986 in Tokyo, chaired by the Bank.
Since then, occasional contacts between the government and the Bank continued on the sidelines of
the Annual Meetings.
Myanmar went into arrears with the Bank in January 1998 and subsequently into nonaccrual status
in September 1998. All credits that had been approved but which had not fully disbursed were
cancelled and Myanmar was not eligible for new loans. The Bank’s engagement with Myanmar
became limited to monitoring economic and social developments in the country based on available
information and reports, liaising with other international donors and agencies, continued
participation in IMF Article IV missions, and providing support to the work of other donors in
selected areas.
Relations between Myanmar and the Bank have however been recently normalized. As part of its
efforts to restore normal relations with the international community, the Government of Myanmar
cleared the full amount of its arrears to the Bank in January 2013, in the amount of US$420 million
through a bridge loan from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation. The Bank resumed normal
lending to Myanmar, with the first loan being a concessional IDA credit extended to help Myanmar
repay in full the bridge loan contracted to clear the arrears.
The Bank opened its first ever country office in Myanmar on August 1, 2012. Its engagement with
Myanmar is currently being guided by an Interim Strategy Note (ISN) pending the preparation of a
full Country Partnership Strategy. The ISN was discussed by the Bank’s Executive Board of Directors
on November 1, 2012, on which date the Board also approved an US$80 million pre-arrears
clearance grant to fund a Community Driven Development Project. The Bank is currently in the
process of preparing four possible lending projects over the next 12 months in energy,
telecommunications, public finance management, and education.
Apart from lending programs, the Bank has significantly scaled up its analytical and advisory
services, some of which are financed by development partners. For example, it has just completed its
first ever Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability assessment with funding from DFID while a
PER is underway.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK3
(May 2013)
Myanmar joined the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) in 1973 and operations started the same year.
In 2012, as the international community resumed engagement with Myanmar as a result of
significant economic and political reforms, the AsDB developed a road map toward resumption of
normal operations. The activities included initial assessments of the economy and of key sectors,
provision of technical assistance, and development of an interim country partnership strategy for
2012–2014.
AsDB’s interim country partnership strategy for 2012–2014 seeks to support the government in
achieving sustainable and inclusive growth. It focuses on (i) building human resources and capacities
(capacity building in ministries in core areas of AsDB involvement, and education); (ii) promoting an
enabling economic environment (macroeconomic and fiscal management; and trade, investment,
financial sector reform); and (iii) creating access and connectivity (rural livelihoods and infrastructure
development, especially energy and transport). AsDB will mainstream the thematic areas of good
governance, environmental sustainability, private sector development, and regional cooperation and
integration into its operations. AsDB will focus on the crosscutting areas of knowledge and
partnerships.
Myanmar cleared its arrears to AsDB in January 2013. The AsDB has so far provided 33 loans totaling
US$1,107 million for 28 projects and one policy-based operation. Of these, two loans amounting to
US$6.6 million were from the AsDB’s ordinary capital resources (OCR) which have already been prepaid, and 31 loans were from the concessional Asian Development Fund resources. The AsDB has so
far provided technical assistance (TA) totaling US$21.8 million for 54 projects. Of these 54 TA
projects, 16 were approved since AsDB reengaged with Myanmar in 2012.
With resumption of its engagement with the international community, Myanmar is an increasingly
active participant in the Greater Mekong Subregion Economic Cooperation Program and the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). AsDB coordinates closely with the IMF, the World
Bank, the UNDP, and other development partners and is actively engaged in various sector and
thematic working groups that are being formed by the government for aid coordination purposes.
The majority of AsDB assistance has been provided to support public sector management, followed
by development of the agricultural sector. The sector composition of AsDB lending to Myanmar is
shown below:

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General. Data provision continues to have serious shortcomings that hamper effective surveillance.
Data are not provided in a timely manner, while official and independent estimates of key
macroeconomic variables differ widely.
National accounts. National accounts statistics are available only on an annual basis with
considerable delay. Coverage of the private sector is incomplete as a proper business directory for
sampling is not available yet. Resource constraints, primarily at the Planning Department and the
Central Statistical Organization (CSO), limit the conduct of surveys and other data collection. GDP
estimates do not completely account for informal sector activity. Agricultural work-in-progress is not
included; construction is recorded on the basis of construction permits; and taxes and subsidies on
products are excluded. Estimates of goods for processing and many services (including construction,
financial services and insurance), as well as the deflators for financial and insurance services need
improvement. Taxes and subsidies on products are not recorded.
Price statistics. The current CPI weights are based on the 2006 Household Income and Expenditure
Survey (HIES). There are a number of weaknesses in the CPI: weights only represent urban households
even though rural areas were also surveyed; some construction inputs are included; rentals of owneroccupied housing are excluded; missing prices are not imputed; and the classification of items is
outdated. The CSO plans to address these issues when it introduces a new CPI in early 2014 with
weights based on the results of the HIES that was conducted in November 2012. Other improvements
to methods and practices will be introduced at the same time.
Government finance statistics. There is no comprehensive monthly or quarterly compilation of
fiscal data. Monthly cash-based budget execution data are available in local language, but are not
published. Annual comprehensive data are compiled with delays of up to 12 months after the end of
the reference year. In addition, some transactions of state economic enterprises are recorded partly
on an accrual and partly on a cash basis. Fiscal and monetary data are not consistent. Budget
estimates and actual expenditures tend to differ by wide margins. In addition, recording of debt
statistics is not comprehensive.
Monetary and financial statistics. The monetary survey compiled by the CBM covers the central
bank and all commercial banks (public and private). Reporting of monetary data in the Standardized
Report Forms, which accord with the MFSM classification principles, was established in January 2012.
The quality of monetary statistics could be improved by: (i) monitoring the consistency of the
reciprocal/interbank accounts that show positions between the CBM and the commercial banks; and
initiating data review and resolution of large inconsistencies; (ii) using electronic means to capture
and share data to minimize mistakes; (iii) in due course, adopting market or fair value-based
valuation of financial instruments; and (iv) reviewing the accuracy of recording of the IMF Accounts
in the CBM’s balance sheet.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MYANMAR

External sector statistics. The coverage and reliability of the balance of payments could be
improved. Merchandise imports are underestimated as military imports and other official imports,
including imports linked to FDI under joint venture agreements with exemptions from custom duties,
are generally excluded. Trade data are recorded at the time of entries by customs, causing serious
volatility in values and incorrect time records. Many of the recommendations of the STA TA missions
conducted in 1999 and 2000 have not been implemented. Items recorded in the current account,
such as goods, services, and income (both primary and secondary accounts), rely on a mix of
compilation methods with limited coverage. Detailed data on services transactions and financial
flows are generally not available and transactions that are not undertaken through the official
banking system are usually not estimated. A detailed recording of transactions in goods, services,
income, and financial items between residents and nonresidents is necessary. Evaluation of external
debts that are not denominated in U.S. dollars is conducted irregularly. Elaboration of external debt
and arrears is needed. FDI flows are not properly measured. Identification and proper classification
of official reserves and other external assets is necessary. The current compilation of IIP data relies
on the accumulation of BOP flows, which makes position data extremely unreliable. It does not allow
to bridge data to external debt tables. Compilation of IIP data also needs to be revamped.
Myanmar is participating in a three-year program that was designed for the improvement of External
Sector Statistics in the Asia and Pacific Region. In May 2013, the first TA mission took place in which
a work plan phased in two semesters was designed. The first two specific and attainable objectives
agreed with the authorities by November 2013 are: (a) timely quarterly dissemination of BOP data
and; (b) elaboration of external debt tables. In addition, the mission is of the view that the CBM is in
a position to improve, as a priority, data collection and dissemination on direct investment, other
investment, and official reserves during 2013.
Data Standards and Quality
Myanmar does not participate in the IMF’s General Data Dissemination System. No data ROSC is
available.
Reporting to STA (optional)
Myanmar submits data reports to STA with a lag of two to six months. However, balance of
payments statistics have not been reported to STA for publication since 2007. No fiscal data are
reported to STA for publication in the IFS. Annual data on the operations of the consolidated central
government were last reported for 2005 to STA for publication in the Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook, but do not include an economic classification of expenditure.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
August 2, 2013

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Myanmar
On June 28, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Myanmar1.
Recent economic developments have been positive. Growth is estimated to have risen to
6½ percent in fiscal year 2012/13 (April-May), driven by gas production, construction and
services while inflation climbed to 4.7 percent in March 2013. The external current account
deficit is estimated to have widened to around 4½ percent of GDP in 2012/13, but to have been
largely financed by foreign direct investment. The recent depreciation of the kyat is contributing
to aligning the exchange rate with longer-term fundamentals, after some apparent overvaluation
during 2012. The auction-determined reference exchange rate, which is the rate used by the
central bank, and the informal rate have converged. International reserves, some of which are
still held by state banks, have increased to US$4.6 billion at end-March, covering 3¾ months of
prospective imports. Broad money and private sector credit are growing rapidly. The fiscal
deficit in 2012/13 is estimated to have declined to 3¾ percent of GDP, on account of higher tax
revenues.
Over the past year, the government has successfully pursued wide-ranging economic reforms,
including under their Staff-Monitored Program with the IMF, which is on track. It focuses on
maintaining macroeconomic stability throughout the reform process and building the institutions
and tools needed for the medium-term. Central elements of the government’s policy program
have been the adoption of a managed floating exchange regime, and the establishment of a
functioning formal foreign exchange market. The government has also liberalized imports and
removed exchange restrictions, and steps to liberalize bank lending have been taken. In 2012/13,
budget allocations for health and educations have been increased substantially, and efforts to
reform tax policy and strengthen tax administration are underway. Legislation to improve the
business climate and boost investment has also been passed.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director,
as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2

The economic outlook remains favorable. Growth is expected to accelerate slightly in 2013/14,
led by rising gas production and investment, including in the transport and telecommunications
sectors, and a recovery in agriculture. Pressures from wage increases and asset prices are
building, but inflation is expected to remain contained at around 6½ percent (year-on-year)
assisted by global commodity prices which are forecast to decline. International reserves are
projected to continue to rise. Financial intermediation is forecast to increase further, with broad
money and credit to the economy continuing to expand at double-digit rates. Following a midyear supplementary allocation, the budget deficit is projected at around 5 percent of GDP. In the
medium-term, sustained and inclusive growth of around 7 percent is achievable, provided
institutions and policies to manage the economy and supervise the financial system continue to
be built. In addition, policies supportive of private sector investment, as well as public spending
on infrastructure, health, and education are required. Risks to this outlook stem from limited
macroeconomic management capacity, which is being strained by the rapid, broad-based
economic transition and emerging domestic price pressures.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for the impressive progress in liberalizing the
economy, which had facilitated development and poverty reduction. They welcomed in
particular the advancement toward medium-term macroeconomic stability and institutional
development objectives outlined in the government’s economic program. Directors noted,
however, that the challenges ahead are daunting, requiring stronger institutions and prudent
policies to preserve macroeconomic and financial stability during the economic transformation.
Accordingly, they stressed the importance of proceeding with needed reforms in a carefully
sequenced manner and at a pace consistent with administrative capabilities.
Directors considered that fiscal policy appropriately balances macroeconomic stability with
development objectives. They supported plans to reorient expenditures toward health, education,
and infrastructure, taking due regard to implementation and absorptive capacity, as well as the
need to maintain debt sustainability following the recent rescheduling of external arrears.
Directors encouraged the authorities to reduce the monetization of the fiscal deficit further, and
to develop a medium-term fiscal framework aimed at smoothing expenditure and building fiscal
buffers. This would require improved public financial management and a well-administered
broad-based tax system to mobilize non-resource revenues.
Directors welcomed the far-reaching liberalization of the foreign exchange system. They
observed that the adoption of a managed float regime has facilitated the convergence of the
formal and informal exchange rates, and the recent depreciation of the kyat has helped align the
exchange rate with longer-term fundamentals. Directors encouraged a further build-up of the
central bank’s international reserves to more comfortable levels in support of the reform process.
They looked forward to the full liberalization of current account transactions envisaged for this
year.

3

Directors highlighted the urgency of improving monetary policy tools. Key priorities in this area
are the enactment of a new central bank law to establish an autonomous and credible monetary
authority and the development of instruments for effective monetary operations. Directors
welcomed the resumption of regular deposit auctions and looked forward to the removal of
financing constraints on open market operations.
Directors encouraged sustained efforts to develop a modern financial sector to support growth
and the transmission of monetary policy. In this context, they emphasized the need to strengthen
supervision, including of foreign exchange operations and state banks, enhance prudential
regulations and regulatory capacity, and improve licensing procedures for banks. Directors also
urged the authorities to address remaining deficiencies in their regime against money laundering
and the financing of terrorism.
Directors recognized the importance of intensive technical assistance to support Myanmar’s
reform process, and noted that technical assistance should be demand-led and tailored to
Myanmar’s specific needs. The breadth of the reform agenda and the limited implementation
capacity call for prioritization and close coordination with development partners. Directors
stressed that particular priority should be given to improving economic statistics.

Statement by Mr. Abdul Ghaffour and Ms. Cho Cho on Myanmar
Executive Board Meeting
June 28, 2013
1.
On behalf of our Myanmar authorities, we would like to extend our sincere gratitude
and appreciation to Mr. Matt Davies and his team for their excellent and constructive
discussions on macroeconomic and financial sector developments during the recent
Article IV consultation and the first review of the Staff Monitored Program (SMP). We are
encouraged by the positive assessment that the authorities have achieved impressive progress
in its reform agenda which has contributed to macroeconomic stability, strong growth and
high investor interest. These are signs that the appropriate implementation of the reform
agenda to improve the economic and social well-being of our people is bearing fruit. We are
further encouraged by the good SMP progress review with all quantitative targets and
structural benchmarks have been successfully met, some with significant margins.
Nonetheless, our authorities remain mindful of the challenges in institutional and capacity
constraints and that embarking on such extensive reform requires careful deliberation and
attention to unintended consequences. Our authorities concurred with the broad appraisal in
the staff report and would thoughtfully consider the recommendations therein.
2.
As staff report accurately articulates, our authorities are pursuing comprehensive
economic and structural reforms. In line with the recommendations made during the last
Article IV consultation and SMP discussion, our authorities continue to prioritize
implementation of macroeconomic and structural reform, as outlined in the Framework for
Economic and Social Reform, a medium term growth strategy that is focused on reducing
poverty and diversifying sources of economic growth. This will contribute towards achieving
a sustainable and equitable growth with poverty reduction.
Recent Economic Development
3.
Myanmar has maintained its growth momentum over the past years. Growth is
estimated to rise to 6.7% in 2012/13, compared with the average growth rate of 5% in the
previous five years. The authorities expect growth to accelerate more than 8% in 2013/14,
mainly led by rising gas production and investment, services, construction and also recovery
in agriculture sector which was affected by flood in mid-2012. This is in line with the staff’s
estimation of the potential higher growth prospects for 2013/2014. While inflation has
increased to 4.7% in 2012/13, it remains moderate. Key drivers have been increases in prices
for fuel and rent, and food. While pressures from wage increases and asset prices are
building, the authorities expect inflation to remain contained at around 5.3% in 2013/14, with
global commodity prices forecasted to decline. The current account deficit is projected to
widen to 4.4% in 2012/13 due to the increase in import of capital goods. International
reserves have risen to US$ 4.6 billion at the end of March, 2013 which covers 3.75 months of

2
imports. Our authorities broadly concurred with staff’s assessment on economic outlook and
our authorities believe that the implementation of measures over the past years to improve
agricultural productivity, supporting industrialization and fostering the growth of SME would
further strengthen growth outlook.
4.
The agriculture sector remains a major contributor to the GDP. The reform measures
undertaken in the sector, such as land reform, exemption of taxes on some export items and
intensifying trade promotion especially with neighboring countries, the agriculture sector,
including livestock and fishery is expected to contribute towards a higher growth rate.
Industrial sector including manufacturing, power, energy, construction and mining and
services sector is also expected to contribute towards a higher growth rate. These
achievements are largely attributable to on-going implementation of reform process such as
diversification of economic structure, simplifying business registration, measures to facilitate
corporatization and privatization, as well as opening up the private sector investment
opportunities. Similarly, the services and trade sectors is also expected to contribute to a
higher growth rate attributable to rising exports with greater access to international markets,
liberalization on export and foreign investment in the transportation and telecommunication
sectors.
5.
Concerted efforts are also being made to push ahead with industrial development
reform and giving more financial autonomy and accountability to State Economic Enterprises
(SEEs) to facilitate economic transformation and development. Along with the other
developments, expansion of electric power generation to address the electricity shortage;
discovering new oil and gas fields for domestic consumption; and investments in
infrastructure will also contribute to a higher economic growth.
Fiscal Policy
6.
In order to achieve the goal of inclusive, sustainable and equitable development and
poverty reduction and upgrading standard of living of our people, our authorities are
committed to a broad-based fiscal reform and have developed a fiscal reform strategy
consistent with staff advice. This includes broadening the tax base, strengthening the tax
administration, improving accountability and simplifying tax rate structure. Large Taxpayer
Office is expected to be established in the very near future to further strengthen the tax
administration and increase tax revenue. Establishment of a working group and a treasury
department in the Ministry of Finance and Revenue are also on track.
7.
To pave the way to strengthen public financial management (PFM) and to improve
public service delivery and accountability, comprehensive fiscal reform process including
developing PFM strategy is also under process with the Fund’s technical assistance.

3
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
8.
We are encouraged to note the assessment that Myanmar has made great strides in the
liberalization of its foreign exchange regime and broadly agree with staff’s recommendation
in the staff report. The authorities are committed towards maintaining a flexible exchange
rate policy that does not target a specific level, while smoothing fluctuations and maintain
adequate international reserves. Our authorities continue to carry out reforms measures in
line with the previous staff advice on monetary and exchange rate policies.
9.
In accordance with our authorities' plan to reform the complex exchange rate system,
pegged official exchange rate had been replaced by a managed float system since April 1,
2012 with technical support from the Fund. Foreign exchange auction is now being operated
and Foreign Exchange Certificate is now being phased out gradually to maintain exchange
rate stability and achieve the goal of exchange rate unification.
10.
The authorities concur with the staff recommendation that increased access to
financial services is important to facilitate economic growth. In this regards, reform measures
such as liberalizing the interest rate on deposits, easing restrictions on eligible collateral,
lifting deposit-to-capital ratio and capital requirement for branch expansion, and granting
foreign exchange operations to private banks, have been taken to enhance effective
intermediation of funds in supporting a sustainable economic growth.
11.
The authorities recognize the importance of operational autonomy to the Central
Bank of Myanmar and it is expected that the new CBM Law, once enacted, will provide
greater operational autonomy to the CBM in carrying out its core central bank functions. The
CBM plans to review the existing Financial Institutions of Myanmar Law, 1990 to establish a
comprehensive legal framework for the orderly development of the Myanmar financial
sector. The authorities are committed in developing monetary policy tools that is critical for
achieving program goals and intends to accelerate progress in this area in advance of the
law’s enactment. In particular, the authorities have begun holding bi-weekly deposit auctions
and will include this as a new structural benchmark.
12.
Our authorities reaffirmed their commitment to fully liberalize the current account
transactions and fully accepting the obligations of Article VIII during the year. So as to fulfill
their commitments, the Foreign Exchange Management Law, was enacted in August, 2012,
with the aim of improving foreign exchange management and removing restrictions on
current payments and transfers abroad. Rules relating to the said law are now in drafting
stage.

4
Financial sector
13.
The Myanmar’s financial sector is growing and undergoing rapid modernization. The
authorities concur that the presence of a modern, well-regulated and supervised financial
sector is critical to finance investment, reduce monetization and enhance the effectiveness of
CBM’s monetary policy transmission. A number of key measures have been implemented to
enhance the role of the financial sector in supporting economic reform. Eligible collateral has
been expanded to include key agricultural export goods and this will further enhance access
to credit. Deposit rates have also been liberalized within a fixed corridor and the authorities
have abolished the capital-to-deposit requirement, and eased capital requirements for the
opening of new branches. Credit cards and ATMs have been introduced, and a payment
union for interbank settlements has been established.
14.
To further liberalise the financial sector, in accordance with the commitments under
the ASEAN Economic Community blueprint, the CBM will allow foreign bank entry to
participate in the banking sector in the form of Joint-Venture in the near future. Nonetheless,
the authorities emphasized that it is paramount to safeguard financial stability and the need to
provide sufficient room for domestic banks to develop capacity to be able to compete
effectively with the new foreign entrants. In this regard, the CBM is currently in the process
of finalizing the policy for admitting foreign banks.
15.
Overall, the financial position of the banking sector remain sound with high level of
capitalisation, adequate liquidity buffers, improved performance in profit earnings and
manageable NPL level. Nevertheless, with the current rapid expansion and modernization of
the banking sector, the CBM is mindful of the importance of strengthening the supervisory
and regulatory framework and enhancing capacity building. In this regards, the authorities
look forward to the continued support in the form of technical assistance, in the several areas
identified in the staff report.
16.
The draft Counter Terrorism Law has been finalized and is in the process of being
submitted to the Parliament. The new Control of Money Laundering Law is being redrafted
with the assistance of the Fund’s technical assistance to more comprehensively address the
requirements of international standards. Myanmar remained committed to implement a
strong AML/CFT system and to address the remaining deficiencies in its AML/CFT regime.
Statistical Issues
17.
The authorities agree that the improvements in statistics are important for effective
functioning of the Fund’s surveillance and supporting policy formulation. The importance of
improving economic statistics can be recognized by the prominence it has been given by our
authorities in their economic reform strategy. The authorities appreciate the help of the

5
Fund’s TA on compilation of CPI and National Account in the first stage and look forward
for further technical support in this area.
SMP Performance
18.
We are encouraged to note the positive assessment on the SMP. The authorities have
made good progress in meeting all the benchmarks set for the program, including building
the international reserves of CBM and improving the functioning of the foreign exchange
market. Further progress can be expected during the year towards the program objectives and
the authorities are on the right track to meet the quantitative and structural benchmarks for
September 2013.
Conclusion
19.
Although significant progress has been made and growth outlook is favourable, the
authorities are mindful of the challenges ahead especially in the area of institutional and
capacity building. While the authorities remain committed to pursue needed reform, the pace
of changes would have to be commensurate with the implementation capacity of the
authorities and existence of appropriate preconditions and safeguards. Therefore, the need for
appropriate sequencing of measures cannot be underestimated. This will ensure reform
process proceeds smoothly and macroeconomic stability is maintained at all times. Our
authorities would like to express their sincere gratitude to the Fund, the World Bank and the
ADB for their continuous support and invaluable input over the years and policy
recommendations in the various areas and look forward to continued cooperation in the years
to come.
