INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
MALDIVES
Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2010 Consultation with Maldives
Approved by Vivek Arora and James Roaf
January 24, 2011
Summary. Economic activity is recovering on the back of a strong rebound in tourism arrivals.
Tight monetary policy has helped drain excess liquidity, but foreign exchange shortages remain.
The fiscal stance is unsustainable, and a difficult political environment is constraining
advancement of needed reforms. The medium term outlook is marked by uncertainty over the
course of domestic policies. The key policy challenge is to reduce persistent fiscal and external
imbalances through a strong fiscal consolidation and an adjustment of the exchange rate.
Program status: A blend of a Stand-By Arrangement (SDR 49.2 million) and an arrangement
under the Exogenous Shocks Facility (SDR 8.2 million) was approved on December 4, 2009.
The first review was concluded in March 2010. The amounts drawn so far are SDR 8.2 million
(SBA) and SDR 2.05 million (ESF). Significant fiscal slippages, including delays in the
implementation of tax reforms, an earlier-than-envisaged restoration of wages back to their
September 2009 levels (after the October 2009 cuts), and lack of progress on public employment
restructuring, have prevented the completion of the second review. To complete it, staff
proposed adjusting the exchange rate and a revised fiscal adjustment strategy to put debt on a
sustained downward path.
Previous Article IV Consultation: The Executive Board discussion of the 2009 Article IV
Consultation is summarized in the Public Information Notice No. 09/142 at www.imf.org.
Mission: A staff team consisting of R. Cubero (head), I. Masha, C. Park (all APD), K.
Kashiwase (FAD), and R. Basu (SPR) visited Malé during October 25–November 8, 2010.
K. Mathai, Resident Representative in Colombo, participated in the initial and concluding
segments of the mission. The staff met with the President, the Minister of Finance and Treasury,
the Governor of the Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA), other senior officials, members of
the Parliament’s Public Finance Committee, commercial banks, donors, and private sector
representatives.
Exchange rate system: Maldives has a conventional fixed peg against the U.S. dollar. Maldives
continues to avail itself of the transitional arrangements of Article XIV, and has not yet accepted
the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. It maintains exchange restrictions and a
multiple currency practice subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3 of
the Fund’s Articles of Agreement, arising from the MMA’s policy of rationing its supply of
foreign exchange to commercial banks, and the more than 2 percent exchange rate spread
between the official rate and the rate at the parallel market.
Data provision is adequate for effective surveillance and program monitoring, but some
weaknesses remain.
Outreach: The mission met with Parliament, gave a presentation open to the public and the
media, issued a press statement and held a press conference, with wide local media coverage.

BACKGROUND

1.
To address severe fiscal and external imbalances, in 2009 the Government of
Maldives put together a comprehensive adjustment program, supported by the Fund.
The effects of an unsustainable increase in public spending after the 2004 tsunami were
exacerbated by the global crisis, which led in 2009 to sharp declines in tourism and related
investment, other capital inflows, and exports. These developments pushed the economy into
recession and resulted in falling reserves, dollar shortages, and a massive fiscal deficit, a
large share of which was monetized. A Fund-supported plan, approved in December 2009,
centered on a strong fiscal adjustment to put public finances back on a sustainable mediumterm path, complemented by monetary tightening and measures to strengthen the banking
sector.
2.
Despite some decisive initial actions, significant fiscal slippages have undermined
the restoration of sustainability. The authorities took significant initial adjustment
measures in the second half of 2009, including cuts in central government nominal wages; an
increase in electricity tariffs; the replacement of universal electricity subsidies with a targeted
scheme; the cessation of deficit monetization; and an active monetary policy tightening.
However, slippages have occurred, such as delays in the implementation of key tax reforms,
an earlier-than-envisaged restoration of wages, and lack of progress on public employment
restructuring. International reserves remain on a downward trend, and dollar shortages
persist.
3.
The political environment remains challenging. Deep political polarization is
constraining advancement of the economic reform agenda at all levels. Relations between the
executive and the opposition-dominated parliament have become increasingly strained. After
a period of political tension in mid-2010, an uneasy calm now prevails. However, the outlook
for political relations is still uncertain. With local, island-level elections scheduled for
February 2011, passage of essential reforms may be further delayed.
4.
The key policy challenge is to reduce persistent imbalances to prevent a currency
or fiscal crisis, achieve macroeconomic sustainability, and stimulate growth. This
requires the implementation of outstanding fiscal adjustment measures under the program,
additional fiscal consolidation measures, and adjustment of the exchange rate coupled with
wage restraint. Structural reforms are also needed to increase the economy’s resilience,
especially in public financial management and the financial sector.
II.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

5.
After contracting by 2¼ percent in 2009, the economy rebounded strongly in
2010, driven by tourism (Figure 1). Like other tourism-dependent economies, Maldives
was severely hit by the slump in tourist arrivals that accompanied the global crisis (Box 1).
As the global economy recovers, tourism has again picked up. While spending per tourist per
day is reported to have fallen, a sharp recovery in tourist arrivals and bednights—up

4
20 percent and 18½ percent on a year-on-year
(y/y) basis, respectively, as of November
2010—has fueled a strong recovery in
economic activity. Real GDP growth is now
projected at 4¾ percent in 2010. Fishing,
however, continues its secular decline, due
largely to exogenous factors. Inflation remains
driven by international commodity as well as
local fish prices, increasing since mid-2009 on
a y/y basis, and is projected at an average of
5 percent in 2010.

6.
Monetary tightening has helped stabilize the economy (Figure 2). Active open
market operations and the cessation of deficit monetization have effectively reduced excess
liquidity. Reserve money fell continuously through September, and remained well below
program targets. However, a large increase in foreign currency deposits in the commercial
banking system since end-October (mainly associated with parent funding for the newly
privatized Male international airport) and a corresponding increase in foreign currency bank
deposits at the MMA, led to a sharp increase in reserve money (defined to include bank
foreign currency deposits at the MMA), although in y/y terms it still fell by 1½ percent as of
end-December. Private sector credit has stalled, but bank investments in T-bills have pushed
up overall credit. This has also propelled domestic currency deposits, despite a sharp fall in
currency in circulation. Thus, broad money is expected to increase by 16¾ percent in 2010.
7.
External imbalances remain (Figure 1). The economic recovery and higher
commodity prices have pushed up imports, offsetting the tourism rebound. The current
account deficit is expected to have increased to about 32¼ percent of GDP in 2010, sustained
by slightly higher foreign capital inflows. The MMA continues to ration the supply of foreign
exchange to banks, while fully meeting the demand from the central government and some
SOEs. Abstracting from occasional foreign financing injections, international reserves
continue to decline: usable reserves fell from $150 million in April to $87 million by endOctober, but were boosted in November by the airport privatization proceeds ($74 million).
On current policies, the underlying downward trend is expected to remain. The parallel
market premium has increased to around 10 percent, partly due to seasonal factors, although
there are also reports of dollar hoarding. The real effective exchange rate (REER) has
continued to move with the U.S. dollar, and has appreciated since mid-2008 (Box 2).

Fiscal outturns in 2010 have been mixed (Figure 3). Despite significant delays in
the implementation of fiscal adjustment measures (paragraph 14), preliminary revenue and
expenditure data point to some under-execution of the budget and a 2010 fiscal deficit close
to the program target of 17¾ percent of GDP. However, financing data, which are a more
reliable predictor of actual fiscal outcomes, indicate a deficit of around 20¼ percent of GDP.
Debt has been revised down relative to initial projections, on account of larger-than-expected
privatization inflows (estimated at about $97 million in 2010) and better information on the
fraction of state-owned enterprise (SOE) debt that is government guaranteed.

The banking system as a whole remains sound, but vulnerabilities remain
(Figure 2). On an aggregate level, banks are well capitalized and rufiyaa liquidity is high.
However, asset quality has continued to decline due to banks’ exposure to large tourismrelated borrowers affected by the global crisis. This has led to a sharp drop in profitability.
Banks have also become heavily exposed to the sovereign, with gross claims on the

8
government representing 18 percent of assets and 28 percent of loans.1 A key systemic
vulnerability is the still fragile financial position of the state-owned Bank of Maldives
(BML), the country’s largest bank. BML has very large non-performing loans and also
continues to face dollar liquidity stresses.
III.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS

A. Growth, Competitiveness, and Medium-term Outlook
10.
Long-run economic growth will need to be underpinned by macroeconomic
stability and structural reforms to enhance competitiveness. The current fiscal and
external imbalances undermine growth through several channels, including negative
confidence effects and crowding out of private investment. Tourism will remain the engine of
growth in the years to come. Maldives has done well to increase bed capacity and diversify
markets. Indeed, fast-increasing tourist inflows from Asia helped reduce the impact of the
recent crisis (Box 1). To continue to make progress up the development ladder, Maldives will
need to diversify into other industries, including services such as outsourcing. The key to
diversification will be an improvement in competitiveness, which requires enhancing the
coverage and quality of education and infrastructure, and reforms to improve the ease of
doing business (Box 2).
11.
On current policies, the real exchange rate is significantly overvalued, according
to a CGER-type analysis. Significant fiscal consolidation, possibly accompanied by a
nominal devaluation, will be needed to bring the real effective exchange rate in line with a
sustainable path (Box 2). Such policies, along with structural reforms, would also boost
competitiveness and growth.
12.
The medium-term economic outlook is beset by uncertainty over the course of
domestic policies. A gradual growth recovery is expected over the medium term, with rates
around 4½ percent. Tourism and re-exports of jet fuel are likely to grow in line with the
external environment, while the fisheries sector is expected to continue to perform poorly due
to exogenous factors affecting the fish population. On current policies, the current account
deficit would remain high, potentially leading to reserve depletion and an external financing
gap (Table 5). Global risks to the outlook are broadly balanced, but domestic risks are tilted
to the downside. In particular, slow fiscal consolidation, persistent external imbalances and
dollar shortages, and political tensions could hamper fiscal, financial and external
sustainability, and have a negative impact on tourist arrivals and external financing flows.

1

Exposure to the sovereign is, however, excluded from regulatory single borrower limits.

9
13.
Authorities’ views and GDP rebasing. The authorities agreed with the staff’s
assessment of the outlook and the exchange rate. They noted that a rebasing of national
accounts is currently being undertaken and is expected to lead to a significant upward
revision of historical GDP. The revised data are expected to be published in January 2011.
Staff considers that, while a large increase in GDP would affect the relative magnitude of
external and fiscal imbalances, it would not alter the direction of the needed policy changes
discussed below.
B. Fiscal Policy
14.
Several policy developments undermine fiscal adjustment relative to program
objectives. The tourism goods and services tax (T-GST) was passed in August 2010, albeit at
a rate of 3½ percent instead of 4 percent as the authorities had initially intended, and a
parallel bill provided for the elimination of the $8 bed tax by end-2013 (with no offsetting
increase in the T-GST rate). The business profit tax (BPT) was passed in December 2010 and
will enter into effect from July 2011, eighteen months later than planned. The
implementation of the general goods and services tax (G-GST) will take longer than expected
due to administrative capacity constraints. On the expenditure side, there have been no net
fiscal savings from public employment restructuring, wages will be restored to their
September 2009 levels from January 2011 (one year earlier than programmed), and the new
Decentralization and Disability Bills will lead to considerable spending increases. In 2011
and 2012, the deficit is expected to be offset by temporary payments for resort lease
extensions under recent reforms to the Tourism Act. The loss of these payments from 2013
and the elimination of the $8 bed tax would generate a sharp increase in the deficit from 2014.

The 2011 budget, approved by the Majlis at end-December 2010, entails a
loosening of fiscal policy. First, it provides for a 21 percent increase in government spending

sales. Once these adjustments are
made, the deficit goes up to 21¼ percent of GDP, a 3½ percent of GDP expansion compared
with 2010.2
16.
On current policies, the fiscal position is unsustainable. The staff’s baseline
scenario is built on the policy slippages discussed in paragraph 14, on the adjusted 2011
budget information, and on the assumption that the G-GST comes into effect in January 2013.
On this basis, staff projects the fiscal deficit at 19 percent of GDP in 2012. The expiration of
lease extension payments from 2013 and the elimination of the $8 bed tax would make the
fiscal deficit balloon from 2014, with debt reaching 135 percent of GDP in 2015 and over
300 percent by 2030. The risk of debt distress has therefore increased from moderate to high
(see the accompanying DSA).
17.
The magnitude and term-structure of public debt, combined with the large fiscal
deficit and recent legislative reforms, pose significant financing risks. With the
outstanding stock of T-bills at over Rf 4 bn (21 percent of GDP) by end-2010, most of which
is in maturities of three months or under, the government’s gross financing needs in 2011 are
estimated at 45½ percent of GDP (Table 6). The roll-over risk is therefore large. Moreover,
recently passed amendments to the Public Finance Act, currently challenged by the
government in court, would require legislative consent for external borrowing and the lease
or sale of state assets. These could limit financing options for the government and jeopardize
its privatization plans, which in 2011 include US$154 million (9½ percent of GDP) from
land sales and the divestment of the telecoms company.
18.
Strong additional measures are therefore needed to rein in the fiscal deficit. The
program’s original fiscal targets, based among others on the authorities’ ambitious plans for
2

In addition, the budget’s GDP projection for 2011 (Rf 21.3 bn) is slightly higher than the staff’s current
estimate (Rf 20.7 bn), on account of a higher implicit GDP deflator.

11
public employment restructuring and wage reductions, have now become unattainable. The
revised fiscal adjustment strategy will involve different measures and targets. Staff
recommended, as a minimum, the following measures:
On the expenditure side:


A realistic and well-planned program for redundancies across central government
employment to fully offset the fiscal effects of the Decentralization Bill (estimated at
over 1,000 jobs with average salaries much higher than those of civil servants) and
achieve a significant net reduction in central government employment of around
2,000 jobs (about 5 percent) by end-2011 and a further 2,000 by end-2012. This
strategy should be accompanied by an attractive but affordable redundancy package
(the baseline assumes six months of salary, compared with a legally-mandated three
months), and involve a reduction in the number and remuneration of political
appointees to 2008 levels.



A strong focus on preserving welfare expenditure on the poor, by improving the
targeting of subsidies and transfers. The revision of electricity subsidies in 2009 was a
welcome step, and further efforts are needed to replace those subsidies with targeted
transfers.



Focusing on high-priority capital expenditure projects already in the pipeline. This
would entail cutting 2011 capital expenditures by 2½ percent of GDP (relative to the
budget) to 10 percent of GDP, and maintaining them at that share of GDP in 2012–13.
In addition, the growth in operating expenditures in 2011 over 2010 should be kept in
line with CPI inflation, implying savings of 1¼ percent of GDP in 2011 relative to the
budget.

On the revenue side, the authorities need to continue preparing the ground for the
implementation of the T-GST, the BPT, and the entry into effect of the G-GST at a rate of
6 percent in January 2013, all of which are reflected in the baseline scenario. Additional
revenue measures will be required, however, and should ideally be submitted to the Majlis as
a package. Staff recommended that these include:


Introduction of excises on alcohol, tobacco, jet fuel, gasoline, and vehicles, to come
into effect in July 2011.



Passage of a provision in the T-GST Act so that its rate goes up to 6 percent when the
bed tax is eliminated at end-2013.

about current levels through 2015 and fall very slowly thereafter, leaving it vulnerable to
even small shocks (including the risk of a court-mandated restoration of wages from January
2010, at a cost of 3 percent of GDP); international reserve coverage would decline below
adequate levels; and the current account deficit would remain elevated. To regain
sustainability, the proposed fiscal measures need to be coupled with a significant exchange
rate adjustment (paragraph 22).

Fiscal consolidation will need to be supported by stronger public financial
management. Continued policy slippages, including the introduction of spending initiatives
without proper costing, and the lack of timely monitoring and reporting of fiscal data
undermine fiscal adjustment efforts (Box 3). The mission recommended: expediting
completion of the PEFA assessment recommendations, including on budget execution and
expenditure control and managing fiscal risks; migrating foreign-financed expenditure data to
the public accounts system; improving budget preparation and planning (including costbenefit analyses for domestically-financed capital expenditures); moving to medium-term
budgeting; and adopting a fiscal responsibility framework, in line with the recommendations
of recent FAD TA. In addition, staff recommended generating monthly fiscal outturn reports
and creating a policy unit at the Ministry of Finance and Treasury charged with monitoring
fiscal developments and analyzing the impact of alternative fiscal policies.

13
20.
Given the fractious political environment, broad political support may be
required for a successful and sustainable fiscal adjustment. The mission reiterated its
recommendation that the government explain to the public the need for fiscal adjustment and
seek an agreement with key stakeholders on a fiscal adjustment package.
21.
Authorities’ views. The authorities concurred with staff’s assessment of the fiscal
situation, but advocated a smoother medium-term adjustment. They indicated that the 2011
budget would provide for a fiscal deficit of no less than 15 percent of GDP, which would
entail a moderate fiscal tightening while accommodating capital spending priorities. They
also noted that the timing and magnitude of structural fiscal reforms would be affected by
political realities, including the local government elections in February 2011 and the
government’s lack of an outright parliamentary majority. The authorities are confident that
the financing needed to accommodate a slow fiscal adjustment will be forthcoming from
domestic and external sources, particularly bilateral creditors, as well as privatization. They
agreed on the need to seek broad political support for fiscal adjustment.
C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
22.
To fully restore fiscal and external sustainability, the fiscal adjustment measures
proposed above would need to be complemented by a significant exchange rate
adjustment. The real exchange rate is significantly overvalued, even under the staff’s
illustrative fiscal adjustment scenario (Box 2). Staff and the authorities agreed that, in the
absence of strong and swift fiscal consolidation, the current exchange rate is unsustainable
and an adjustment is needed. Despite the limited scope for import substitution in Maldives, a
discrete devaluation or a depreciation under a float would help reduce external imbalances (if
accompanied by monetary and wage restraint) through strong negative income effects, given
the high pass through of exchange rate changes to domestic prices (Appendix 1). In addition,
a devaluation would yield considerable fiscal gains provided that nominal public wages are
frozen (Appendix 2).
23.
Staff discussed the advantages and disadvantages of a step devaluation and a
managed float:


The fixed peg regime has provided a strong nominal anchor. A step devaluation
allows for greater control over the short-run path of the exchange rate and preserves
the nominal anchor. On the other hand, if deemed insufficient or unsustainable, it
could lead to a speculative run on the currency and possibly on bank deposits. To
reduce this risk, the devaluation would have to be large (of the order of 20–30 percent). And, to remain sustainable, it would need to be supported by credible fiscal
consolidation measures.



A float would eliminate the need to use reserves to defend the peg. However, given
the shallowness of domestic markets and the country’s vulnerability to shocks,

14
volatility is likely to be very high. In this regard, a managed float, with interventions
aimed at stemming volatility, would seem better than a pure float. At the same time, a
float—managed or otherwise—could lead to significant overshooting and the loss of
a nominal anchor, would pose a challenge for the conduct of monetary policy, and
would reduce but not eliminate the risk of a speculative run.
24.
Authorities’ views. The authorities concurred with the staff assessment. They will
review existing foreign exchange regulations and, if the decision is made to transition to a
different regime, seek Fund technical assistance on the needed steps and the implications for
the conduct of monetary operations.
25.
The authorities and staff agreed that the MMA should continue to tighten its
monetary policy stance. In the face of rapid public sector credit growth, the MMA needs to
rein in the corresponding expansion in broad money through continued monetary tightening
so as to reduce pressures on the currency, regardless of the choice of exchange rate regime.
Continued liquidity tightening would complement a devaluation, and help check any impact
on inflation expectations.
D. Financial Sector
26.
The MMA should continue to push ahead with the enforcement of its prudential
regulations. It has reached agreement with banks that regulations on single borrower limits,
asset classification and provisioning, and foreign currency exposure limits be complied with
by end-2011. All other prudential regulations are already fully complied with. Staff also
recommended that the MMA adopt regular stress testing on banks’ ability to withstand
shocks (interest rate, exchange rate, NPLs), and prepare an overall crisis preparedness and
management strategy. Banks are long in dollars; therefore, a devaluation would directly
benefit them, and any negative impact on the quality of dollar loans to non-dollar earners is
likely to be small.3 Staff proposed a list of vulnerability indicators that should be closely
monitored.
27.
The authorities should press ahead with the restructuring of BML. BML should
be first recapitalized and subject to a diagnostic evaluation by an independent audit firm, and
its management should be strengthened.
28.
There has been progress on structural financial sector reforms. The recent
enactment of the Banking Act is a welcome step. It needs to be followed by prompt passage
of the amendments to the MMA Act, currently in the Majlis. The MMA has continued to
implement the safeguards assessment recommendations: an international external auditor
firm was appointed, the audited statements have been published, and significant steps have

15
been taken to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards, while the appointment of an
internal auditor has been delayed by the lack of suitable applicants.
29.
The Fund is currently assessing Maldives’ compliance with the anti-money
laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) framework. An onsite
mission in October 2010 found a number of significant shortcomings, notably in preventive
measures for financial institutions and AML/CFT supervision. The mission’s draft
assessment report will be discussed during the July 2011 plenary meeting of the Asia/Pacific
Group on Money Laundering.
E. Program Issues
30.
Program performance (Figure 4). All the performance criteria for March and June
2010 were met, as were the indicative targets (IT) for September 2010. The December 2010
IT for reserve money was breached, due to the rapid increase in foreign currency bank
reserves at the MMA, and preliminary information suggests that the fiscal deficit financing
IT was breached by a very large margin.
31.
Completion of second review under the program. Staff reiterated that agreement
on a strong adjustment strategy, along the lines described above, and with significant and
credible prior actions, is needed for the completion of the review. The strategy would likely
entail looser short run numerical fiscal targets than the original program, while converging to
program targets in the medium term. The authorities were receptive to staff’s
recommendations. While they are open to moving ahead on the exchange rate front as soon
as possible, they indicated that other measures may have to wait until after local government
elections in February 2011 are over and the initial impact of the T-GST is reviewed.
32.
External financing. The increase in the current account deficit in 2010 relative to the
program projection has been matched by larger external financing to the government, mainly
from the rollover of an Indian loan. For 2011, total external financing requirements are
projected to increase to $933 million. Continued delays in the completion of the Fund
program review could trigger a suspension of financing from the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank as well, leading to a total fall in multilateral financing of $73 million in
2011.

IV.

STAFF APPRAISAL

33.
Overview. Reflecting recovery from adverse external conditions, the economy turned
around in 2010. Inflation has continued to move in line with global price developments and
domestic supply shocks, but a tight monetary policy stance has helped contain pressures.
Over the medium term, real growth is expected to remain at levels around 4½ percent,
consistent with global developments, although domestic political uncertainties could weigh
in on growth.
34.
Fiscal policy. The current stance of fiscal policy is unsustainable, and was worsened
by the 2011 budget. Under the baseline, public debt would rise steadily. The risk of debt
distress has thus increased from moderate to high. Considerable fiscal adjustment will be

17
necessary to maintain debt sustainability. Stronger public financial management will be
critical for a successful fiscal consolidation.
35.
Monetary policy. The stance of monetary policy has been broadly appropriate, and
contributed to safeguarding price stability. The MMA should continue to tighten monetary
policy to stem pressures on, and strengthen confidence in, the currency. Tighter liquidity
would complement a devaluation, and contribute to contain any resulting inflationary impact.
36.
Exchange rate. Given the insufficient fiscal consolidation, the real exchange rate is
significantly overvalued and has become unsustainable, as reflected in steady downward
pressure on reserves and persistent dollar shortages. An exchange rate adjustment should
therefore be part of a comprehensive strategy to restore sustainability. The MMA continues
to ration foreign exchange to commercial banks. However, no new restrictions have been
introduced and the existing restrictions have not been intensified. Similarly, no new multiple
currency practices (MCPs) have been introduced and the existing MCP has not been
modified.
37.
Financial sector. While the banking system as a whole shows reasonable levels of
capitalization, profitability, and liquidity, significant vulnerabilities remain. In particular,
credit quality, while somewhat improved, remains poor, and banks are heavily exposed to the
sovereign. The MMA should continue to enforce its new prudential regulations, particularly
on provisioning, single borrower limits, and foreign currency exposure limits.
38.
Program. Completion of the second review will be contingent on reaching agreement
on a strong fiscal and external adjustment strategy, with credible prior actions. Staff will
remain engaged in policy discussions with the authorities.
39.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation be held in accordance with
Decision No. 14747-(10/96), as amended.

Box 1. Impact of the Global Crisis on Tourism-dependent Economies and Policy Responses:
A Cross-country Perspective
The recent global crisis had a severe impact on tourism inflows and real GDP growth in tourismdependent economies, but more modest effects on inflation, fiscal balances and exchange rates. 1
The 2008–09 global crisis had a severe impact on tourism-dependent economies (TDEs). As a
result of the global recession, tourism receipts fell throughout the world (Figure 1), as did in general
the demand for non-essential goods and services. The impact was much stronger than during the
milder 2001 global slowdown. And while TDEs experienced a less severe decline in tourism receipts
than the median for the rest of the world (RoW), their high exposure to the tourism sector translated
into a larger negative impact on real per capita growth (Figure 2).

Given its much larger tourism dependence (Figure 3), the growth impact on Maldives has been
more severe than in other TDEs, even though tourism receipts fell by less. Real per capita growth
in Maldives declined 3.9 percent in 2009 (compared with a median of 3 percent for TDEs and 0.9 for
RoW). However, the recovery has been faster, aided in part by arrivals from new and fast-growing
markets, particularly China (Table 1).2

For the purposes of this box, TDEs are the 28 countries for which the average of the tourism receipts-to-GDP
ratio over the last 10 years was greater than 10 percent. The RoW category comprises the remaining
136 countries in the 164-country sample.
2

A recent study for the Caribbean suggests that countries with more competitive hotel pricing have fared better
in terms of tourist arrivals (WHD REO, October 2010).

The impact of the crisis on inflation in TDEs
has been moderate (Figure 4), with inflation
generally following international commodity
prices. A notable exception is Seychelles, where a
sharp exchange rate depreciation after 2007 led to
a significant inflation spike.

Policy Responses
The fiscal response of TDEs during the recent
crisis (proxied by the change in the overall fiscal
balance) has been moderate (Figure 5). The
median fiscal deficit of TDEs widened by about
2–3 percentage points of GDP, very similar to the
median for the RoW.

In contrast, the fiscal deficit in Maldives increased by more than 20 percentage points of GDP.
As a result, Maldives’ public debt has built up rapidly and reached a much higher level (on average)
than those of other TDEs and the RoW (Figure 6).

Exchange rate outcomes depended on the policy regime, but TDEs experienced, on average, a
nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) appreciation (Figure 7 and Table 2). Of the 28
economies, 15 have fixed exchange rate regimes, and of these only 1 officially devalued in 2009 (Fiji,
by 20 percent against the U.S. dollar). As a result, these economies experienced a NEER appreciation
on average (Figure 7 and Table 2). In contrast, the 13 TDEs with more flexible exchange rate
arrangements had an average NEER depreciation of 4.3 percent, which helped them cushion the
negative shock.

Box 2. Maldives: Exchange Rate, External Sustainability, and Competitiveness
The Maldivian rufiyaa has appreciated by
5.6 percent in real effective terms since mid-2008,
in the face of relatively high domestic inflation. The
real effective exchange rate (REER) is now roughly in
line with the average of the past ten years (Figure 1).
Unit labor cost data are not available, but would likely
show a larger appreciation, as the rapid increase in
public sector wages is likely to have had an impact on
economy-wide wages.

Maldives has remained competitive relative to
relevant comparators. For the past decade, the path
of the Maldives’ REER has remained below those of
some relevant competitors for high-end tourism,
except Seychelles (Figure 2), and growth in tourism
has been healthy (Table 1). However, the recent
REER appreciation and a difficult business
environment (despite a recent improvement in the
Doing Business ranking) pose challenges going
forward.

CGER-type methodologies suggest that the REER
is inconsistent with medium-term fundamentals
under the baseline scenario. The macroeconomic balance and external sustainability approaches indicate
that the current account path is inconsistent with its medium-term norm under baseline policies. For given
elasticities, this implies that the REER is significantly overvalued (Table 2). The analysis suggests that even
the illustrative fiscal adjustment scenario is insufficient to narrow the underlying imbalances. Stronger
measures, including an exchange rate adjustment, are needed.

Box 3. Maldives: Public Financial Management Reforms
The authorities have taken important steps to implement some of the immediate priorities
identified by the 2009 PEFA assessment to improve public financial management (PFM).
Much of the work toward establishing a Treasury Single Account (TSA) has been done. The
Public Accounting System (PAS) is functioning as a basic payments processing system, and can
generate financial statements. With the basic functionality of the PAS in place, the Financial
Controller’s Office was able to produce annual financial statements for 2009, as scheduled in the
PFM reform action plan, and to submit them, for the first time ever, to the Auditor General.
Yet, more work is necessary to complete the PFM reforms. The authorities need to bring into
the PAS the 30-plus commercial bank accounts that remain outside the TSA, all associated with
project funding from donors. The PAS modules for generating periodic reports on budget
execution need to be completed: the authorities’ goal is to have them fully operational by mid2011. In addition, the World Bank has been assisting the authorities in integrating a payroll
module to the PAS, to allow for timely and accurate monitoring of the wage bill. All of these
additions will enhance cash flow and debt management and improve program budgeting, to which
the authorities made a transition in the 2011 budget.
The establishment of a framework for monitoring and managing fiscal risks is also essential.
This is another high-priority area identified by the PEFA assessment. Key risks include financing
shortfalls, cost overruns in government projects, and uncertain costs of political decisions (e.g., the
Decentralization Act).
To increase accountability, mitigate fiscal risks and underpin fiscal consolidation, Maldives
would benefit from adopting a fiscal responsibility law (FRL). Under a FRL, the administration
would have to lay out its medium-term strategy, including numerical fiscal targets; improve budget
formulation and publish monthly reports on budget execution (including explanations for major
deviations). The FRL should also require the Majlis to assess the cost of new spending initiatives.
A politically-independent entity could be created to assess the fiscal impact of new revenue and
expenditure policies in light of the medium-term budget objectives.
Capacity constraints in the public finance administration must be addressed immediately as
a prerequisite for sustainable PFM reform. High turnover of trained staff has been a critical
problem, leading to inadequate staffing and skills levels.

Appendix 1. Maldives: Estimated Fiscal Impact of a Devaluation
A nominal depreciation could have a large positive direct fiscal impact if accompanied
by public sector wage restraint. A static, partial equilibrium analysis conducted by staff
suggests that, if nominal wages remain constant, a 25 percent nominal depreciation could
improve the fiscal balance by about 3½ percent of GDP relative to the baseline, and the
impact of a larger depreciation would be stronger still (Table 1). The analysis is based on a
classification of the different components of fiscal revenue and expenditure as dollar linked,
inflation linked, or constant (Table 2). It assumes that the pass through of a nominal
exchange rate change to the CPI is 80 percent (based on the analysis in Appendix 2), and that
the pass through to the GDP deflator is somewhat lower on impact (the trade deficit in goods
and services dampens the pass through to the deflator). Since net dollar-denominated
financing (disbursements minus amortizations) for the government is expected to be positive
in 2011, the cash-flow impact of a depreciation would be even larger. And, while the dollardenominated public debt (external debt plus dollar-denominated local debt) would rise on
impact from 48 percent of GDP to 52 percent with a 25 percent depreciation, the
improvement in the net fiscal balance would help reduce debt over the medium term.

1/ Assumes that the nominal exchange rate change takes place on January 1, 2011. The analysis is passive: output
and absorption volumes are assumed to remain constant (elasticity of zero with respect to the exchange rate).
2/ Factors that are neither dollar linked nor inflation linked, so that their nominal value in rufiyaa terms is unaffected.

The effect on the current account and international reserves would be similarly large,
on account of both the fiscal improvement and the impact of the depreciation on import
volumes. Given the high pass through to domestic prices and therefore the limited impact of

34
a depreciation on the REER, its positive impact on the external balance would arise mainly
through negative income effects.
If government wages are allowed to move in line with inflation, the net fiscal impact
from devaluation would become negative. If nominal wages are frozen, a devaluation or
depreciation would make them fall in real terms and relative to GDP. If, however,
government wages were indexed to inflation after the devaluation, the resulting increase in
expenditure would more than offset any revenue gains, leading to an increase in the fiscal
deficit (Table 1). Also, if nominal wages are kept constant for a period but then allowed to
catch up with the inflation during that period, the fiscal impact would be merely temporary.
For permanent fiscal gains to result from a total or partial wage freeze, once the freeze period
is over wage adjustment should be based on subsequent, and not retroactive, inflation.

1/ Business profit tax is a proposed revenue measure, assumed in the baseline to come in effect in 2011.
2/ The dollar-linked component of interest payments is computed based on the share of dollar-denominated debt in total public debt.
3/ Assumes that 80 percent of capital expenditures are dollar linked. The rest is considered as inflation linked.
4/ One simulation assumes a freeze in nominal wages and allowances; the other treats them as inflation linked.

If the effects of devaluation on import demand and real growth are taken into account,
the estimated net fiscal impact would be smaller. The analysis in Table 1 only considers
the direct effects of devaluation on fiscal aggregates. However, devaluation would also affect
fiscal outcomes through other (indirect) channels: import demand and growth.


Price-elasticity of import demand (static) effect. Devaluation reduces import demand
on impact through both substitution and income effects. In Maldives, there is little
scope for import substitution, but the price-income effect on imports is likely to be
very large, as domestic incomes fall in dollar (and real) terms. And, since import
tariff revenue is the largest component of tax revenue, the negative fiscal effect
through this channel is likely to be considerable.

35


Real GDP growth effect. Staff considers that, given Maldives’ high import
dependence, the impact is likely to be mildly contractionary in the short run, but
expansionary in the medium run once the supply effects (mainly from lower real
wages) work their way through the economy. The growth channel would affect fiscal
outcomes through import demand (in this case, a dynamic effect) as well as through
domestic revenue bases (profits tax, profit transfers), but the overall fiscal impact is
likely to be relatively small.

Table 3 below shows a simulation including these additional channels. For given parameters,
the total net fiscal impact is shown to be significantly smaller than when only direct effects
are considered. And, if nominal wages are not frozen, the devaluation could result in large
fiscal losses.

Appendix 2. Maldives: Sensitivity of the CPI to Exchange Rate Changes
The Maldivian economy is very import intensive, making the CPI highly sensitive to
changes in the exchange rate. The 2003 Supply and Use Table (SUT) indicates that out of
85 products, about a third (29) are imports, 19 have import contents exceeding 50 percent,
and only 23 are fully domestic. If the imported content of domestic inputs is considered (2nd
round effects), the number of products for which total imported content is over 50 percent
would be 62. Based on the SUT, staff computed the 1st and 2nd round effects on Maldives’
CPI of a 1 percent change in the exchange rate. The results indicate that the total exchange
rate pass through into the CPI is around 79 percent; that is, a 10 percent increase in the
exchange rate would lead to an increase in consumer prices of 7.9 percent (Table 1).

1/ First round effect is the direct impact of a 1 percent change in the exchange rate on the cost of an item's imported inputs. This analysis is based on the Supply and Use
Table (2003).
2/ Second round effect is the impact of a 1 percent change in the exchange rate change on the price of an item through the change in the imported content cost of domestic
inputs used in the production of that item.
3/ Total impact is the sum of the first and second round effects of a 1 percent change in the exchange rate on the price of the corresponding item, expressed in percent.

The Maldivian pass through coefficient is extremely high compared to other countries.
The analysis above does not consider the possibility of substitution in production and
consumption or the possible response of distribution margins to changes in the exchange rate.
Following the approach in Campa and Goldberg (2006) and using, for comparability, their
calibrated elasticity parameters, staff computed the pass through coefficient allowing for
these effects. The coefficient for Maldives was estimated at 77 percent, which is far higher
than the 26 percent average pass through that Campa and Goldberg computed for their
sample of 21 (mainly OECD) countries (Table 2). This unusually high pass through is
explained by the structural features of the Maldivian economy—in particular, the high import
content in production and consumption, the lack of domestic substitutes, and relatively small
distribution margins.

The dynamics of exchange rate pass through, as derived from a separate VAR
estimation are consistent with results derived in the nonparametric estimation. Pass
through of exchange rate peaks in the third quarter for both the producer price index and the
consumer price index, with stronger initial impact on CPI. The response of the import price,
CPI and PPI to shocks to nominal effective exchange rate were consistent with theoretical
expectations. Variance decomposition results indicate that the output gap and commodity
price shocks are also key factors in explaining variations in PPI and CPI during the period.

Appendix 3. Maldives: Implementation of Past Fund Advice
Advice from the 2009 Article IV Discussions
Implementation
Reduce the central government wage bill through a The Civil Service Commission (CSC) implemented a
combination of salary adjustment and staff
reduction in civil service wages as recommended,
retrenchment.
effective October 1, 2009. However, the government has
decided to restore wages to their September 2009 levels
starting January 2011. There is also a risk that the courts
will order a restoration retroactive to January 2010. Little
or no progress has been made on staff retrenchment.
Reform electricity subsidies to improve targeting. Electricity tariffs were raised, effective November 1,
2009, and tariff adjustments are now made in line with a
cost-based formula linked to fuel prices. The previous
universal subisidy was replaced with a more targeted
mechanisms, but the authirities are working on improving
the targeting.
Implement tax revenue measures.
The tourism goods and services tax (T-GST) was passed
in August 2010 at a rate of 3½ percent, and came into
effect in January 2011. The business profit tax (BPT) was
passed in December 2010 and will enter into effect from
July 2011. The implementation of the general goods and
services tax (G-GST) has been delayed to allow more
time to build capacity, in line with Fund technical
assistance.
Improve public financial management.

Important steps have been taken, such as the
establishment of a treasury single account and the
implementation of the basic functionalities of the public
accounts system. The authorities need to expedite
completion of the PEFA assessment recommendations,
including on budget execution and expenditure control;
migrating foreign-financed expenditure data to the public
accounts system; moving to medium-term budgeting; and
adopting a fiscal responsibility framework.

Pass the Banking Act and reform the MMA Act.

The Banking Act was enacted in November 2010. The
proposed reforms to the MMA Act are currently in the
Majlis.
The MMA has reached agreement with banks on full
compliance by end-2011 with the regulations on single
borrower limits, asset classification and provisioning, and
foreign currency exposure limits. All other prudential
regulations are already fully complied with.

Strengthen the prudential framework.

Exchange Arrangements

From March 1, 1982 to June 30, 1985, the Maldivian rufiyaa was pegged to the U.S. dollar.
Beginning in July 1985, the exchange rate of the rufiyaa was linked to a trade-weighted
basket of currencies, but the exchange rate vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar remained relatively stable
until February 1987. On March 1, 1987, the rufiyaa was devalued by 29 percent vis-à-vis the

3
U.S. dollar. From 1987 to 1994, the exchange rate of the rufiyaa was adjusted periodically.
Since October 1994, the exchange rate of the rufiyaa remained unchanged at Rf 11.77 per
U.S. dollar, until July 25, 2001, when the rufiyaa was devalued to Rf 12.80 per U.S. dollar.
Maldives continues to avail itself of the transitional provisions of Article XIV, and has not
yet accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. It maintains an exchange
restriction subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) of the Fund’s Articles
of Agreement, arising from the MMA’s policy of rationing its supply of foreign exchange to
commercial banks. This rationing by a governmental agency has caused the channeling of
foreign exchange transactions for current international transactions to the parallel market
where transactions take place at an exchange rate that deviates by more than 2 percent from
the official exchange rate. The more than 2 percent exchange rate spread gives rise to a
multiple currency practice subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 3 and also to
an exchange restriction given the additional cost involved for obtaining foreign exchange.
VIII. Last Article IV Consultation
The 2009 Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on December 4,
2009.

Technical Assistance

FAD: In May 2007, a mission conducted a diagnostic review of tax and tariff policy and
administration. In October 2008 and April 2009, a series of PFM missions provided
peripatetic support for the design and implementation of a new government integrated
financial management information system (GIFMIS). A joint mission with the World Bank
visited Male in April-May 2009 to complete a PEFA assessment. A TA mission on tax
Administration and tax policy took place in September 2010. The mission focused on
existing and planned tax administration reforms and the extent of preparedness for new tax
regimes. In October, a Cash Management and Fiscal Reporting TA mission overlapped with
Article IV mission. The mission focused on budgetary management and fiscal accounting
and reporting.
LEG: In October 2003, Mr. Head provided assistance on the revision of the Maldives
Monetary Authority Act (MMA Act). A series of missions (March and September 2005, and
April 2006) were provided to revamp the banking law. In August 2009, a mission provided
assistance on the MMA Act (jointly with MCM). An AML/CFT assessment mission took
place in October, 2010. A follow up mission planned for February 2011 will focus on
Payments Law.
MCM: Two missions visited in 2006 on monetary operations, financial market development,
and banking issues. In 2007, a series of mission were provided on debt management,
monetary policy and financial supervision. In 2008, three missions visited on monetary
operations and liquidity management, monetary policy and financial supervision issues. In
November 2008 and March/May/August 2009 a series of mission were provided on research

4
capacity building, bank supervision, monetary policy and the MMA act. Two missions
visited Male to advise on monetary operations and the development of a Crisis Management
Framework and Liquidity Management. In December 2010, MCM conducted a TA mission
on crisis preparedness and management, bank restructuring, and monetary operations.
STA: In November 2005, TA was given on monetary and banking issues. In April 2006,
STA provided advice on government finance statistics. In January 2007, STA provided
advice on balance of payments statistics. In May 2007, STA conducted a mission on Money
and Banking Statistics.

Safeguards Assessment

A safeguards assessment of MMA was concluded in March 2010. In line with staff
recommendations, the MMA has appointed an external auditor, and strengthened controls
over foreign payments through the automation of the authorization process. The authorities
also indicated that they are planning to appoint an internal auditor shortly. In addition, a new
MMA Act is under development with Fund technical assistance to strengthen the MMA’s
legal framework.

ANNEX II. MALDIVES: JOINT MANAGEMENT ACTION PLAN1
(As of October 2010)
World Bank

International Monetary Fund

The current framework for the Bank’s involvement in Maldives is the Country Assistance
Strategy (2008) and confirmed in the CAS progress report (2010). The strategy is built
around three pillars of economic governance and investment, human development and social
protection, and environmental management. The bank’s lending programs, including from
IDA and IFC, as well as advisory and analytical services, support the overall thrust of the
strategy. The Bank has disbursed the first tranche of a programmatic series of development
policy lending operation.
A blended arrangement of SBA and ESF approved by the Executive Board in December
2009 is the framework for Fund’s engagement with Maldives. Following shocks from the
global crisis, exacerbated by an expansionary fiscal stance, Fund financial assistance enabled
Maldives to finance the shocks, while committing to a fiscal consolidation program over the
medium term. The core of the policy framework is a strong fiscal adjustment to contain
aggregate demand and put public finances back on a sustainable path in the medium-term,
complemented by monetary tightening and measures to strengthen the banking sector. Two
tranches have been disbursed under the arrangement, but the program is on hold, pending
completion of the second review program targets.
The teams have been and will continue to have joint missions and regular briefing meetings
on macroeconomic developments to support the release of subsequent tranches of each
institution's lending operations. Public financial management is a key area of collaboration
for these operations as is utility pricing and social protection, where the Bank is taking the
lead on a Poverty and Social Impact Analysis of the electricity tariff increases required under
the IMF program. This work is also informing the Bank's ongoing work program supporting
the development of a universal cash transfer program in the country.
The teams continue to coordinate their nonprogram work. This year the teams will continue
follow-up activities to the joint PEFA exercise undertaken in 2009. The Bank is taking the
lead in the area of public debt management, while the IMF team will focus on tax issues (e.g.
support for implementation of a Goods and Services Tax). The Fund team will also support
the authorities in the drafting of a Fiscal Responsibility Law. The teams are planning a joint
mission in the second quarter of FY11 to provide technical assistance in the area of debt and
cash management. The Bank will continue to support implementation of a credible mediumterm expenditure framework (MTEF). Part of the Bank's work program in this area will
include providing technical assistance and undertaking analytic work in the area of public
sector reform. The Fund also plans to undertake analytical work on exchange rate and
vulnerability issues. The Appendix details the macro-critical activities that the Bank and
Fund will work on over the coming year.

ANNEX III. MALDIVES: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK1
(As of 31 December 2010)
Asian Development Bank’s Strategy
The Maldives Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2007–2011 was endorsed by the Board of
Directors of the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) in October 2007. The CPS explicitly
recognized that capacity gaps (weak institutions and human resource deficiencies) have
become binding constraints to realizing national goals and objectives and thus need to be
addressed urgently. The CPS therefore defined a sequenced approach to providing AsDB
support to the Maldives. In the first phase of the CPS period, AsDB will concentrate on
providing much-needed capacity-development assistance with the objective of helping the
Government build institutional capacity to efficiently manage public expenditures and
improve the enabling environment for private sector development. AsDB will move to its
second phase assistance to resume investment lending in the identified CPS priority sectors
of Energy, Transport and Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) Development when its
readiness criteria are secured.
For this purpose, capacity building support has been provided to strengthen economic and
financial management, as well as structuring public-private partnerships, including
improving the enabling environment for small and medium-scale private enterprises.
Ongoing technical assistance (TA) loan and TA grant are enhancing the Government's
capacity to accomplish the policy and institutional reforms supported by the Economic
Recovery Program.
Economic Recovery Program Loan
The AsDB Board of Directors approved the Economic Recovery Program (ERP) in
December 2009 to support recovery and sustainable growth of the economy over the medium
term. ERP became effective on 8 June 2010. The ERP will support specific reform
initiatives, including (i) rationalizing, prioritizing, and aligning public spending with
available resources; (ii) broadening the tax base; (iii) reducing economic subsidies; (iv)
supporting privatization of state-owned enterprises (SOEs); (v) strengthening internal audit
functions; and (vi) changing the role of the Government in the economy from a provider of
all services to an enabler of sustainable and equitable growth. The first tranche of $16.6
million was disbursed on 25 June 2010. The second tranche disbursement of approximately
$16.2 million is planned by June 2011, subject to full compliance with the second tranche
release actions as specified in the ERP policy matrix.

Prepared by Asian Development Bank staff.

9
TA loan ($1.5 million) and TA grant ($3.0 million) attached to the ERP are enhancing the
Government's capacity to accomplish the policy and institutional reforms supported by the
Program. It includes (i) strengthening administration of new taxes introduced under the
Program; (ii) developing capacity of the Government for implementing new revenue
measures, debt management, budget formulation, and expenditure rationalization; (iii)
strengthening the Ministry of Finance and Treasury’s internal audit unit; and (iv) providing
support for the apex Project Management Unit and two Thematic Project Management Units,
and (iv) capacity development of the Privatization Committee and Invest Maldives to
expedite ongoing privatization of SOEs.
Loans and Grants
Since 1981, AsDB has provided 20 loan and grant for public sector projects with total
approved amount of $160.8 million.
As of 30 November 2010, seven loans were active with a net loan/grant amount of $78.7
million (Table 1) comprising of two projects in public sector management amounting to
$34.3 million (43.6 percent), one for multisector for $20.0 million (25.4 percent), one for
industry and trade sector for $7.0 million (8.9 percent), one for education sector for $6.0
million (7.6 percent), one for water and other municipal infrastructure and services sector for
$6.0 million (7.6 percent) and one for transport and ICT sector for $5.4 million (6.9 percent).
Contract awards in 2010 totalled $20.7 million as of 30 November 2010, bringing the
cumulative figure to $53.8 million. Of the 2010 contract awards, $16.6 million (79.9 percent)
went for the Economic Recovery Program Loan, followed by $2.1 million (10.1 percent) for
the Private Sector Development Project and by $0.7 million for the Employment Skills
Training Project. Disbursements in 2010 totalled $25.1 million as of 30 November 2010,
bringing cumulative disbursements to $47.0 million. The disbursement ratio was
42.82 percent.
AsDB’s Private Sector Operation has approved cumulatively 2 projects amounting to $16.5
million. The amount includes both direct loans and an equity investment.
Technical Assistance
As of 31 December 2010, AsDB had approved 58 technical assistance (TA) projects for a
total amount of $ 23.12 million of which 17 had been project preparatory and 41 had been
advisory TAs addressing institutional strengthening and capacity development.
In terms of TA amount, assistance is largest for public sector management at 52.5 percent for
22 projects, followed by transport and ICT sector at 13.2 percent for 12 projects, industry and
trade sector at 8.4 percent for 3 projects, education sector at 8.3 percent for 6 projects, energy
sector at 5.9 percent for 6 projects, agriculture and natural resources sector at 4.9 percent for

10
3 projects, finance sector at 4.0 percent for 4 projects, water and other municipal
infrastructure and services sector and multisector at 2.7 percent for 2 projects.
There are 3 TAs in the active portfolio with a total amount of $ 4.05 million (Table 2). Two
of these are advisory technical assistance projects and another one is project preparatory.

ANNEX IV. MALDIVES—STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of January 7, 2011)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
Macroeconomic statistics have improved in recent years, with technical assistance from STA
and the Asian Development Bank (AsDB). Remaining shortcomings affect the balance of
payments, government finance, and national accounts statistics. The main official statistical
publication is the Statistical Yearbook of Maldives, which contains data series up to 2004.
APD receives a monthly electronic statistical report, covering a broad range of economic and
financial statistics. It also receives, albeit with a lag, the Quarterly Economic Bulletin (QEB)
and the Annual Report(AR) of the Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA).
Real sector: National accounts statistics are available only on an annual basis and with a
considerable lag; while GDP estimates are made using both the production and expenditure
approaches, these estimates are inconsistent. Furthermore, the base year for constant price
estimates is 1995, so that recent changes in the structure of the economy are not reflected by
the base period weights. The AsDB is assisting the authorities in setting up a framework for
compiling more comprehensive national accounts. Also, the authorities have been working,
with the assistance of an external consultant, on rebasing the national accounts. The rebased
series are expected to be published in January 2011.
Recently, the CPI has been rebased to June 2004=100, with assistance from the AsDB.
Weights are based on the household income and expenditure survey that was conducted
between September 2002 and June 2003 and adjusted for price changes up to June 2004.
Fiscal sector: General government data are reported for publication in the GFS Yearbook
and the latest published data are for 2009. Monthly data on revenue and expenditure are
available, but the reporting system is new, and its reliability is as yet untested. In particular,
the consistency of these data with below-the-line financing numbers provided by the
monetary authorities is weak. Data on external debt are subject to reconciliation with
creditors. Data on the operations of state enterprises are limited.
Monetary sector: APD receives a weekly electronic report on monetary statistics, covering
the balance sheets of the MMA and the commercial banks. Current summary data are
published in the MMA’s Monthly Statistics publication as well as in its QEB and AR, but
with a significant lag. There are inconsistencies between monetary and fiscal data regarding
the financing of the fiscal deficit due to issues of timing and coverage. An April 2007 STA
monetary and financial statistics mission completed the standardized report forms for the
central bank and other depository corporations, and developed an integrated monetary
database that meets the needs of the MMA, STA, and APD. It became operational in 2010. It

12
is expected that a new call report form to obtain balance-sheet data for other financial
corporations will be introduced with the assistance of a follow-up mission.
External sector: The MMA compiles balance of payments data on an annual basis. There
are problems of coverage and measurement in a range of areas. Travel credits (receipts) are
still estimated on the basis of a small, outdated, survey of resorts/hotels. Coverage of foreign
direct investment firms is limited, leading to underreporting. Estimates of distributed and
reinvested earnings of direct investment enterprises in the tourism sector remain
unsatisfactory, and information on private financial flows is incomplete. Data on the
international investment position are incomplete as private sector data are not available.
Quarterly data on external debt and debt service are available for the government and the
monetary authority, and to some extent for the banking sector and state enterprises at the
time of the annual consultation missions, but no data are reported for the nonfinancial private
sector. A STA technical assistance mission in January 2007 proposed steps to improve data
on direct investment, travel receipts, and a range of other specific items.
Official reserves assets are reported weekly with a (variable) one-week lag. Predetermined
foreign currency outflows (mainly debt service payments) are known and reported to APD at
the time of annual Article IV consultation missions, while other movements of foreign
currency assets are not identified.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Maldives does not participate in the General No data ROSC available.
Data Dissemination System (GDDS).
III. Reporting to STA (Optional)
The authorities report macroeconomic data to the Fund on a regular and generally timely
basis for publication in the IFS, BOPSY, and GFSY.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
MALDIVES
Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis Under the Debt Sustainability
Framework for Low Income Countries 1
Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
the International Development Association
Approved by Vivek Arora and James Roaf (IMF)
and Jeffrey D. Lewis and Ernesto May (IDA)
January 24, 2011
Under the baseline scenario, reflecting current policies, public debt is expected to rise
steadily, reaching a present value of 306 percent of GDP by 2030.2 While privatization
proceeds have provided some temporary financing relief, the debt path is unsustainable. As a
result, Maldives’ risk of public external debt distress has increased from moderate to high
since the 2009 debt sustainability analysis (DSA).3 Key risks are shocks to exports and
additional fiscal policy slippages. The continuing need for financing the large current
account deficit will put further pressure on the total debt burden, including private external
debt. The DSA illustrates that current policies would lead to extremely large domestic and
external financing requirements that cannot realistically be met, and therefore calls for
additional fiscal consolidation measures in the near term.4

1

This DSA was prepared jointly by the staffs of the IMF and the World Bank. The debt data underlying this
exercise were provided by the Maldivian authorities. The fiscal year for Maldives is January–December.
2

The baseline in this DSA depicts the outcome of the current policy stance on debt sustainability, and clearly
illustrates the need for additional fiscal consolidation measures in Maldives. While the standard approach is to
reflect such adjustment in the baseline scenario, the timing, nature and scope of the inevitable additional fiscal
adjustment is difficult to predict at this stage, and it is therefore shown in an illustrative alternative scenario
(which reflects the impact of minimum adjustment policies on the debt trajectory).

Income Countries (IMF Country Report No. 10/28; IDA/SecM2010-0020).

Maldives is classified a “medium performer” in terms of policies and institutions by the World Bank’s
Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), averaging 3.45 over 2007–2009. The relevant indicative
thresholds for medium performers are: 40 percent for the present value (PV) of the debt-to-GDP ratio,
150 percent for the PV of the debt-to-exports ratio, 250 percent for the PV of the debt-to-revenue ratio,
20 percent for the debt service-to-exports ratio, and 30 percent for the debt service-to-revenue ratio. These
thresholds are applicable to public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external debt only (not to total PPG debt).

2
I. RECENT DEBT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Total public debt has increased rapidly since the 2004 tsunami, from 55 percent
of GDP in 2004 to an estimated 89 percent of GDP in 2010 (Figure 1 and Table 1).5 The
increase has been driven by an expansionary fiscal policy in the aftermath of the tsunami
(public expenditure rose from Rf 3.5 billion in 2004 to Rf 10.9 billion in 2009) combined,
more recently, with a global crisis-induced shortfall in fiscal revenue (from Rf 7.4 billion in
2008 to Rf 6.1 billion in 2009).


After the tsunami, public external debt rose in dollar terms (although it has not really
increased as a share of GDP) as donor funds flowed into the country for
reconstruction needs. As tsunami-related flows waned, and with external financing
limited as a result of the global crisis, the build-up in public external debt in 2009–10
was less dramatic. Maldives received financial assistance from India totaling US$200
million over that period. Recently, the government contracted a non-concessional $74
million loan from China, followed by concessional borrowing from the Saudi Fund of
$8 million. The authorities expect additional non-concessional external borrowing
through end-2013.6



A ballooning fiscal deficit since 2008, coupled with the fall in external financing, led
to a rapid accumulation of public domestic debt over the last three years. In 2008 and
the first half of 2009, most domestic financing for the deficit came from the Maldives
Monetary Authority (MMA). The debt with the MMA came to represent 46 percent
of the central government’s domestic debt in 2009. However, deficit monetization
was halted in September 2009 and has since been replaced by sales of T-bills and
bonds, mainly to commercial banks, while the outstanding debt stock with the MMA
was converted into negotiable bonds.

5

Public debt refers here to central government debt and central government guaranteed debt. The government
has granted guarantees to state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Non-guaranteed SOE debt is excluded, in line with
the program’s definition of public debt. There is significant uncertainty surrounding the measurement of the
PPG debt stock, and in particular over government-guaranteed debt held by SOEs. A revision of this led to a
reduction of the 2009 public debt stock by about 8 percent of GDP. However, a historical series for this
component of debt is not available and therefore the data for previous years may be overestimated.
6

Consideration is being given to a currency swap or trade finance deal of $100 million with Sri Lanka to boost
international reserves, as well loans from other sources for infrastructure and development projects.

2.
The stock of private external debt has also been increasing rapidly over the last
six years (Figure 1).7 Private external debt is estimated to be almost 43 percent of GDP in
2010, a small increase over 2008 as financing for resort development dried up in 2009 and
did not fully recover in 2010. About a third of the stock is short-term. The magnitude and
maturity structure of private external debt raises liquidity concerns. A mitigating factor,
however, is that much of this debt is likely owed to resort head offices (although the data on
this is not available), which would reduce the risk of sudden stops of external financing.
3.
Taken together, private external debt and total public debt are estimated at
about 132 percent of GDP. Of this, external debt (PPG and private) accounts for 85 percent
of GDP, and has risen to represent about 150 percent of goods and services exports in 2010
(Table 2). By end-2010, gross reserves were sufficient to cover short-term debt, but reserves
have been on an underlying downward trend, and have been only boosted temporarily by
external financing injections, including $74 million in November 2010 from the privatization
of the Male airport. Total PPG debt, in turn, has risen to 2.5 times total central government
revenue, from under 1.2 times three years ago (Table 2). The DSA below documents in more
detail the nature of public and external debt vulnerabilities.

7

There is, as in the case of the PPG debt stock, considerable uncertainty in the measurement of private external
debt. A reclassification of external flows to the private sector yielded larger debt-creating flows for 2009, but
the historical stock is yet to be revised and may be underestimated.

II. CONTEXT AND MACROECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS
4.
Maldives continues to face severe fiscal and external imbalances. The global
economic downturn in 2008–09 had a significant negative impact on exports and tourism
receipts, external financing, and government revenue. Combined with excessive government
spending, this led to an unsustainable fiscal deficit. In the second half of 2009, the authorities
put together a comprehensive adjustment program, supported by Fund and Bank resources.

% of GDP

2,000

5
Despite some decisive initial actions under the program, including cuts in central government
nominal wages, cessation of deficit monetization and introduction of active open market
operations to tighten liquidity, as well as increases in electricity tariffs, significant policy
slippages have undermined the restoration of sustainability (see discussion in the
accompanying Article IV staff report). As a result, the fiscal and current account deficits
continue to be very large, and dollar shortages remain.
5.
The baseline scenario in this DSA is built on current policies, including the
authorities’ current tax reforms plans as well as the slippages observed since the 2009 DSA.
These policies imply that the fiscal deficit will stay high in 2011–13 and will rise steadily
thereafter (see Box 1 for more details on fiscal and other assumptions).
6.
The baseline scenario clearly illustrates that the current stance of fiscal policies
is unsustainable. These policies would lead to financing needs over the long run that cannot
plausibly be met by donors or supported by domestic or international markets, particularly
considering the deteriorating debt dynamics, and public debt service would absorb an
increasing and unrealistically large share of government revenues (76 percent by 2030).
Moreover, in addition to the large external debt, under the baseline scenario gross reserves
would be depleted by 2013 and become very large and negative thereafter, implying an
external financing gap (which is not reflected in the external debt path) that reaches
131 percent of GDP by 2030 (Box 1). The baseline scenario does not attempt to forecast
developments in the future, but to assess whether current policies can be sustained in the long
run given reasonable assumptions.
7.
This scenario differs significantly from the baseline scenario in the 2009 DSA,
which was predicated on the strong medium-term fiscal consolidation expected under the
program. This led to a moderate rating for the risk of external public debt distress in the 2009
DSA. However, a difficult political environment at all levels has prevented the authorities
from carrying out the plans for reducing the wage bill as expected under the program: there
has been no progress on public sector employment restructuring, and the wage cuts
undertaken in September 2009 will be reversed much earlier than expected. There have also
been delays in the entry into effect of key taxes. All of this has left the fiscal deficit on an
unsustainable path. Other macroeconomic assumptions for key variables have largely been as
expected (in fact, the growth outlook is now somewhat better than at the time of the 2009
DSA), but the much worse medium- and long-term fiscal deficit path is the overarching
factor driving the differences between the current and the previous DSA.

6

Box 1: Main Assumptions for the Debt Sustainability Analysis (2010–2030) under the
Baseline Scenario


Real GDP growth in 2010–15 is projected to average around 4.4 percent a year compared
with an average of 5.7 percent over the previous six years. After contracting by 2.3 percent in
2009, growth is expected to recover, as global and domestic conditions improve, aided in part
by tourism growth from new markets in Asia. Resort development is expected to take place at
a slower but more sustainable pace than that observed since the tsunami, and a continued
decline in the fish catch is expected to hold back the fisheries sector. Growth is expected to
average 4.5 percent from 2016.



Inflation is projected to average around 4 percent a year in 2010–15, compared with an
average of about 6 percent over the previous six years, due to a moderation in the growth rate
of global commodity prices over the medium term and reflecting a tighter monetary policy.
Inflation is expected to stay at 3 percent from 2016, in line with trading partners’ rates.



Interest rates on public debt are assumed to increase to 7.3 percent by 2016 (compared with
an average of 3.4 percent over the previous six years), reflecting tighter domestic liquidity and
an increase in the sovereign risk premium. They are assumed to stay at that level thereafter.



The external current account deficit (including grants) is projected to average about
36.4 percent of GDP per year in 2010–15, and to rise systematically thereafter, reaching about
55 percent of GDP in 2030. The widening external imbalances reflect ballooning fiscal
deficits, only partially offset by crowding out of private demand. Gross reserves are assumed
to be fully depleted by 2013 under the baseline and become negative and large thereafter,
implying an unmet financing gap that would reach 131 percent of GDP (cumulatively) by
2030.



The fiscal deficit (including grants) is projected to decline to 17.9 percent of GDP in 2010
from 29 percent in 2009, reflecting policy adjustments and the cyclical recovery. However,
despite the entry into effect of the goods and services tax (GST) on tourism from January 2011
and of the business profit tax from July 2011, and the expected entry into effect of the general
GST from January 2013, the deficit would remain elevated through 2013 given high spending
on current policies. Moreover, the fiscal deficit would rise slowly thereafter, reaching about
38 percent of GDP in 2030. This reflects the expiration from 2013 of resort lease period
extension payments and from 2014 of the $8/bed/night tourism tax, as well as increasing
interest payments from the deteriorating debt dynamics.



As a result of widening fiscal and external imbalances, there would be an implausibly large
increase in public financing needs and debt service. It is assumed that, through 2016,
domestic financing acts as residual; from 2017, domestic borrowing is kept constant at
8 percent of GDP per year, and external financing acts as residual. New annual PPG external
borrowing would average over 26 percent of GDP from 2017-2030, despite averaging only
4 percent from 1998-2009. Similarly, the domestic debt stock would double from 2010–2030.
The debt service on public sector debt would rise from 18 percent of government revenues
(and grants) in 2010 to 76 percent by 2030.

7
III. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY8
Baseline Scenario
8.
Under the baseline scenario, the PPG external debt path is projected to worsen
systematically through 2030, breaching all external debt stock burden thresholds along
the way. The present value (PV) of external debt to GDP breaches already its threshold in
2010 (Figure 2), while the ratios of debt to exports and debt to revenue would breach their
respective thresholds in the future. Although the debt service ratios are rising, they would
remain below their thresholds. The absence of liquidity concerns reflects in part the
rescheduling of one of the India loans. 9
Stress Tests and Alternative Scenarios
9.
Stress tests indicate extreme vulnerability to a combination of shocks, less
favorable external financing terms, and to an export shock. For the PV of the debt-toGDP and debt-to-revenue ratios, the combination shock (a one standard deviation shock to
growth, exports, the GDP deflator, and non-debt flows) has the largest impact in the short
term (the greatest factor being the shock to export receipts), while the interest rate shock—a
2 percentage points increase in the interest rate on new borrowing, relative to the baseline—
has the largest impact on long-term debt ratios. For the debt-to-exports and debt service-toexports ratios, the export shock (export value growth at historical average minus one standard
deviation in 2011–2012) yields the most extreme impact. For the debt service-to-revenue
ratio, the most extreme stress test is the combination shock. The stress tests highlight the
vulnerability of the debt dynamics to shocks to tourism receipts (which account for the bulk
of exports) and to external financing costs, which are of course sensitive to expectations
about the fiscal path.
10.
Debt dynamics are somewhat more benign under the historical scenario. When
key macroeconomic variables are set to their historical averages, the PV of external PPG
debt-to-GDP ratio breaches the threshold only in the long run, while for all other indicators
the path is upward-sloping but remains well below the respective thresholds.

8

External debt sustainability analysis is focused on PPG external debt, to which thresholds are applicable.
Private external debt is not considered for the purpose of IDA grant allocations.

9

A credit of US$100 million was made available to the government of Maldives by the government of India in
early 2009, and repayments of US$50 million in two tranches, initially expected to be made in 2010 and 2011,
have been extended to 2019 and 2020. Also, the Male branch of the State Bank of India (SBI) contracted a
US$100 million two-year non-concessional loan (subject to fifty percent rollover) from its parent at end 2009
and early 2010, to on-lend it to the government of Maldives in exchange for foreign currency-denominated
domestic bonds. This loan is being rolled over by one year.

8
11.
Private external debt may increase the risks to debt sustainability. Private
external debt accounts for over one half of the total external debt-to-GDP ratio. Much of this
debt is at maturities of less than 10 years, at market interest rates, and denominated in U.S.
dollars. To the extent that private external debt may increase liquidity and re-financing risks
for the country as a whole, and could thereby put pressure on the exchange rate, the risks to
debt sustainability could be higher than an analysis of external PPG data alone may suggest.
Moreover, the private external debt stock may be underestimated: non-FDI external inflows
to the non-financial private sector—which comprise mainly financing for privatization and
tourism projects—were treated as non-debt creating historically. While the flows have been
reclassified for 2009 into debt and non-debt creating, the historical stock is yet to be
modified.
12.
In the staff’s view, the risk of public external debt distress for Maldives is high
on current policies (baseline scenario). Four of the five external debt burden indicators
breached the thresholds. Staff judges this to be a function of the severe fiscal and current
account imbalances, in part due to exogenous shocks faced over the past years, but more
recently exacerbated by the expansionary fiscal stance and insufficient fiscal adjustment
measures.
13.
Under an illustrative fiscal adjustment scenario, the risk of debt distress falls
significantly. Staff’s adjustment scenario is based on baseline policies, plus the following
additional fiscal adjustment measures: significant public sector redundancies; a tightening of
capital and operating expenditures over 2011–13; introduction by July 2011 of excises on a
number of goods; and a revision to the Tourism Goods and Services Tax so that the tax rate
rises to 6 percent when the tourism bed tax expires at end-2013.10 This scenario is meant to
illustrate the magnitude of adjustment that would be required as a minimum to put public
debt on a downward path. Under this scenario, external debt burden indicators decline
steadily under the adjustment scenario, and would only temporarily breach the PV of debt-toGDP ratio (Figure 3). However, stress tests illustrate that the debt path would still be
vulnerable to a combination shock or a shock to exports.
IV. PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
Baseline Scenario
14.
Total public debt is unsustainable on current policies (baseline scenario). The PV
of the public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to increase sharply, from 88 percent in 2010 to
306 percent by 2030, owing to the steadily rising overall fiscal deficit (Table 2a). The PV of
the public debt-to-revenue (including grants) ratio would rise from 248 percent in 2010 to

10

For details, see the IMF’s staff report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation with Maldives.

9
794 percent by 2030. The public debt service-to-revenue ratio would increase from
19 percent in 2010 to 76 percent by 2030 (Figure 4 and Table 2a).
Stress Tests and Alternative Scenarios
15.
Maldives’ public debt is highly vulnerable to exogenous shocks under the
baseline scenario. The stress tests indicate that the debt path is particularly vulnerable to
shocks to long term growth. If real GDP growth drops permanently by a one standard
deviation, the debt ratio would reach 501 percent of GDP by 2030. Under the illustrative
adjustment scenario (see paragraph 13), public debt would fall steadily at a slow pace.
However, it would still remain vulnerable to shocks, particularly to growth shocks (Figure 5).
V. CONCLUSION
16.
On current policies, Maldives’ public debt would become unsustainable and the
country faces a high risk of external public debt distress. Four of the five external debt
burden indicators breached the thresholds in the baseline scenario. The analysis highlights
the country’s vulnerability to shocks to the tourism sector (which is critical for growth), and
to less favorable financing terms. This suggests the need to diversify the structure of the
economy to the extent possible within the country’s geographical constraints. Private external
debt, which is likely to be underestimated, adds to debt vulnerabilities by increasing liquidity
and refinancing risks for the country as a whole. In addition, public external debt is highly
vulnerable to shocks to the primary balance. This underscores the need for further fiscal
adjustment: in the absence of strong fiscal consolidation measures in the near term, both
public and external debt will remain on an unsustainable trajectory, leading to financing
needs over the long-run that cannot plausibly be met.
17.
Authorities’ views. The authorities are more optimistic than staff about the outlook
for fiscal revenue, including the expected yield from the tourism GST and the business profit
tax, and are confident that they can keep expenditure subdued. In addition, they have noted
that a rebasing of national accounts, which is at a very advanced stage, will likely lead to a
significant upward revision in GDP. Nonetheless, the authorities agree with staff that the
current fiscal and debt trajectories are unsustainable. They have committed to further
discussions with staff aimed at exploring ways to bring the fiscal deficit back to a sustainable
path.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Includes other non-debt creating flows.
3/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
4/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Large residuals reflect the baseline projection of positive balance of payments' errors and omissions through 2016, in line with historical patterns. In addition, from 2013, gross international reserves are projected to be depleted and become negative,
impying an external financing gap.
5/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
6/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
8/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
9/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Sources: Maldivian authorities; and staff estimates and projections.
1/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline, while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
2/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
3/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
4/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
5/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A1 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on the Maldives
February 14, 2011
The information below has become available following the issuance of the staff report. It
does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
Macroeconomic developments and data revisions
1.

In light of recent global developments, the January World Economic Outlook update
revised up the baseline projections for international commodity prices in 2011 and
beyond. In the case of Maldives, this is expected to lead to somewhat higher inflation,
a slightly wider current account deficit, a weaker reserve path, and more moderate
real GDP growth in 2011 than envisaged in the staff report. The negative shock will
also put additional pressures on the exchange rate peg. This heightens the urgency of
putting in place the comprehensive adjustment measures recommended in the staff
appraisal.

2.

The authorities are in the process of revising the 2010 fiscal outturn data. The
preliminary revenue and expenditure information points to a 2010 fiscal deficit that is
likely to be at least 2 percentage points of GDP larger than envisaged in the staff
report, mainly due to lower revenue from resort leases.

3.

The rebasing of the national accounts is still ongoing; the revised figures are now
expected to be published in March 2011.

Political developments
4.

Maldives held its first ever local government elections on February 5 to elect a total
of 1091 councilors at the city, island, and atoll levels. The elections were orderly and
voter turnout was high. Preliminary reports indicate that the main opposition party
(DRP) won the most seats overall (502 against 375 for the ruling MDP), taking
control of a majority of island and atoll councils. However, the MDP won a
significant majority of seats in the major population centers, including the two largest
cities (Male and Addu).

Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 11/26
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 28, 2011

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
Maldives
On February 14, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Maldives.1
Background
Expansionary fiscal policies in Maldives after the 2004 tsunami led to severe fiscal and
external imbalances, leaving the economy vulnerable. The situation deteriorated markedly
in 2008–09, as the decline in tourism which followed the global economic crisis hit the
Maldivian economy hard, aggravated the imbalances, and pushed the country into
recession. In response, the authorities adopted an ambitious adjustment program supported
by IMF financing. The program focused on a strong fiscal adjustment, monetary tightening
and a strengthening of the financial sector.
After contracting by 2¼ percent in 2009, the economy rebounded strongly in 2010, on the
back of a sharp recovery in tourism inflows. Real GDP growth is estimated at 4¾ percent in
2010. Inflation continues to reflect mainly international commodity price movements,

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

increasing since mid-2009 on a year-on-year basis, and is expected to average 5 percent in
2010. The current account deficit is projected to have widened to about 32¼ percent of
GDP in 2010, as the economic recovery and higher commodity prices have pushed up
imports, offsetting the tourism rebound.
There has been considerable progress in the implementation of fiscal adjustment measures.
In addition to the significant measures taken in 2009, the tourism goods and services tax (TGST) was passed in August 2010 and came into effect from January 2011. Also, the
business profit tax (BPT) was passed in December 2010 and will enter into effect in July
2011. Preliminary data put the 2010 fiscal deficit at around 17¾ percent of GDP, down from
29 percent in 2009, although financing information points to a deficit of around 20-21
percent of GDP. However, there have also been significant policy slippages that rendered
the program’s ambitious targets unfeasible and undermine fiscal adjustment in 2011 and
beyond. On the expenditure side, there have been no net fiscal savings from public
employment restructuring, public sector wages will be restored to their September 2009
levels earlier than expected, and the new Decentralization and Disability Bills will lead to
considerable spending increases. Also, the BPT will come on stream eighteen months later
than planned.
Monetary policy has helped stabilize the economy. Active open market operations and the
cessation of deficit monetization have effectively reduced excess rufiyaa liquidity. Private
sector credit has stalled, but bank investments in treasury bills have pushed up aggregate
credit and fueled broad money growth. International reserves remain on a downward path,
only interrupted by temporary external financing injections, and the Maldives Monetary
Authority (MMA) continues to ration the supply of foreign exchange to banks, while fully
meeting the demand from the central government and some state-owned enterprises. Dollar
shortages persist, and the parallel market premium has increased somewhat.
The real effective exchange rate (REER) has appreciated since mid-2008, broadly
tracking movements in the US dollar. This, coupled with a difficult business environment
and fiscal pressures, poses competitiveness challenges going forward.
The banking system as a whole is well capitalized, but vulnerabilities remain. Nonperforming loans have continued to increase, reflecting banks’ exposure to large tourismrelated borrowers hit by the global crisis, and this has affected bank profitability. Banks have
also become significantly exposed to the sovereign. The MMA has reached agreement with
banks on compliance with regulations on single borrower limits, asset classification and
provisioning, and foreign currency exposure limits by end-2011.

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that the Maldivian economy is recovering well, fueled by a strong
rebound in tourism. Inflation has continued to be driven mainly by international commodity
prices but a tight monetary policy stance has helped contain pressures. Over the medium
term, economic activity is likely to stabilize and grow in line with global developments.
Despite these encouraging signs, the economy faces unsustainable fiscal and external

3
positions. While recognizing the difficult political situation facing the authorities, Directors
stressed the need for decisive and comprehensive adjustment measures to achieve
macroeconomic stability, sustainable growth and poverty reduction. Efforts to strengthen the
financial sector and improve the business climate will also be critical.
Directors welcomed the progress made in the implementation of fiscal adjustment
measures, which had led to a significant reduction in the budget deficit. They also
welcomed the passage of the tourism goods and services tax and of the business profit tax,
which will come into effect from 2011. However, they expressed concern about slippages,
such as the lack of significant progress in public employment restructuring. Directors
stressed the urgent need for continued and credible adjustment efforts, including through a
combination of additional revenue-enhancing, expenditure-reducing, and expendituretargeting measures. Strengthening public financial management will also be critical for fiscal
consolidation. A number of Directors pointed out that the pace of adjustment should take
into account political constraints.
Directors endorsed the tight policy stance of the MMA, and recommended continued
monetary tightening to safeguard price stability, stem reserve losses and contain currency
pressures. They observed that the fixed exchange rate regime has served as an effective
nominal anchor for the Maldivian economy. Nevertheless, the economy continues to
experience a steady downward pressure on reserves and persistent dollar shortages.
Directors called for continued discussions between the authorities and the staff on this issue
while being mindful of the risks involved and the impact on the poor.
Directors noted that the banking system as a whole exhibits reasonable levels of
capitalization and domestic currency liquidity. However, credit quality remains poor and
banks’ exposure to the sovereign has reached high levels. They emphasized that the MMA
should continue to enforce prudential regulations, particularly on provisioning, single
borrower limits, and foreign currency exposure limits. The Anti-Money Laundering/
Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework should also be strengthened.
Directors welcomed the progress in advancing structural financial sector reforms.
Directors called for a close policy dialogue between the authorities and the staff with a view
to reaching agreement on a strong, medium-term adjustment strategy, including credible
and realistic prior actions, as a basis for completing the second review under the program.

Statement by A. Shakour Shaalan, Executive Director for the Maldives
February 14, 2011
The government that took office in late 2008 faced urgent policy challenges and
swiftly acted to restore external balance and fiscal sustainability. Within a few months, they
adopted a program of fiscal restraint that was based on a substantial cut in the size and wages
of the public sector and downsizing. At the same time, monetary policy was relieved from
the burden of sizeable fiscal financing. The authorities had requested a smoother path of
adjustment and for exceptional access to help finance sizeable redundancy packages of the
public sector downsizing. This did not happen, and we expressed the view at the time of the
Board approval of the program that it was overambitious requiring a budget cut of 29 percent
of GDP over a three-year period. After the adoption of the Fund program in December 2009,
there were legal challenges to the wage cut which were symptomatic of the challenging
domestic environment.
Performance Under the Program. In spite of these challenges, the authorities
managed to broadly adhere to the program’s quantitative performance criteria. Following the
completion of the First Review, all performance criteria for March and June, as well as the
indicative targets for September, were met. However, staff doubts about the adequacy of
measures to achieve the fiscal targets for 2010 and 2011 prevented completion of these
reviews. The staff supplement suggests that the December 2010 fiscal target may have been
missed by 2 percent of GDP, although it is also possible that the target may have been met.
End-of-year reconciliation of the fiscal accounts has not been finalized, and final outcomes
have differed by as much as 2-3 percent of GDP in past years.
Recent Developments and Outlook. The Maldives economy saw a healthier than
anticipated rebound in growth in 2010 on the back of the recovery in tourism arrivals.
Inflation remained subdued and gross international reserves were built up. Tourism will
likely remain the main engine of growth in the medium term.
Fiscal Policy. In spite of strong commitment by the authorities, both administrative
capacity constraints as well as political opposition delayed implementation of fiscal reforms.
On the revenue side, Parliament approved the Tourism Sales Tax (T-GST) in August 2010
and the business profits tax in December 2010, eighteen months later than planned. The
general sales tax will be submitted to parliament this year but Fund technical assistance
suggests it cannot be implemented before January 2013.
Some expenditure measures were implemented as agreed, but others proved difficult
to implement. Electricity tariffs were raised in November 2009 to eliminate budgetary
subsidies to the electricity company, operational expenditures were reduced, and some
domestically-financed non-priority projects were postponed as agreed. However, the initial
wage cuts were strongly opposed by the Civil Service Commission and wages had to be
reinstated to September 2009 levels. Public employment downsizing was stalled because the
expected donor support for redundancy and training packages never materialized. The budget
that was agreed under the program had assumed a 6 month severance pay, but the authorities

2
found this severance to be too modest for the downsizing, given the political and social
constraints, and they were not able to obtain the financing for larger redundancy packages.
The authorities remain fully committed to restoring fiscal sustainability, and reiterate
their request for a smoother medium-term adjustment. The fiscal deficit was already reduced
from 33 percent of GDP in 2009 (in the absence of measures) to 18-20 percent of GDP in
2010 (yet to be finalized). Additionally, tax measures adopted in 2010 will have a future
annual yield of 7½ percent of GDP. A deficit of 15 percent of GDP in 2011 is expected under
current policies. While political realities will influence the timing of reforms described on
page 11, expenditures—including capital spending—will be adjusted as necessary to achieve
this deficit target.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies. Staff argue that fiscal measures would need
to be supplemented by a significant exchange rate adjustment in order to restore fiscal and
external sustainability. This scenario precludes a smoother adjustment path that is preferred
by the authorities. The strategy is also dependent on wage restraint, which may be difficult
given the majority opposition in Parliament. The authorities are open to considering all
measures to complete the necessary adjustment. However, as estimated in Appendix 1, the
net effect of a 25 percent devaluation on the fiscal position is an improvement of 1.7 percent
of GDP assuming a wage freeze, and a deterioration equivalent to 2.4 percent of GDP with
constant real wages. These estimates highlight the risk of relying on currency devaluation to
strengthen the fiscal position.
The authorities concur with the need to tighten monetary policy. The Monetary Policy
Committee of the Maldives Monetary Authority has agreed to increase the frequency of open
market operations in addition to the normal weekly schedule, and to introduce two-week
reverse repos beginning February 14 to supplement the existing 1 week reverse repos.
Further measures may be considered as needed, such as an increase in the minimum reserve
requirement, currently at 25 percent.
Financial Sector. The authorities continue to strengthen supervision and enforcement
of prudential regulations. A new regulatory framework was introduced in 2009, and while
banks could not fully comply immediately, agreements were reached for full compliance by
end-2011. They intend to privatize the largest public bank by engaging a strategic investor.
Banks are well positioned to withstand a possible devaluation since they hold long positions
in dollars and only 25 percent of loans are extended to non-tradeable sectors.
Fund Program. The authorities view a Fund program as a useful framework to guide
and reinforce their efforts to restore external balance and fiscal sustainability. Other
development financing may be contingent on the existence of a Fund program. In this regard,
they look forward to further constructive discussions with staff.
