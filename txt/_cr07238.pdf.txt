ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA
Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by Staff Representatives for the 2006 Consultation with Antigua and Barbuda
Approved by Ranjit Teja and Matthew Fisher
December 5, 2006

Developments. Antigua and Barbuda is experiencing its fastest growth in decades, led by private
investment and preparations for the 2007 Cricket World Cup. A bold policy effort is underway to
tackle long-standing fiscal and debt problems, and raise growth prospects. However, despite
important progress, major challenges remain to secure a lasting improvement in public finances.
Focus. Discussions centered on reforms to restore sound public finances and sustain economic
growth. This report is complemented by the staff report for the 2006 Eastern Caribbean Currency
Union (ECCU) regional discussions that covers common regional issues, including banking
supervision.
Mission. Discussions were held in St. John’s during August 30–September 12 with representatives
from the private sector, civil society, and the government, including Prime Minister Spencer and
Finance Minister Cort. The mission comprised Ulric Erickson von Allmen (Head, PDR),
Rupa Duttagupta, Koffie Nassar (both WHD), and Dmitriy Kovtun (PDR). David O. Robinson
(WHD) and Shawn Ladd (OED) participated in the closing discussions.
Last Article IV Consultation (concluded on December 21, 2005; IMF Country Report No. 06/145).
Directors commended the efforts to address the country’s economic problems, and urged the
authorities to take advantage of strong near-term growth prospects to implement further fiscal, labor
market, financial sector and other structural reforms to consolidate fiscal balances and raise the
growth potential.
Statistics and Fund Relations. The lack of comprehensive data is an issue for surveillance.

I. CONTEXT
1.
The coming year could be a watershed for Antigua and Barbuda, with the
authorities coming to grips with long-standing fiscal and debt problems. The
government that took office in 2004 has adopted an ambitious policy agenda to tackle
decades of weak public finances—epitomized by persistent fiscal deficits, a triple-digit
debt-GDP ratio, endemic arrears, and a large civil service—and raise growth prospects. In
the context of strong economic growth, led by private investment and preparations for the
2007 Cricket World Cup, the authorities have launched fiscal reforms (Box 1), measures to
improve the investment climate, and are developing a strategy to regularize arrears. These
efforts have been underpinned by outreach to build public support.
2.
At the same time, sound public finances is still a work in progress. While the
fiscal position has improved, deficits remain large, government debt is high, and arrears
continue to be incurred. Even with a sizeable fiscal adjustment, large financing requirements
will remain. The reform agenda for the coming year is important and includes two crucial
fiscal measures: the introduction of the value-added tax (VAT) and completion of the civil
service separation program. Ahead of the 2009 elections, there are risks of policy slippages.
II. ECONOMIC BACKDROP AND OUTLOOK
3.
The economy is enjoying its third
year of vigorous growth and low inflation
(Figures 1–2; Tables 1−3). Performance has
been helped by a generally supportive
international environment, improved
government policies, and absence of natural
disasters. Available indicators suggest the

at 8 percent in 2006—among the
highest in the region—led by hotel and
housing investments and World Cup-related activities. For 2007–08, growth in the
tourism sector, which has operated at capacity, is expected to benefit from the
expanded hotel capacity and planned improvements in infrastructure (airport and
roads). Nonetheless, GDP growth will likely cool in 2007−08 as the construction
boom winds down.

•

Labor markets. Strong demand, skills-mismatches, and a stagnant domestic work
force are causing labor shortages in key sectors, for example, hotel and construction.
In response, the authorities have increased the number of permits issued to foreign
workers. Still, unemployment remains high (reportedly 9 percent).1

The reported figure is not recognized by the government, however.

•

Inflation. Despite strong demand and higher domestic petroleum prices, inflation has
remained low in the context of the ECCU and its quasi-currency board arrangement.
The VAT introduction will cause an up-tick in prices in 2007 (about 1½ percent).

•

Balance of payments. The current account deficit is projected to widen to 20 percent
of GDP in 2006, reflecting FDI-financed
investment.

Central Bank (ECCB), was approved in
January 2006, and banks are now also
required to provision 10 percent of public sector arrears. Nonbanking institutions,
insurance companies and credit unions, are increasingly competing with banks for
deposits and credit. Draft legislation for supervision of these institutions is with
Parliament. To strengthen the Anti-Money Laundering effort, the authorities have
prepared, with technical assistance, a “Best-Practices Handbook” for financial
investigations.

(Proj.)

Box 1. Antigua and Barbuda: Key Fiscal Reforms Implemented or Underway
•

Personal income tax—reintroduced in April 2005; to yield 1.7 percent of GDP in 2006.

•

Property tax—the tax base was broadened in February 2006, and a move to a market value-based system is
planned in January 2007.

•

VAT—scheduled to be introduced in January 2007 at a 15 percent rate, with a transitional rate of 10.5 percent for
hotels. The VAT, expected to yield 3 percent of GDP (in additional revenue) over the medium term, replaces the
consumption duty, telecommunication tax, and various hotel taxes.

•

Excise taxes—to be introduced with the VAT, but law has yet to be passed by Parliament.

•

Voluntary civil service separation program—1,078 civil servants (about 10 percent of the total) applied for
separation and early retirement. The pace of the program slowed in 2006 and it is now expected to be
implemented over 2006–07.

•

Social security reform—the authorities discussed the need for reform at a public symposium in July 2006, and
intend to publish a white paper on reform options soon.

•

Public expenditure reform—the revised Finance, Administration, and Audit, and Procurement Acts will provide
greater oversight of the broader public sector. The legislation is with Parliament. The Free Balance cash
management system has been implemented in the Ministry of Finance and is expected to cover all ministries by
end-2006.

•

Debt strategy—the government has publicly announced its intentions to regularize arrears and bring debt to a
more manageable level, and is developing a strategy with its financial advisors.

An important fiscal adjustment is underway, but debt remains high and arrears
accumulation continues. Fiscal balances improved in the first half of 2006 thanks to tax
reforms and collection of tax arrears. However, capital spending, mainly grant-financed and
World Cup-related, more than doubled. For the year as a whole, excluding one-off items and
assuming spending restraint, the primary balance is projected to improve by over 1 percent
of GDP relative to 2005. Nonetheless, the overall budget will remain in substantial deficit.

5.
Despite widespread arrears and awareness of the impending debt strategy, the
government was able, for the first time, to access the regional securities market. In
July 2006, it issued two bonds totaling EC$100 million (5–7 year; 8–9 percent fixed
interest) in U.S. and E.C. dollars. Proceeds were used partly to repay expensive debt and set
aside for severance costs. Earlier in 2006, the government also issued EC$51 million in
91-day treasury bills that have since been rolled over.
6.
Medium-term growth prospects are good,
but subject to risks. Real GDP growth of 4−5 percent
is feasible, given the outlook for main tourism markets,
the increase in stay-over capacity, and assuming
implementation of the authorities’ policy agenda.
However, labor shortages could constrain growth. The
main vulnerabilities relate to:

Tourism downturn. Tourism is vulnerable to shifts in demand from the United States
and the United Kingdom, which together account for three-quarters of stay-over
arrivals. Avian flu or terrorism could also have severe effects even if Antigua and
Barbuda is not hit directly. Policy options are limited, but the authorities are
undertaking marketing to broaden the tourism base.

•

Hurricanes. Antigua and Barbuda
experienced four hurricanes in the
1990s with varying effects—on
average, they were associated with
a 2 percent fall in GDP and an
8 percentage point increase in the
debt ratio. The authorities have
increased disaster management
efforts, and have expressed interest
in participating in the Bank’s
Caribbean Catastrophe Risk
Insurance project.

Policy risk. Slippages in the reform agenda could thwart prospects for sound public
finances and debt sustainability, sap investor confidence, and undermine growth
prospects. Risks of slippage will rise as the 2009 elections nears.

7.
The authorities broadly shared staff’s views and projections, but thought
growth would be higher in 2006. They expect growth in 2006 to be about 12 percent,
based on faster completion of large construction projects, followed by a more pronounced
slowdown in 2008. Their fiscal projections were broadly in line with those of the mission as
much of the construction-driven growth is tax exempt. It was agreed that frontloading the
reforms, to take advantage of the strong near-term growth outlook, would provide best
assurances that reforms would not be blown off course.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
8.
A central theme of the discussions was reforms to restore sound public finances
and sustain economic growth. These objectives are interlinked: high growth facilitates
fiscal adjustment, while strong public finances strengthens growth prospects by providing
buffers against shocks and by reducing uncertainty over future taxation and provision of
public services. The authorities’ program was designed with assistance from CARTAC and
benefited from technical assistance from the Fund.
A. Restoring Sound Public Finances
9.
The authorities’ have launched a comprehensive reform agenda to restore
sound public finances and achieve debt sustainability. It involves a sizeable fiscal
adjustment, regularization of relations with creditors, and exploration of all financing
options, including a debt strategy, to ensure progress toward debt sustainability.

3 percent of GDP improvement over
2005. The primary surplus would rise further to 4 percent of GDP by 2011 (Tables 4–5).

11.
Any improvement will require progress on several fronts. There have been
delays in introducing the VAT and completing civil service retrenchment, revenue
administration is weak, compliance with the personal income tax has been uneven
(averaging only 30 percent in some segments), and holding back spending is a constant
challenge.
12.
Recognizing the challenges to implementation capacity, the immediate fiscal
priorities should be:
•

Complete the voluntary separation program. This program is now expected to be
completed in 2007, yielding wage savings of 2 percent of GDP relative to 2005.

•

Ensure a successful VAT. The VAT and excises are projected to provide 3 percent of
GDP in additional revenue by 2011, but this hinges on successful implementation and
avoidance of exemptions. The authorities are considering options to strengthen VAT
implementation capacity and thought staff’s revenue projections were conservative.

•

Improve the personal income tax. Penalties should be enforced to improve
compliance. A broader definition of taxable income to include benefits and
allowances would reduce tax avoidance.

•

Strengthen expenditure control. The fiscal adjustment depends on holding average
spending growth below two percent a year in real terms, requiring firm control over
commitments, including the wage bill. The authorities expect expenditure control to
be boosted by the new cash management system and the new Finance, Audit, and
Administration Act, and fuller integration of the Public Sector Investment Program
(introduced in 2005) into the budgetary process to ensure careful evaluation of all
public investments. The mission urged that social programs be preceded by detailed
analysis, drawing on the ongoing poverty assessment.

11

13.
However, even with this fiscal
adjustment, large financing
requirements remain and debt
sustainability would not be assured. The
overall budget deficit and debt dynamics
depend on the terms on which government
arrears will be regularized, and the
availability and terms of new financing to
close financing gaps.

are also considering seeking further
market borrowing and concessional donor financing—including the PetroCaribe agreement
with Venezuela, which would provide a concessional loan (1–2 percent) to finance a portion
of oil imports from Venezuela. The mission encouraged the authorities to explore also other
options, including privatization receipts.
15.
The mission prepared an illustrative
baseline scenario to assess debt sustainability
(Tables 7–8, Figures 4 and 7, and Box 2).
Government debt would decline gradually to
the 60 percent of GDP benchmark established
by the ECCB’s Monetary Council for 2020.
However, the debt will remain high, and its path
remains vulnerable to shocks and sensitive to
financing assumptions. If more favorable
financing terms are obtained (e.g., 3 percent
real interest rate) on new financing or through

Box 2. Baseline Assumptions
•

Real GDP growth of 4–5 percent.

•

Primary balance reaches 4 percent of
GDP by 2011 and remains there.

•

Arrears are regularized in mid-2007
with a bond at 10 percent interest rate
(8 percent real rate); 2 percent nominal
rate is assumed for arrears to public
entities. The government is assumed to
remain current on other obligations.

•

New financing at 10 percent interest.

The authorities aim to resolve arrears to the universal social security scheme outside of the debt strategy, and
intend to clear long-standing wage arrears of EC$104 million over 2006–07 through cash and a bond.

12
negotiations with creditors, the debt ratio
would decline more definitively, to around
50 percent of GDP by 2020. An important
risk relates to policy slippages, as
illustrated in the mission’s “slow-reform”scenario. Finally, the baseline scenario,
despite achieving a declining debt ratio,
involves substantial financing
requirements, especially in 2007−09, and
unless these are closed, arrears
accumulation will continue.

underway and the already rather high tax burden, the mission emphasized expenditure

administration.

Any assessment of public finances should cover the broader public sector.

central government (Table 9). The

B. Sustaining Growth
20.
A key challenge is how to sustain growth
in the face of adverse demographic dynamics.
World Bank projections show a stagnant workingage population and a rising number of people at
retirement age over the next decade. Sustaining per
capita income growth under such conditions will
require growth in output-per-worker and/or
continued inflows of foreign workers.

21.
A stagnant working-age population and labor shortages pose challenges for
labor market policy. The authorities are concerned about unemployment, especially among
the young, and the challenge of finding the right balance of foreign workers in the work
force. Foreign labor has supported the current economic expansion by reducing labor
shortages. Going forward, reform of regulations, including for dismissals, could increase
labor market flexibility and improve the business environment (Figure 5). Unemployment,
and skills-mismatches in key sectors, could be reduced by encouraging the establishment of
accredited institutions that can provide certification. This would also enable Antiguans to
take advantage of opportunities within the CARICOM Single Market.3 Finally, the ongoing
civil service downsizing could help reduce labor shortages.
22.
External competitiveness, though hard to gauge, will be bolstered by hotel and
infrastructure investments, and improvements in the business environment (Figure 6).
The real effective exchange rate has depreciated since 2002, with the weakening of the
U.S. dollar against world currencies. Even so, the current account deficit has widened,
reflecting a surge in FDI. Antigua and Barbuda is a high-cost tourism destination and there
is some uncertainty over how tourism will respond to the expansion in hotel capacity given
similar expansions elsewhere in the region. Industry representatives are generally optimistic
though, pointing to high occupancy rates, which had constrained the country’s capacity to
maintain market share. The mission agreed that competitiveness is best buttressed through
reforms to raise productivity and upgrade the infrastructure. In this connection, efforts to
streamline the public sector and revamp the tax system, and implementation of the
Investment Authority Act—approved in August 2006 to simplify procedures—will support
competitiveness and growth prospects. Also, the CARICOM Single Market will widen
employment, trade, and business opportunities.
23.
The internet gaming sector, once a source of jobs and diversification from
tourism, is collapsing. The authorities indicated that employment in this sector has fallen
from some 3,500 people to 700 after the loss of access to the market in United States, and
the outlook for the sector took a turn for the worse in the fall of 2006 after new U.S.
legislation curtailed internet gaming further. The authorities expressed frustration that an
amicable solution to the dispute could not be found, even after the World Trade
Organization ruled in their favor. The report of an arbitration panel reviewing the
United States’ compliance with WTO rulings is expected in early 2007.
24.
There is scope to make tax incentives for investment less costly and
distortionary. Like many countries in the region, Antigua and Barbuda uses tax
concessions—mainly under the corporate income tax, import duties, custom service charge,

(avg. 2001–06)
to consider more efficient alternatives,
like accelerated depreciation and timelimited loss carry-forward provisions. The authorities’ intentions to cap concessions, and
implementation of the Investment Authority Act—that will establish criteria for granting
concessions—would make the concession regime more transparent and less discretionary.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
25.
An important start has been made in tackling long-standing fiscal and debt problems,
and improving growth prospects. Fiscal reforms have been implemented, or are underway, to
substantially raise the primary surplus to 4 percent of GDP over the medium term; an Investment
Authority Act has been approved to strengthen the business environment; outreach efforts have
broadened to explain reforms; and increased confidence in the direction of policies has allowed the
government to access the regional capital market.
26.
Economic policies could help sustain growth and competitiveness over the medium
term. In particular, labor policy can contribute to sustaining growth—in the context of a stagnant
domestic workforce—by reducing the costs of dismissals, encouraging programs to reduce skills
mismatches, and allowing inflows of foreign workers (e.g., embracing labor mobility under the
CARICOM Single Market). The investment incentive system could be improved by moving to a
more transparent, rules-based mechanism. External competitiveness could be buttressed by reforms
to enhance the business environment, reduce labor market rigidities, and improve basic
infrastructure.
27.
Major challenges remain in securing a lasting improvement in public finances. First,
achieving a primary surplus of 4 percent of GDP over the medium term, while feasible, would be
very ambitious and entail a substantial revenue effort and unwavering expenditure control. The
priority should be to complete the civil service separation program without further delay, ensure a
successful implementation of the VAT as planned, improve tax administration, and strengthen
expenditure management and control. Second, despite this adjustment, the debt burden and
financing requirements would remain high and vulnerable to shocks. The authorities are exploring
all options to close the financing gaps. In its debt strategy, the authorities are encouraged to
maintain a collaborative approach to creditors. Depending on the availability and terms of new
financing (including from the debt strategy), further fiscal adjustment cannot be ruled out. With the

20
completion of tax reforms and given high statutory tax rates, fiscal efforts should focus on the
expenditure side. With strong growth and labor shortages, there is scope for a second (but targeted)
civil service downsizing. Efforts should also focus on continuing to strengthen tax administration,
minimizing losses from tax incentives, and expenditure consolidation at all levels of the
government. Effective implementation of the Finance, Administration, and Audit, and Procurement
Acts will be critical in sustaining strong public finances.
28.
The intention to reform the universal pension scheme is welcome. The next step should
be to adopt a plan to reform both ABSSS and civil service pensions, as pressures on both will grow
over the medium term, and consider merging the two schemes.
29.
Economic statistics need to be improved. Data deficiencies compromise the quality of
policy analysis and design. The authorities’ efforts to reorganize the Statistics department to
improve comprehensiveness, timeliness, and quality of data are welcome.
30.
Antigua and Barbuda is proposed to remain on the 12-month Article IV consultation
cycle.

1/ Includes gross central government and government guaranteed debt.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)] times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Dynamics of GDP growth and the primary balance are taken from the average impact of 12 large natural disasters in the ECCU (Rasmussen, WP/04/224).
9/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
10/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

B. Bound Tests

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP
deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency
denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an
appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Dynamics of GDP growth and the current account are taken from the average impact of 12 large natural disasters in the ECCU (Rasmussen, WP/04/224).
7/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and
non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels of the last projection year.

SUMMARY OF ANNEXES

Fund relations. Antigua and Barbuda has never used Fund resources. Its quota is SDR 3.5 million.
It is a member of the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU), and the EC dollar has been pegged
to the U.S. dollar at EC$2.70 = US$1 since 1976. Antigua and Barbuda has accepted the obligations
under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. It maintains an exchange system free from restrictions on the
making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.
Relations with the World Bank Group.4 The country assistance strategy (CAS) for FY06−09
supports the region’s development through: (1) stimulating growth and improving competitiveness;
and (2) reducing vulnerability. Like its predecessor, the current CAS does not include any lending to
Antigua under the base case scenario. However, Antigua could benefit from participation in the
Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility and the Mainstreaming Adaptation to Climate Change
Environmental Protection project.
Relations with the Caribbean Development Bank.5 The CDB provides financing of priority
projects and technical assistance. Major projects under implementation include: line of credit to the
Antigua and Barbuda Development Bank; a basic education project; an airport and seaport security
enhancement project; and a poverty assessment project—part of a wider regional programme—to be
completed during the final quarter of 2006.
Statistical issues. Antigua has participated in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since
October 2000. There are significant problems with real, fiscal, and balance of payments data.
National accounts are plagued by the absence of trade data since 1991. There is no comprehensive
labor force survey. Data on central government finances published by the ECCB are broadly in line
with the 1986 GFS Manual, but Antigua has not reported data in recent years for the GFS Yearbook
and IFS publications. Balance of payments statistics, provided to STA by the ECCB, are reported on
an annual basis only and not in the format recommended in the 5th edition of the BOP Manual. The
government has indicated that it intends to seek assistance from CARTAC and donors to improve
statistics.

Antigua and Barbuda is a member of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), which
manages monetary policy and the exchange system for its eight members. The common
currency, the Eastern Caribbean dollar, has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of
EC$2.70 per U.S. dollar since July 1976. In practice, the ECCB has operated like a quasicurrency board, maintaining foreign exchange backing of its currency and demand liabilities
of close to 100 percent.
Antigua and Barbuda accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 in
November 1983. It maintains an exchange system free from restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions.

ANNEX II: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of October 25, 2006)
The World Bank’s management presented to its board the Eastern Caribbean Sub-Region
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), on September 13, 2005. The World Bank Group’s
strategy for the four years covered by this CAS (FY06–09) supports the sub-region’s
development agenda through two main pillars: (1) stimulating growth and improving
competitiveness; and (2) reducing vulnerability, by promoting greater social inclusion and
strengthening disaster risk management.
The CAS, which covers the period FY 2006–09, does not include any lending to Antigua and
Barbuda under the base case scenario. However, during the implementation period, the
country could benefit from participation in the Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility financed
through on-lending, possibly through the Caribbean Development Bank. Antigua and
Barbuda could also benefit from a GEF-funded Mainstreaming Adaptation to Climate
Change Environmental Protection project, which seeks to assist in the incorporation of
climate change concerns in sector and regional planning for the OECS nations. Additionally,
Antigua and Barbuda will benefit from recently completed, ongoing and planned analytical
and advisory activities to support the CAS’ two main pillars including the following
activities: “Towards a New Agenda for Growth”—OECS growth and competitiveness study;
Caribbean Air Transport Rationalization report (draft recently completed); a Caribbean Skills
and Curriculum Study; a report on Institutions, Performance and the Financing of
Infrastructure Services in the Caribbean (recently completed); Caribbean Financial Sector
and Regulation report; Caribbean Social Projection Strategy Review (draft recently
completed); a regional study on Crime and Violence in the Caribbean; and an OECS private
sector financing study planned for the current fiscal year. Under the High Case lending
scenario, US$10 million is planned for investment lending and/or Development Policy
Lending to support policy reform efforts in the areas of growth and competitiveness
(including interventions on Public Sector Modernization and Public Utilities Reform).
The previous CAS, which covered the period FY 2002–06, did not include any lending to
Antigua and Barbuda.

36

ANNEX III: RELATIONS WITH THE CARIBBEAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of November 1, 2006)
The Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) supports the economic and social development of
Antigua and Barbuda through the financing of priority capital projects and technical
assistance (TA) and policy dialogue on major developmental issues. CDB’s involvement
with Antigua and Barbuda has covered such areas as:
•
Formulation and implementation of macroeconomic social and sectoral
policies geared towards providing a framework for sustainable economic growth;
•
Development of infrastructure to facilitate
private sector investment;
•
Development of human resource to
facilitate economic growth and diversification;
•
Direct and indirect lending to agriculture,
tourism and manufacturing; and
•

Emergency disaster rehabilitation.

ANNEX IV: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Antigua and Barbuda has been a participant in the General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS) since October 2000. However, data provision for surveillance purposes is deficient
and prevents an accurate assessment of the flows of funds within and among sectors in the
economy, which hampers economic analysis. Major improvements are needed to facilitate
effective surveillance. There are significant problems with real, fiscal, and balance of
payments data.
1.

Real sector

GDP is compiled at current and constant (1990) prices but follows the 1968 System of
National Accounts. National accounts compilation has been plagued by absence of trade data,
which has had a serious impact on the estimation of value added in some sectors, especially
construction and wholesale and retail trade. However, the Central Statistical Office (CSO)
has restarted compilation, with merchandise trade data extracted from data files provided by
Customs since the fourth quarter of 2004. The CSO has completed the compilation of
historical monthly series from copies of trade documents for the period 1999–third quarter
2002. The Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance Centre (CARTAC) plans to work with
the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) in developing a program to improve the
compilation of national accounts through the development of a supply and use table as a
precursor to rebasing the national accounts.
The consumer price index uses weights from a Household Income and Expenditure Survey
conducted during February 1998−January 1999. However, the survey and price collection
exclude Barbuda. There is no comprehensive labor force survey and thus little coverage of
the labor market developments. An Annual Wages and Hours Worked Survey for the private
sector was conducted in 2003, though the coverage of Barbuda was limited. Results of the
2001 population census have been analyzed and published.
2.

Government finance

Annual and quarterly data on central government finances published by the ECCB are
broadly in line with the methodology set up in the 1986 Government Financial Statistics
Manual. However, Antigua and Barbuda has not been reporting statistical information in
recent years to STA for inclusion in the GFS Yearbook and IFS publications.
3.

Monetary statistics

Monetary statistics are compiled by the ECCB on a monthly basis with a lag of eight weeks.
The data are reported to the Fund regularly. The monetary survey, however, does not include
the accounts of credit unions that accept demand and other deposits. The ECCB is taking
steps to collect reliable data on credit unions.

38

4.

Balance of payments

Balance of payments statistics are provided to STA by the ECCB. These data are reported on
an annual basis only and are not reported in the format recommended in the fifth edition of
the IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual (1993). Reporting of data on reserves and external
debt is in accordance with Antigua and Barbuda’s participation in the GDDS. The latest data
published in the International Financial Statistics are for 2002.
The GDDS metadata identify priorities for improving BOP data in the short term. These
include merchandise trade statistics and visitor expenditure estimates for cruise passengers.
Medium term priorities include compiling quarterly balance of payments statistics and partial
international investment position tables containing information on debt and monetary
operations.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
January 17, 2007

1.
The information below, largely based on the 2007 Budget Speech, has become
available after the issuance of the staff report. These developments do not alter the thrust of
the staff appraisal. Rather they reinforce the message of the need for stronger expenditure
discipline and management.
2.
The 2007 Budget. While the budget reiterated the authorities’ commitment to
achieving sound public finances and debt sustainability, it also announced a very substantial
increase in spending on investment and wages; which, if implemented, would seriously
undermine the prospects of achieving viable public finances.
•

Wage bill. The 2007 budget shows a nominal wage bill (unadjusted for the savings
that would accrue from the separation program) that is over 3 percent of GDP higher
than staff’s projections. However, even after adjusting for the savings from the
separation program, the wage bill would still be over 2 percent of GDP higher.

•

Capital spending. Also budgeted is a very large increase in capital spending (to
8 percent of GDP, compared with about 4½ percent projected in the staff report),
mainly for infrastructure.

•

Fiscal balance. Even if capital spending were contained at the still high 2006 level,
and after taking into account wage savings from the voluntary separation program,
the budget would imply a primary deficit of more than 4 percent of GDP, compared
with a surplus of about 1 percent of GDP recommended in paragraph 10 of the staff
report. If implemented, the budget would represent a serious blow to the planned
turnaround in Antigua and Barbuda’s public finances over the coming years.

3.
Authorities’ views. In discussion with staff, the authorities acknowledged that the
spending ceilings announced in the budget speech were high, but reaffirmed their intention to
work toward achieving the fiscal adjustment described in the staff report consistent with
achieving debt sustainability.
4.
Tax reforms. On a positive note, tax reforms are on track. The modernized property
tax has come into effect, and the value-added tax is to be implemented on January 29, 2007,
as expected. Preparations are well underway and there has been a sharp increase in
registration in recent weeks. The government is receiving technical assistance from
CARTAC in the form of four experts (for a 2–3 week period), and has also hired outside
experts, to ensure a successful introduction of the VAT.

2
5.
Gasoline pricing mechanism. The government announced an imminent move to a
flexible oil pricing mechanism in 2007 that allows full pass-through of world oil price
changes to domestic prices, as done recently by other countries in the region (Grenada since
October 2006, and St. Kitts and Nevis since December 2006).
6.
Revised banking data. Revised official data on financial soundness for 2001–05,
indicate slightly lower capital adequacy and non-performing loan levels than previously
reported and slightly higher provisioning (see revised Table 10).
7.
Implications. The very large increases in capital spending and the wage bill included
in the 2007 budget send a worrying signal about the direction of policies, and, if
implemented, would cause a serious setback to restoring sound public finances. Staff has
urged the government to prioritize and consolidate expenditures to achieve the fiscal
adjustment recommended in the staff report consistent with achieving debt sustainability, and
would encourage the authorities to quickly develop a mechanism to restrain expenditure
correspondingly.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
January 25, 2007

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with
Antigua and Barbuda
On January 17, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the 2006 Article IV consultation with Antigua and Barbuda.1
Background
The government of Antigua and Barbuda has adopted an ambitious reform program in its
endeavor to pull the economy from decades of fiscal weakness—characterized by persistent
fiscal deficits, a triple-digit debt burden, endemic arrears, and a large civil service—and
declining growth rates. The reform agenda includes comprehensive tax reforms, civil service
downsizing, measures to improve the investment climate, plans to reform the ailing social
security system, and an impending strategy to regularize relations with creditors. These efforts
have been complemented by extensive outreach to build public support. Successful
implementation of the ongoing and planned reforms could mark a watershed for Antigua and
Barbuda’s economic prospects.
The reform drive has benefited from an upswing in recent economic activity. The economy is
experiencing its third consecutive year of high growth, driven by a construction boom in hotels
and housing, as well as projects related to the 2007 Cricket World Cup. Growth in 2006 is
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
expected to reach 8 percent, among the highest in the region. Over the medium term however,
growth will slow as the construction boom winds down. Inflation has remained low, largely
reflecting the stability provided by the regional quasi-currency board arrangement.
Fiscal outcomes deteriorated in 2005 but are expected to improve in 2006. Data till the first
half of 2006 show an improvement in the fiscal position, largely due to revenue gains, while
capital expenditure increased sharply in preparation for the Cricket World Cup. The
government was able to access the regional government securities market—the first time ever
for Antigua and Barbuda—and use proceeds to partly pay off high-end debt. Despite these
efforts, arrears continued to accumulate and the debt stock remains in excess of 100 percent
of GDP.
The external current account deficit increased to 15 percent of GDP in 2005 and is projected to
widen further to 20 percent of GDP in 2006, but will be fully financed by foreign direct
investment.
The financial sector faces risks in the context of a lending boom—by both, the banking and
non-banking financial sector—and already high non-performing loan levels at locallyincorporated banks. Some progress has been made in banking sector supervision with the
implementation of the revisions to the uniform Banking Act. Legislation for the supervision of the
non-bank financial sector (by the Financial Services Regulatory Commission) has been prepared
but is yet to be approved by the Parliament. The authorities are continuing to strengthen their Anti
Money-Laundering framework.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors welcomed the government’s program to resolve long-standing fiscal and debt
problems, raise growth prospects, and build a consensus to support difficult and ambitious
reforms. The strong economic outlook provides a good opportunity to advance these reforms.
The tax reform, including the imminent implementation of the value-added tax, is a major
achievement. At the same time, it will be important to strengthen tax administration and tax
compliance.
Directors emphasized that tight control over expenditure will be crucial to achieve fiscal
sustainability. In this light, the sharp increase in wage and investment spending in the 2007
budget, if implemented, would set back plans to restore viable public finances. Directors
welcomed the authorities’ intention to work toward achieving the fiscal adjustment as originally
envisaged.
Directors supported the government’s intentions to regularize relations with creditors and
achieve debt sustainability. They encouraged the authorities to maintain an open and
collaborative approach with all creditors and to make progress in resolving outstanding
arrears.

3
Structural reforms—in particular, labor market reforms and improvements in infrastructure—
will be important to sustain growth and external competitiveness. The efforts to enhance the
transparency of the incentive regime through the Investment Authority Act are commendable,
but consideration should also be given to a broader reform of the tax incentives system,
perhaps at a regional level.
Directors welcomed the government’s stated intentions on pension reform, needed to ensure
the long-term sustainability of the universal pension scheme and to address budgetary
pressures related to population aging. Directors recommended that plans for social security
reform also cover civil service pensions, and that consideration be given to integrating the two
systems.
Directors urged a further strengthening of financial sector supervision, in particular with respect
to the expanding and thus-far unregulated non-bank financial sector.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to reorganize the statistics department, and
encouraged them to persevere with improvements in data needed for policy making and
surveillance. They supported the provision of technical assistance in these areas as needed,
from CARTAC and other sources.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

GOVERNMENT OF ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA
ARTICLE IV MISSION 2006:
STATEMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT OF ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA
ON THE IMF STAFF REPORT
Once again, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda was pleased to engage the IMF
officials in the annual Article IV Consultation.

During this two week consultative

process, the IMF team met with representatives from the public and private sectors and
civil society in an effort to comprehensively assess macroeconomic developments. We
welcomed this opportunity to interact with the IMF on policy issues that are critical to the
transformation of our economy and appreciate the continued support and assistance of
this institution. At the end of the mission, the Government held a joint press conference
with the Fund staff in order to afford the media a chance to freely interact with the IMF
team and to receive first hand, the team’s perspective on the economy of Antigua and
Barbuda.
We concur with the Fund’s assessment that there are challenges with which the
Government must grapple as it seeks to establish more stable fiscal balances. These
challenges are particularly more pronounced as the Government seeks to simultaneously
promote economic growth through the empowerment of the private sector. Despite this,
however, we remain committed to correcting the fiscal imbalances and achieving debt
sustainability. The Government and the Fund staff share, in many instances, similar
views and perspectives on how best to meet these challenges. Indeed, both parties agree
that the fiscal reform initiatives, particularly tax reform, have been quite ambitious.
However, the Government is very pleased with the outcomes of the tax reform efforts,
especially given that revenue increased by over 20.0 percent since the commencement of

the reform process. We also note the Fund’s concerns that the efforts on the expenditure
side did not move apace with the revenue enhancing initiatives.

There have been

administrative delays and other constraints and obligations that restricted the speed of
implementing expenditure reducing measures in 2006.

However, the Government

remains dedicated to the task of continuing to improve expenditure management
processes and ensuring fiscal prudence.
Though we welcome the positive assessment of the economic outlook for Antigua and
Barbuda, the Government is of the view that the projection of 8.0 percent real economic
growth for 2006 was conservative and did not fully reflect the impact of ongoing activity
in some key sectors, partly associated with Cricket World Cup (CWC) 2007, and the
likely impact on other service sectors. Assessments of economic performance done by
the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank indicate real economic growth of closer to 12.0
percent in 2006 and a projected rate of between 4.0 and 5.0 percent for 2007.
The Government recognises that there are challenges in respect of the labour market
which are compounded by the absence of reliable data on the labour market participation.
In this regard, we remain committed to improving the quality and availability of
information on the labour force and to implementing appropriate policies to reduce labour
market rigidities. It should be noted, however, that the preliminary draft of the Country
Poverty Assessment Report indicated that the level of unemployment for the period
2005/2006 is 4.4 percent.
With respect to the fiscal accounts, the Government is pleased that the report highlights
the fact that an important fiscal adjustment is taking place. This adjustment has been
driven by a very aggressive tax reform effort which has produced significant results. The
Government is pleased with the work done on the revenue side of the fiscal reform
process which culminated with the introduction of the Antigua Barbuda Sales tax
(ABST). We will continue to pursue initiatives to further strengthen tax administration
and remain open to receiving the advice and technical assistance from our regional and
international counterparts in this regard. Specifically, we will continue to enhance the

capacity within the Inland Revenue and Customs Departments and will redouble our
efforts to complete the implementation of the Customs Renewal Programme – the
objective of which is to increase overall efficiency in the Customs Department.
While we have not been as aggressive on the expenditure side of the fiscal reform
equation, the Government is no less committed to this crucial element of the process.
The Voluntary Separation and Early Retirement Programme (VSEP) is one of the major
elements of the Government’s programme for expenditure reform. Despite some initial
administrative delays, the VSEP is well underway and is expected to generate significant
savings on the wage bill.

In addition to this programme, the Government is well

advanced in the implementation of an expenditure management system which focuses on
automating spending procedures, enhancing efficiency and improving accountability and
transparency in public expenditure. A key element for the success and sustainability of
the expenditure management initiatives will be an effective Treasury Department. In this
regard, the Government with the support of the Eastern Caribbean Economic
Management Programme (ECEMP) and the Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance
Centre (CARTAC), has commenced an initiative to reorganise and strengthen the
Treasury Department. Over the next several months, the Government will intensify its
efforts on the expenditure side in order to streamline the public sector, rationalise
spending, and improve efficiency and productivity. The support of national, regional and
international stakeholders will be critical to the success of the programme and the
Government will seek their participation at the appropriate level.
We recognise the Staff’s concerns with respect to budgeted expenditure for 2007 but
reiterate our commitment to ensuring the restoration of sustainable fiscal balances. While
the Government notes the points made in the report, particularly in respect of budgeted
capital expenditure, we are of the view that expenditure for capital projects, especially
with respect to infrastructure, is critical for our overall policy to encourage private sector
investment and development. This, in our estimation, is extremely important to our
strategy to promote investment and create an environment for private sector led growth.

However, we agree that prioritization is essential and as such, our intention is to ensure
proper expenditure management during the implementation of fiscal policies in 2007.
As stated in the report, the Government still faces some difficulty in attaining debt
sustainability. However, reducing the public debt to a more manageable level is a top
priority of the Government and we have already commenced the process towards
realizing this goal. With the generous financial support of the Canadian International
Development Agency (CIDA) we contracted the services of an international debt
management firm which assisted us in developing a debt strategy. Over the course of the
next few months we expect that, with the continued financial support of CIDA, we will
implement this strategy and realize considerable improvement in the debt profile of
Antigua and Barbuda.
As the Government continues to pursue measures that will bring about structural change
and macroeconomic transformation, we remain focused on creating a private sector
friendly and investment enabling environment. In this regard, we are very pleased that
with the invaluable assistance of many generous stakeholders, the Antigua and Barbuda
Investment Authority (ABIA) is now operational. The Authority, which came into being
with the invaluable assistance and generous support of many national, regional and
international stakeholders, is responsible for promoting and facilitating investment. It is
also responsible for implementing the Government’s policy with respect to incentives
which is articulated in the legislation. This allows for a more transparent and simplified
system for the provision of incentives to all investors.
The availability of reliable and timely data remains a challenge in Antigua and Barbuda
and requires deliberate intervention. We expect to implement a programme to strengthen
local capacity to enhance the output of the Statistics Division. This programme will
focus on increasing human resources, ensuring the availability of appropriate tools and
equipment, and providing intensive training.

Finally, we are once again grateful for the support of the Fund and for the opportunity to
engage in open dialogue with the Article IV team. While we appreciate that many of the
positions taken by the Fund have merit, all policies and measures adopted by the
Government are ultimately based on our broader understanding of and appreciation for
the peculiar circumstances on the ground and, more importantly, the overall needs of the
people of Antigua and Barbuda. We intend to continue to make full use of the technical
expertise of the Fund and will seek the Staff’s guidance and advice on issues of
importance to the economic transformation and development of Antigua and Barbuda.
