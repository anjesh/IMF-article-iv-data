INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
MEXICO
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2007 Article IV
Consultation with Mexico
Approved by Anoop Singh and Adnan Mazarei
November 9, 2007
Executive Summary
Background: Mexico has achieved macroeconomic stability—and weathered well the recent financial
market turbulence—but it has not yet reached its economic potential. GDP and productivity growth have
remained disappointingly low, and poverty and inequality are still high. The new government has made
an impressive start in energizing the reform agenda, including the passage of the recent fiscal package,
putting the central government pension scheme on a sustainable footing, and increasing competition in the
financial sector.
Challenges: The recent deterioration of the U.S. economic outlook will spillover into Mexico, mainly via
trade channels. Growth is expected to remain solid, but modestly below trend, and sharing the downside
risks of the U.S. outlook. The risk of a sustained decline in oil production underscores a long-term
vulnerability of the public finances. Mexico’s fundamental challenge remains to put in place policies to
achieve a sustained and substantial acceleration in GDP growth and reduction in poverty.
Staff’s views: The modestly restrictive monetary policy stance reflects an appropriate balance between
inflation risks. The recent tax and pension reforms are welcome steps towards addressing long-run fiscal
challenges. For the medium term, the fiscal situation will tighten progressively, with much of the
projected increase in taxes by 2012 being offset by the expected decline in oil revenues. It is critical to
avoid increasing inertial expenditures, and to move ahead with plans to strengthen tax administration and
expenditure management. A gradual but ongoing reduction of the large non-oil fiscal deficit would be
prudent. Early implementation of reforms of the state-owned oil sector could reduce the risk of a sharp
decline in oil production, and it will be important to improve competition in key sectors. It will be
important to monitor rapidly growing credit to households, and to proceed carefully in stimulating
financial development via development banks.
Authorities’ views: The authorities broadly shared the staff’s assessment. They were somewhat more
optimistic on the near-term outlook for growth, while recognizing downside risks from the United States.
They also emphasized the considerable upside potential for Mexico over the medium term, if envisaged
structural reforms can be implemented. The authorities agreed that the oil production outlook was
uncertain beyond the medium term, but emphasized that implementation of appropriate policies would
greatly improve the chances of developing new oil resources.

I. CONTEXT AND KEY ISSUES
1.
Since the 1994–95 crisis, Mexico has achieved broad domestic and external
economic stability, and vulnerabilities have been sharply reduced. Strengthened
macroeconomic policies have brought sustained low inflation and a declining public debt
ratio; a fully flexible exchange rate regime has been introduced; financial regulation and
supervision have been greatly strengthened; and the public debt has been redeemed of
“original sin” and its maturity extended. Given these improved fundamentals, as well as a
decline in the current account deficit and external debt to low levels, Mexico has become
increasingly resilient to external shocks, and has not been subject to disruptive episodes of
capital flight or sharp exchange rate movements. Partly as a consequence, the economy has
experienced its own “great moderation,” with output now much less volatile, albeit closely
linked to the U.S. cycle.

2.
Despite these successes, Mexico is far from achieving its potential.
Notwithstanding the advantages of proximity to the United States, Mexico has not joined the
league of fast-growing emerging markets, and there has been no sign of income convergence
with the United States. Poverty and inequality remain high (Figures 1 and 2), accompanied
by a substantial informal sector and large-scale emigration to the United States. Underlying
this are a host of structural problems, including weak infrastructure and education;
insufficient competition in key sectors and inflexible formal labor markets; still-limited
financial intermediation; and weaknesses in the rule of law. At the same time, new challenges
are emerging, most importantly—with oil accounting for more than a third of budget
revenues—the fiscal implications of declining oil reserves.

3.
The new government that took office last December has made an impressive
start in addressing these challenges. At the outset of his term, President Calderon set the
goal of abolishing extreme poverty and raising GDP per-capita to US$29,000 by 2030. As a
first step, in mid-2007, the National Development Plan, set out a wide ranging policy agenda,
including ambitious plans to raise infrastructural expenditure and move ahead with structural
reforms, with the aim of raising Mexico’s potential growth from 3½ percent to 5 percent by
2012. Moreover, despite the administration’s lack of a congressional majority, several major
reforms have been enacted, including a comprehensive fiscal package to help offset declining
oil revenues, a reform of civil service pensions, and measures to increase competition in the
financial sector and expand access to finance.
4.

In this context, the discussions focused on four areas:

•

near-term implications of the recent deterioration in the global economic situation;

•

making the most of recent fiscal reforms, and preparing to address medium- and
longer-term fiscal challenges, including declining revenue from oil;

•

catalyzing financial development while maintaining financial stability; and

•

identifying immediate priorities within the long-structural reform agenda.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS

5.
The economic expansion has continued on a solid footing, albeit affected
increasingly by developments in the United States. After an unusually rapid increase
through mid-2006, GDP growth has slowed in line with the United States (Figure 3), with
solid consumption growth—aided by booming household credit—offset by slowing
investment and exports. Despite some pickup in the second and third quarter, in part
reflecting a rebound in the U.S. auto industry, growth is projected to average just under
3 percent for 2007 as a whole.
6.
With inflation—and inflation expectations—above target, the Bank of Mexico
(Banxico) has tightened monetary policy this year. After converging briefly to the 3 percent target, inflation has been closer to 4 percent since September 2006, boosted by a series
of supply shocks to world food prices, especially corn, sugar and milk. Wage growth so far
has not accelerated, and medium-term inflation expectations have been broadly stable—
although remaining ½ point above the 3 percent target. In that context, Banxico acted to raise
short-term interest rates to 7¼ percent in April, and further to 7½ percent in October, citing
the need to avoid second-round effects and to guide downward inflation expectations.

Fiscal policy is on track to achieve balance for 2007, on the traditional budget
measure, as required by the new Fiscal Responsibility Law (Figure 4). The non-oil
augmented fiscal deficit for 2007 is projected to be close to 7 percent of GDP, broadly
similar to recent years level.1 2 Within this, a 0.4 percent of GDP decline in net oil revenues,
reflecting declining oil production, is being offset by a reduction in operational outlays, while
investment and social expenditures increase. Following longstanding policy, PEMEX’ prices
for domestic sales of gasoline and diesel were held essentially constant in real terms, now
representing a subsidy (since international prices have risen above the Mexican level).

Public debt trends remain generally favorable. The public debt to GDP ratio has
been steadily declining, and the average maturity of central government traded domestic debt
has increased—with the government recently able to issue 30-year nominal fixed rate bonds,
albeit in small amounts—although annual rollover of the augmented public debt is relatively
high. That said, the net wealth of the public sector may be declining with the continued
depletion of Mexico’s proven oil reserves, now down to only 10 years’ production.
9.
The external position remains solid, notwithstanding a decline in oil production
and negative shocks from the United States (Figure 5). Net oil exports contracted as
production faltered, and auto exports to the United States weakened markedly after surging in
2006. Recorded remittances—previously on a strong upward trend—also slowed, seemingly

1

The decline in the non-oil deficit in 2006 was mainly due to a development bank’s sale of loans to
FOVISSSTE, a publicly-authorized housing fund that as of 2006 is no longer included in the fiscal accounts.

2

Looking over the last 5 years of rising oil revenues (see table), the non-oil augmented deficit did not expand—
instead, the higher oil revenues helped reduce the overall augmented deficit and also pay for an increase in oilrelated expenditures (including investment).

reflecting increased uncertainty over U.S. immigration policy and slowing U.S. activity.3 As
a result, the current account deficit rose modestly in the first half of 2007, and a deficit of
¾ percent of GDP is projected for the year as a whole. As in the past, net inflows of foreign
direct investment have significantly exceeded the current account deficit this year. In contrast
to 2006,4 official reserves have risen this year, by US$5 ½ billion in the first three quarters of
2007; reserves are about 1½ times short-term total external debt on a residual maturity basis
(Figure 6).
10.
Mexican financial markets have weathered recent global financial volatility well.
As in other emerging markets, the global repricing of risk resulted in a significant decline in
equity markets, which shed most of their 2007 gains; a modest rise in sovereign bond and
CDS spreads (Figure 7); and a modest depreciation of the peso. By October, all these
movements had been largely reversed. With Mexican institutions reported to have little or no
direct exposure to U.S. sub-prime assets, domestic financial markets have continued to
function normally, without need for policy intervention by the authorities. There does not
appear to have been significant contagion or withdrawal of liquidity through foreign-owned
banks (which account for close to 80 percent of banking system assets).5
11.
The banking system appears sound although rapid consumer credit growth
needs careful monitoring. Commercial banks remain well capitalized, profitable and liquid,
and nonperforming loans are low. The main potential concern remains rapid growth of bank
credit to the private sector (31 percent annual growth through June), primarily to households;
delinquent consumer loans have recently edged up, from a low base, although the risks are
limited by households’ relatively low debt service ratio (Figure 8).6 Credit to enterprises has
recently picked up, but remains very low; corporate financial indicators are relatively strong
(Figure 9).

3

Some of the previous fast growth of recorded remittances was attributable to improvements in measurement.

4

The small decline in reserves in 2006 reflected a special operation, prepaying more than US$12 billion of
public sector external debt.
5

The authorities closely monitor all banks for related-party credit activity, while Memoranda of Understanding
with foreign supervisory bodies complement the Mexican prudential regulations that put caps on interbank
lending.
6

International evidence finds that “credit booms” are more likely to be followed by financial distress episodes
when they are associated with large current account deficits, appreciation of the real exchange rate, and high
inflation. None of these conditions apply to Mexico.

III. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
12.
With the economy estimated now to be close to potential, external conditions are key
to the near-term outlook (Box 1). While Mexico will benefit from rising oil prices, it will be
significantly affected by the weakening in the United States, with staff forecasts of U.S. growth in
2008 revised downward by almost 1 percentage point to 1.9 percent since July. Against this
background, the staff project growth at close to 3 percent in both 2007 and 2008—below trend,
and gradually reopening a modest output gap. The authorities saw the staff projections as
somewhat pessimistic, noting that the staff’s U.S. growth forecast was below Consensus
Forecasts; they also thought the impact of the U.S. downturn would be smaller than previously
since it was concentrated in housing, while industrial production—which affects Mexico more
directly—had been less affected.
13.
There was agreement that near-term risks to growth were slanted to the downside.
While recent reforms would have a positive impact on confidence—reflected inter alia in

A significant aspect of the medium-term baseline scenario is that—given the
combination of slowing oil production and rising domestic fuel consumption—Mexico will
lose its status as a net exporter of hydrocarbons. On the fiscal side, lower production will result
in a decline in the public sector’s oil income to about 7 percent of GDP in 2012, so that a steady
reduction of the non-oil fiscal deficit will be needed to comply with the zero budget balance target
(as projected) and avoid a rising public debt ratio (see Section IV.B). On the external side,
the combination of slowing exports and rising imports would essentially eliminate the

18
Box 1. Effects of the U.S. Deceleration on the Mexican Economy
Especially since the introduction of NAFTA, Mexico has exhibited strong sensitivity to the U.S.
business cycle, which has continued recently. Real external linkages now seem more important
for Mexico than financial linkages.
•

Staff’s analysis of the Mexican business cycle (Selected Issues, Chapter I) confirms that a
close relationship with U.S. cycle continues. The co-movement between Mexican GDP and
U.S. real activity is strong, with a close alignment of turning points.

•

Changes in U.S. real economic variables can account for as much as 45 percent of Mexican
output fluctuations. This likely reflects the close trade integration with the United States;
more than 85 percent of Mexico’s exports destined to the U.S. market.

•

Indicators of U.S. output—whether industrial production, or total GDP—seem more
important than U.S. domestic demand, reflecting that much of Mexico’s exports are
intermediate goods, rather than final consumption goods. This export structure could work to
Mexico’s advantage if the U.S. external account deficit were to contract sharply (since U.S.
final demand would then fall faster than U.S. output).

•

Staff’s analysis suggests that external financial conditions, and international oil prices, also
influence Mexican GDP, but to a much lesser extent than real variables. This finding
contrasts to some recent analyses for other emerging markets in Latin America (e.g.,
Zettelmeyer et al, 2007), where financial linkages seem more important. A possible
explanation is that Mexican balance sheets are stronger (and so less vulnerable to tightening
of international financial conditions). The smaller degree of financial intermediation in
Mexico, and smaller external debt, may make Mexico less sensitive.

•

Data limitations prevented quantifying the role of remittances in transmission of the U.S.
business cycle, but other work suggests that U.S. downturns do lead to slower remittances.
While remittances to Mexico are much less important (about 3 percent GDP, or 5 percent of
private consumption) than elsewhere, a sharp slowdown could still have a non-negligible
impact on domestic demand.

question of convergence of inflation to the
3 percent inflation target.
17.
At the present juncture, Banxico faces the challenging task of weighing upside inflation
risks from supply side shocks against downside risks from weakening external demand.

20
On the one hand, the authorities noted that external supply-side shocks—most recently, wheat
prices—continued, while the recent tax reform would put upward pressures on prices in 2008,
although the extent was difficult to estimate (partly reflecting concerns that these could adversely
affect expectations, the introduction of the gasoline excise was delayed to January 2008). On the
other hand, the 50bp reduction in the Fed Funds rate in September was a de facto tightening for
Mexico; and looking forward, the weakening U.S. outlook could be expected to reduce demand
pressures, and thereby the risk of second round effects. Overall, the team considered that the
current policy stance—judged moderately restrictive—was appropriate for the time being, with the
next move depending importantly on incoming data, including with respect to developments in the
United States, as well as wage settlements and inflation expectations. The authorities emphasized
that they would continuously evaluate the policy stance in light of the 3 percent inflation target; in
October, Banxico raised rates by 25bp, to 7½ percent.
18.
The team welcomed the progress being made in enhancing Banxico communications.
In May 2007, Banxico for the first time published a conditional forecast that convergence to the
inflation target would occur within a specified time horizon (in that case, about 18 months); the
monthly monetary policy press releases were also revamped to focus more on factors affecting
inflation beyond the short term. In October, Banxico took the further step of publishing a projected
quarterly path for inflation over a 2-year horizon, indicating convergence to target near the end of
2009. The team observed that these measures, especially the communication of a projected
inflation path, along with Banxico’s rolling commitment to achieve the inflation target, would
facilitate market adjustment to recent and future shocks, as well as convergence of inflation and
inflation expectations to target. Looking forward, a further desirable step would be to publish
Banxico’s inflation model.
19.
Mexico operates an independently floating exchange rate system, and the team
welcomed the continued observance of the transparent auction rule in place since early 2003
(Box 2). Banxico passively accumulates part of the public sector’s net foreign exchange cash flow,
but abstains entirely from discretionary purchases or sales of foreign exchange, and thus the
market-determined exchange rate remains fully flexible in both directions. This transparent
regime—applied equally during times of peso appreciation and depreciation—has facilitated the
inflation targeting framework, and by allowing continuous adjustment, it has avoided making
Mexico a target of speculative inflows or outflows of capital.

Box 2. The Foreign Exchange Policy Regime, and Accumulation of Reserves
•

The Bank of Mexico (Banxico) has not engaged in discretionary purchases or sales of foreign
exchange in this decade.

•

Still, Banxico accumulates reserves passively, partly from capitalization of interest earnings,
but mainly by (net) purchases of the public sector’s net foreign exchange cash flow
(principally, proceeds from oil exports and from external borrowing, less amortization of
external debt). Of these net inflows, Banxico sells 50 percent to the private market, via daily
auctions, following a rule established in early 2003.

•

The exchange rate is completely flexible on any given day, and in general is free to react fully
to changes in fundamentals. At the same time, the pace of Banxico’s passive reserve
accumulation, via oil export revenue, can be influenced by fluctuations in oil export prices;
this may dampen the sensitivity of the peso to such price fluctuations (relative to an
alternative policy in which Banxico would auction 100 percent of the oil earnings it receives).

•

Over the 2003–06 period, Mexico’s reserves expanded by approximately US$17 billion,
about 2 percent of 2006 GDP. Compared to other emerging markets during this period,
Mexico’s reserve accumulation was among the slowest.

•

At end-2006, Mexico’s reserves—again, viewed in relation to GDP—were second-smallest in
this sample, at about 9 percent. Still, Mexico’s reserves appear adequate by standard
indicators, such as ratios to short-term external debt, imports, and M2 (Tables 3 and 6).

•

The staff also applied the Jeanne-Ranciere (2006) model of “optimal reserves” to Mexico.
While results from this approach are very sensitive to parameter assumptions, they tend to
support the view that Mexico’s reserves were too low some years ago, but have reached an
adequate level.

23
20.
Still, Banxico’s NIR have trended upwards, driven by rising public
sector oil revenue, raising questions whether they are now too high. While
neither the level of—nor rate of increase in—reserves is high compared with other
emerging markets, the team agreed that

the team agreed with the authorities that there was no need for any change in

21.
The team judged the peso’s real effective exchange rate (REER) to be
broadly in line with medium-term fundamentals. This assessment follows from
several quantitative analyses, including the two cross-country estimation methods
developed by the IMF’s Consultative Group on Exchange Rates (CGER). Thus the
REER that is estimated to be consistent with medium-term values of fundamentals
turns out close to the current REER level.7 In another approach, the estimated current
account norm for Mexico is found to be a moderate deficit, one that is similar to the
level projected 5 years ahead (on the basis of a constant REER).8 Market assessments
from Consensus Forecasts or from interest rate differentials also suggest little
medium-term exchange rate movement, while options prices indicate only a very
small probability of a large currency move (Figure 11). Moreover, external
competitiveness seems adequate, with Mexico’s share of the key U.S. market
holding broadly steady (see Figure 5).
22.
The authorities expressed some skepticism about the usefulness of
estimates of equilibrium real exchange rates, including the CGER exercise,
given the large uncertainties involved. Considering the depth,

7

The team also considered Mexico-specific models of the equilibrium REER, examining such factors
as remittances and oil production volume, but these variants failed to improve on the CGER’s
modeling of the REER’s historical behavior. The analysis did indicate that Mexico’s equilibrium
REER has been rather stable over the last 5 decades.
8

Mexico’s actual current account deficit is smaller than the norm estimated for 2012. However, this
gap is projected to disappear over the next 5 years, as the actual current account deficit widens—
primarily as a result of declining net exports of hydrocarbons. A third CGER approach, identifying the
current account balance that would hold Mexico’s net international investment position at its current

sophistication, and forward-looking nature of the Mexican foreign exchange market, they
expected the value of the peso would react quickly and continuously to remain in line with
fundamentals. In their view, the broad stability of the real effective exchange rate of the peso
in the last several years had reflected a balance of opposing tendencies, with the effect of
trade competition (from Asian countries especially) being offset by an improving terms of

B. Fiscal Policy: Building on Recent Reforms and Ensuring Sustainability
23.
The team welcomed the major fiscal reforms approved in 2007, which are
important steps in necessary directions (Boxes 3 and 4). An innovative tax reform will
effectively widen the tax base, narrowing loopholes and providing much-needed revenue,
supported by tax administration efforts. Transfers to subnational governments—the basis for
a large part of public expenditure—will be rationalized, and a range of measures will help
improve accountability and efficiency of public expenditure. In addition, the system of
pensions for federal government employees, which had been on a financially unsustainable
basis, has been put on a sounder footing.

Box 3. The 2007 Reform of Federal Employee Pensions (ISSSTE)
•

The ISSSTE reform, approved in March, transforms a defined benefit system into a definedcontribution system with individual accounts. Current workers will be offered a “recognition
bond” for voluntary changing systems; they will have to decide whether to switch to the new
system by mid-2008. The reform also guarantees a minimum pension and introduces
fundamental parametric changes such as the increase in retirement ages.

•

Although the implementation of the reform generates cash flow requirements over the
medium term, the reform implies a major improvement in the long term: the authorities
expect that the reform will reduce the projected actuarial deficit (estimated prior to the reform
at about 60 percent of GDP) by about one third.

•

Other public pension systems, including some at the subnational government level, and some
state-owned enterprises, continue to face significant actuarial deficits.

26

Box 4. Fiscal Reforms Approved in 2007
The fiscal reform package approved in September has four pillars:
•

Tax policy reform: A new single-rate tax, the IETU, will be introduced in 2008, with a rate
of 16.5 percent, rising to 17.5 percent in 2010. Companies or persons with entrepreneurial
activities will pay the greater of either the new IETU or the existing 28 percent income tax
(ISR). While the new tax has a lower rate than the ISR, it allows far fewer exemptions. The
reform also creates excises on gambling and lotteries, while eliminating the minimum tax on
assets. A revenue gain of about 1 percent of GDP from these tax measures is expected in
2008, mostly from the IETU.

•

Tax administration: Through a range of tax auditing and control efforts, such as better
controls of tax refunds and promoting the use of an electronic signature, the authorities expect
to raise tax collections by 0.2 percentage points of GDP a year over 2008–12 (broadly
consistent with gains in tax efficiency during the previous administration). Efforts are
ongoing to modernize customs administration, and introduce a fiscal career service. The
reform also seeks to fight evasion of taxes by the informal sector, with a levy on cash
deposits exceeding 25,000 pesos/month (creditable against any other federal tax liability).

•

Intergovernmental fiscal relations: Increases in transferable federal revenues (relative to
2007 nominal levels) will be allocated to subnational governments using new formulas,
which include tax collection incentives and some redistributive elements. The reform
establishes a rule-based and transparent allocation process.

•

Public expenditure policy and management: The reform aims to improve the effectiveness
of spending through the establishment of a methodology to prioritize investment projects;
cutting operating expenditures of the federal government, agencies and public enterprises;
and starting “budgeting for results” in 2008. Measures that will strengthen accountability of
subnational governments have been approved by the Senate and are pending approval by
local legislatures. These measures include enabling the Superior Audit of the Federation to
make audits of earmarked transfers and empowering congress to issue a law establishing a
standard accounting framework across all levels of government.

Other initiatives were approved jointly with the fiscal package. A new 5.5 percent tax will be
applied gradually over 18 months to gasoline and diesel, with proceeds transferred to state
governments (this tax will reduce, but not eliminate, the untargeted subsidies on these fuels). The tax
regime for PEMEX was modified, reducing the ordinary royalty on hydrocarbons from 79 percent
now to 71.5 percent in 2012 (budget revenue will be unaffected, as PEMEX is part of the budget).
Effects of the new tax (IETU): The IETU is likely to be paid by companies that had benefited from
special tax regimes or had aggressively exploited the many loopholes of the existing income tax
(ISR). The authorities estimate that the IETU will be paid by about 40 percent of companies, with the
other 60 percent paying the ISR. Since the IETU replaces the assets tax and allows for immediate
deduction of investment—in contrast to the gradual depreciation scheme in the ISR—its introduction
can be expected to somewhat lower the relative cost of capital. (To avoid creating an incentive for
firms to postpone investments until the IETU takes effect in January 2008, a transitory regime will
allow deferred investment expenses to be credited against IETU.)

27
24.
The proposed 2008 budget again aims at a zero balance on the traditional budget
measure (consistent with an augmented deficit of somewhat less than 2 percent of
GDP). Reflecting the tax reform, non-oil tax revenues are projected to increase by
1.1 percent of GDP, 30 percent of which will be transferred to the states, and the remainder
used for infrastructure and social expenditures.9 Net oil revenues are projected to decline
slightly as a share of GDP, despite an expected rise in export prices, as oil production falls
and fuel imports rise to keep up with domestic demand. Also in 2008, the pension reform will
start to be implemented, inducing modest transition costs, and federal employees will choose
whether to switch systems and accept “recognition bonds” from the government.10
25.
The team stressed that even with the tax reform, the fiscal situation would
tighten progressively over the medium term. The reform would produce an upfront jump
in tax revenue, but subsequently the budget will have to cope with declining oil revenues as
well as rising pension costs (notwithstanding the

the poor, such as those on household electricity,
gasoline and diesel (ideally such subsidies should be reduced, including through targeting).
The team welcomed the intention to emphasize infrastructure investment projects, though it
would be important to control the share of these that will be financed through off-budget
mechanisms or imply a stream of long-term expenditures.
26.
Social gains from this year’s reforms will depend critically on implementation of
much-needed steps to improve expenditure management. The challenge is to improve
efficiency and accountability at both federal and subnational levels. The team welcomed the
authorities’ plans to move toward performance budgeting, and steps to promote
accountability in public expenditure executed at the state and local levels, funded by federal
9

The revenue law for the 2008 budget was approved on October 30, but the corresponding expenditure budget
was still in congress when this report was finalized (deadline for congressional approval is November 15).

10

Exact financial implications of the pension reform cannot be gauged before mid-2008, when employees will
have decided whether to accept the recognition bond option. The staff’s medium-term fiscal projections assume
that transition costs will peak at 0.2 percent of GDP in 2009, and decline gradually thereafter (these costs are
reflected in the staff’s projections of the augmented balance, but not of the traditional balance).

28
transfers. The proposal to empower congress to establish uniform accounting will be a
critical step to enhancing subnational accountability, and the team suggested that a portion of
federal transfers could be made contingent on meeting basic reporting standards. The
authorities are now working to implement a Treasury Single Account to improve cash
management and transparency in the use of public resources; they recognized that the federal
government still lacks an effective financial management information system, and planned to
move on this soon. The team noted that this would be necessary to track and “cost” the
envisaged performance budgeting programs.
27.
This year’s tax reform, while sufficient to meet needs over the next five years, is
only a first step toward meeting Mexico’s longer-run fiscal challenges. Indeed, in
presenting the government’s tax reform proposal, the authorities suggested that the tax/GDP
ratio would need to be raised by a total of some 10 points by 2020—partly to fund
expenditure needs, but also to substitute for an uncertain oil revenue stream (Box 5). Thus a
forward-looking policy orientation is critical to avoid the risk of a large and abrupt fiscal
policy adjustment in the future. In this connection, the authorities noted that additional
resources would be granted to PEMEX, which—in combination with more fundamental
reforms (see below)—should allow more oil resources to be developed. In addition, the
recent pension reform would generate important savings, to begin during the next
administration, and some current oil revenue was flowing into special funds, another form of
saving.11
28.
To complement these approaches, the team recommended an emphasis on a
sustained gradual reduction of the non-oil augmented fiscal deficit, which remains a key
underlying vulnerability. Such a focus would raise awareness of the underlying fiscal
position, considering oil as an exhaustible resource. An indicative limit on the non-oil deficit
would be especially important if oil export prices were to rise further, creating a temporary
abundance of oil revenue. In such a circumstance—which now seems relevant for 2008—
avoiding a widening of the non-oil augmented deficit could mean aiming at a traditional
budget balance above the minimum (zero) overall balance required by the Fiscal
Responsibility Law. In a similar vein, the limits on the several funds for “excess” oil income,
which are capped at modest levels, could be raised. If such approaches cannot be taken for
2008, it would be desirable to direct any additional oil-financed spending toward capital
investment, including in the oil sector.

11

Such inflows are counted as expenditure in the traditional budget balance (the augmented balance counts
them as asset accumulation, or negative financing).

29

Box 5. The Sustainability of Oil Income
Mexico’s proven reserves of oil have declined to the equivalent of about 10 years’ of current
production. The natural endowment is much larger, but there is great uncertainty about how
much, and how quickly, other oil resources can be developed—and at what fiscal cost.
•

At least through the medium term, a significant stream of oil production is assured.
Although the Cantarell field, accounting for more than half of production, is now in decline,
this is expected to be partially offset in the next few years by faster production at other fields.

•

Looking beyond the medium-term, the level of oil production is subject to wide
uncertainty, depending mainly on the size and quality of new investments. In the most
pessimistic view—considering only the current level of proven reserves—production at
current rates could be sustained for only about 10 more years. Realistically, however,
ongoing and future investments will convert some part of Mexico’s undeveloped resources
into working wells. Such resources are sizable—according to PEMEX, “probable” reserves
represent another 9 years of current production, and “possible” reserves another 9 years.
Beyond this, if the necessary technology can be acquired to access deep water oil deposits in
the Gulf of Mexico, the potential

•

The possibility of still-higher world oil prices gives some upside risk to oil revenues—
but the impact of world prices on revenues will diminish over time, along with the
volume of net hydrocarbon exports. Already, the moderate decline in oil production
projected over the medium term implies that Mexico will cease to be a (net) exporter of
hydrocarbons by about 2012. At that point, Mexico’s external terms of trade will no longer
benefit if international fuel prices rise, and net fiscal revenues from hydrocarbons will come
entirely from sales to the domestic market, at administered prices. Under current policies, an
important part of these domestic sales—gasoline and diesel fuels—are not linked to world
prices.

The team also recommended—and the authorities broadly agreed—that it would
be desirable to develop a broader picture of the public finances to help assess longer
term challenges and risks. This could include a wide assessment of liabilities, such as
remaining actuarial deficits of the public pension systems, non-debt liabilities associated with
PPSs, developments in oil wealth and—to the extent possible—other public sector assets. It
would also be desirable to track potential risks from contingent liabilities, including those
related to minimum pension guarantees, financial guarantees extended by development
banks, and PPPs (which are likely to expand in coming years). Presentation of longer-term
budget scenarios in the annual budget documents would also be useful. There was also a case
for consolidating management of all public debt in the Secretary of Finance and Public
Credit, with a focus on reducing annual refinancing needs, and to develop consolidated
monitoring of subnational governments’ debt.
C. Maintaining Financial Stability Amid Financial Development
30.
Mexico’s financial system has continued to develop and strengthen, increasing
its resilience to shocks. As discussed in Section II, the Mexican banking system remains
sound (Figure 13), with the strong recovery in banks’ financial positions contributing to the
significant rebound in credit in recent years. Domestic capital markets—notably for
government debt and derivatives markets—have also deepened, while the role of local
investors, particularly the privately-managed pension funds (AFORES),12 has grown
markedly. The latter proved a stabilizing factor during the recent financial market turbulence,
with purchases by local investors—who were more focused on Mexican fundamentals—
offsetting sales by some foreign institutions.13
31.
The overall challenge now is to continue financial deepening—in terms of
greater financial intermediation, as well as financial innovation—while maintaining
stability. Over the last year, the authorities have continued to promote banking competition,
including through licensing eight new banks; launched significant reforms of AFORES by
introducing a new investment regime and measures to promote competition (thereby raising
net returns to contributors); and begun to use development banks to catalyze private sector
lending to under-served sectors, including infrastructure. They have also introduced measures
to strengthen the underdeveloped local repo market, and—with the Federal Competition
Commission—are working on a strategy to strengthen contract enforcement and to provide
better creditor rights’ protection, including by strengthening the judicial system. The
authorities have scheduled an AML/CFT assessment for 2008, to be conducted by the IMF’s
Legal Department.
12
13

Annual inflows to AFORES have doubled over the last five years, raising the stock to 9 percent of GDP.

The opposite pattern has been observed in the past, e.g., during the run-up to the 2006 elections, downward
price pressures from local investors were somewhat offset when foreigners stepped in.

32
32.
The team welcomed these developments, which build importantly on the
progress made in recent years, but noted some areas needed careful monitoring. In
particular, as stressed in the recent FSAP Update,14 it would be important to carefully monitor
the ongoing rapid growth of credit to households, including through developing better data
on households’ balance sheets; in addition, the extension of banking licenses to subsidiaries
of major corporations—while having the potential to significantly increase the banked
population—carries risks, which the authorities are monitoring closely. While an expansion
of development bank activity could help fill gaps in the market, the team underscored the
potential risks, including contingent liabilities from guarantees. The proposed structured
finance framework for public infrastructure also needed to be carefully considered, given the
likely high degree of uncertainty on the potential returns, and the potential risks for local
investors—or , if there are guarantees from the issuing development bank—the public sector
itself.
33.
Mexico has made considerable progress in strengthening tools to address
systemic risks, including in adopting a more expeditious bank resolution framework, the
publication of the first financial stability report and the development of innovative analytical
tools to assess contagion risk, and a “fire drill” exercise undertaken by Banxico. To build on
this, it would be important to undertake interagency fire drills, and develop joint contingency
plans, and to pass the bank bankruptcy law to complete the bank resolution framework. The
team welcomed the authorities’ intention to strengthen further the supervisory powers of the
CNBV (the main banking supervisory body) as included in the proposed reform of the
Banking Law as well as to consider consolidating regulatory functions under one roof. As
recommended in the FSAP Update, greater independence for the regulator would also be
desirable.
34.
The team took a close look at the mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) market in
Mexico, which has been growing rapidly (see Selected Issues, Chapter II and Figure 14).
While small by developed country standards—the market is now the largest in Latin
America, and the Mexican experience has attracted considerable interest in other emerging
markets. Overall, the market is flourishing, with little risk of similar problems as in the U.S.
sub-prime mortgage market, given that underlying loans are generally at fixed interest rates,
have conservative loan to value ratios, and most have mortgage insurance (requiring a
thorough review of the loan origination process). That said, pricing RMBS is more

complicated than in some other countries, due to the absence of a performance history on
prepayments and defaults, and much depends on local real estate appraisers, raising the
risk of fraudulent reporting. The team and the authorities agreed that it would be desirable
to develop fuller and more reliable real estate data (and to strengthen the obsolete property
registry).
D. Structural Reforms to Promote Stability, Growth and Equity15
35.
The new government has rightly identified raising productivity growth as
essential to reducing poverty and enhancing human development. The key areas for
action, which are well understood, include: improving infrastructure and education;
boosting competition and flexibility in product and labor markets; deepening financial
intermediation; and strengthening the rule of law to ensure a secure business environment,
both in terms of physical security and contract enforcement.
36.
The National Development Plan sets out, in broad terms, the authorities’
medium-term policy agenda in all these areas. Some important elements of this plan
already are in train, including the expansion of infrastructure investment and efforts to
promote financial development and access to credit, as discussed above. In addition,
President Calderon has made a priority of improving security by fighting crime. The
authorities indicated that they would likely continue to take a step-by-step approach—
which has worked very well so far—seeking to build a consensus for action and then move
forward with implementation in one or two areas at a time.
37.
There was agreement that two key priorities were reform of the energy
sector—especially given the long lags in developing oil resources—and stimulating
competition. President Calderon has initiated a national dialogue on energy sector
reforms, and the recent fiscal package included some initial steps to put PEMEX on a
sounder footing; the team argued that the challenge is to complement these with measures
to address key governance problems and enhance operational flexibility, and allow a role
for the private sector or other companies. The authorities also indicated that work on
enhancing competition was already proceeding on several fronts, including the
telecommunications sector. The team welcomed this, noting also that international
experience suggests that improving product markets and competitiveness can facilitate
reforms in other areas. In addition to stimulating efficiency, greater competition would
directly improve equity. The team also noted that further liberalization of foreign trade and
investment could play a role in stimulating competition and efficiency, and in reducing

36
poverty as well.16 Recent and planned steps to liberalize certain food imports are steps in the
right direction, and should help contain prices of basic food items.
38.
Mexico’s large and relatively low productivity informal sector is a key constraint
on growth. The causes of informality are wide ranging, linked to many of the structural
challenges noted above, and possibly also to interactions between tax and social security
systems. Against this background, the team suggested that it would be useful to take an
integrated look at the factors generating informality, and the scope for reducing them over
time. The authorities broadly agreed, although they noted that some factors that had been
suggested by some as creating disincentives to formal sector participation—such as universal
benefit programs—also had important social benefits. They also noted that the new levy on
large cash deposits will reduce the attractiveness of informality, by making tax evasion more
difficult.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
39.
Over the last decade, Mexico has achieved macroeconomic stability, but still has
a long way to go to reach its full economic potential. Macroeconomic policies and
frameworks have been markedly improved, and external and internal vulnerabilities reduced
significantly. But despite these achievements, and the advantages of proximity to the United
States, output and productivity growth have remained disappointingly low, and poverty and
inequality high. In addition, new risks—notably of a sustained decline in oil production—
have emerged.
40.
The new government has made an impressive start in addressing these
challenges. Major progress has been made in long-delayed public sector reforms, including
the passage of the recent fiscal package, and putting the federal government pension scheme
on a sustainable footing, and in increasing competition in the financial sector. More
generally, the National Development Plan has set out a welcome longer-term vision to build
a more inclusive society and bridge the gap with fast-growing economies, thereby reducing
poverty while creating more and better job opportunities for the rapidly growing labor force.
41.
The macroeconomic outlook remains solid, although there are downside risks in
the short term from the external environment. Mexico has weathered the recent financial
turbulence well, reflecting both limited exposure of domestic financial institutions to losses
in the U.S. sub-prime market, as well as strong fundamentals. That said, given the strength of
real sector linkages with the United States, GDP growth in both 2007 and 2008 is likely to
16

Selected Issues Chapter III finds that Mexico’s entry into NAFTA helped reduce “transactions costs” in
external trade, but also that such costs still tend to be higher than in the Canada-U.S. trading relationship. This
suggests that Mexico has some way to go in achieving full benefits of globalization, and points to the value of
policies to lessen impediments to market integration, by removing obstacles to external trade, stimulating
competitive behavior among firms within Mexico, and improving transportation and logistical infrastructure.

37
stay below potential, with risks slanted to the downside. Thereafter, staff projections suggest
a solid rebound, with the pace depending at first on developments in the United States and—
especially over the medium term—progress with structural reforms.
42.
Monetary policy has succeeded in anchoring inflation and inflationary
expectations at a low level, although still somewhat above the 3 percent target. In the
short term, the Bank of Mexico will continue to face the challenging task of balancing upside
risks to inflation from supply shocks against downside risks to inflation from the weakening
external environment. For now, the present mildly restrictive policy stance appears broadly
appropriate, with the next step depending critically on incoming data, including on the U.S.
outlook. In this regard, recent actions to enhance central bank communications—including
the publication of a forecasted inflation path—should help facilitate a smoother adjustment to
current shocks, as well as to guide inflation expectations closer to the Bank of Mexico’s
target.
43.
Mexico continues to operate an independently floating exchange rate regime,
allowing a continuous and generally smooth adjustment to shocks. The real effective
exchange rate has remained broadly stable in recent years, and—on several methodologies—
appears broadly in line with fundamentals. International reserves have risen in recent years,
to a healthy, but not excessive level; looking forward, staff projections suggest that the pace
of increase will slow substantially as net oil export earnings decline. Correspondingly, the
staff sees no immediate need for a change in the Bank of Mexico’s non-discretionary rule
governing the accumulation of reserves.
44.
The recent fiscal reform is a key step towards addressing the challenges from
declining oil production; the IETU in particular is an innovative way to strengthen non-oil
tax revenues, and its broad base must be defended. But while the reform will allow for an
increase in expenditures in the short run, the underlying situation will tighten progressively,
with much of the projected increase in taxes being offset by the expected decline in oil
revenues over 2008–12. It will be critical to resist pressures to increase inertial expenditures,
and to press ahead with the measures necessary to strengthen tax administration and reduce
operating expenditures; there is also room for fiscal savings by targeting energy subsidies to
those most in need. More generally, the gains from the reform will depend critically on
improved efficiency and accountability in public spending, at both the national and
subnational levels. In this connection, the authorities’ plans to strengthen expenditure
management, including a planned move towards a performance budgeting system are
welcome. This in turn will require early implementation of a modern integrated financial
management information system, as well as the establishment of standardized—and high
quality—accounting and reporting systems for the three levels of government.
45.
With proven oil reserves down to 10 years of current production, Mexico’s fiscal
policy will need—as the authorities have stressed—to look beyond the medium term.
Early implementation of long-discussed reforms of the state-owned oil sector could reduce

38
the fiscal risk of a sharp decline in oil production during the next administration, and
potentially bring large economic returns. In the meantime, until the risk to future production
can be substantially reduced, it would be prudent to gradually reduce the large non-oil fiscal
deficit. To put greater focus on longer-term fiscal considerations, it would be useful to
supplement the balanced budget target with an indicative limit for the non-oil augmented
fiscal deficit, set to diminish over time, accompanied by presentation of longer-term budget
scenarios during the annual budget discussions. It would also be desirable to develop more
comprehensive measures of the public sector balance sheet, including oil wealth and
contingent liabilities arising from government guarantees.
46.
As financial development proceeds, the authorities need to continue to strike a
balance between steps to promote intermediation—still very low by international
standards—and preserving stability. The key priorities include continued close monitoring
of rapidly rising consumer credit, which would be facilitated by improved data on consumer
balance sheets and housing market developments; completion of outstanding measures to
reduce systemic risks, including passage of the bank bankruptcy law; and further
strengthening of creditor rights and contract enforcement. While the proposed expansion of
development banks’ activities could help fill gaps in the market, the authorities need to
remain alert to potential risks, including from the use of structured instruments to finance
infrastructure projects. More broadly, the recent progress in addressing issues identified in
the 2006 FSAP is encouraging, and it will be important to continue in those directions.
47.
Mexico’s fundamental challenge remains to put in place the policies needed to
achieve a sustained and substantial acceleration in GDP growth. Over the medium term,
action will be needed on many fronts; the issue is how best to prioritize, not least because the
authorities’ step by step approach has succeeded in building the political consensus for action
that was notably lacking in the past. In the near future, energy sector reform will be critical,
including addressing key governance problems in PEMEX and allowing a greater role for the
private sector. Strengthening competition, particularly in key network sectors such as
telecommunications, should also have high priority, and—as international experience has
shown—may also facilitate reform in other areas as well as helping equity. While there is
still a long way to go, the progress with reform over the last year is an important step towards
the goal of Mexico joining the ranks of the faster growing emerging market countries in the
coming years.

Appendix I. Background and Summary of Informational Annexes
Discussions. The 2007 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Mexico City during
September 17–28, 2007. The mission met with the Minister of Finance, the Governor and the
members of the Board of the Bank of Mexico, senior staff of several government ministries and
agencies, representatives of regulatory agencies, the competition authority, representatives of
labor unions, and banks. The staff team comprised D. Robinson (Head), S. Phillips, R. GarciaSaltos, R. Blavy (all WHD); M. Garcia-Escribano (FAD); M. Espinosa and L. Zanforlin,
(MCM); D. Velculescu (PDR); and S. Sosa (FIN). Mr. Singh joined the final days of the mission.
Messrs. Guerra and Jimenez (OED) attended most meetings.
Exchange arrangement. Mexico has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, sections 2, 3, and
4, and does not have restrictions on payments for current international transactions.
Mexico has a floating exchange rate regime since December 22, 1994.
Fund relations. Mexico has no outstanding purchases or loans.
Technical assistance. Since 2005, STA has provided assistance in national accounts. In 2007,
FAD provided assistance in customs administration, intergovernmental fiscal relations and
treasury.
Statistical Issues. Core data are adequate for surveillance. Mexico observes the Special Data
Dissemination Standards (SDDS) and its metadata are posted on the Dissemination Standards
Bulletin Board (DSBB). A data ROSC for Mexico was completed on May 23, 2003 and was
subsequently published as IMF Country Report No. 03/150. In a number of cases, the periodicity
and timeliness of disseminated data exceeded SDDS requirements. Still, there is room for
improvement in a number or areas (see Informational Annex III), including subnational
government fiscal and debt statistics.
Relations with the World Bank. As of July 31, 2007, Mexico was the Bank’s ninth largest
borrower with US$4.1 billion debt outstanding, representing 4 percent of the IBRD’s total
portfolio. A sharp decline in the Bank’s exposure to Mexico occurred in 2006, when the
government carried out a substantial prepayment (approximately US$9 billion) of multilateral
bank (IBRD and IDB) debt, drawing on central bank foreign exchange reserves, which reduced
IBRD debt outstanding by US$5.1 billion. The Bank’s portfolio consists of 17 active projects
with a total undisbursed balance of US$1 billion. Since the prepayment of external debt in 2006,
new lending has been substantially lower than in previous years and the Bank and the
government are in the process of redefining the level and forms of engagement that will be
reflected in a Country Partnership Strategy that is expected to be discussed by the Bank’s Board
in the first quarter of CY 2008.

ANNEX II. MEXICO—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
The Bank’s relationship with Mexico in recent years provides a demonstration of the Bank’s
current role in middle income countries (MICs). On the demand side, as in the case of many
other MICs, Mexico is interested in Bank support for addressing global priorities, including
climate change, catastrophe risk management, and trade integration. The country also seeks
to draw on the Bank’s international experience through high-level technical assistance, and to
maintain its relationship with the Bank as a fallback financing option should private credit
markets fail to provide sufficient liquidity at some future point.
Mexico has been a leading consumer of many of the new or redesigned products and services
that the Bank has developed. It was the first country to use local currency products, which
have eliminated foreign currency risk to financial intermediaries in subnational loans.
Mexico is also a leading implementer of Global Environment Facility (GEF) grants and other
products that help to counter climate change and environmental degradation. Government
officials have worked closely with Bank staff on efforts aiming to use existing fiduciary and
safeguard systems within Bank projects, both to reduce the cost of doing business with the
Bank and to facilitate the development of the country’s institutions. Mexico has been open to
the Bank’s facilitation of dialogue on major development issues such as poverty and
inequality, often through jointly sponsored conferences and workshops. Where Bank support
could not be easily carried out through loan or grant-financed programs, various units of
government have been willing to pay for the Bank’s unique expertise through fee-based
services arrangements.
As of July 31, 2007, Mexico was the Bank’s ninth largest borrower with US$4.1 billion debt
outstanding, representing 4 percent of the IBRD’s total portfolio. A sharp decline in the
Bank’s exposure to Mexico occurred in the second half of 2006 when the government carried
out a substantial prepayment (approximately US$9 billion) of multilateral bank (IBRD and
IDB) debt, which reduced IBRD debt outstanding by US$5.1 billion. The prepayment
reflects the government’s interest to replace foreign currency debt with locally issued
instruments and as such it suggests a reduced appetite for foreign borrowing in the future.
The Bank’s portfolio consists of 17 active projects with a total undisbursed balance of
US$1 billion. Ever since the 2006 prepayment of external debt, new lending has been
substantially lower than in previous years and the Bank and the government are in the
process of redefining the level and forms of engagement that will be reflected in a Country
Partnership Strategy that is expected to be discussed by the Board in the first quarter of CY
2008.

ANNEX III. MEXICO—STATISTICAL ISSUES
Core data are adequate for surveillance. Mexico observes the Special Data Dissemination
Standards (SDDS) and its metadata are posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin
Board (DSBB). A data ROSC for Mexico was completed on May 23, 2003 and was
subsequently published as IMF Country Report No. 03/150. In a number of cases, the
periodicity and timeliness of disseminated data exceeded SDDS requirements. However,
there are various areas where improvements could be made. The authorities are aware of this
situation and are continuing work in this regard.
Although some of the balance of payments statistics conform to the fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual, a full transition has not yet been completed. Several measures
to improve external debt statistics have been carried out, including the compilation of data
on external liabilities of publicly traded companies registered with the Mexican stock
exchange (external debt outstanding, annual amortization schedule for the next four years
broken down by maturity, and type of instrument), but a projection of the total external debt
service of commercial banks is still not available. International reserves data are compiled
according to the Operational Guidelines for the Data Template on International Reserves and
Foreign Currency Liquidity of the IMF (2001). The authorities recently published Financial
Soundness Indicators using the IMF's methodology for 2005 and 2006; it would be useful
to update and publish such data on a regular basis.
A national accounts mission in 2005 found that the coverage of non-observed (informal,
illegal, and underground) activities is incomplete and that outdated coefficients from the use
matrix of the base year 1993 are extensively used. A follow-up mission, scheduled for early
2008, will include the analysis of the results of the input-output table, the new series of gross
domestic product by the production and expenditure approaches at current and constant prices,
and the complete set of national accounts series by institutional sector according to the System of
National Accounts 1993 for the period 2003–2005.
In the fiscal area, the authorities have reported since 2001 a comprehensive measure of the
fiscal balance—the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement—that encompasses the direct net
cost of public investment projects with deferred recording in the fiscal accounts
(PIDIREGAS) as well as the interest cost on a number of government liabilities that had not
been previously recorded. Both the preliminary (available with a 30-day lag following the
end of each quarter) and the final (available mid-year of the subsequent year) data are
published and submitted to congress, ensuring that revisions are transparent and subject to
public scrutiny.
In light of the large share of public expenditure that is executed at the state and local government levels, it would be useful to develop consistent and timely reporting of subnational
government operations and debt, as well as consolidated general government statistics.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
MEXICO
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the Western Hemisphere Department
Approved by Anoop Singh and Adnan Mazarei
November 29, 2007
This supplement reports on economic and policy developments since the staff report was
issued on November 12. The thrust of the staff’s appraisal remains unchanged.
1.
GDP growth for the third quarter reached 3.7 percent (y-o-y), somewhat above
staff’s projections. Growth was fueled by the service sector, which more than compensated for
weaker performance in manufacturing sector. It is likely that growth for 2007 as a whole will
modestly exceed the staff report’s projection of 2.9 percent.
2.
The Bank of Mexico decided, at its November 23 monetary policy meeting, to
hold monetary conditions steady. The bank noted the economy’s better performance in the
third quarter, while pointing to an increased risk that weakening of the U.S. economy would
negatively affect Mexican activity. The bank also observed that Mexican financial markets
were continuing to function normally, amid renewed global financial turbulence.
3.
Financial asset prices have weakened in the last few weeks, continuing to
move broadly in line with global market developments. In November, Mexico’s EMBI spread
increased by about 45 basis points, while the EMBI global spread widened by about 65 basis
points. The stock market declined about 7 percent (compared to 5 percent for the U.S. Dow
Jones), and the peso lost about 2 percent against the U.S. dollar (all data as of November 28).
4.
Congress approved the 2008 budget aiming at zero balance on the traditional
budget measure, in line with the Fiscal Responsibility Law. Relative to the 2007 budget, the
2008 budget allocates significantly more resources to infrastructure investment and targets
higher spending in social programs, i.e., education, housing and health.
5.
The staff’s projection of the oil export price has been revised upwards. For
2008, the price of the Mexican mix is now projected at about US$73 per barrel, compared to
US$63.2 in the staff report (and US$49 in the budget). This revision raises staff’s projection of
fiscal revenues by about ½ percent of GDP. Under the Fiscal Responsibility Law, additional
income resulting from higher oil prices will be split among several stabilization funds, the
pension systems restructuring fund, and investment projects at the federal and state government
levels.

2
6.
The authorities made some adjustments on the IETU, the new income tax that
will begin in 2008. These adjustments aim at a more uniform corporate tax treatment and
include temporary tax credits for existing inventories, for investment-related losses incurred
during 2005–07, and for the maquila sector. The authorities expect that these adjustments will
not significantly affect revenues from the tax reform.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 13, 2007

International Monetary Fund

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with
Mexico
On December, 3, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Mexico.1
Background
The economic expansion has continued albeit slowed by developments in the United
States. Despite some pickup in the second and third quarter, growth is projected to be
close to 3 percent for 2007 as a whole. During the last 12 months inflation has been
closer to 4 percent, boosted by a series of supply shocks to world food prices, than to
the 3 percent target. Wage growth so far has not accelerated, and medium-term inflation
expectations have been broadly stable—although remaining ½ point above the
3 percent target. In that context and citing the need to avoid second-round effects and to
guide downward inflation expectations, the Bank of Mexico acted to raise short-term
interest rates to 7¼ percent in April, and further to 7½ percent in October.
The external position remains solid, notwithstanding a decline in oil production and
slower pace of growth in remittances. The current account deficit is projected to increase
to ¾ percent of GDP for the year as a whole. The Bank of Mexico has continued to
abstain from discretionary intervention in the foreign exchange market, following the rule
for its foreign exchange sales announced in 2003. Mainly reflecting public sector oil

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

2
export earnings, official reserves have risen by US$5 ½ billion in the first three quarters
of 2007 and are about 1½ times short-term external debt on a residual maturity basis.
Fiscal policy is on track to achieve balance for 2007, on the traditional budget measure,
as required by the new Fiscal Responsibility Law. The non-oil augmented fiscal deficit
for 2007 is projected to be close to 7 percent of GDP, broadly similar to recent years’
level. Within this, a 0.4 percent of GDP decline in net oil revenues, reflecting declining
oil production, is being offset by a reduction in operational outlays, while investment and
social expenditures increase. The public debt to GDP ratio has been steadily declining,
and the average maturity of central government traded domestic debt has increased—
with the government recently able to issue 30-year nominal fixed rate bonds, albeit in
small amounts—although total public sector debt rollover needs are still relatively high.
Mexican financial markets have weathered recent global financial volatility well. As in
other emerging markets, the global repricing of risk that began in late July led to a
modest rise in bond spreads, as well as a decline in equity prices and some
depreciation of the currency (although the latter two movements have now been largely
reversed). Domestic financial markets have continued to function normally, without need
for policy intervention by the authorities. Commercial banks remain well capitalized,
profitable and liquid, and nonperforming loans are still low. The main potential concern
remains rapid growth of bank credit to the private sector (29 percent annual growth
through September), primarily to households. Credit to enterprises has recently picked
up, but remains very low.

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the improvements in macroeconomic and financial
policies that have helped Mexico to reduce significantly external and internal
vulnerabilities over the years—with sustained low inflation, a declining public debt ratio,
and a reduction in external debt to low levels. They also welcomed the recent reform
breakthroughs, including on tax policy and public pensions, as essential, forward-looking
steps to addressing longer-term challenges.
At the same time, Directors noted that Mexico still has a long way to reach its full
economic potential, emphasizing the need to accelerate output and productivity growth
and to further reduce poverty and inequality. They therefore welcomed the National
Development Plan’s emphasis on building a more inclusive society that bridges the gap
with fast-growing economies while creating more and better job opportunities.
Directors considered that Mexico’s near-term outlook remains solid. They observed that
Mexican markets have weathered the recent global volatility well, owing to Mexico’s
healthy fundamentals. Nevertheless, Directors expected that economic growth in the
short run could remain somewhat below potential, as the recent deterioration of the U.S.
economic outlook could spill over to Mexico.

3
Directors noted that monetary policy has succeeded in anchoring inflation and
inflationary expectations at a low level, although still somewhat above the 3 percent
target. In that context, they considered the current policy stance broadly appropriate,
while noting that the Bank of Mexico now has the challenging task of weighing upside
risks to inflation from supply shocks against downside risks to inflation from the
weakening external environment. Directors welcomed the recent steps to enhance
monetary policy communication—including the publication of a forecasted inflation
path—which should facilitate adjustment to shocks, and guide inflation expectations
closer to the target.
Directors considered the independently floating exchange rate regime as appropriate
and serving Mexico well, and the real effective exchange rate as broadly in line with
fundamentals. They noted that this transparent regime has facilitated continuous and
smooth adjustment to shocks, thus contributing to internal and external stability.
Directors also noted that the level of international reserves appears adequate, and saw
no immediate need for a change in the non-discretionary rule governing the
accumulation of reserves.
Directors welcomed the recent tax policy and public pension reforms as key to
addressing long-term fiscal challenges. They recommended that the upfront revenue
gains from the tax policy measures be used cautiously, including in light of the projected
medium-term decline of oil production and associated fiscal revenue. In that context,
Directors noted the importance of implementing the plan to strengthen tax
administration, and resisting any pressures to increase inertial expenditures. They
welcomed the authorities’ focus on capital expenditures, while recommending the
targeting of subsidies to those most in need.
Directors supported the recent and prospective steps to enhance efficiency and
accountability in public spending, at both the national and subnational levels. They
encouraged the early implementation of a modern integrated financial management
information system and noted the importance of improving subnational fiscal and debt
statistics.
While commending the recent steps to prevent medium-term fiscal difficulties, Directors
noted the fiscal risks from a possible sharp decline of oil production during the next
administration. In that context, they recommended giving a longer-term orientation to
fiscal policymaking, developing comprehensive measures of the public sector balance
sheet, and supplementing the balanced budget requirement with a focus on steadily
reducing the large non-oil fiscal deficit. A number of Directors recommended
establishing an indicative limit for the non-oil augmented fiscal balance over the medium
term.
Directors observed that Mexico’s financial system remains sound and well regulated.
They commended the authorities’ progress to address the issues identified in the 2006
FSAP Update and their intention to continue moving on that broad agenda. Directors

4
noted the need to remain alert to potential risks, such as those arising from the use of
structured instruments and the planned expansion of development banks’ activities.
They also recommended continued close monitoring of consumer credit growth, which
would be facilitated by improved data on consumer balance sheets and housing market
developments.
Directors commended the recent successes in building consensus in Mexico to reenergize the reform agenda, and hoped that this success would be extended to other
areas. Directors noted the potential for Mexico to reap large gains—including in
reducing fiscal risks—from an early implementation of reforms of the state-owned oil
sector. Several Directors highlighted the importance of allowing investment partnerships
with other oil companies and investors in the oil sector. Directors also emphasized the
benefits of enhancing competition, especially in such key network sectors as

promote equity.

Public Information Notices (Pins) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, Pins are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
Reader to view this pdf file) for the 2007 Article IV Consultation with Mexico is also available.
