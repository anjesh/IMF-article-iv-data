STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND SECOND POST-PROGRAM MONITORING DISCUSSIONS
December 19, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context: Latvia intends to repay all outstanding obligations to the Fund early, using the
proceeds from an international bond issue in December 2012. The economy continues to
recover strongly. After contracting by 24 percent during the crisis, real GDP growth is set
to exceed 5 percent for the second year in a row in 2012, despite the euro area recession.
Labor market conditions are improving, underpinned by strong job creation, but
unemployment is still high. Underlying inflation and the current account deficit remain
low. After strong fiscal efforts, the budget deficit is set to fall to 1.7 percent of GDP in
2013, well below the Maastricht limit. The outlook is for a continued recovery, albeit at a
somewhat slower pace. The authorities’ objective of euro adoption in 2014 appears within
reach, subject to technical uncertainties.
Challenges: Latvia’s medium-term outlook is favorable, but risks are tilted to the
downside because of the fragile external environment. High short-term external debt and
weak reserve coverage ratios remain a source of vulnerability. Continued
micro-economic reforms are needed to reduce high structural unemployment, preserve
competitiveness and improve growth prospects within a fixed exchange rate regime.
Staff views: The authorities’ plan to adopt the euro in 2014, subject to meeting the
Maastricht criteria, remains justified on economic grounds. The 2013 budget further
cements past fiscal gains, but some of its elements could have been better targeted and
recent changes to social benefits should be reconsidered. Medium-term fiscal
sustainability would be underpinned by expeditious passage of the Fiscal Discipline Law
(FDL). Prefunding of future debt service payments remains appropriate. The rapid increase
in non-resident deposits represents a source of vulnerability and warrants vigilance.
Authorities’ views: The authorities largely concurred with staff’s assessment, despite
some differences on tax and benefit policies. They agreed on the importance of finalizing
structural fiscal reforms, on prefunding debt repayments and on the need to reinforce
bank supervision to contain risks associated with non-resident deposits.

REPUBLIC OF LATVIA

CONTEXT AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Latvia has rebounded vigorously from the crisis, after successfully undertaking a
difficult adjustment program. The defense of Latvia’s peg to the euro required a sustained
internal devaluation, achieved through sharp fiscal consolidation; and a restoration of
competitiveness through declining unit labor costs (Box 1). These efforts were rewarded by restored
external stability, resurgent economic growth, and a successful return to international capital
markets. The country appears well placed to meet the Maastricht criteria for euro adoption. In
December 2012 Latvia successfully issued a US dollar bond, and publicly announced its intention to
repay all outstanding obligations to the Fund ahead of schedule.

A. Strong Recovery Continued Through 2012
2.
Latvia’s economic growth continues to surprise on the upside. Following robust real
GDP growth of 5½ percent in 2011, the momentum has been maintained in 2012 despite
weakening conditions in trading partners. Output expanded by 5.7 percent year-on-year in the first
three quarters of 2012, the fastest rate of growth in the European Union.
3.
The recovery so far has been well balanced between external and domestic demand.
Export performance has held up remarkably well given the external context, growing by 12 percent
in January-September in nominal terms compared with the same period in 2011. This reflects
Latvia’s only partial exposure to the worst performing areas in Europe; the growing ability of Latvian
exporters to access non-traditional markets; continued strong performance of major export product
groups as well as entry into new, high-value-added niche products; and an extraordinary harvest in
a year of high commodity prices. Private consumption and gross fixed capital formation have also
expanded rapidly, on the back of pent-up demand from households and firms that postponed
consumption and investment during the crisis. Higher employment and better margins for firms
have helped finance this activity. Available indicators for the fourth quarter suggest that economic
activity may decelerate somewhat from the strong pace of the third quarter, while nevertheless
remaining strong.
4.
The labor market is improving but unemployment, especially long-term
unemployment, is still high. The unemployment rate decreased to 13.5 percent in the third
quarter of 2012 from 16.2 percent on average in the first half of the year. While this rapid reduction
partly reflects seasonal factors, it is underpinned by strong job creation. Employment grew by
2¾ percent (y-on-y) in the first three quarters of 2012, with the pace of improvement quickening to
3.4 percent in the third quarter. Moreover, this reduction in the unemployment rate occurred in the
context of increasing participation in the labor market, which in the third quarter was almost
2 percentage points higher than a year ago. That said, the share of the long-term unemployed
remains high and stable at about half of the total unemployed. Much of the unemployment is
structural in nature. This is rooted in skill mismatches in the labor market and extensive informal
economy including, reportedly, home production and barter networks, especially in rural areas. Staff
estimates a remaining unemployment gap of about 2¾ percentage points. Real wage growth
remains restrained at about 1½ percent per annum.

Box 1. Ex-Post Evaluation of Latvia’s Stand-By Arrangement: A Summary1
Latvia’s economic boom, which accelerated after EU accession in 2004, proved unsustainable. Large
private inflows fueled rapid growth, inflation accelerated, a real estate bubble developed, and a large current
account deficit opened. By early 2008, growth was leveling off but vulnerabilities turned the slowdown into a
crisis. Capital flows came to a sudden stop as global liquidity tightened. Uncertainty regarding the largest
domestically-owned bank led to a run on its deposits and a system-wide liquidity shortage. These
compounded the concerns over the sustainability of the currency peg.
The Fund approved an SBA for Latvia on December 23, 2008 with exceptional access of 1,200 percent of
quota (SDR 1.5 billion or approximately €1.7 billion) for 27 months, which was extended to 36 months. The
SBA was part of an international effort co-financed and coordinated with the European Union, EBRD, the
World Bank, Nordic countries, and other neighboring countries with total financing of €7.5 billion.
The main objectives of the program were to arrest the liquidity crisis and ensure long-term external
stability, while maintaining the exchange rate peg. The program included measures to stabilize the
financial sector and restore confidence, drawing on front-loaded official external support to bolster foreign
exchange reserves. The program also contained measures to facilitate debt restructuring. For the medium
term, the program included measures to foster real depreciation, including through income policies, and
adjust fiscal policy to limit financing needs and create space to accommodate potentially large contingent
financial sector liabilities. The program contained the explicit exit strategy of euro adoption.
Immediate program objectives were met and progress was made towards longer-term objectives.
Initial uncertainty, including regarding the authorities’ commitment to program objectives, gave way to
better policy implementation and a sharp improvement in financial conditions relative to program
projections, particularly after the first review. The loss of reserves and drain on bank deposits were stemmed
by the third quarter of 2009. Growth resumed by end-2009, earlier than expected. While the economic
contraction and level of unemployment were much larger than initially projected, the turnaround in the
current account was significant and rapid. Of the original €7.5 billion financing package, only €4.5 billion
were drawn. But more remains to be done, as unemployment remains high and output below potential.
The key lessons from the experience of Latvia are:


Strong ownership is critical to successful adjustment and reform. Strong ownership in Latvia was
rooted in general public acceptance of difficult austerity measures.



An explicit and credible exit strategy, euro adoption in Latvia’s case, can help boost confidence and
anchor program objectives.



Strong support by the international community and effective engagement by the private sector were
instrumental. Parent banks maintained their exposures in Latvia, and capitalized their subsidiaries.



The specific conditions prevailing in Latvia that helped internal adjustment are not easily replicable:
low initial public debt, strong ownership, a credible exit strategy, and a large upfront current
account adjustment (which was mainly autonomous). Internal devaluation policies helped relative
price adjustment including in the labor market.



Real-financial linkages play a major role in propagating shocks. In Latvia, the underestimation of
these linkages led to an underestimation of the impact of the financial crisis on real activity.



Flexibility in program design helped ensure that the program achieved its objectives. Fiscal program
design effectively adapted to evidence of a sharper than projected output collapse.

5.
Inflation has fallen sharply. After peaking at about 4¾ percent (year on year) in mid-2011
owing to higher commodity prices and past indirect tax increases, consumer price inflation eased to
1.5 percent by end-November 2012, the lowest level of the last two years (Figure 2). Core inflation
receded from 3¼ percent to almost zero over the same period. Energy price inflation currently
stands at 5.6 percent, less than half the rate observed a year ago.
6.
Past consolidation efforts have brought the headline fiscal deficit well below the
Maastricht criterion. Following a 3.4 percent of GDP fiscal deficit (ESA 95 definition) in 2011, the
original 2012 budget provided for further adjustment of 1.1 percent of GDP. Despite a mid-year cut
in the statutory VAT rate by 1 percentage point, cyclical and broad based revenue over
performance led to a 1.3 percent of GDP upwards revision to tax revenue. However, these gains
were partially offset by the mid-year supplementary budget, which incorporated a 1 percent of GDP
increase in spending on basic health care, road maintenance and pensions, as well as higher
contributions to the EC budget and financing for loss-making hospitals. On balance, staff expects a
headline deficit of 1.8 percent of GDP for 2012—well below the Maastricht criterion of 3 percent of
GDP.

peak of about 19½ percent and now stands at

NPLs. The improvement in the corporate loan portfolio

three-fourths of household loans comprise mortgage
lending). The share of NPLs is now about 11 percent for corporate loans but 16 percent for
household loans. The system-wide capital adequacy ratio now stands at 17.4 percent, well above
the 8 percent regulatory minimum.
8.
Credit to residents is still contracting but will likely level off soon. The balance sheet of
the banking system has shrunk substantially from its pre-crisis peak. Since end-2008 total assets of
the banking sector have decreased by about L3½ billion (15 percent). The nominal stock of loans to
residents is about 30 percent lower. The stock of credit outstanding is still decreasing as some
borrowers, especially households, continue to deleverage. The still negative credit growth also
reflects the ongoing process of dealing with insolvent loans (write-offs) and banks (Parex Bank and
Latvijas Krajbanka were removed from the credit statistics in March and May respectively). Excluding
these effects, loans to residents contracted by 2 percent year-on-year by end September, a

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF LATVIA

leveling-off from the 6 percent rate of contraction at end-2011. Meanwhile, new credit is increasing,
especially to the corporate sector. The volume of new loans to residents granted in the first three
quarters of 2012 was 28 percent higher than in the same period in 2011, and less than 18 percent of
these new loans were to households.
9.
Deleveraging by foreign-owned banks has been large over recent years. Subsidiaries of
foreign banks in Latvia have reduced their liabilities to parent banks by about L3.5 billion since
end-2008; of this, L3.2 billion correspond to deleveraging by Nordic banks (Figure 7). With stable or
increasing deposits over the same period, the loan-to-deposit ratio (LTD) of subsidiaries of foreign
banks has dropped significantly from almost 260 percent to 176 percent. The pace of deleveraging
is still strong. Liabilities to parent banks decreased by 26 percent from end-2010 to end-2011, and
by roughly the same rate in the first three quarters of 2012. However the rate of deleveraging by
Latvian subsidiaries is expected to slow down in the coming quarters, given that the loan portfolio
of these banks has stabilized, resident deposits are growing modestly and outstanding liabilities to
foreign parent banks have declined to about 40 percent of their peak-levels. The recent pace of
deleveraging seems to be driven mainly by the ongoing deleveraging of households and weak
credit demand by firms, rather than funding constraints from abroad. That said, tighter lending
standards applied by the subsidiaries themselves might be playing a non-negligible role.
10.
Non-resident deposits (NRDs) in the banking system have been expanding rapidly
(Appendix I). NRDs in Latvia increased by 19.7 percent in the year to end-September (15.7 percent if
exchange rate effects are excluded), while resident private deposits have grown by only 1.3 percent
over the same period. While NRDs have been historically high in Latvia, they now exceed deposits
of private residents in the banking sector. The recent acceleration is believed to be mainly due to
CIS depositors relocating their funds from countries with banks under stress in the euro area. The
rise in NRDs has been associated with a strong accumulation of foreign assets, mostly liquid assets
such as government securities and claims on MFIs.
11.
The financial regulator (FCMC) found significant undercapitalization in a mid-size
bank specializing in non-resident clients. Negotiations are ongoing with a strategic private
investor who has already contributed to an injection of L8.2 million in fresh capital.

REPUBLIC OF LATVIA

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
12.
Under staff’s baseline scenario, economic activity will ease in 2013, but remain strong
by regional standards.


Export growth, while remaining strong, will decline as the pace of gains from exploiting
new markets diminishes and economic activity in the euro area remains weak, resulting in a
modest widening of the current account deficit. The boost to domestic demand associated
with postponed investment and consumption is projected to diminish gradually. Overall,
output growth is expected to slow down somewhat in the first half of 2013 before
accelerating again in the second half as conditions in trading partners improve. With the
phasing out of base effects that kept growth in 2012 above 5 percent, staff projects growth
to decline to about 3¾ percent in 2013.



Credit to the private sector is projected to resume gradually. In the aftermath of the
crisis productivity growth continued to outstrip wage growth, allowing firms to finance
investment from cash balances. But going forward the gap between productivity and wages
is expected to shrink, and companies will increasingly turn to the banking system for credit.
Nonetheless, credit growth will remain somewhat constrained by the weak equity position
of companies on average and tighter lending standards than before the crisis. Credit to
households will probably keep shrinking for some time as real estate prices are expected to
remain low given the excess housing supply after the boom.



Employment is projected to grow somewhat more slowly over the next few quarters
as the economy approaches its natural rate of unemployment. Employment growth
averaging 1.4 percent is expected in 2013, down from 2.5 percent in 2012. The level of
unemployment is expected to decrease to about 13.7 percent in 2013—still above staff
estimates of the natural unemployment rate of around 12 percent.



Inflation has probably bottomed but is nevertheless expected to remain contained
given a still-negative output gap and high unemployment. Staff projects modest
average consumer price growth of 2.2 percent in 2013.

13.
Over the medium term economic growth should converge to around 4 percent. The
baseline assumes that Latvia adopts the euro in 2014, in line with the authorities’ target.


8

The output gap is expected to close by 2015–16 (see Selected Issues Paper on estimating
potential output). Real GDP growth is projected at about 4.2 percent in 2014–15, based on a
catch-up in business investment, continued recovery of consumption—fueled by an
increase in disposable income due to cumulative improvements in labor market conditions
and planned reductions in the personal income tax (PIT) rate over 2013–15—and a gradual
increase in exports as global external conditions improve. After the effect of the tax cuts
fades away, output growth is expected to average 4 percent per year from 2016 onwards, as
projected productivity improvements are partially offset by a stagnant labor force given

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF LATVIA

demographic trends (Appendix II). Inflation should level off at about 2–2½ percent,
reflecting low projected imported inflation. Higher growth than in trading partners, as well
as the closing output gap, will lead to a modest widening of the current account deficit to
about 3½ percent of GDP deficit in the medium term. This is expected to be financed by a
gradual reduction in the pace of deleveraging by foreign banks, and a conservative pickup
in FDI.
14.
Risks are skewed to the downside. Adverse developments in the euro area could raise
Latvia’s borrowing costs and slow the recovery (text table). Moreover, Latvia’s high external debt
represents a significant vulnerability. According to the external DSA, shock to the baselines for
growth and/or the current account could substantially delay a reduction of the debt burden. That
said, Latvia does have upside potential if it can attract stronger than expected additional foreign
direct investment and create more jobs more quickly; full implementation of a strong
microeconomic reform agenda would make this favorable scenario more likely.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
15.
Discussions centered on prospects for euro adoption; policies to address financial
sector and external vulnerabilities; ensuring fiscal sustainability over the medium term while
protecting the social safety net; and structural reforms to enhance competitiveness.

A. The Path to Euro Adoption
16.
The authorities are strongly committed to euro adoption in 2014—the “exit strategy”
of the 2008-11 IMF-supported program. They intend to request EC and ECB assessments of
Latvia’s convergence, to be prepared in spring 2013. Pending euro adoption, Latvia will maintain its
long-standing peg to the euro, and participation in ERM-2. The authorities are not open to
alternative exchange rate regimes: they chose to maintain the peg through 2008–09 despite severe
external pressures, relying instead on wage and price adjustment.
17.
Despite the euro area crisis, staff continues to believe that given the peg Latvia is
better off inside than outside the euro. Euro adoption would:


Eliminate the risk of speculative attacks against Latvia’s exchange rate. This would benefit
the wider EU as well as Latvia: contagion risks from Latvia to other CEE pegged exchange
rate countries were a major concern in 2008–09.



Address vulnerabilities stemming from foreign currency exposures; the financial system is
already very highly euroized.



Reduce sovereign borrowing costs in a durable way by removing exchange rate premia. Of
course, joining the euro would not eliminate sovereign risk, as evidenced by the
heterogeneity of spreads within the currency union.



Further enhance financial sector stability by giving Latvian banks access to the ECB, which
has greater capacity to provide emergency liquidity.

18.
Latvia appears on track to meet all the Maastricht criteria, subject to uncertainties on
two criteria—inflation and interest rates—whose reference values are not yet determined.
Based on the fiscal outturn so far in 2012, the Maastricht criteria on the fiscal deficit and public debt
should be met comfortably (Figure 8). Prospects for meeting the inflation and interest rates are
more uncertain, since these criteria depend on the EU institutions’ determination of the countries to
be used for the reference value calculation. The current level of inflation is below the Maastricht
reference value and should remain under the projected reference rate at the time of the EC and
ECB’s assessments of Latvian convergence.2 Latvia’s harmonized long-term interest rate is on a
downward path and fell to 3½ percent in October, suggesting that prospects for meeting this
2

REPUBLIC OF LATVIA

criterion in early 2013 are also good. However, the reference values for these criteria depend not
only on price and interest rate developments in other EU countries, but also on the treatment of
outlier countries for the reference value calculations, which makes the outcome particularly
uncertain.3 The authorities expressed concern that under plausible scenarios Latvia’s interest rate
could be compared with that of only one or two countries with abnormally low interest rates due to
their safe-haven status (for example Sweden or Germany). During the mission, representatives from
the EC and the ECB assured the authorities that the criteria would be applied fairly, based on
economic judgment.

in 2014–15, with additional repayments
scheduled in 2014 related to Eurobond debt. The projected reserve level of €5.4 billion at end-2012
is above the standard rule-of-thumb of three months’ import cover. However the level of external
short-term debt is a concern: the maturity profile of external debt is shortening as some banks
receive short-term NRDs while others repay long-term loans to parent banks (deleveraging).
Measures of reserve adequacy that account for Latvia’s large short-term external debt are low,
primarily because of the denominator effect from large NRD deposits. Reserves as a share of
short-term external debt are projected at about 50 percent in 2012. Given Latvia’s own 2008
experience whereby 40 percent of international reserves dissipated due to a substantial fall in NRDs,
a prudent and vigilant stance is needed.
20.
Latvia plans to use the proceeds from a recent bond issue to prepay the Fund in full.
In December 2012 Latvia issued an international US dollar bond that raised $1.25 billion at a low

Monitoring. Staff welcomed both the bond issue and the intention to repurchase Fund obligations,
since the measures lock in current favorable yields and extend the maturity structure of external
debt, thereby helping mitigate concerns about reserve cover.

C. Banking Sector Vulnerabilities
21.
The rapid rise in non-resident deposits in the banking system is a potential source of
vulnerability, with possible implications for Latvia’s liquidity position and reputation
(Appendix I).


Given their short maturity and higher volatility, NRDs are particularly prone to sudden
reversals. This became apparent during the financial crisis, when NRDs fell by 30 percent in
the 12 months following August 2008. Given the size of the sector, a sudden reversal of
NRD flows, and the potential of contagion to resident deposits (largely denominated in
foreign currency), represents a source of vulnerability to international reserves and a
significant contingent fiscal liability (via sovereign backing for the deposit insurance
system). Although banks specializing in non-resident clients allocate a significant share of
their portfolio to liquid foreign assets, the quality and availability of some of these are
harder to verify than for domestic assets (for example, the insolvency of Latvijas Krajbanka
in November 2011 was triggered by the discovery that €140 million of assets in
correspondent accounts were actually encumbered). The authorities recognize the higher
risk of NRDs as a funding source and the potential of contagion to domestic depositors in
the event of severe outflows. But they believe the risk to international reserves is small given
the accumulation of liquid foreign assets by banks experiencing rapid growth in NRD
deposits.



The higher reputational risk associated with non-resident activity represents an additional
source of vulnerability. Staff, the authorities and banks’ managers agree that it is
significantly more difficult to ensure compliance with AML/CFT regulation when dealing
with non-resident clients, and that an incident in an individual institution could spill over to
the reputation of the whole banking system. Staff welcomed the amelioration of previous
deficiencies in AML/CFT regulation, particularly on prevention—as recently reported in the
Council of Europe MONEYVAL report—but stressed the need for risk-based,
comprehensive, and frequent supervision.

22.
The FCMC has appropriately adopted regulatory measures to reflect the higher risks
associated with non-resident activities, and the implementation of Basel III regulation should
maintain this approach.


12

Since mid-2011 the FCMC has required banks that hold either non-resident loans of over
5 percent of total assets or non-resident deposits of over 20 percent of total assets to hold
additional capital. The extra capital requirement ranges from 0.5 to 9 percent of risk
weighted assets, and depends on both the level and growth rate of the exposure to nonresident business. The authorities plan to keep higher capital requirements for non-resident
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF LATVIA

banking when adopting Basel III regulation—either within Pillar II or by applying a capital
add-on to address systemic risk within Pillar I.


Staff and the authorities agreed that the parameterization of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio
(LCR) in the context Basel III implementation should ensure that NRDs are backed by more
liquid assets than other deposits. The FCMC will start monitoring the new liquidity ratios
from January 2013 and plans to deviate from the baseline specification as needed, in
particular by applying higher run-off factors for NRDs.



Given the large contingent fiscal liability associated with NRDs (45 percent of insured
deposits comprise NRDs), staff discussed with the authorities the possibility of charging
NRDs a higher contribution to the Deposit Guarantee Fund (DGF), consistent with the
risk-based pricing of insurance schemes. The authorities argued that the effective premium
charged is indeed higher for NRDs: their average size—and hence average DGF
contribution—is significantly higher than for resident deposits, but the insured amount is
restricted to 100,000 euros in both cases.

23.
Staff welcomed recent steps by the authorities to strengthen the supervision of
banking activities with non-resident clients. The FCMC has amended its off-site and on-site
inspection framework to ensure a deeper focus on the dynamics and quality of banks’ non-resident
assets. Other measures include the more active use of the Pillar II framework to establish minimum
requirements for maturity mismatches between assets and liabilities; and requiring banks to do
periodic liquidity stress-tests based on FCMC prescribed scenarios.
24.
Progress had been made in restructuring the banking sector (Box 2). Staff urged that
the disposal of legacy assets proceed expeditiously, subject to the goal of obtaining value for
taxpayers. Staff recommended that the authorities request a new FSAP to take stock of the
transformation in the financial sector since the previous, pre-crisis FSAP. The authorities welcomed
the suggestion and will consider undertaking an FSAP sometime in 2014.

D. Fiscal Sustainability
25.
The 2013 budget further cements past fiscal gains. Staff project that, taking account of a
2 percentage point redirection of state social contributions to the second pillar, the budget would
achieve a structural improvement of 0.5 percent of GDP, thus complying with both the Maastricht
criteria as well as Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) conditions. In addition to the one percentage
point PIT cut already legislated for 2013, the budget increases tax allowances for dependents, and
extends the range of tax rates on residential property from 0.2 to 1.5 percent while extending more
flexibility to local governments in setting these rates. Additional priority spending is well allocated,
aiming to reduce bottlenecks in health care, reform lower-end teachers’ salaries and support
demographics (see Appendix II). The budget incorporates a recent agreement between the central
and local governments on lowering the maximum level of the Guaranteed Minimum Income (GMI)
while decentralizing its financing, against IMF, World Bank and EC advice.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Box 2. Completing the Restructuring of the Banking Sector
The sale of the commercial part of Mortgage and Land Bank (MLB) is close to completion. The sale of
assets accounting for almost 60 percent of MLB’s commercial activities by book value has been completed.
The sale of the remaining commercial assets, comprising loans to real estate corporates and non-performing
loans, is planned by 2013Q1, but the government has not excluded transferring these assets to the Latvian
Privatization Agency if the price offers are deemed unsatisfactory. Staff agreed with the authorities that
obtaining value for taxpayers is an important objective, while reiterating that the process should continue as
expeditiously as possible.
The authorities are making progress on the strategy to create a single development institution (SDI).
The strategy envisages the merger of MLB’s non-commercial part with other development institutions (the
Latvian Guarantee Agency, Latvian Environmental Investment Fund and the Rural Development Fund) to
form the SDI. A discussion on whether the Ministry of Finance or the Ministry of Economy should be the
shareholder of the SDI is currently delaying further progress. Staff urged that the process be expedited, and
that the SDI operate without a banking license to ensure that it does not enter into commercial activities in
the future.
The sales process for Citadele has been postponed due to weak market conditions, and the
authorities are now planning to modify the restructuring plan. Under new management, the bank has
restructured its operations and increased its profitability. But the prospects of attracting an investor have
been limited by the moribund global M&A market. The government intends to propose a new restructuring
plan to the European Commission aimed at facilitating the sale process and maximizing the recovery for
taxpayers. Its main elements are: i) postponing the original commitment date to sell the wealth management
business, so that it can be sold together with the rest of the bank, thereby preserving the overall
attractiveness of the bank; and ii) allowing partial sales of the State stake in Citadele to attract smaller
investors.
Progress has been made in recovering assets from Latvijas Krajbanka. Krajbanka’s administrator KPMG
has already sold assets and repaid about L90 million to the deposit guarantee fund (DGF). The sale of the
loan portfolio, with a book value of about L160 million, is underway. Final offers for loans grouped in five
bundles will be received by end-January and the authorities expect the sales process to be concluded by the
first quarter of 2013. While the progress to date is encouraging, asset sales will nevertheless be insufficient
to fully compensate payments to depositors by the DGF, of about L340 million. Staff concurred with the
authorities that legal action should be pursued to recover other missing assets in correspondent accounts
(amounting to about L130 million).
As the DGF was depleted after Krajbanka’s failure, staff discussed plans to replenish the fund with the
FCMC. Deposit insurance premia have been raised by 50 percent. A proposal to extend the period of
increased contributions is being considered; under current legislation higher contributions can only be
charged for one year after the DGF covers deposits.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF LATVIA

26.
Staff expressed broad support for the budget, while urging reconsideration of
changes to the GMI benefit. Social exclusion benefits in Latvia are already among the lowest in
Europe, and should not be cut further. Moreover, there is a danger that under the decentralized
scheme some income-constrained local governments will be unable to provide even the reduced
benefit levels in full, and over time this could cause regional disparities in provision. Staff
recommended instead that a broader reform of social assistance programs and benefits be
undertaken following the recommendations of a World Bank study due in Spring 2013. The
authorities were more sanguine about the ability of local governments to fund the decentralized
GMI, but indicated that they may revisit the subject when the World Bank study is completed.
27.
Over the medium term, staff and the authorities agreed on the need to take
advantage of the ongoing recovery to continue building fiscal space. Fiscal policy will need to
contend with several headwinds, including: preapproved personal income tax (PIT) cuts, which total
5 percentage points over 2013–15; restored indexation of paid-out pensions as of 2014; a gradual
reduction in SOEs payout ratios from the current 90 percent level; second-pillar pension
contributions, which are further increased over 2015–16 until they reach 6 percent; and increasing
social insurance benefits for high-earners while restoring the ceiling on social contributions.
Compensatory measures will be needed to ensure continued reduction in the structural fiscal
balances in line with the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP).
28.
Staff urged reconsideration of the planned PIT cuts, at least from 2014 onwards. The
large cumulative size of the proposed cuts implies an excessive loss of fiscal space and a
correspondingly greater need for compensatory measures. While some reduction in the tax wedge
on labor would be desirable, untargeted cuts in the statutory PIT rate are not first-best from an
efficiency or equity perspective: better options would be to introduce a two-tier PIT system5; to
increase the minimum non-taxable allowance; and/or, in conjunction with the social assistance
reform, to introduce an earned income tax credit program. The authorities however regard the tax
cuts as an essential component of improving work incentives and addressing the informal economy,
and prefer to focus on other measures to ensure fiscal sustainability.
29.
A broad range of revenue and expenditure reforms would help in building fiscal space
while protecting the most vulnerable sections of society.


Revenue: A reform of the cadastre of properties to facilitate corrections and ensure fair and
consistent valuations across regions should be followed by an increase in the lower bound
for tax rates on property, while ensuring progressivity to protect the poorest. Reducing tax
exemptions for dependents in conjunction with reforming state family benefits would
increase progressivity of the family support programs. Other revenue reform options
include reducing the tax allowance for pensions, eliminating exemptions on indirect taxes

5

For example, in line with previous FAD technical advice, a two tier system could consist of two rates: 25 percent
(the current rate in 2012), and 15 percent for lower income taxpayers. The threshold income could be chosen such
that the measure is revenue enhancing compared to the current plan of an across the board cut.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

REPUBLIC OF LATVIA

such as the diesel exemption for farmers and increasing the revenue from environmental
taxes to correct for negative externalities.


Expenditure: Spending reforms should focus on improving the economic incentives
stemming from public spending programs. Public transport subsidies could be reduced
while designing a well-targeted cash transfer to compensate the poor for price increases.
Family and child benefits, and non-contributory supplemental pensions, should be better
targeted to ensure equality both within and across cohorts. Reducing the duration of
parental, maternity and paternity benefits, while supporting child care could yield further
savings while improving labor market efficiency. Without committing to reforms in any
specific area, the authorities acknowledged the need to consider a broad range of possible
measures.

30.
A series of structural fiscal reforms is in the pipeline. The Law on Budget and Financial
Management sets binding ceilings on central government spending for 3 years, which were
approved together with the 2013 budget. Passing the Fiscal Discipline Law (FDL) and related
constitutional amendments should now be given the highest priority. These would enhance fiscal
sustainability going forward by avoiding pro-cyclical fiscal policies and ensuring the consistency of
expenditure ceilings with both structural balance and expenditure growth rules. The authorities
indicated that the FDL is pending in parliament and could be passed as early as January 2013. The
authorities also pointed to progress in other structural areas, such as recent measures by the State
Revenue Service (SRS) to terminate fictitious companies and restrict the activities of persons
involved; to limit cash transactions; and to eliminate transactions designed to avoid income tax.
Moreover, the SRS has embarked on a medium-term strategy to increase audit coverage.

E. Structural Reforms to Enhance Competitiveness
31.
Latvia’s competitiveness has been improving steadily. Staff assess that the exchange
rate is now broadly in line with fundamentals (Box 3). Latvia continues to gain market share in world
imports—increasing its presence in established markets, but also penetrating new ones—helped by
the continuing depreciation of the REER. Nonetheless, staff calculations—albeit subject to a wide
range of uncertainty—suggest a modest remaining competitiveness gap of about 4.6 percent,
which would need to be addressed through structural policies. The authorities concurred with staff
on the need for continuing micro-economic reforms to bring down the stubbornly high rate of
structural unemployment and enhance competitiveness within the fixed exchange rate regime.
32.
While Latvia’s labor market demonstrated remarkable flexibility during the crisis,
there remains scope to promote work incentives. Several fiscal reforms should be considered
from this perspective. The guaranteed minimum income (GMI) benefit—which currently phases out
one-for-one with income—places a very high tax wedge for GMI recipients entering employment.
Consideration should be given to reducing the benefit more gradually with rising income levels.
Staff further urged shifting active labor market policies towards in-work tax credits and benefits, as
these have proven to be effective in increasing employment of lower skilled workers. Reducing the

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF LATVIA

duration of family benefits while enhancing formal child care would also support labor force
participation.
33.

The authorities have developed plans in a number of bottleneck areas:



Judicial reform: The authorities are seeking to address delays in the civil court system.
Logistical measures include videoconferencing to speed up witness testimony, and
publication of anonymized court decisions to promote transparency. Staff welcomed these
and other measures to promote judicial efficiency. Meanwhile, measures to curb abuses of
the insolvency framework remain under discussion. Staff urged retention of the single
“cash-flow” test for insolvency—an international best practice introduced in the 2010
reform of the law (with LEG technical assistance)—but supported efforts to improve
implementation.



State-owned enterprises (SOEs): In May 2012, the government conceptually approved the
introduction of a new, partially centralized institution to oversee SOE governance and
enhance their financial reporting. But agreement on the necessary legislation remains
pending. Meanwhile, a technical-level working group is reviewing each SOE to consider its
future status.



Higher and vocational education: The authorities acknowledge that the quality of higher
education is lagging behind neighboring countries, with very limited resources being thinly
spread over a large number of institutions, and student numbers falling. And vocational
study programs have become increasingly misaligned with labor market needs. However,
proposals to concentrate resources according to course quality in higher education are
encountering strong stakeholder resistance.

Box 3. Latvia: External Stability Assessment
Application of the CGER methodology suggests that the real exchange rate is broadly in line with
fundamentals, with estimates varying depending on the approach used:
 The Macroeconomic Balance (MB) and the External Sustainability (ES) approaches suggest a
real exchange rate close to equilibrium—the deviation ranges between 0 and -2.1 percent
respectively. The MB results are premised on staff’s baseline assumption of closing the output gap by
2017; a slower speed of recovery could imply greater real overvaluation. The ES estimate, in addition to
being sensitive to the output gap assumption, hinges also on the level at which the NFA-to-GDP ratio is
stabilized, which in the current analysis is fixed at the previous year’s value. Stabilizing the NFA-to-GDP
ratio at a smaller ratio would imply less real undervaluation.
 A third methodology, the equilibrium real exchange rate approach (ERER), suggests an
overvaluation of around 15 percent. However, this estimate is extremely sensitive to the sample
period—changing the sample period or selecting an ad hoc equilibrium year for the REER can swing the
misalignment estimate by over 10 percent.

The results remain subject to high levels of uncertainty. The Latvian economy has experienced profound
structural changes, and in the current account balance has been characterized by extreme volatility: peaking
at a deficit above 20 percent of GDP in 2007, swinging to a surplus of nearly 9 percent of GDP in 2009, and
then stabilizing at a small deficit in 2011–12.
Alternative measures of competitiveness point to significant improvements:
The REER depreciated dramatically during the crisis and has continued to do so although at a slower
pace. By the second quarter of 2012 the ULC-based REER had depreciated by over 9 percent since end2009. The PPI- and CPI-based REERs depreciated by over 6 percent to July and September 2012,
respectively.

ago Latvia’s exports have diversified away from the wood and apparel sectors and into new, likely higher

ranking in the top ten for exports) have increased as a share of total exports, pointing to the emergence
of small niche products, as also suggested by various government and private sector representatives.
Relative to its Baltic neighbors, Latvia’s export share to traditional European markets has fallen more

All the above results suggest an improvement in Latvia’s competitive position over the past two
years, but with further structural reforms still needed. During the 2010 Article IV consultation, staff had
estimated the competitiveness gap at about 10 percent (based on end-2009 data). This update suggests a
partial closing of the gap, consistent with continued depreciation of the REER (in CPI, PPI and ULC terms),
and greater market and product diversification of the export base since that time.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
Latvia’s economy has been recovering strongly. Economic growth is expected to exceed
5 percent in 2012 despite recession in the euro area. Inflation has fallen sharply, in the context of a
still negative output gap. The unemployment rate is declining despite an increasing labor
participation rate. But the level of unemployment—most of which is structural in nature—remains
unacceptably high.
35.
Economic growth is expected to weaken slightly in 2013, before picking up in the
medium term. Credit to the private sector is projected to resume gradually, with lending to
businesses picking up earlier than lending to households. The output gap is expected to close by
2015–16, with inflation leveling off at about 2–2½ percent. The current account deficit should widen
modestly while remaining well within sustainable bounds. But risks are skewed to the downside. In
particular, adverse developments in the euro area could derail the recovery and raise Latvia’s
borrowing costs.
36.
Euro adoption in 2014 appears within reach, subject to some technical uncertainties.
On the basis of fiscal outturns so far this year and the 2013 budget approved by parliament, the
general government deficit and debt for 2012–13 would be below their respective Maastricht
reference values. Inflation and interest rates have declined to low levels, although the reference
values for these criteria are yet to be determined by the European institutions. On balance, euro
adoption continues to make economic sense for Latvia. It would remove residual currency risk and,
by addressing vulnerabilities stemming from foreign-currency exposures, enhance the stability of
the already very highly euroized financial system.
37.
With the 2012 budget deficit coming in at under 2 percent of GDP, the 2013 budget
further cements fiscal gains. It should be consistent with both the Maastricht deficit criterion and
the Stability and Growth Pact. Additional priority spending is well distributed, addressing some of
the bottlenecks in health and reforming lower end teachers’ salaries. However, the cuts to and
decentralization of the guaranteed minimum benefit could adversely affect the most vulnerable
segment of society. This measure should be reconsidered—and on the basis of the forthcoming
World Bank study—replaced with benefit reforms consistent with both improving incentives to
work and ensuring adequate safety net coverage.
38.
The authorities should take advantage of the ongoing recovery to continue building
fiscal space over the medium term. Large planned cumulative cuts in the PIT rate should be
reconsidered: better options could include a two-tier system or an increase in the minimum
non-taxable allowance. Compensatory measures will be needed to maintain the fiscal momentum in
the face of this and other headwinds (such as restored indexation of pensions, partial restoration of
second pillar pension contributions and the lowering of required dividend ratios for SOEs).
39.
The rapid increase of non-resident deposits (NRDs) in the banking system warrants
vigilance. While the expansion of NRDs is associated with an accumulation of foreign assets, the
increasing size of the sector represents a source of vulnerability to international reserves and—
20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF LATVIA

given sovereign backing for the deposit guarantee scheme—a significant contingent fiscal liability.
The FCMC’s current and planned prudential measures to guard against such risks are welcome. The
supervision of NRD-specialized banks should be sufficiently intensive and frequent.
40.
Gross reserves are low in relation to short-term external debt. The maturity profile of
external debt is shortening as some banks receive short-term NRDs while others repay long-term
loans to parent banks (deleveraging). In this context, the recent successful international bond
issue—part of which will be used to prepay outstanding obligations to the Fund—is welcome. It
extends the maturity profile of external debt while locking in current favorable yields.
41.
Maintaining the momentum on structural reforms will help underpin Latvia’s
medium-term fiscal sustainability, competitiveness, and growth prospects. In the fiscal area,
the Fiscal Discipline Law would reduce the risks of pro-cyclical policy from re-emerging in the
future. Other high priorities areas include reforms to the judicial system, to address court system
delays and curb abuses of the insolvency framework; the governance structure and transparency of
SOEs; and the quality of higher and vocational education. Timely implementation of planned
reforms would result in a significantly better business environment, in turn improving prospects for
sustainably higher investment, employment, and living standards.
42.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

1/ The coverage refers to the general government; gros s debt is us ed throughout.
2/ Derived as [(r - (1+g  - g + (1+r]/(1+g++g)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interes t rate;  = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;  = s hare of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and  = nom inal exchange rate depreciation (meas ured by increas e in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interes t rate contribution is derived from the denom inator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as (1+r).
5/ For projections , this line includes exchange rate changes .
6/ Defined as public s ector deficit, plus amortization of m edium and long-term public s ector debt, plus s hort-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interes t rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nom inal interes t expenditure divided by previous period debt s tock.
9/ As s umes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows ) remain at the level of the las t projection year.

1/ Shaded areas represent actual data. Individual shocks are permanent one-half standard deviation shocks.
Figures in the boxes represent average projections for the respective variables in the baseline and scenario being
presented. Ten-year historical average for the variable is also shown.
2/ For historical scenarios, the historical averages are calculated over the ten-year period, and the information is
used to project debt dynamics five years ahead.
3/ Permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and primary balance.
4/ One-time real depreciation of 30 percent and 10 percent of GDP shock to contingent liabilities occur in 2010,
with real depreciation defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local
currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).

1/ Derived as [r - g -  (1+g) +  (1+r)]/(1+g+ +g  ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; = change in domestic GDP deflator in euro terms,
g = real GDP growth rate,  = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and  = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [- (1+g(1+r1+g+ +g ) times previous period debt stock. increases with an appreciating domestic currency (> 0) and rising
inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at
their levels of the last projection year.

Appendix I. The Non-Resident Banking Sector in Latvia
The financial sector in Latvia is dominated by commercial banks, with a strong foreign
presence. Commercial banks’ assets accounted for almost 90 percent of total assets in the financial
sector and 150 percent of GDP at end-2001. There are 20 commercial banks—including
8 subsidiaries of foreign banks from Sweden, Norway, Austria, Russia and Ukraine—and 8 foreign
bank branches in Latvia.
The banking sector is segmented between banks dealing with domestic clients and banks
dealing with non-resident clients (NR banks). This split in business models is to a large extent
correlated with bank ownership. In broad terms, the subsidiaries of Nordic banks and the branches
of foreign banks deal with resident clients while the other banks focus on non-resident clients.
NRDs account for: more than 70 percent of deposits for 2/3 of local banks; more than 60 percent of
deposits for all non-Nordic subsidiaries; and less than 10 percent of deposits for all but one branch
of foreign banks and for all Nordic subsidiaries.
A large fraction of foreign depositors are from CIS countries. As of end-September 2012, about
1/3 of NRDs were from EU countries, 12 percent from CIS countries (70 percent of them from
Russia) and 55 percent from other non-EU jurisdictions. The latter, however, corresponds largely to
offshore companies from jurisdictions such as the British Virgin Islands and Belize, whose ultimate
beneficial owners are mostly CIS residents. Also, 58 and 25 percent of EU deposits are from the U.K.
and Cyprus respectively, but the ultimate owners are mainly CIS residents. Overall, 80 to 90 percent
of NRDs are estimated to come from CIS countries. CIS depositors have historically found Latvia
attractive as a provider of banking services for a number of reasons: (i) its geographical location; (ii)
widespread fluency in Russian; and (iii) efficient and competitively priced banking services.
Banks specialized in non-resident clients constitute a

as specialized in non-resident clients if NRDs represent more than 20 percent of its assets. While
the size of the non-resident segment in Latvia has always been large, it is expanding at a rapid pace.
In the 12 months to end-September 2012 NRDs increased by 19.7 percent (15.7 percent if exchange
rate effects are excluded). The recent acceleration is believed to be mainly due to CIS depositors
relocating their funds from countries with banks under stress in the euro area, mainly Cyprus.
Another potential driver of recent NRD flows is the fact that since mid-2010 Latvia grants EU
residency permits to foreigners investing at least L200,000 in the form of subordinated debt of a
credit institution (other eligibility criteria include investment in real estate or in nonfinancial
companies). But this factor seems to have played a minor role, as only about L50 million in
investment (out of L290 million) claimed for obtaining EU residency permits were made in the
banking sector.
A large share of NR banks’ assets is invested abroad. The share of foreign assets in NR banks’
total assets is about 55 percent, while it is only 12 percent for banks dealing with residents. More
than 90 percent of these assets are issued by counterparts in the European Economic Area
(EEA, 62 percent), CIS countries (18 percent) and the U.S. and Canada (13 percent).


Almost half of total foreign assets held by NR
banks are claims on foreign MFIs, 80 percent of
which are from EEA countries (of which banks from
Germany, Austria, the U.K. and Switzerland
account for 77 percent).



Foreign loans account for about ¼ of NR banks’
foreign assets. About 70 percent of these are
granted to clients from CIS countries, either

The rather rapid increase in NRDs in NR banks has
been associated with an accumulation of liquid foreign
assets. While NRDs in banks dealing with non-resident
clients increased by almost L1.4 billion between 2008 and
2012, their portfolio of foreign assets expanded by L1.2
billion, most of which is invested in liquid assets. Claims on

securities account for more than 90 percent of the foreign
assets accumulated over the last 4 years. Foreign loans, instead, are at essentially the same level as
in 2008.
Consequently, NR banks have become more detached from the domestic economy. Domestic
assets held by NR banks have decreased by L0.5 billion between 2008 and 2012 (while total assets
increased by 0.7 billion). Loans to residents granted by NR banks decreased by almost L1 billion
over the same period.
NR banks have smaller capital buffers than the rest, but are subject to higher minimums.
While the average capital adequacy ratio of banks dealing with residents has increased from about
10 percent in 2007 to close to 20 percent in 2011, it has increased from slightly above 10 percent to
about 15 percent for banks dealing with non-residents. NR banks face higher minimum levels,
though: since mid-2011 the FCMC requires these banks to hold extra capital (from 0.5 to 9 percent
of risk weighted assets) depending on the exposure of each bank to the non-resident business, and
the growth rate of this exposure.

Appendix II. Latvia’s Demographic Challenge
Latvia’s population is shrinking rapidly. During 2000–11, the population declined by about 14 percent
(340 thousand people). Emigration was responsible for about ⅔ of this decline while natural change due
to low fertility accounted for the remainder:


Emigration: an estimated 200–215 thousand people, mainly young people—roughly 9 percent of the
population—have left Latvia during 2000-11 (Hazans, 20111; and Central Statistics Bureau); and



Low fertility: the decline of the population for natural reasons was about 125–140 thousand people
(5 percent of the population). The number of births has halved since the early 1990s—from around
40,000 annual births to around 20,000—falling below replacement levels.

Demographic decline is not merely an economic issue, but is more broadly perceived as an
important national concern. On economic grounds alone, emigration may enhance welfare (in
expectation) in the short-term as it is an alternative to unemployment, reduces unemployment insurance
costs, and may increase the inflow of remittances. However, in the long term, emigration and
demographic decline have negative economic consequences for the country, including to human capital,
public finances, and pension schemes. For a small country like Latvia (about 2 million inhabitants),
excessive emigration is unsustainable. The authorities are engaged in the difficult task of seeking to
reverse incentives to emigrate and encourage the return of expatriates.

Emigration tends to slow down substantially with economic recovery. The largest episodes of
emigration in the past decade occurred during the Russian crisis in the early 2000’s and the global
financial crisis in 2008–10 (see chart). In this latter period net emigration was about four times larger than
it was during the boom in 2005–07. The contraction in labor demand during the crisis and consequent
layoffs led unemployed workers to seek job opportunities abroad (the preferred destinations in 2011 for

over ⅘ of emigrants were countries inside the European Union, notably Germany, the UK, and Ireland).
Net emigration declined sharply in 2011, and is likely to fall further as the economy continues to rebound.
It is less clear whether it will turn negative; inference is difficult based on the short and shock-filled
empirical record. The authorities are optimistic that net emigration can be curbed, and surveys indicate
that 20 percent of emigrants plan to return within 5 years (Hazans, 2011). On the other hand, given the
large income gap between Latvia and preferred emigration destinations, some component of net
emigration is likely to be structural and thus less amenable to reversal.
The policies with the most traction to discourage emigration are pro-growth policies, those
favoring income convergence and factor price equalization over time, which are desirable in their own
right. Measures such as facilitating immigration by other nationalities have less political support.
Ministers have publicly encouraged expatriate Latvians to return home, but recognize that labor is mobile
within the EU.
Given the general nature of remedies for emigration, the more specific policy focus has been on
increasing birth rates. The draft National Development Plan 2014–20 (NDP) sets “a stable basis for
demographic growth” as a strategic objective. The 2013 budget includes a variety of family-related
measures:


Health care – compensation for prescription medicines for mothers and children, extended access
to medical services, and compensation for treatment of reproductive health.



Tax policy – extended income tax allowance for dependents.



Social support – extended cash transfers for children aged 0–1.5 years, higher floor and ceiling for
parental benefits, and new cash transfer to families to facilitate access to kindergarten services.

Available evidence on the drivers of fertility rates, although scant, favors supporting formal child
care. In principle, fiscal policy can help families to reduce the costs of children while also influencing
preferences on the size of family. But this can occur only when the policy support is sufficiently large,
consistent, and appropriately designed. Political pressure for universal rather than means-tested transfers
could increase the risk of poorly targeted, fiscally costly measures that fall short of achieving their
objective. More specifically, the available evidence indicates that:


Availability of formal childcare has an unambiguously positive effect on fertility rates, whether
through childcare subsidies and enrollment, part-time employment or control over working time.



Duration and payment of parental leave has an ambiguous effect on fertility, conditional on
employment. Home- or childcare leave benefits that are not earnings related can have positive effect
on fertility, especially among low-income families (e.g. Finland).



Financial transfers can have a small and positive but usually temporary effect on fertility rates: they
may induce earlier decisions to have children without significantly affecting overall fertility. Transfers

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF LATVIA

typically do not affect opportunity costs and cover only a small part of the direct costs, but can affect
the fertility of low-income households.
Demographic policies must navigate a delicate balance between boosting fertility, containing
disincentives for labor force participation, and reducing inequalities among beneficiaries. Personal
income tax allowances for children can be regressive, as unemployed and low-income families may not
have enough income to benefit from the allowance. Similar support could more effectively be provided
through child benefits. At the same time family oriented support in Latvia (both contributory and noncontributory) has been found to be poorly targeted. Therefore, priority should be given to means-testing
all child allowances. Empirical evidence suggests that high levels and durations of parental benefits can
disincentivize work: long paid leaves in particular can result in deteriorating skills. The best options for
reconciling family and work incentives lie in policies promoting child care; the OECD countries with the
highest female employment rates today are also the ones with high fertility rates. The recent literature
has documented a significant negative elasticity of female labor supply with respect to the cost of child
care of around -0.13 to -0.2. This implies that policies to reduce the cost of child care for families could
achieve the dual goal of increasing fertility and promoting work incentives. In-work tax credits—desirable
in their own right as conducive to greater low-skilled employment—could also help mitigate fertility
decline if conditioned on the presence of children in the household.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:

The currency of Latvia is the lats, which was introduced in March 1993 to replace the Latvian ruble.
The exchange rate was pegged to the SDR from February 1994 to December 2004, within a
±1 percent band. On January 1, 2005, the lats was repegged to the euro at the rate €1=0.702804 lats,
and on April 29, 2005, Latvia entered ERM II, maintaining the previous band width. Exchange
restrictions maintained for security reasons have been notified to the Fund for approval most recently
in March 2011 (see EBD/11/11, March 11, 2011).
VIII. Previous Article IV Consultation:
The 2010 Article IV staff report was published on December 9, 2010 (IMF Country Report No. 10/356).
The previous Article IV Board discussion took place on July 21, 2010. The Public Information Notice
No. 10/104 was released on August 12, 2010.
IX.

Safeguards Assessment:

The safeguards assessment completed on July 8, 2009 concluded that the Bank of Latvia (BoL)
operates robust internal audit and control systems. The assessment recommended clarifying the
respective roles of the BoL and the Treasury in holding, managing, and reporting to the Fund audited
international reserves data. It also recommended amendments to the mandate of the BoL’s audit
committee and improvements to the financial statements' disclosures. The authorities have already
taken steps to implement these recommendations, notably by establishing a formal arrangement
between the BoL and the Treasury, revising the audit committee charter and expanding the existing
accounting framework.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
1.
General: Data provision to the Fund is adequate for surveillance purposes. Latvia is a subscriber of the
SDDS (Special Data Dissemination Standard) and a link to Latvia’s metadata is available at the IMF’s website for
the DSBB (Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board).
2.
National Accounts: The CSB compiles and publishes quarterly national accounts with the production
and expenditure approaches on a regular and timely basis. Since September 2011, national accounts are
calculated with the NACE rev. 2 classification, determined by the European Commission. However, there are
discrepancies between the GDP estimates based on production and those based on expenditure. The
statistical discrepancy is included in changes in inventories on the expenditure side.
The underlying data for the production approach are obtained primarily through a survey of
businesses and individuals, and are supplemented by data from labor force surveys and administrative sources.
The CSB believes that the basic data understate economic activity, particularly in the private sector, and there is
an ongoing effort to increase coverage. Additional data for the expenditure-based accounts are obtained from
household budget surveys and other surveys from the State Treasury and ministries.
3.
Government finance statistics: Fund staff is provided quarterly with monthly information on
revenues and expenditures of the central and local governments and special budgets. With some limitations,
the available information permits the compilation of consolidated accounts of the general government. The
Government Finance Statistics database in the IMF’s eLibrary website contains cash data in the GFSM 2001
format. Quarterly general government data on an accrual basis are provided through Eurostat for the
International Financial Statistics on a timely basis.
4.
Monetary statistics: Monetary statistics could provide more detail in the liabilities of depository
corporations by subsectors of the general government in line with international standards.
5.
Balance of payments: The BoL assumed responsibility for compiling the balance of payments
statistics from the CSB in early 2000. The data collection program is a mixed system, with surveys
supplemented by monthly information from the international transactions reporting system (ITRS), and
administrative sources. Contrary to international standards—but similar to a number of other EU countries—
the BoL includes provisions for expected losses of foreign-owned banks. Between Q4 2008–Q2 2010, this
treatment led to the recording of negative reinvested earnings (i.e., losses) of foreign-owned banks as negative
outflows. These “inflows” in the income account of the balance of payments thus gave a positive contribution
to the current account.
6.
Data Standards and Quality: Latvia is a participant in the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard
since November 1, 1996. A Data ROSC was published in June 2004.
7.
Reporting to STA: The authorities are reporting data for the Fund’s International Financial Statistics,
Government Finance Statistics Yearbook, the Direction of Trade Statistics, and the Balance of Payments
Statistics Yearbook.

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation and Second
Post-Program Monitoring Discussions, and Ex-Post Evaluation of
Exceptional Access Under the 2008 Stand-By Arrangement with the
Republic of Latvia
On January 23, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the 2012 Article IV consultation 1and the Second Post-Program Monitoring Discussions 2, and the
Ex-Post Evaluation of Exceptional Access Under the 2008 Stand-By Arrangement 3 with the
Republic of Latvia.
Background
Latvia continues to rebound vigorously from the deep downturn in 2008–09, despite recession in
the euro area. Real GDP growth of 5.5 percent in 2011 and 5.7 percent in the first three quarters
of 2012 was underpinned by both external and domestic demand. Strong job creation has
resulted in falling unemployment, but the unemployment rate remains high at about
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return
to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.
2

Post-Program Monitoring provides for more frequent consultations between the Fund and members
whose arrangement has expired but that continue to have Fund credit outstanding, with a particular
focus on policies that have a bearing on external viability. There is a presumption that members
whose credit outstanding exceeds 200 percent of quota would engage in Post-Program Monitoring.
3

The requirement for ex post evaluations (EPEs) was agreed by the IMF Executive Board in
September 2002 for members using exceptional access in capital account crises, and extended to any
use of exceptional access in February 2003. The purpose of the EPE is to provide a critical and frank
discussion of whether justifications presented at the outset of the arrangement—including the
justification for exceptional access—were consistent with Fund policies and to review performance
under the Fund-supported program.

2

15 percent, and half of the unemployed have been out of work for more than a year. Consumer
price inflation has declined sharply from its peak, averaging [2.4] percent in 2012. Robust export
growth is expected to keep the current account deficit at about 2 percent despite recovering
import demand. Latvia has successfully returned to international markets.
As a result of fiscal consolidation measures over the last 4 years, Latvia reduced its general
government deficit from nearly 10 percent of GDP in 2009 (ESA 95 definition) to 3.4 percent of
GDP in 2011. Despite a 1 percentage point mid-year reduction in the statutory VAT rate and a
supplementary budget containing additional expenditures, revenue over performance helped
reduce the deficit to below 2 percent of GDP in 2012. The 2013 budget further cements past fiscal
gains and should be consistent with both the Maastricht deficit criterion and the Stability and
Growth Pact.
The banking system returned to profitability in 2011 and is well capitalized. Credit to residents has
contracted substantially since the onset of the crisis, but the rate of contraction has been
declining and is likely to level off soon. Non-resident deposits (NRDs) in the banking system—a
potential source of vulnerability to international reserves—have been expanding rapidly, but to a
large extent this process has been matched by an accumulation of liquid foreign assets.
The government aims at euro adoption in 2014. The country is well-positioned to meet all the
Maastricht criteria in 2013. Joining the euro would remove residual currency risk, adding stability
to the Latvian economy.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They welcomed Latvia’s early
repayment of all outstanding obligations to the Fund following the successful international bond
issuance, which reflects renewed confidence in the economy and the authorities’ policies. The
economy continues to recover strongly, inflation has fallen sharply, and the current account deficit
is modest. While the medium-term economic outlook is favorable, risks are tilted to the downside
because of the uncertain external environment. Directors emphasized the need for continued
strong policies to safeguard financial stability, tackle persistently high structural unemployment,
and strengthen potential growth.
Directors commended the authorities’ remarkable fiscal adjustment and welcomed that the 2013
budget appropriately consolidates the fiscal gains, holding the budget deficit well below the
Maastricht criterion. They called for sustaining measures to build fiscal space and avoid the
resurgence of imbalances. Directors urged the authorities to keep the lowering of the Guaranteed
Minimum Benefit and the decentralization of its financing under close review to ensure that the
system continues to provide adequate support to the most vulnerable and avoids deepening
regional disparities. They welcomed the authorities’ readiness to reconsider the issue in light of
the upcoming World Bank report. While some Directors saw merit in the planned cuts to the
personal income tax in order to improve work incentives, others urged caution given concerns

3
about equity and fiscal space, and highlighted the need for compensatory measures. Directors
agreed that structural fiscal reforms, including timely passage and effective implementation of the
Fiscal Discipline Law, will be crucial to strengthening fiscal sustainability.

Directors noted that the banking system continues to recover. However, the rapid increase of
non-resident deposits (NRDs) warrants vigilance, given that it represents a source of vulnerability
to international reserves and a contingent fiscal liability. Directors welcomed higher minimum
capital requirements for NRD-specialized banks, and recommended continued intensive and
frequent supervision. Directors looked forward to completion of the banking sector restructuring,
and noted that a new FSAP would be useful to take stock of the transformation since the crisis.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ strong commitment to euro adoption and commended the
progress towards meeting the Maastricht criteria. They noted however that continued strong
implementation of structural reforms will be necessary to address high structural unemployment
and enhance competitiveness. Priorities for action are reforms to the judicial system, the
governance structure and transparency of state-owned enterprises, and the quality of higher and
vocational education.
Directors agreed with the conclusions of the ex post evaluation. They concurred that the
immediate program objectives were achieved and that important progress was made in meeting
longer-term objectives. Key supporting elements included strong ownership by the authorities,
significant support by the international community, including a large financing package, effective
engagement by the private sector, an explicit and credible exit strategy, and a flexible program
design. Directors also agreed that the case of Latvia shows the importance of adequately
accounting for real-financial linkages in estimating the impact of financial stress on real activity
and in program design.
Ex-Post Evaluation
The economic boom in Latvia that began in 2000 and accelerated following accession to the
European Union in 2004 proved unsustainable. Large private sector inflows fueled rapid
economic growth driven mainly by domestic demand in the nontradeable sector. Inflation
accelerated, a real estate bubble developed, and a large current account deficit opened. The
accompanying increase in foreign indebtedness, which financed domestic credit expansion, led to
the buildup of vulnerabilities particularly in the banking sector and heightened financial account
risks.
By early 2008, the fast growth was leveling off but severe vulnerabilities turned the slowdown into
a crisis. Capital flows came to a sudden stop as global liquidity tightened. Uncertainty regarding
the financial condition of the largest domestically-owned bank led to a run on its deposits and a
severe system-wide liquidity shortage. These pressures were compounded by concerns over the
sustainability of the currency peg. In November, the authorities turned to the IMF and the
European Commission for financial support to avert a systemic bank failure, prevent further
decline in international reserves that could threaten the sustainability of the peg, and address the

4

deterioration in the fiscal position in the face of the decline in economic activity. The Stand-By
Arrangement (SBA) was approved in December 2008 with an exceptional access of SDR 1.52
billion, equivalent to 1,200 percent of quota—one of the largest in Fund history at the time, with
significant co-financing from other partners including the European Union and regional partners.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat

Statement by the Staff Representative on the Republic of Latvia
January 23, 2013

1.
This statement summarizes developments in Latvia since the issuance of the staff
report (EBS/12/167). The additional information does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Latvia repaid all outstanding obligations to the Fund on December 20, 2012. The
repurchase amounted to SDR 603.038 million (about €714.3 million) and covered obligations under
the 2008-11 SBA program. This development was prefigured in the staff report. All tables and
charts in the staff report already incorporate the repayment, unless otherwise specified.

Statement by Mr. Benny Andersen, Executive Director,
and Mr. Gundars Davidsons, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director
on the Republic of Latvia
January 23, 2013
On behalf of the Latvian authorities, we thank staff for the excellent analysis provided in the
reports and the selected issues papers. The Latvian authorities have always given careful
consideration to policy recommendations coming from the Fund. Also this time, the
authorities and staff had fruitful discussions and staff provided a valuable insight on the
economy's risks and challenges. Though the views differed on some minor points, the
Latvian authorities broadly agree with the views outlined in the Article IV/PPM and Ex-Post
Evaluation reports. In the following few paragraphs we will try to convey the authorities’
views on various subjects discussed during the staff visits.
Economic outlook
Still riding the wave generated by the Latvian authorities’ decisive actions of 2009/2010
the economy continued to surprise on the upside. Despite the headwinds from the
sovereign debt crisis and the still-ongoing deleveraging, the slowdown we had been
expecting all through 2012 has not materialized. The exports sector performed better than
expected, and the 3rd quarter GDP figure, at 5.2 percent (y-o-y), added yet another quarter of
Latvia heading the list of the EU’s best growth performers. The recent data indicate this rapid
growth trend, though gradually decelerating, was continuing also in the 4th quarter.
Recognizing that this growth is largely a rebound from the excessive drop during the crisis
and has its roots in the hysteria of 2009, the authorities project a gradual slowdown in 2013,
in line with staff views.
End of Latvia’s 2008 SBA
The repayment of the remaining debt to the Fund closes the chapter on Latvia’s 2008
Stand-By Arrangement. The economy has indeed experienced a profound change: the
exchange rate is now broadly in line with fundamentals, and the current account and public
deficits are at comfortable levels. The fact that the repayment to the Fund was financed by a
US dollar bond issuance at a yield of 2.9 percent illustrates that this revival has also been
recognized by markets. The most significant cost of the crisis is the increase in emigration.
While the problem is not new, Latvia was an emigration country even during the boom years,
finding a way to curb emigration and make the country a more attractive place to live will be
one of the toughest challenges the authorities will face in the coming decades. In this context,
we found the discussion in Appendix II on demographic challenges particularly interesting.
More information on the authorities’ views on the program and the Ex-Post Evaluation
can be found in the Annex to Latvia’s “Ex-Post Evaluation of Exceptional Assess Under
the 2008 Stand-By Arrangement” paper.

Article IV consultation and PPM discussions
On most key Article IV consultation issues, the authorities and staff were on the same
page. On the fiscal policy, monetary policy stance, exchange rate assessment, structural
reforms, and the challenges in the financial sector the views did not differ substantially.
Three issues were discussed more thoroughly, and therefore, warrant a closer look: the
changes in the guaranteed minimum income (GMI) benefit provision, the envisaged PIT
reductions, and the increase of non-resident deposits (NRDs).


The discussion on the GMI benefit was probably the closest to what can be
called contentious, though from the authorities’ perspective, the differences are
not as significant as they may seem. The Latvian authorities have always considered
the centralization of the GMI benefit as a temporary crisis measure to be unwound as
the crisis ends. They also believe that there is a strong rationale for a decentralized
GMI benefit system, since municipalities are better placed to assess the needs and
incentives of particular individuals. That said, the Latvian authorities do believe that
the current degree of inequality is unacceptable and the high level of poverty, tracing
back to the collapse of the Soviet Union, should be reduced. The GMI benefit
changes, however, should be a part of a more comprehensive reform effort addressing
the challenges faced not only by social assistance clients but also low-income
households in general. The upcoming World Bank report “Latvia: Who is
Unemployed, Inactive or Needy? Assessing Post-Crisis Policy Options” will serve as
guidance for further work. If strong arguments are put forward, the Latvian
authorities do not exclude re-introduction of some elements of a centralized GMI. For
2013, the government is confident that municipalities will be able to provide the
benefit in full. It should be noted that in line with the agreement between Cabinet of
Ministers and Association of Local Governments, the 2013 budget law includes
transfers to the poorest municipalities. Besides, the government has also committed to
support municipalities should their personal income tax revenues fall below planned
targets.



The authorities are determined to implement the PIT cuts as planned. The aim of
the rate reductions is to reduce labor costs, with the broader goals of unemployment
reduction and improvement in competitiveness in sight. The agreement on the PIT
cuts was a difficult compromise decision and is currently supported by the business
community and other stakeholders.



The Latvian authorities are taking steps to mitigate the risks associated with the
recent increase of NRDs. While the authorities' thinking is very much in line with
that of staff, it should be noted that against the backdrop of the past experience, the
current level of the deposits is high, but not extraordinarily high. That said, the
Latvian authorities agree that particular vigilance is warranted and, as outlined in the

3

report, are taking measures to reduce the risks. The FCMC has set higher capital
requirements for banks specialized in non-resident clients and has taken other steps to
strengthen liquidity risk management in those banks. The supervision of activities
related to non-resident clients has also been significantly strengthened. The Latvian
authorities stand ready to introduce additional measures if the NRD-associated risks
increase.
The road ahead
The authorities’ commitment to euro adoption remains unwavering. The Latvian
authorities are committed to meet the Maastricht criteria in a sustainable way and are
comforted by the ECB and EC assurances that the criteria will be applied in an economically
meaningful manner.
Efforts to reduce the unacceptably high rate of unemployment will continue. The
unemployment rate has declined considerably, from the peak of over 20 percent to 13.5
percent in the 3rd quarter of 2012 (seasonally adjusted 14.1 percent). Since we agree with
staff that most of the remaining unemployment is structural in nature, achieving a further
reduction will be increasingly difficult. Nevertheless, the authorities intend to take additional
steps to decrease unemployment. A new targeted grant scheme for companies expanding
employment in selected sectors was launched in the last quarter of 2012 and measures to
facilitate regional mobility are in the pipeline. The authorities have also continued to refine
the existing active labor market measures gearing employment incentives and training
programs more towards the skills demanded by employers. The above-mentioned World
Bank study is progressing and the first results are expected in a few months. This study is
expected to provide a clearer picture of the extent of long term and structural unemployment,
poverty and inequality and serve as guidance for future policy changes.
The crisis has triggered a broad range of potentially growth-enhancing reforms in key
sectors. Significant changes are envisaged in higher and vocational education, the judicial
system, the management of state-owned enterprises, and in competition policy. The Selected
Issues paper covers those issues in great detail, properly reflecting the challenges the Latvian
authorities face and the authorities’ future plans. We place a high value on staff’s interest and
assessment on such subjects. Staff rightly points out that the reforms in the higher education
sector are already meeting strong insider resistance. Sustaining the reform momentum in a
more benign environment will be the authorities’ main domestic challenge in the years to
come.
