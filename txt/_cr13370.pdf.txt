STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
October 18, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context: Growth in recent decades has been sluggish owing to persistent political
turmoil, external shocks, and slow progress on structural reforms. Unemployment at
nearly 9 percent continues to be stubbornly high, with youth and underemployment at
significantly higher rates. The political environment remains complex as Fiji prepares for
transition to democratic government in 2014, although the strained relations with
traditional development partners have started to ease somewhat, after the enactment of
the new constitution in September 2013.
Key issues and policy recommendations:
 Structural reform. The key policy challenges are to raise potential growth, reduce
vulnerability to shocks, and further reduce poverty. Although the authorities have
recently implemented some structural measures—improving infrastructure,
enhancing land-leasing efficiency, restructuring the sugarcane industry, among
others—the need for deeper and faster reform to support higher growth and reduce
unemployment and poverty is urgent. The investment climate needs improvement
through making government regulations more predictable and less intrusive,
including relaxing the extensive price controls.
 Macroeconomic policies. The current configuration of mildly expansionary fiscal
policy and accommodative monetary policy is broadly appropriate as the
unemployment rate remains high and inflationary pressures dissipate against the
background of some slack in the economy and stable commodities prices. The
projected increase in the fiscal deficit is largely due to an increase in capital spending
to clear infrastructure backlogs. Recent income tax cuts are growth-friendly but basebroadening measures are needed. The slow appreciation of the real exchange rate
has continued and the Fund’s exchange rate assessment approaches now suggest
moderate overvaluation. The level of the peg should be subject to periodic reviews
and adjusted as necessary, and the authorities could also consider more flexible
arrangements.

CONTEXT
1.
Fiji is one of the largest and most developed of the Pacific island economies, with a
per capita income of US$4,200. Fiji’s human development indicators are relatively strong and Fiji
has achieved broad coverage in provision of basic services, with declining overall poverty levels even
though progress in rural areas is lagging (see Box 1). Although Fiji has a more diversified production
structure than most Pacific island economies, the economy remains heavily dependent on sugar and
tourism. Regional integration of Pacific Island Countries (PICs), including Fiji, with Australia, New
Zealand, and emerging Asia has increased over the last two decades. PICs have become more
exposed to the region’s business cycles, and spillovers from large regional economies are more
important for PICs than from advanced economies outside the region. 1
2.
The political environment remains complex as Fiji prepares for transition to
democratic government in 2014. The current government took power in a 2006 military coup and
in July 2009 announced plans for a new constitution and an election by September 2014. After some
delays and controversies, a new constitution was drawn up and became effective in September
2013. Since the enactment of the new constitution, the strains with traditional development
partners have started to ease, and stakeholders are looking forward to the 2014 election.
3.
The key policy challenges are to raise the potential growth rate and increase the
resilience to shocks. After experiencing robust growth in the 1970s, economic growth in Fiji slowed
to about 2 percent between 1980-2012 owing to persistent political turmoil, external shocks, and
slow progress in structural reforms that have discouraged private investment. As in the case of other
Pacific island economies, growth in Fiji has also been constrained by high transportation costs and
the small size of its domestic economy. Although the authorities have recently implemented some
reform measures, the need for deeper and faster structural reforms to support broad-based and
inclusive growth is urgent. Unemployment at nearly 9 percent remains stubbornly high, with youth
and underemployment at significantly higher rates. Moreover, reflecting the limited opportunities in
Fiji, emigration continues, often among the skilled and highly educated, leading to brain drain and
reducing the population growth rate.
4.
In the last Article IV consultation with Fiji, Executive Directors viewed the authorities’
macroeconomic policies as generally appropriate. Directors noted that boosting sustainable
growth and reducing poverty through structural reform is the top priority. Directors considered the
reform of the Fiji National Provident Fund (FNPF) as the key financial-sector priority. Directors
supported the reform plans for land policy, the sugar sector, the civil service, and public enterprises,
while encouraging faster progress in other areas. They called on the authorities to rapidly scale back
the price-control regime, strengthen antitrust enforcement, and increase social transfers to cushion
the impact on the poorest. Directors also urged the removal of remaining exchange restrictions.

Since the last Article IV Executive Board discussion in January 2012, the authorities have made
progress on the structural reform agenda by reforming the FNPF and other state owned enterprises,
reducing the size of civil service wage bill, and scaling back capital controls. But the urgency to
accelerate the reform momentum remains.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
5.
Economic activity is picking up, partly driven by supportive policies. Growth in 2012
increased to 2¼ percent supported by income tax cuts, low interest rates and the one-time payouts
under the FNPF reform in 2012. However, not all sectors expanded in 2012. Tourist arrivals declined
by 2.5 percent, while sugar production fell by 7.1 percent as massive floods and Cyclone Evan, one
of the worst storms in Fiji’s history, caused severe damage to crops in December 2012. The cyclone
also caused extensive damage to tourist infrastructure and dampened growth. Economic growth is
set to increase to around 3 percent in 2013, fueled by consumption and investment spending both
by the public and private sectors. The latest available consumption indicators suggest accelerating
momentum in the first half of 2013 boosted by higher disposable income and borrowing. These
effects are likely to taper off somewhat in the latter part of 2013. As a result of this higher growth,
the slack in the economy is estimated to close towards the end of 2013. In 2014, growth is projected
to moderate to 2¼ percent, in line with estimated potential.
6.
Headline inflationary pressures are subdued. In 2012, average inflation stood at
4.3 percent as imported commodity and food prices moderated, down from 8.7 percent in 2011.
Inflation is projected at around 3 percent in 2013 as world commodity prices are expected to be
broadly stable. The authorities continue to maintain price controls on a large part of the CPI
basket—basic food items, hardware and construction materials, pharmaceuticals, and petroleum
products—that may cause the CPI to overstate the decline in inflationary pressures.
7.
Monetary policy rates remain near the zero-lower bound. The Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF)
lowered its policy rate to 0.5 percent in October 2011 and monetary policy has been on hold since
then. The lower policy rate and persistent excess liquidity in the banking system have slowly been
transmitted to lower lending rates and the yield curve has shifted down. In response to lower rates
and improved confidence, net domestic credit increased by 10 percent in the first half of 2013, led
by the wholesale, retail, hotel, restaurant, and construction sectors. The increased lending continues
to be funded predominantly by deposits. Despite the RBF’s accommodative monetary policy stance,
real lending rates remain relatively high in the range of 4-5 percent.
8.
The financial sector is stable. Banks are sound and continue to be well capitalized with
average capital adequacy ratios above regulatory requirements, low levels of non-performing loans
(NPLs) and adequate loan loss provisioning. At end-March 2013, the NPL ratio declined further to
2.6 percent while provisioning for NPLs improved to 41 percent. Banking sector earnings remain
buoyant and profitability increased by 70 percent in the first quarter of 2013 with interest spreads at
around 4 percent. The entry of BRED Bank (part of Banque Populaire Group of France) in November

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

REPUBLIC OF FIJI

2012 was expected to increase competition in the banking sector and exert some pressure on
banking sector margins.
9.
The estimated 2012 fiscal deficit of 1 percent of GDP was smaller than projected owing
mainly to expenditure restraint. On the revenue side, personal income tax collection declined by
22 percent mainly as a result of corporate and income tax cuts in the 2012 budget, but the revenue
impact was partly offset by buoyant VAT collection and increased fees, fines and charges. On the
expenditure side, lower than budgeted capital expenditure and interest bill contributed to the lower
deficit. The primary surplus stood at 2.6 percent in 2012 and the government debt declined to
51.1 percent, from 53 percent in 2011. The 2013 budget targets a deficit of 2.8 percent of GDP, with
a large boost to infrastructure spending. The 2013 budget also raised the minimum threshold for
income tax. Over the past years, the corporate tax rate has been lowered from 31 percent to the
current rate of 20 percent. For companies establishing regional headquarters in Fiji, the 2013 budget
further lowered the corporate income tax to 17 percent.
10.
International reserves have stabilized at comfortable levels. At end-2012, international
reserves stood at US$ 889 million (about 5 months of retained imports). The reserve position has so
far remained stable despite offshore investments by the FNPF and the gradual relaxation of
exchange controls. The current account deficit is estimated to have narrowed in 2012, mainly on
account of slower import growth. In 2013, the current account deficit is set to widen substantially
reflecting the purchase of three aircrafts by Fiji Airways, at a total cost of about US$600 million,
partly financed by the FNPF. Partly a result of the aircraft purchase, international reserve coverage is
expected to dip to around 4.7 months of imports in 2013. In the first six months of 2013, imports
increased by 6.7 percent, while exports declined by 14.5 percent as export earnings from gold and
fishing sectors were sluggish. Through the first quarter of 2013, tourism earnings remained
somewhat weaker than in the same period of 2012.
11.
Reforms to the FNPF were introduced in March 2012. The reforms terminated the FNPF’s
overly generous benefits that were based on unrealistic demographic and socioeconomic
projections. Under the reforms, recipients of pensions in the scheme could either opt for a lump
sum withdrawal or roll over their balances into a new scheme which is based on more realistic
assumptions. Nearly 1/3 of the recipients of pensions elected a lump-sum payout, which in total
amounted to F$127 million (1¾ percent of GDP), and this has contributed to a one-off stimulus to
growth.
12.
Risks to the outlook stem both from domestic and external factors. Domestic risks stem
largely from the complex political situation as Fiji prepares for elections in 2014, and from delays in
further implementation of structural reforms. Credit growth has picked up in recent months. While
an increase in credit growth is desirable as it has been sluggish in recent years reflecting lack of
confidence in the economy, it should be monitored carefully to avoid risks of overheating in the
context of the economy’s absorptive capacity constraints. On the external side, tourism spending
may be adversely affected by the below trend growth in Australia (the main source of tourist
arrivals) as the economy is facing a transition from the mining investment boom, and the weakening
Australian dollar on the back of declining commodity prices as emerging markets demand slows. In
6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF FIJI

addition, the recent appreciation of the Fiji dollar against the Australia and New Zealand currencies
may have affected Fiji’s competitiveness as a tourist destination. The prospective tapering of
unconventional monetary policy in advanced countries may result in economic and financial
volatility, particularly in emerging markets. Portofolio flows into Fiji have been small to date, limiting
the risks of capital flow reversals. However, the potentially protracted financial market volatility
raises the risk of having to refinance Fiji’s US$ 250 million sovereign bond in unfavorable market
conditions. While strong linkages with Asia would help in the event of a global downturn, Fiji
remains vulnerable to global commodity price shocks. Moreover, Fiji continues to be susceptible to
natural disasters, requiring the maintenance of macroeconomic policy buffers.
13.
In the event that risks to the Fijian economy materialize, allowing the automatic
stabilizers to operate would be the first line of defense. If the downturn persists, there is scope
for limited fiscal stimulus. Monetary policy will be of limited effectiveness given that policy rates are
near the zero-lower bound and the weak transmission mechanism. To limit the risk of having to
refinance Fiji’s sovereign bond in unfavorable market conditions, the authorities should consider
building balances in the sinking fund for repayment of external debt. On the upside, a successful
implementation of democratic elections in 2014 could trigger a surge in foreign investment and
development aid. To take advantage of the benefits of increased foreign direct investment, it is
urgent to accelerate the implementation of structural reforms to alleviate supply side constraints
and boost the absorptive capacity in the economy so as to avoid bidding up asset prices and wages
of skilled workers in short supply (see Risk Assessment Matrix in Box 2).

Authorities’ Views
14.
The authorities broadly agreed on the macroeconomic outlook. They viewed the recent pick
up in consumption and investment as driven by the returning confidence rather than temporary
factors. On the risks, the authorities were more sanguine than staff on the effect of the Fiji dollar
appreciation against the Australian and New Zealand currencies on tourist spending, arguing that
tourism will hold up as tourists that previously went to higher cost locations elsewhere will now view
Fiji as an attractive alternative.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
The macroeconomic situation has improved and the current configuration of macroeconomic policies
is broadly appropriate. However, there is no time for complacency. The current environment is a rare
window of opportunity to address deep-seated structural issues and lay the foundation for higher and
broad-based growth that is inclusive and sustainable.

A. Monetary and Financial Policies
15.
In view of low inflation and continued underlying sluggishness, monetary policy is
appropriate, but the monetary transmission mechanism remains weak. Despite RBF’s policy
easing, real lending rates remain relatively high. There are welcome signs that the policy easing is
slowly leading to lower lending rates and credit growth has picked up, albeit from low levels. The

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

REPUBLIC OF FIJI

addition of new entrants to the banking sector is welcome as it could encourage competition and
could potentially improve the transmission of monetary policy.
16.
The financial sector is generally sound. The banking sector is well capitalized and most
banks have low NPLs. While the RBF has improved supervision, there is scope for further progress in
improving stress testing and scenario analysis. Good progress has been made on the 2006 Financial
Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) recommendations but in view of the time elapsed since the last
FSAP, the authorities are considering requesting an update. The persistent excess liquidity in the
banking system remains. Credit growth has been sluggish in recent years, but the excess liquidity
could pose risk of excessive credit growth as confidence in the economy improves.
17.
The recent pickup in credit growth—albeit from low levels—warrants close
monitoring. The strong growth in loans for consumption purposes and vehicle imports likely
reflects a one-time consumption increase due to the permanent tax cuts that has led to higher
disposable income, as well as aggressive marketing by banks. Real estate lending is also brisk and
real estate prices, particularly of freehold land, have increased, although the picture is clouded by
the lack of comprehensive house price data. The RBF is urged to monitor sectoral developments
closely, including enhanced data collection and surveillance of sectors with rapid credit growth, and
could consider using targeted macroprudential measures if credit growth in certain sectors is
deemed out of line with economic fundamentals. In case of rekindled and broad-based inflationary
pressures, the RBF should use open market operations more aggressively to reduce excess liquidity
and, if necessary, tighten policy rates.
18.
Initiatives to broaden financial access are welcome. The RBF has recently introduced a
small- and medium-sized enterprise loan guarantee scheme, established sector lending ratios for
banks, and encouraged micro-finance operations (see Box 3). However, the international experience
with sectoral lending targets is mixed and can lead to a misallocation of resources. In the context of
providing increased financial access, particularly to the agricultural sector and small & medium
enterprises, the Fiji Development Bank should focus on its core mandate to expand access to
financial services but the lending criteria should be implemented transparently and with clear
budgetary support.

Authorities’ Views
19.
The authorities broadly shared staff’s outlook on the monetary and financial sectors. They
view the recent rise in credit as a generally healthy rebound from low levels and appropriate to
stimulate investment, but agreed that vigilance is needed in case inflationary pressures emerge. The
authorities noted that the current excess liquidity is not fueling inflation, but indicated their
readiness to aggressively use open market operations to mop up liquidity in the event of inflationary
pressures. The authorities view increased financial inclusion as important to foster broad-based
economic development and the agricultural lending target is justifiable on this basis, but
emphasized that the program is relatively small and flexibly administered.

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF FIJI

B. Fiscal policy
20.
The fiscal policy stance in the 2013 budget is broadly appropriate. Fiji’s fiscal policy
continues to balance the need to strengthen the fiscal position against the need to increase public
investment to enhance the growth potential. The increase in public investment, especially upgrading
the inadequate infrastructure, is appropriate to support growth, if administered effectively. The
cabinet-endorsed plan to keep the fiscal deficits small (2 percent of GDP in 2014; 1.5 percent in
2015; and 1 percent in 2016) implies primary surpluses, a declining debt ratio, and limited roll-over
risk since most of the public debt is domestic. The authorities have been successful in maintaining
tight control over expenditures in recent years (e.g. the declining share of civil service wages) and
the share of operating expenditures is expected to decline further in favor of increased capital
spending, but the contingent liabilities of the government remain sizeable and underscore the
importance of continued state-enterprise reform.
21.
Tax revenues have been boosted by increased consumption, but may prove less
buoyant in the period ahead. The reduction in income tax rates has resulted in sharply lower direct
tax revenue in 2012 and thus far in 2013. This decline has so far been largely offset by buoyant VAT
collection (up by 13 percent through August 2013), including contributions by one-off factors such
as increased VAT arrears collection efforts and the temporary consumption boost. Based on revenue
and expenditure developments in the first half of 2013, the deficit target of 2.8 percent of GDP in
2013 appears to be on track to be comfortably met. Looking ahead, revenue buoyancy in 2014 may
prove somewhat lower as the effect of one-off factors that have contributed to higher revenues
tapers off. In such a case, imposition of intrusive ad hoc taxes and administrative fees to meet the
deficit target should be avoided because such measures could damage the business confidence. On
the expenditure side, restraint should be focused on non-interest recurrent spending rather than
capital spending.
22.
Recent direct tax cuts are growth friendly, but need to be accompanied by basebroadening measures. Base-broadening measures are

been lowered significantly to 20 percent over the past few
years—and to 17 percent for companies establishing regional headquarters in Fiji—and should not
be lowered further to avoid adverse revenue impact and tax competition concerns.
23.
Public debt has declined and is broadly sustainable. Public debt stood at just above
50 percent of GDP in 2012, down from 54.7 percent in 2010. In addition, contingent liabilities, largely
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

REPUBLIC OF FIJI

on account of state-owned enterprises, remain above 15 percent of GDP, although they have
declined in recent years owing to reforms on such entities and the pension scheme. The debt
sustainability analysis indicates that public debt is sustainable, but points to the need for some
caution on external financing. Fiji’s external debt remains low from a regional perspective, but it has
increased rapidly recently, largely reflecting the US-dollar denominated sovereign bond issued in
2011, and increased reliance on bilateral loans from nontraditional sources for infrastructure
financing. The financing terms of these loans are long-term and the interest rates are lower than
market rates, but the effective rates of the loans (factoring in the hidden cost of using specified
suppliers and other captive costs) could be higher.
24.
Debt management strategies should be geared to preserving policy options. The
US$250 million sovereign bond issued in 2011 matures in 2016 (see Box 4). Prospects of less
accommodative monetary policy in advanced economies could trigger a repricing risk, a sustained
reversal of capital flows, and may result in possibly unfavorable external conditions for refinancing.
To maintain policy buffers, debt management may consider taking advantage of current favorable
domestic financing conditions to gradually build up balances in the sinking fund for external debt
repayments (currently amounting to around US$128 million). Fiji’s debt management capacity is
generally sound and has benefited from technical assistance from development partners.
25.
The FNPF reform in 2012 is commendable but some risks remain. The reform has
enhanced the actuarial sustainability of the pension fund and reduced the medium-term contingent
liabilities of the government. The introduction of periodic updating of actuarial assumptions every
three years should fortify sustainability. The current lump-sum payout policy has resulted in only
5 percent electing more gradual payments when reaching pension age. Despite the positive
actuarial impact of the pension reform, the risk remains of an increase in government social
spending in the longer term, as the lump sum payment is unlikely to support an adequate level of
income over the remaining lifespan of the retirees. However, any fiscal impact would likely only
materialize in the longer term. In the meantime, the authorities are encouraged to plan ahead and
continue using international expertise to review the pension system.
26.
In the medium term, structural reforms to broaden the revenue base and continued
restraint on operating expenditure are key to create fiscal space for capital investment
spending, lowering the public debt and increasing resilience to shocks. Fiji’s susceptibility to
natural disasters and narrow export base suggest the need to continue building fiscal buffers to
respond to adverse developments.

Authorities’ Views
27.
The authorities are confident that the 2013 deficit target will not be breached, similar to the
recent past where the actual deficit outcomes have been lower than the budget target. On the
revenue side, the authorities agreed that the recent revenue performance may not be sustained,
particularly on the domestic VAT side. The authorities view some tax incentives as necessary to
continue to attract foreign investment, but they intend to review the tax incentive regime in due
course. On debt management, the authorities remain committed to building up balances in the

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF FIJI

sinking fund to preserve policy options through privatization and property sale revenue without
resorting to domestic borrowing. Debt is raised to finance government capital projects rather than
operating expenditure, which is more than sufficiently covered by revenues.

C. Exchange Rate Policy and External Balance
28.
The competitive boost from the April 2009 devaluation has been largely eroded by
creeping real exchange rate appreciation, driven by partner-country inflation differentials
under Fiji’s basket peg regime.2 The real exchange rate is now slightly higher than the level
consistent with medium-term macroeconomic fundamentals. The IMF’s exchange rate assessment
approaches point to overvaluation in the range of 1-14 percent (see Box 5). Although the exchange
rate assessment approaches are subject to considerable uncertainty, the continuous real
appreciation trend following the depreciation in 2009 is a cause for concern. Overall, export growth
is projected to be sluggish in the medium term. The sugar export earnings are expected to continue
its relative decline, especially in the context of expiring EU preferential purchase agreements. Over a
longer period, growth in the tourism sector earnings may also be adversely affected by the real
appreciation.
29.
The current stable macroeconomic environment provides a good opportunity to lay
the foundation for a more flexible exchange rate regime. To avoid the need for large disruptive
step devaluations under balance of payments stress conditions, the exchange rate policy should be
subject to periodic reviews and adjustments made if needed, in order to prevent creeping
overvaluation. More flexible arrangements, including a wider trading band, could also be
considered.
30.
Further relaxation of capital account restrictions could be considered. By standard
reserve metrics, the current level of international reserves is adequate although Fiji’s narrow export
base and susceptibility to shocks would suggest the need for a relatively higher reserve target in the
range of 5 months of retained imports. Capital transactions are still allowed only if the Fiji Revenue
and Customs Authority (FRCA) issues a tax clearance certificate, and such issuance is sometimes
delayed. In this context, increased use of one-year pre-approvals under the FRCA “Gold Card”
program to facilitate payments should be encouraged. Some exchange restrictions are subject to
Fund approval under Article VIII, arising from tax certification requirement.3 Relaxation of capital
controls should be accompanied by a continued strengthening of the AML/CFT regime.

2

Since April 1975, the exchange rate of the Fiji dollar has been linked to a basket of currencies of Fiji’s five major
trading partners: the U.S., Australian, and New Zealand dollars; the Euro; and the Japanese yen. The weights used in
the basket, based mainly on the value of trade and tourist transactions are reviewed annually.

Staff are assessing whether these or any other measures have jurisdictional implications.

Authorities’ Views
31.
The authorities agreed that more exchange rate flexibility is desirable, but did not view it as
urgent as reserves are at comfortable levels. They also highlighted the role of different currencies in
the Fijian currency basket, and the challenges in making assessments of competitiveness when
basket currencies move in different directions.

D. Structural Reforms
32.
Slow progress on structural reforms has held back growth in the past decades. The
authorities have accelerated reforms in recent years, but the key policy challenge remains to raise
potential growth, reduce unemployment and increase resilience to shocks. The need for faster and
deeper structural reform is urgent to boost investor confidence, reduce the economy’s supply
bottlenecks and raise the absorptive capacity in order to take full advantage of a potential increase
in foreign and domestic investments following the planned elections in 2014. Fiji has relatively
strong human development indicators (see Box 1), but reducing poverty levels further will require,
among others, increased employment opportunities domestically through structural reforms.
33.
Price controls should be scaled back significantly. Arguably, there may be a case for
regulating a few basic essential commodities, given that oligopolistic behavior is not uncommon in
small economies and that Fiji’s remotely dispersed population makes it difficult to enforce anticompetitive practices. However, the current micromanagement of price controls distorts price
signals, creates uncertainty, is costly to administer, gives vendors incentives to reduce product
quality and/or supply, and reduces incentives for investment. With inflationary pressures currently
low, the price controls should be scaled back to enhance competition, transparency, cost-efficiency,
and predictability, while targeted social transfers could mitigate any impact on vulnerable segments
of the population.
34.
Government policy consultation and predictability should be improved. There is scope
to improve communication between the government and stakeholders. The authorities are
encouraged to involve the broader public in the key policy decision making process. Any abruptness
in policy decisions can create uncertainty in the business community, adversely affecting the

12

REPUBLIC OF FIJI

investment climate and long-term investment decisions. Moreover, improvement in intragovernment communication and in the capacity of the middle-level management can speed up the
approval process and improve the business climate. The line ministries should be encouraged to
provide assistance to improve the operations and viability of small-to-medium sized employers, and
stimulate employment generation, instead of imposing ad hoc fees and fines. More participation of
talents with diverse expertise, including private sector experience, in government boards,
commissions and other decision making positions should be encouraged.
35.
Efforts to improve data quality to underpin informed policy making should continue.
The authorities need to accelerate and expand efforts to increase data coverage and improve
quality, particularly in the areas of balance of payments and national accounts, including GDP by
expenditure in constant prices, through strengthening the capacity of the Fiji Bureau of Statistics. In
the past, the provision of high quality statistics has been hampered by high turnover among skilled
statisticians. The authorities continue to receive substantial support through technical assistance to
improve capacity in this area. Increased provision of statistics to the public is also encouraged.
36.
Continued sector-specific structural reforms are needed to improve the investment
climate and broaden the export base. A reliable energy supply is essential to meet the increasing
demands of the economy and crucial to improve the investment environment. In this context, a
national energy policy that provides clear incentives for energy producers to significantly increase
supply, especially in renewable energy sources like solar, is needed. In view of the investment-tooutput lags in the energy sector, it is urgent to accelerate efforts to sustainably expand the energy
supply in the medium-term. The government has made good plans for reforming the sugar-cane
sector, including using the by-products of sugar production for ethanol and electricity generation.
However, the issue of unstable land lease, aging workers, lack of larger-scale mechanization, and
obsolete and poorly maintained facilities are long-term challenges (Box 6), which require immediate
and accelerated reform efforts. With EU preferential purchase agreements expiring, it is imperative
to continue the reform efforts to ensure the industry remains viable. Increased efficiency in
utilization of land is also a key factor in facilitating investment. The recent establishment of the Land
Bank is welcome, but further progress is needed in laws, policy and implementation to provide a
predictable and stable supply of land with lease for long-term investment.

underinvestment over the past decades has
contributed to degradation of physical capital. Similarly, the lack of domestic opportunities has
contributed to loss of highly skilled and educated labor through emigration. Under a successful
reform scenario of a drastically improved business investment climate, private sector investment can
be stimulated to reverse the decline in total factor productivity, and capital as well as labor inputs
can be boosted. Under this scenario, potential growth can be raised from the current 2-3 percent to
about 4-5 percent by 2020 (Box 7). Unemployment and poverty levels can be reduced through
increased economic opportunities domestically, the debt-to-GDP ratio would stabilize at around
45 percent of GDP, and longer-term inflationary pressures can be mitigated through improvements
in productivity. Staff constructed an illustrative structural reform scenario to estimate the economic
benefits of accelerated reforms. This scenario assumes an improved investment climate which
stimulates both domestic and foreign investment, raising potential growth to 4½ percent in the
medium term.

Authorities’ Views
39.
The authorities broadly agreed on the structural reform agenda and the urgency to speed
up implementation. They point to significant progress on the structural reform agenda over the past
few years. The authorities acknowledge the need to scale back price controls, but view some
controls as essential to protect the poor given the lack of competition in some of the geographically
dispersed markets of Fiji. The authorities view the past use of decrees as sometimes necessary to
improve the business climate against the background of occasionally non-responsive government
bureaucracy.

STAFF APPRAISAL
40.
Macroeconomic policies are broadly appropriate. The current configuration of mildly
expansionary fiscal policy and accommodative monetary policy is broadly appropriate as the
unemployment rate remains high and inflationary pressures have dissipated against the background
of some slack in the economy and stable commodities prices. The recent pickup in credit growth
warrants close monitoring. In case of rekindled and broad-based inflationary pressures, the RBF

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF FIJI

should use open market operations more aggressively to reduce excess liquidity and, if necessary,
tighten policy rates. The projected increase in the fiscal deficit is largely due to an increase in capital
spending to clear infrastructure backlogs. Recent income tax cuts are growth friendly but basebroadening measures are needed to strengthen the revenue system and fiscal position. The gradual
appreciation of the real exchange rate has continued and the Fund’s exchange rate assessment
approaches now suggest moderate overvaluation. The level of the peg should be subject to periodic
reviews and adjusted if necessary, and the authorities could also consider more flexible
arrangements.
41.
The current environment provides a rare window of opportunity to make a clear break
with the slow growth of past decades and lay the foundation for a transition to a higher
growth trajectory and reduced poverty. This will require accelerated progress in implementing
structural reform. While significant reforms have been put in train over the past three years—e.g.
sugarcane sector, civil service, land utilization, pension system, infrastructure improvements,
improved financial access—a slowing down in the reform momentum now will likely stall potential
growth at around 2 percent.
42.
Under a scenario of successful elections in 2014, both domestic and foreign
investments are expected to pick up significantly as political uncertainty is reduced. However,
the economy urgently needs to improve the investment climate, boost investor confidence and
expand its capacity to accommodate increased private sector investment. In this context, relaxation
of price controls, increased efficiency of land use, improved predictability and streamlining of
government regulation and implementation, continued focus on infrastructure upgrades and better
aligned incentives for expanding electricity production, would reduce the economy’s supply
bottlenecks. In particular, given the investment-to-output lags in the energy and sugarcane sectors,
it is imperative to accelerate reforms in these sectors. This would allow the economy to utilize more
effectively the expected increase in private sector investment in order to raise potential growth and
to stimulate employment without fueling price increases.
43.
Improved data quality is urgently needed for informed policy making. The authorities
need to accelerate and expand efforts to increase data coverage and quality, particularly in the areas
of balance of payments and national accounts, including GDP by expenditure. The capacity of the
Fiji Bureau of Statistics should continue to be strengthened, supported by technical assistance from
development partners. Increased statistics provision to the public is also encouraged.
44.
A number of exchange restrictions are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII.
Restrictions arise from tax certification requirements on the transfer abroad of profits and dividends,
and on the proceeds of airline ticket sales, and on the making of external debt and maintenance
payments, and from direct limits on large payments. These should be eliminated. While they are
designed to promote tax compliance, exchange restrictions are not the appropriate means to this
end, as they weaken the business climate and dampen foreign investment. The authorities are urged
to further strengthen the AML/CFT regime.
45.

It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12-month

cycle.

Box 1. Fiji: Human Development and Poverty (World Bank)
Fiji’s development indicators are relatively strong. Fiji has achieved broad coverage in provision of
basic social services, contributing to strong human development indicators. Fiji spends less on basic
social services than other Pacific economies as a proportion of public expenditure and relative to the
size of the economy, reflecting greater economies of scale realizable with larger population. Around
35 percent of Fijians lived below the national basic needs poverty line in 2008/09, but the incidence of
1
food poverty is low, under 5 percent.
Expectancy of life was around 69.3 years in 2011, slightly above the Pacific average of
67.5 years. Infant and child mortality rates are among the lowest in the Pacific, at 16.4 and 14.1 per
1,000 live births respectively, reflecting the broad coverage of public health services. Incidence of
tuberculosis is low and declining. The incidence of HIV is around 0.1 percent. Like other Pacific Island
Countries, however, Fiji faces important challenges in managing Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs)
which are responsible for 82 percent of deaths. 62.3 percent of adult Fijian population is overweight
or underweight, and 18 percent have diabetes.
Fiji has achieved strong health outcomes with low public health expenditure as a proportion of
government expenditure and as a percentage of GDP, relative to other Pacific Island Countries
and other upper-middle income countries. Public expenditure in health is complemented by
private health expenditure of around 1.2 percent of GDP. Enrollment in primary education is almost
universal, with a primary net enrollment rate of 96.8 percent – well above the Pacific average of
86.4 percent. Net enrollment in secondary education, at 80.3 percent, is the highest in the Pacific.
Broad access to education has seen the youth literacy rate reach 99.5 percent, above the average for
upper-middle income countries and the East Asia and Pacific region. Secondary drop-out rates remain
a cause for concern, but specific policy measures have recently been implemented to address this
issue. Since 2007, public expenditure on education has declined steadily, and is now equivalent to
4.5 percent of GDP. At around 16 percent, expenditure on education is close to the average for Pacific
Island Countries, upper-middle income counties, and the East Asia and Pacific region as a proportion
of total government expenditure. In 2009, just over one third of the Fijian population lived in poverty.
Since 2003 national poverty dropped by 4.6 percentage points from 39.8 percent in 2002/03 to
35.2 percent in 2008/09. This overall decline, however, masks significant rural-urban variation. Most of
the poverty reduction during this period was driven by the 8.3 percentage point (23 percent)
reduction in urban poverty from 34.5 percent to 26.2 percent. Rural poverty remained at 44 percent.
Poverty rates varied significantly by district, from 53.5 percent in Northern to 23.4 percent in Central.
The social protection system in Fiji is one of the most developed in the Pacific region. Moreover,
in 2012 the Government endorsed 2 key changes to the social protection system in Fiji:
(i) introduction of the poverty-targeted benefit at a household level (targeting the poorest 10 percent
of the population); and (ii) introduction of the old age social pension for people aged over 70.

Box 3. Fiji: Financial Inclusion and Access
Despite a relatively well-developed financial sector, financial access needs broadening.
Compared to other PICs, the financial sector in Fiji has well-developed institutions, including a
broad array of services offered by commercial banks, non-banking financial institutions, credit
institutions, insurance companies and microfinance institutions. However, the banking sector’s
business models, including physical presence, products and services largely serve the well-off
urban population, leaving many Fijians, especially in rural areas and SMEs, with few financial
services. The limited access to financial services has likely contributed to holding back growth
and employment generation in the financially underserved areas, including the SME sector.
The RBF has recently introduced initiatives to promote financial inclusion. To promote
development of SMEs, the RBF introduced a small and medium enterprises credit guarantee
scheme in January 2012. This allows lending institutions to apply for a government guarantee
cover of up to $50,000 per business on eligible SME loan facilities at an interest rate below
10 percent. The government contributed an initial $2.5 million to start off the scheme and
pledged another $1.5 million in the 2013 budget. The RBF has also established a housing facility
for low income home owners, with a total allocation of $25 million to be channeled through the
Housing Authority. To promote increased agricultural lending, the RBF issued policy guidance to
commercial banks to require them to lend at least four percent of their deposits to business in
the agriculture sector. The RBF also chairs the National Financial Inclusion Taskforce—a
multistakeholder representative committee—to coordinate national efforts towards financial
inclusion, with focus on microfinance, statistics and financial literacy.

environment. The 2011 bond
rolled over a maturing
US$150 million bond that

The ERER estimates explain the REER
largely on the basis of the tourism-based
terms of trade (i.e., using average
expenditure per tourist as a price proxy for
this key export). Assuming a slight
improvement in the terms of trade over the
medium term (with tourist spending flat,
and import prices declining as per the
WEO), the exchange rate is estimated to be
1 percent overvalued.

The estimated overvaluation of around 14 percent of the ES approach is somewhat higher than
previous estimates due the use of a different estimate of net foreign liabilities (70 percent of GDP
from the net international investment position).

Box 6. Fiji: Transforming Sugar to Sugarcane Industry
Despite its long-term relative decline, the sugar industry remains important in Fiji’s
economy. It is estimated that almost a quarter of the population engages in sugar-related
activities such as growers, transporters, millers, and associated service providers. The industry
remains a major earner of foreign exchange.
Recent reforms have stemmed the decline in production, but growth is expected to be
slow. Sugar production once peaked over 500,000 tonnes in 1994. Since then output has
significantly declined to around 160,000 tonnes in 2012, accounting for only 10 percent of its full
capacity. Moreover, of the 20 African Caribbean and Pacific Group (ACP) sugar producers, Fiji has
among the lowest sugar yield per harvested hectare. The declining productivity of sugar
production is captured through the rising total cane to total sugar ratio (TCTS).

Government support and implementation of reforms, including improvements to mill operations,
harvesting and transport systems, have stabilized the sugar sector. After a period of operating at
a loss necessitating budgetary support from the government, the Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC)
registered a net profit of FJ$ 1.8 million in 2012, further reducing the contingent liabilities of the
government. To coordinate the reforms going forward, the government established the
Stakeholder Action Group in 2012 to focus on commercial viability, industry competitiveness and
sustainability.
Significant challenges remain to revitalize the sugar industry. Transforming sugar to
sugarcane industry is an important component in reviving the industry and promoting financial
sustainability of FSC. FSC’s strategies to reform the industry include the utilization of the byproducts of sugarcane to generate electricity. Currently, the FSC has installed a 5-megawatt
electricity generator, and plan to acquire a 40-megawatt generator. The FSC is also considering
ethanol production projects. Moreover, the government intends to improve the financial
sustainability of FSC through converting government debt to equity and buying out minority
shareholders. Other areas of reform include introducing the new cane quality payment system
and replanting programs. However, significant challenges still remain for the sugar cane industry,
including the expiration of EU preferential purchase agreement, obsolete equipment, unstable
land leases, and an aging work force.

Using a production function approach, productivity growth is estimated to have contracted over
the past decades. The main contribution to growth in Fiji is estimated to come from capital
accumulation through public and private investment, while labor input has contributed a smaller share.
The lack of sufficient investment to maintain labor
and capital inputs, combined with the political
instability, have eroded the quality of the factors of
production. Against this background, total factor
productivity is estimated to have contracted over the
past two decades. This underinvestment has
manifested itself in insufficient infrastructure and
brain drain through emigration, hampering
productivity growth. According to the World Bank’s
Logistics Performance Index, Fiji was ranked 144th
out of 155 countries, indicating the country’s high
cost of logistics and transportation.
Structural reform can boost potential growth. Using empirics from cross-country panel regressions,
improved institutional
quality, better human

to reduce emigration among the highly skilled, to enhance the productivity of labor.

1/ For financing, the GFSM2001 allows for a classification, under each instrument, by the sector of the counterparty. For residents
(domestic), these are: general government, central bank, deposit-taking financial corporations except the central bank, other financial
corporations, nonfinancial corporations, and households and nonprofit institutions serving households. For nonresidents (foreign), these
are: general government, international organizations, financial institutions except international organizations, and other nonresidents.
2/ The instrument classification is consistent with the 2008 System of National Accounts .

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

Exchange Rate Arrangements: Fiji’s de facto exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg.
Since April 1975, the exchange rate of the Fiji dollar has been linked to a basket of currencies of Fiji’s
five major trading partners: the U.S., Australian, and New Zealand dollars; the pound sterling (replaced
by the Euro at the beginning of 1999); and the Japanese yen. The weights used in the basket, based
mainly on the value of trade and tourist transactions are reviewed annually. The exchange rate of the
Fiji dollar against U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, is determined daily by the Reserve Bank of Fiji
(RBF) in relation to the currency basket. The RBF’s buying and selling rates for transactions in

2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF FIJI

U.S. dollars are communicated to commercial banks. On April 15, 2009, the Fiji dollar was devalued
by 20 percent against the basket. The exchange rate was F$1.8584 per U.S. dollar as of September
26, 2013.
Exchange and capital controls were tightened significantly in early 2009 following the devaluation of
the currency. Some of the exchange restrictions have been eliminated and amended since then.
Remaining restrictions subject to Article VIII arise from the Fiji Revenue and Customs Authority tax
certification requirements on the transfer abroad of profits and dividends, and on the proceeds of
airline ticket sales, and on the making of external debt and maintenance payments, and from limits
on large payments (e.g., oil imports and dividends repatriation of foreign banks).
Approval of most current payments was delegated to commercial banks and foreign exchange dealers
in the late 1990s. However, the extent of delegation was tightened during periods of stress on foreign
exchange reserves, most recently in April 2009. In December 2009, the RBF announced an increase in
the delegated ceilings for commercial banks and foreign exchange dealers for most current payments,
effective January 1, 2010, and further increases in delegated limits were announced in January 2013.
Banks have also been allowed to have net forward contracts of up to F$20 million, and individuals are
allowed to take out up to F$15,000 for overseas investment.
Last Article IV Consultation: The 2011 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Suva during
October 24–November 4, 2011. The consultation (Country Report No. 12/44) was completed by the
Executive Board on January 20, 2012. Fiji is on a 12-month cycle with the concurrence of the
authorities. The 2013 Article IV consultation was delayed owing to the authorities’ request to better
align the consultation with the authorities budget schedule.
Safeguards Assessment: The first-time safeguards assessment of the Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) was
finalized in January 2011 and found key safeguards elements in place. The RBF publishes annual
financial statements that are both prepared and audited in accordance with internationally
recognized standards. The assessment confirmed, however, that the level of autonomy of the RBF is
very low with the legislation supporting a wide scope of political interference. Proposed
amendments would address some but not all of these weaknesses; alternative measures were
recommended by the staff for others. An action plan has been put in place where there is capacity
to prepare IFRS financial statements and commenced with the financial statements for the year
ended 2010 during 2011.
Resident Representative: The Regional Resident Representative Office for Pacific Islands based in
Suva, Fiji was opened on September 13, 2010 and the office covers Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands,
Micronesia, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. Mr.
Yongzheng Yang is the resident representative.

WORLD BANK-IMF COLLABORATION
(As of September 30, 2013)
The Bank and Fund country teams led by Mr. Vivek Suri (World Bank Lead Economist, East Asia and
the Pacific) and Mr. Chikahisa Sumi (IMF Mission Chief for Fiji) maintain a close working relationship
and have an ongoing dialogue on a range of macroeconomic and structural issues.
Cooperation over the past year has included World Bank participation in the August 2013 Article IV
mission to Fiji. The Bank’s participation facilitated discussions with the authorities in areas of mutual
interest such as social protection, civil service reform, and growth priorities.
Based on the above cooperation, the Bank and Fund teams continue to agree that Fiji's main
macroeconomic challenges are to safeguard fiscal and external stability, as well as address structural
obstacles that are impeding growth. The authorities have accelerated reforms in recent years, but
the key policy challenge remains to raise the potential growth, reduce unemployment and increase
resilience to shocks. The need for faster and deeper structural reform is urgent to boost investor
confidence, reduce the economy’s supply bottlenecks and raise the absorptive capacity in order to
take full advantage of a potential increase in foreign and domestic investments following the
planned elections in 2014. These obstacles are detailed in the main text of the report, but some of
the structural reforms seen by the Bank and the Fund as macro-critical include:


Increased efficiency of land use, which is critical for Fiji’s growth prospects and economic
diversification.



Price decontrol, to re-establish price signals and encourage investment.



Sugar-cane sector reform, to revitalize a key sector. The government has made good plans
for reforming the sugar-cane sector, including using the by-products of sugar production for
ethanol and electricity generation. However, the issue of unstable land lease, aging workers,
lack of larger-scale mechanization, and obsolete and poorly maintained facilities are longterm challenges. With EU preferential purchase agreements expiring, it is imperative to
continue the reform efforts to ensure the industry remains viable



Civil service reform. The authorities have made some progress with civil service reform.
Over the medium term, functional reviews are required to identify core service areas and
ensure that the structure of the public service remains appropriate.



Public enterprise reform. The pace of implementation of reforms of other public
enterprises aimed at improving services and reducing fiscal costs needs to be accelerated.
These reforms will help reduce the government’s direct and contingent liabilities, help
ensure fiscal sustainability, and promote growth.



Review of the social safety net. Fiji has recently achieved significant gains in protecting the
vulnerable through the strengthening of social safety nets. From this point, efforts should
continue to enhance the definition of eligibility criteria, improve targeting, and increase
coverage of vulnerable groups. A stronger safety net will help to ensure the success of Fiji’s
reform agenda.



Tax policy and administration reform. Efforts to broaden the tax base should continue,
including review of the tax incentive regime. Fiji continues to benefit greatly from TA in this
area provided by the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Center (PFTAC) located in Suva.



Debt management. Debt management strategies should be geared toward careful
evaluation of and optimization between all policy options and building up buffers.



Strengthening statistical capacity and statistics. Fiji should ensure that it continues to
develop personnel with the capacity to produce accurate and timely economic statistics.
Good statistics are important both for macro policy formulation and good public financial
management (e.g. establishment payroll and wage bill control). Fiji continues to benefit from
a broad range of statistical advice from PFTAC.

The Bank and Fund teams agreed to continue close collaboration going forward. Appendix I details
those activities that the Bank and Fund will work on over the coming year.

RELATIONS WITH THE PACIFIC FINANCIAL TECHNICAL
ASSISTANCE CENTRE1
[As of September 30, 2013]
Background
Fiji has been PFTAC’s largest user of TA in recent years. The revenue sector has been the main
area of focus. PFTAC has supported FIRCA in a comprehensive modernization process including the
development of enhanced corporate planning, simplified income tax legislation and streamlined
personal income taxation policies and procedures. There has also been significant progress made in
the Statistics area with improved national accounts balance of payments and price statistics. In the
PFM area, support has been focused on building internal audit and accounting capacity while in
macroeconomics the focus has been on building modeling skills, including for potential natural
resource revenues.
PFTAC TA aims to sustain the authorities’ progress on fiscal consolidation and enhance the
framework for macroeconomic policy making. In the fiscal area, revenue will continue to be the
main focus as the authorities are keen to improve revenue performance.
Strategy 2013-2015
PFTAC’s TA strategy is guided by the APD regional strategy note and is planned within the results
framework for the current PFTAC funding cycle.2
PFTAC TA aims to support the authorities sustain progress on fiscal consolidation and
enhance the framework for macroeconomic policy making. In the fiscal area the majority of
inputs will continue to be in the revenue area with support on PFM systems and fiscal forecasting.
Enhanced statistics will support strengthened modeling capacity in RBF and Ministry of Finance
which should ensure policy makers are better informed.
In the Public Financial Management area, the main focus will be assisting in strengthening
weaknesses identified in the 2012 PEFA assessment. This may include assistance in looking at the
roles, responsibilities and structure of the Ministry of Finance. Areas of specific follow-up assistance

1

The Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) in Suva, Fiji, is a regional technical assistance
institution operated by the IMF with financial support of the AsDB, Australia, New Zealand, Govt. of
Korea and the EU. The Centre’s aim is to build skills and institutional capacity for effective economic and
financial management that can be sustained at the national level. Member countries are: Cook Islands,
Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea,
Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.

The specific result in the framework that activities target is identified in italics in the section, for example
cash management is referred to as (1.6), where 1.6 is the code in the result framework in the program
document.

will be influenced by the action plan drawn up following the PEFA (1.2) but are likely to be focused
on strengthening accounting and financial reporting processes and systems, formal adoption of
IPSAS, transition to accrual accounting (perhaps drawing on IMF HQ expertise), budget execution
(1.4), and continuation of training budget officers in methods for budget preparation/analysis.
Assistance in cash and debt management may also be a focus (1.6), if resources are available. PFTAC
will coordinate closely with the ADB’s PEM TA project.
In the revenue area, Fiji is one of the regional leaders in terms of administrative processes but is
keen to improve revenue performance. PFTAC assistance will focus on (i) finalising the legislation for
PAYE Final Tax to enable the laws to be promulgated; (ii) implementing PAYE Final Tax; planning for
and implementing VAT self assessment; and reviewing the planned changes to FRCA’s operating
model and structure relative to the implementation of PAYE FINAL and self assessment. PFTAC will
also follow up on recommendations arising from the strategic review of FRCA’s information
technology processes carried out in August 2012 and contribute to the enhancement of FRCA’s
capability to manage the fiscal regime for the mining sector and international tax issues.
In statistics, the focus of support will be further development of the national accounts. The ultimate
aim is to have quarterly national accounts estimates being produced by 2014 (4.4), but in advance of
that PFTAC will support the finalization of rebased estimates planned for September 2013 (4.1, 4.2).
PFTAC will also support the development of GDP estimates by expenditures with the expectation to
produce draft estimates by December 2013 (4.1) and will continue to provide limited follow-up on
price indices with support from IMF HQ (4.8). IMF HQ will also provide support for enhancing
balance of payment statistics and government finance statistics.
In financial sector supervision, the PFTAC advisor will continue to be available for consultations
with RBF staff and will work on regional issues with the RNF’s head of bank supervision who is
executive director of AFSPC. APRA, who had provided the bulk of TA in this sector recently indicated
that it will be scaling down its support to the RBF following a policy change at AusAid. RBF
subsequently indicated that it will be increasing its involvement with the TA program provided by
PFTAC, especially as it pertains to Risk Based Banking Supervision training. It will further request
technical assistance during the anticipated Credit Union’s legislative and oversight modernization
program of that sector.
In the macroeconomic area, work will focus on building macroeconomic modeling and analysis
capacity in RBF (5.1, 5,2) with the aim of having better inflation and external forecasts to feed into
monetary policy making (5.3). Key projects include measuring core inflation, empirical work on
identifying the long-run determinants of inflation, development of macroeconomic models for Fiji,
and improvements to RBF’s financial programming framework and toolkit for external sustainability.
In the fiscal area, past work helped to evaluate MoF’s revenue forecast and make methodological
improvements; current work is focused on developing a framework for debt sustainability analysis,
drawing on the Fiscal Management Model for Fiji that resulted from an earlier PEM TA project (5.4).

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of September 30, 2013)
The Asian Development Bank (AsDB) has approved 19 loans totaling $317million. The AsDB has
approved 83 TA projects, totaling $27.3 million since 1970. AsDB opened a Pacific sub-regional
office in Suva in June 2004, servicing Fiji Islands and five other Pacific nations.
Following the military coup of December 2006, AsDB’s disbursements and TA operations were
suspended. In April 2007, AsDB adopted an Approach to Reengagement for Fiji Islands which allows
for the completion of activities ongoing at the time of the December 2006 coup, but not approval of
a new country partnership strategy or new operations until Management judges that five criteria
have been met viz.(i) whether a new loan would expose ADB to additional legal or political risks
associated with the country’s financial obligations; (ii) whether the de facto government is in
effective control of the country and enjoys a reasonable degree of stability and public acceptance;
(iii) whether the de facto government generally recognizes the country’s existing international
obligations; (iv) the number of countries that have recognized the de facto government or dealt with
it as the government of the country; and (v) the attitude of other international organizations toward
the de facto government. While the first four criteria have been met, the stance of some AsDB
member countries towards the government and Fiji Islands’ suspension from the Pacific Islands
Forum and the Commonwealth remain problematic. Periodic reports, to update AsDB’s Board on the
evolving situation in the country, are prepared in line with the Approach to Reengagement.
ADB’s assistance has focused on completing activities ongoing at the time of the December 2006
coup. Supplementary financing of $26.8 million was provided in 2009 for the Third Road Upgrading
Project, while $23.0 million was provided for the Suva–Nausori Water Supply and Sewerage Project
in the same year. As an exception, the Emergency Flood Recovery Project loan of $17.56 million was
processed and approved in 2009. All three projects are expected to be completed by the end of
2013. ADB is providing ongoing technical assistance, most recently for state-owned enterprise (SOE)
reform, and provided two grants from the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund of $1 million each in
February and April 2012 following the floods. Fiji also participates in regional technical assistance in
areas such as climate change, public sector management, and information and communication
technology. In February 2013, a country diagnostic study, jointly supported by the Economic
Research Department and Pacific Subregional Office, commenced in Fiji to identify critical
constraints to growth of the economy. The study is expected to be completed by November 2013.
AsDB undertook a review of country portfolio performance in 2010. While AsDB-financed projects
have not experienced significant counterpart resource constraints to date, the sustainability of the
absorptive capacity of various government agencies particularly as a result of the migration of
skilled staff to implement programs is a long-term concern.
When the conditions for reengagement are in place, a Country Partnership Strategy will be prepared
with Government. Future operations would likely include areas where there is a clear poverty
alleviation focus, both within AsDB’s traditional sectors of assistance in Fiji Islands and also in
relevant areas prioritized under AsDB’s Strategy 2020. Grant co-financing and capacity building
technical assistance are also likely to play important roles in any future strategy.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Despite significant shortcomings in some areas, especially GDP and balance of
payments data, core economic and financial data provided to the Fund are generally adequate
for surveillance. Macroeconomic data are in the process of improving, owing in part to the
considerable technical assistance provided by the Fund and PFTAC in recent years.
The Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) publishes the Annual Report, the Quarterly Review, and the
monthly Economic Review. The Fiji Bureau of Statistics (BoS) publishes a quarterly Current
Economic Statistics and a monthly Statistical News. The Ministry of Finance and National Planning
(MoF) issues the Budget Address and the Supplement to the Budget Address on an annual basis.
All of these publications are received by APD on a regular basis.
Formal participation in the GDDS commenced on May 9, 2000, marked by the posting of the
metadata on the IMF’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. The metadata were last updated
in November 2002.
National Accounts: Production-side estimates of GDP at current and constant prices are
available up to 2011. Revised data were published in April 2013 using the 2002 Household
Income and Expenditure Survey, a new business census, and estimates of the informal sector.
Expenditure-side GDP data in constant prices are not available and expenditure-side GDP data in
current prices are only available through 2005. The authorities are currently refining the
methodology for estimating GDP from the expenditure side. In addition, GDP broken down by
income is only available through 2005.
Price statistics: CPI data are published monthly, with data available up to August 2013. The BoS
is currently updating the CPI weights from the current 2008 base using results of the 2008/09
Household Expenditure and Income survey.
Government finance statistics: While Fiji has provided metadata for central government
operations and central government debt, the metadata were last updated in 2005. Fiji last
reported data for publication in the IMF’s Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) in
2006. The authorities have participated in the regional GFS capacity building project funding by
the Government of Japan, sending participants to regional training in 2012 and 2013 and
receiving a TA mission in January 2013. Data for budgetary central government has been
compiled and advances have been made in collecting the source data required to expand
coverage to general government. The authorities are encouraged to review and update the
GDDS fiscal metadata and resume reporting data for publication in the GFSY and commence
reporting in the International Financial Statistics.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF FIJI

Monetary and financial statistics: Data on the central bank, other depository corporations
(ODCs), and other financial corporations (OFCs) are comprehensive and provided to APD and
STA on a regular and timely basis. Progress has been achieved by the RBF in most areas of the
collection, compilation, and dissemination of monetary and financial statistics (MFS), leading to
the introduction of the standardized reporting forms for the central bank, ODCs, and OFCs. This
resulted in the publication of data aligned to the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual
(MFSM) in the RBF’s website and International Financial Statistics. The full implementation of the
November 2005 workshop and January 2008, July 2011, and April 2012 missions’
recommendations will constitute a very important step towards the compilation in a timely and
efficient manner, of monetary statistics fully consistent with the MFSM and Monetary and
Financial Statistics Compilation Guide. Efforts are now concentrated in improving source data for
ODCs and OFCs and compiling a financial corporations survey with full institutional coverage.
Financial soundness indicators are not reported to STA.
Balance of payments: Balance of payments statistics weaknesses persist and there is a need to
improve the coverage, classification and compilation methodology of the external sector
statistics (ESS). Fiji reports its balance of payments data for dissemination purposes in the
Fund’s International Financial Statistics (IFS) and in the Balance of Payments Statistics
Yearbook (BOPSY). BoS has undertaken a number of actions that were recommended to improve
timeliness in ESS dissemination and to enhance consistency with the sixth edition of the Balance
of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6), albeit at a slow pace.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Fiji is a GDDS participant.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 20, 2013

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Fiji
On November 4, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Fiji.1
Growth in the Fijian economy increased to 2¼ percent in 2012, supported by income tax cuts,
low interest rates and the one-time payouts under the Fiji National Provident Fund (FNPF)
reform, which offset the negative impact of the severe floods and Cyclone Evan on the
agriculture and tourist sectors. Inflation declined as imported commodity and food prices
moderated. With a lower-than-budgeted deficit of 1 percent of GDP, Fiji’s debt-to-GDP ratio
continued to decline in 2012. The financial sector is stable and international reserves have
stabilized to a comfortable level. However, unemployment remains stubbornly high at nearly 9
percent, with youth unemployment and underemployment at significantly higher rates.
Emigration pressures continue especially among the higher skilled. Economic growth is set to
increase to around 3 percent in 2013. The latest available indicators suggest accelerating growth
momentum in the first half of 2013 boosted by increases in disposable income, bank borrowing,
and rising investment. These effects are likely to taper off somewhat in the latter part of 2013. In
2014, growth is projected to moderate to 2¼ percent.
The current macroeconomic policies are broadly appropriate. Fiji’s fiscal policy continues to
balance the need to strengthen the fiscal position against the need to increase public investment
to support growth. The 2013 deficit target of 2.8 percent of GDP is on track to be met, with
strong VAT revenue collections and somewhat slower-than-planned expenditures in the first half
of 2013. In view of muted inflationary pressures, the accommodative stance of monetary policy
is appropriate.
The authorities have recently accelerated structural reforms—including in the areas of land
policy, the sugarcane sector, the civil service, public enterprises, and pensions—but key policy

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
challenges remain to sustainably raise economic growth, reduce poverty, and increase resilience
to shocks. To achieve higher growth and reduce unemployment, faster and deeper structural
reform is now urgently needed. It is particularly important to expand Fiji’s capacity to utilize
effectively an expected increase in foreign and domestic investment following a successful
transition to democratic parliamentary government in 2014.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed Fiji’s improved macroeconomic situation and viewed the current
configuration of policies as broadly appropriate. Directors encouraged the authorities to use the
present stable environment to accelerate the pace of structural reforms in order to support
sustainable, higher and broad-based growth and to reduce vulnerability to shocks.
Directors observed that fiscal policy is rightly balancing the need to strengthen the fiscal
position against the need to increase growth-enhancing public investment. They welcomed the
authorities’ plan to reduce fiscal deficits, while increasing capital spending to clear
infrastructure backlogs. While recent income tax cuts are growth friendly, Directors stressed the
need to broaden the tax base and to manage current expenditures to create space for capital
investment, lower public debt, and build buffers against external shocks. They welcomed the
reform of the Fiji National Provident Fund, while noting that potential risks arising from the
option of lump sum payment would need to be managed carefully.
Directors saw the accommodative monetary policy as appropriate in view of low inflation and
high unemployment. They welcomed the overall soundness of the financial sector and the
rebound of credit growth from low levels but called for enhanced monitoring of sectors with
rapid credit growth. In the event inflationary pressures emerge, Directors advised using open
market operations to reduce excess liquidity and, if needed, tighten policy rates. Directors
welcomed the initiatives for financial inclusion.
Directors noted the continued gradual appreciation of the real exchange rate and called for
periodic reviews and adjustment if necessary, of the level of the peg to avoid abrupt step
devaluations. Most Directors also saw merit in more flexible exchange arrangements.
Directors encouraged the authorities to eliminate remaining exchange restrictions and to
continue to strengthen the Anti-Money Laundering/Combatting the Financing of Terrorism
(AML/CFT) regime.
Directors welcomed the recent progress in structural reforms. However, to raise Fiji’s potential
growth, reduce its vulnerability to shocks, and alleviate poverty they saw a need for deeper and

Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

faster reforms. Priority should be given to improving the investment climate by streamlining
government regulations, relaxing price controls while protecting the most vulnerable, increasing
the efficiency of land use, and upgrading the infrastructure. Efforts are also needed to increase
the energy supply and ensure the viability of the sugarcane industry. Directors called for
improvement in data quality.

Statement by Wimboh Santoso, Executive Director for Fiji
and Caroline Waqabaca, Advisor to Executive Director
November 4, 2013

On behalf of the Fijian authorities, we would like to express our gratitude to staff for the
1.
constructive discussions held during the 2013 Article IV Consultations from August 1-15, 2013.
This year, policy discussions focused on the need to raise potential growth, reduce the country’s
vulnerability to shocks and further reduce poverty. The authorities remain committed to
implementing key structural reforms that will improve the efficiency of the public sector and
encourage more private sector investment in the economy. Authorities broadly agree with the thrust
of the staff report and the analysis and recommendations in the report which serve as a useful
reference for pursuing efforts to achieve sustainable inclusive growth and macroeconomic and
financial stability. Nevertheless, there have been several recent developments in Fiji since the
mission concluded which may be beneficial to the Board of Directors as additional supporting
information for their discussion in the board meeting. This statement outlines the authorities’ views
on the recent 2013 Article IV Consultation report and highlights the strategic policy priorities for
Fiji.
Updates on the Fijian economy and outlook
2.
On September 6, 2013, the President gave his assent to the country’s new constitution, which
should pave the way for parliamentary elections by September 2014, and lay the foundation for
genuine democracy in Fiji by incorporating the concept of one person-one vote and support the
creation of a national identity by entrenching common and equal citizenry. As part of preparations
for next year’s elections, the authorities are working with development partners, some of whom have
pledged their assistance in cash and kind as well as provided technical experts to assist the Elections
Office.
3.
The authorities have set sustainable inclusive growth and poverty reduction through
structural reforms as the top policy priorities in their medium and long-term development plan. The
reform agenda covers various areas including monetary and financial, fiscal, public sector and private
sector, and is in line with the recommendations in the 2011 Article IV Report.
4.
The implementation of policies such as the income tax cuts, low interest rates and the
one-time payouts under the FNPF reform were the main drivers for growth in 2012, helping the
economy expand by 2.2 percent, despite the negative impact from Cyclone Evan and the massive
floods which slowed tourism arrivals by 2.1 percent and lowered sugar production by 7.1 percent.
Based on economic developments in the last few months, the authorities now estimate that the
growth rate for 2013 will be higher at 3.6 percent. The improved forecast for this year is supported
by buoyant consumption spending and investment, that will contribute to better than expected
performances in the manufacturing, communications, wholesale and retail and construction and
transport sectors. Owing to positive performances in these same sectors as well as the agriculture and
financial sectors, the economy is forecast to further expand by 3.0 percent next year. Determined
efforts by the authorities to reinvigorate the economy have seen growth improve from what was
earlier anticipated in the 2011 Article IV Report when growth for 2012 and 2013 was projected at 1.5
percent and 1.7 percent, respectively.

5.
Inflation was on a declining trend in 2012 reaching 2.5 percent (new 2008 base) by year end.
In September 2013, inflation was 3.1 percent, and is expected to fall to 3.0 percent by December,
mainly driven by movements in global food and oil prices. The current account deficit improved to
1.4 percent of GDP in 2012 led by an improved trade balance, as exports growth outweighed a
pick-up in imports. For this year, the current account deficit (excluding the purchase of Fiji Airways
aircrafts roughly 83 percent financed by a 10-year foreign loan) is forecast to increase to around 7.3
percent of GDP, mainly on account of a higher trade deficit resulting from higher imports of fuel,
consumption and investment-related goods. Higher consumption spending in the economy has
boosted imports of food, cars and household goods while the implementation of major investment
projects such as roads has led to increased importation of heavy industrial machines and equipment.
The level of international reserves is currently sufficient to cover 5 months of imports and is
expected to remain comfortable over the medium term.
The financial sector remains sound and stable, despite the negative impact from the 2012
6.
cyclones and floods as well as the implementation of banking reforms to remove and reduce bank
fees and charges. Banks remain well capitalized with low NPLs and adequate loan loss provisioning.
The insurance industry maintained its solvency requirements, posted positive and satisfactory
earnings and grew its asset size in 2012. The Fiji National Provident Fund (FNPF), which remains
the single largest supervised institution accounting for around 35 percent of total financial system
assets, recorded a slight expansion in assets last year, as the Reserve Bank of Fiji continued to closely
monitor the implementation of the institution’s reform program.
7.
The authorities are mindful of the down side risks to Fiji’s economic outlook. Possible
natural disasters given the country is now entering the cyclone season, poses a risk to this year’s
positive growth outlook. Slower growth in major trading partners particularly Australia and New
Zealand on which the country depends for trade in goods and tourism, along with the depreciation in
their currencies, and oil and food price shocks, can also impact negatively on Fiji’s external position.
The authorities continue to boost budgetary resources towards import substitution initiatives under its
Food Security Program as well as its Export Promotion Program, to strengthen Fiji’s external
position. Investment in the country’s second major 40 megawatts hydro-electric scheme now
operational in Nadarivatu is expected to bring much savings to the economy while extending power
supply to more villages and settlements. We agree that any risk of capital flow reversals from the
potential impact of UMP tapering in advanced economies, is minimal, given the current minor
portfolio flows the country has. On the risk of refinancing the US$250 million sovereign bond,
investor feedback so far has been positive with indications for continuing interest in Fiji’s sovereign
bond.
Monetary and Financial Sector Policies
8.
The authorities have maintained an acommodative monetary policy by keeping its policy rate
at 0.5 percent since October 2011. The lower interest rate policy provides an avenue for the banking
sector to support economic growth through granting credit to businesses mainly in wholesale, retail,
hotels, restaurants, manufacturing and construction sectors. Credit growth increased by 9.5 percent in
the first eight months of 2013 and authorities are mindful of the downside risk to financial sector
instability from any excessive credit growth. Therefore, strengthening prudential regulation and
supervision remain on the agenda of the authorities to ensure that NPLs are reduced with greater
provisioning and any identified risks are mitigated in the early stages by adopting risk based
supervision. Current excess liquidity levels are not expected to pose any inflationary pressures
however, the authorities remain watchful of any emerging threats to price stability. The authorities
continue to work with stakeholders on broadening financial inclusion, through initiatives such as the

loan guarantee scheme with the banks, targeted lending, financial services and other micro-finance
activities. Fiji recently won the “Maya Declaration Award” at the 2013 5th Alliance for Financial
Inclusion (AFI) Global Policy Forum, in September in recognition of its achievement in reaching by
March this year, 85 percent of its goal to provide financial services to 150,000 unbanked people by
2014. This figure has since risen to 93 percent by end September, 2013.
Fiscal Policy
9.
On the fiscal front, medium and long term fiscal reforms are still underway to gradually
reduce the fiscal deficit. For 2012, the fiscal deficit is estimated at 1.0 percent of GDP, slightly below
the estimated target of 1.6 percent. For 2013, the fiscal deficit is projected at 2.8 percent largely
reflecting substantial government grants to the Fiji Roads Authority for nation-wide infrastructure
development. At the end of September this year, the government recorded a fiscal surplus of 0.3
percent of GDP, owing to buoyant revenue collections and lower than expected spending for both
operating and capital purposes. The implementation rate of capital projects typically picks up during
the second half of the year. Going forward, the authorities have maintained their commitment to
achieving their fiscal targets within the 2013-17 Medium Term Fiscal Framework approved by
Cabinet. The authorities are confident that measures in the 2014 National Budget to be announced on
November 8, 2013, will ensure alignment with the current fiscal deficit forecasts of 2.0 percent in
2014, 1.5 percent in 2015 and 1.0 percent in 2016. The authorities agree with the staff assessment on
striking a balance between measures to strengthen the fiscal position and efforts to support growth,
recognizing the need to create more fiscal space in order to effectively respond to shocks such as
natural disasters and slowing global demand. The authorities are also committed to further reducing
the debt level, currently around 50 percent of GDP, towards the medium term target of 45 percent.
To date, the Government has saved up to US$128 million in its offshore sinking fund account for the
US$250 million bond repayment in 2016, and has targeted to raise this balance to US$150 million by
year end.
10.
Building on tax measures implemented last year, the government introduced further tax
measures in 2013, to attract investment and support growth in the economy. The relocation of ANZ
Bank’s Pacific headquarters to Fiji from Australia early this year, is a positive response by the market
to the lowering of corporate tax rates by the government for companies that establish their regional or
global headquarters in Fiji. To help provide income tax relief to low income earners, the income tax
exemption threshold was increased almost doubling the minimum threshold over the last five years.
At the same time, efforts to enhance revenues, simplify and strengthen tax administration and
improve compliance, continue. Fund assistance is being sought towards the introduction of a tax
self-assessment program and towards implementing the current Pay As You Earn tax as a final tax
wherewith all personal taxable allowances will be removed. Indirect tax measures, particularly VAT,
are expected to boost overall revenues, and help to offset lower collections from reduced direct tax
rates. Authorities will continue to scrutinize discretionary duty and tax concessions to curb revenue
losses while balancing this with allowing concessions to support development purposes. Over the
past two years, the authorities have consistently transferred a number of concession items under its
Section 10 Standing List to the Customs Tariff list, effectively removing ministerial control over
these items. Expenditure policy has been directed to priority areas such as infrastructure, essential
services and poverty reduction. Huge infrastructure spending this year is expected to improve
productivity and access to services while promoting growth and equality in the economy. The
Government continues to extend measures through its social welfare system, to protect the poor and
alleviate poverty, introducing for the first time this year pensions for senior citizens over 70 years of
age who do not have any form of income or pension or have been under such scheme.

Exchange rate policy
11.
The authorities agree with staff that more exchange rate flexibility is desirable, and will
continue to internally assess the options for introducing future periodic reviews and adjustments to
avoid large disruptive step devaluations. Under the current fixed exchange rate regime, basket
weights are reviewed annually and adjusted accordingly, to reflect recent bilateral trading patterns
with major trading partners.
Structural Reforms
12.
The authorities agree with the need to push for further reforms and remove the structural
impediments that hinder investment towards lifting the country to a higher growth trajectory and
sustainable development.
13.
Progress on public service reforms continues. The Functional and Regulatory Review Office
continues to work closely with government ministries to review the current regulatory environment,
systems and processes, to enhance service delivery and produce a modern public service that is lean,
efficient and accountable. On land reforms, the government recently lifted the moratorium on
agricultural land allowing landowners the option of converting agricultural land for residential,
commercial or industrial use. This allows the areas surrounding Fiji’s towns and cities to be utilized
for other productive purposes including building of new homes, which will increase the value of land
and returns from it, providing landowners with a greater sense of security. Reforms in the sugar
industry remain vital given that a large portion of the population is dependent on the sector. Ongoing
efforts to revitalize the industry and convert it from a sugar to a sugar-cane industry remain a
challenge, especially with the lack of key development partner support and in the face of the
impending expiry of the current preferential agreement with the EU. Nevertheless, reform efforts
have begun to show encouraging signs through the replanting program, the renewal of long term
leases and diversification efforts, which are returning confidence and stability to the industry.
14.
On FNPF reform, steps were taken to adopt an actuarial fair pension conversion rate,
establish a more robust governance framework, separate the pension business from the accumulation
fund and adopt solvency requirements for each fund under the FNPF. In addition, efforts will
continue on rehabilitating major non-performing assets to recover value over time, modernizing the
FNPF Act to strengthen governance, and introducing prudential guidelines for proper supervision, to
ensure prudent and sustainable delivery of retirement savings in the best interest of its members. The
FNPF has progressively increased its offshore investments to around 9 percent of its portfolio and
aims to further raise this to 20 percent over the medium term. Under its pension reform, the FNPF
reduced the pension conversion rate for single life and joint life annuities. Authorities are aware of
possible fiscal risks from the pension reforms highlighted by staff and will put appropriate measures
in place to mitigate any negative implications from these.
15.
The objective of price controls has been to provide protection for poor households through
reasonable levels of prices for selected core commodities on a temporary basis until the market is
able to provide fair prices for these basic items. At the same time, authorities are mindful of the
distortions to market mechanisms that price controls create and acknowledge the need to scale these
back. Additionally, the administrative costs and disincentives for investment attached to price
controls, can negatively impact on economic activity. Authorities will continue to work with
stakeholders to improve the regulatory environment, reduce uncertainties for businesses and
encourage more investment.

Final remarks
16.
To conclude, the authorities are committed to safeguarding Fiji’s economy and the financial
system against shocks while maintaining monetary and fiscal prudence. Continuing to implement
structural reform measures is essential to secure growth momentum in the medium and long-term.
Reducing poverty remains a major priority for the authorities.
17.
The authorities welcome the recommendations to urgently improve data coverage and quality
particularly in the balance of payments and national accounts sectors, including GDP by expenditure.
Strengthening the Fiji Bureau of Statistics Office with technical assistance from development
partners is very important to ensure timely and high quality of statistical information. We thank the
Fund for its assistance so far through headquarters and the PFTAC office in Fiji and look forward to
working closely with it on the recommended areas for improvement.
18.
Finally, the authorities would like to thank staff for their efforts in producing this
comprehensive assessment on Fiji’s recent economic and financial developments and policy
recommendations. Looking ahead, the authorities deem that maintaining close collaboration between
authorities and the Fund is a vital part to improving value added contributions to both sides,
especially in increasing the effectiveness of the surveillance role of the Fund.
