IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Japan

On July 29, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Japan.
Economic growth has slowed due to weak private consumption and sluggish investment, and
inflation has lost its forward momentum. While financial conditions remain accommodative,
falling stock prices and the appreciation of the yen have resulted in a modest tightening. The
authorities responded to the weaker domestic and external economic environment through
additional monetary and fiscal support, including the adoption of the negative interest rate
policy, plans for additional fiscal stimulus, and the postponement of the scheduled 2017
consumption tax hike by two and a half years.
Nevertheless, the outlook for growth and inflation remains subdued. Private consumption is
projected to grow modestly and weakness in the global recovery and trade, higher uncertainty,
especially in the wake of the Brexit referendum, and the recent appreciation of the yen will likely
pose a drag on net exports and investment. Consequently, the economy is expected to expand at a
moderate pace of about 0.3 percent in 2016, before slowing to 0.1 percent in 2017, excluding the
possible effect of the yet to be adopted economic stimulus package. Over the medium term
growth is projected to be in line with potential (which is on a declining trend), while inflation is
expected to rise to about 1 percent. Additional fiscal support could boost growth in the near term,
but downside risks dominate in the medium term relating to weak external and domestic demand,
uncertainty about the sustainability of low interest rates in a high public debt environment, and
financial stability risks in the context of unprecedented monetary easing. These risks may affect
the financial system which so far has remained sound and resilient, with good capitalization and
a declining NPL ratio.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
While Abenomics made initial headway in boosting expectations and revitalizing the Japanese
economy, structural impediments and policy shortfalls, especially on the structural side, are
making it difficult to achieve a sustained lift off. In particular, low confidence in economic
growth prospects is holding back investment and credit demand. Labor market duality and
inflexibility are hampering wage growth and the financial sector’s support of risk-taking is
limited. In addition, the stop-go nature of fiscal policy and optimistic growth assumptions
underlying medium-term budget projections have left fiscal policy without a credible mediumterm anchor and are contributing to policy uncertainty. Weak monetary transmission, sluggish
wage-price dynamics, and a falling natural rate of interest are preventing the needed rise in
inflation expectations, creating a communication and credibility challenge for the BoJ.
Abenomics has also faced external headwinds, with global weakness and volatility complicating
matters. Sluggish global growth and overcapacity in the traded goods sector prevented the
weaker yen from materially boosting exports. Declining commodity prices failed to boost
activity as expected, but instead put downward pressure on headline inflation and forced the BoJ
to repeatedly push out its timeline for hitting the inflation target. Moreover, concerns in
emerging markets and revisions to the expected path of monetary policy in advanced economies
led to heightened volatility in financial markets and safe haven appreciation pressures. In light of
this, while Japan’s 2015 external position was moderately stronger than the level consistent with
medium-term fundamentals and desired policies, the subsequent appreciation of the real effective
exchange rate has moved it towards a level consistent with medium-term fundamentals suggested
by the 2015 assessment, while it may undermine the effort to lower deflation risks.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the initial success of Abenomics and the authorities’ forceful
implementation of policies to lift growth and inflation. Nevertheless, growth remains subdued
and deflation persists, on the back of weak consumption, lackluster private investment, and
sluggish exports. Directors noted strong headwinds from a weak global recovery, the
appreciation and volatility of the exchange rate, and adverse demographics. They generally
agreed that a comprehensive and coordinated policy upgrade is now needed to achieve the
ambitious targets on growth, reflation, and fiscal consolidation.
Directors considered structural reforms as an essential component of the reloaded Abenomics,
aimed at raising productivity, labor supply, and potential growth. They supported labor market
reforms to reduce duality and increase labor force participation by female, older, and foreign
workers. As part of the overall policy mix, Directors generally saw a role for policies that could
help generate wage-price dynamics without excessive interference in market mechanisms. In

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

this regard, they welcomed the decision to lift minimum wage growth, and recommended
consideration of options to strengthen incentives for companies to raise wages and promote
flexible labor contracts. Directors stressed the importance of complementing these measures
with fiscal and monetary demand support, carefully balancing short-term growth with the
medium-term objectives of fiscal sustainability and financial stability. They cautioned that,
absent a full policy upgrade, macroeconomic policies may need to be recalibrated, implying
larger fiscal consolidation needs and a looser monetary policy over a longer period of time,
which could increase potential risks, with negative spillovers to the global economy. In this
context, Directors took note of the recent announcements of the additional monetary easing and
economic stimulus plans.
Directors underscored the need to chart a credible course for fiscal consolidation to place debt
on a downward trajectory, reduce policy uncertainty, and create near-term fiscal policy space.
They broadly agreed that a pre-announced path for gradual but sustained increase in the
consumption tax, insofar as it is administratively feasible, would mitigate any negative impact
on the economy and enhance policy credibility. Directors also recommended containing social
security spending growth and broadening the tax base.
Directors encouraged further efforts to strengthen policy frameworks, particularly fiscal
institutions. Most Directors saw merit in the adoption of spending rules and an independent
assessment of the outlook and budget projections, noting that the authorities’ initiatives to
enhance the existing framework are in the right direction. Directors emphasized the need for
clear, effective communication around monetary policy and better use of forward guidance.
Directors commended the authorities for maintaining a sound and stable financial sector. They
noted that financial stability risks could nonetheless arise from prolonged unconventional
monetary policies and the delay in achieving reflation and fiscal sustainability. Directors
therefore encouraged the authorities to continue to strengthen the macroprudential policy
toolkit; and enhance the monitoring of liquidity in the government bond market, financial
institutions’ profitability, and foreign exchange risks. Efforts should also continue to improve
the resilience of regional banks and inter-agency coordination.
Directors noted the staff’s assessment that the yen appreciation earlier this year has moved
Japan’s external position toward a level broadly consistent with fundamentals. Noting that a
stronger yen would make reflation efforts more challenging, they underscored the importance of
strengthening domestic policies to mitigate inward spillovers and secure external balance over the
medium term.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Abenomics needs a significant policy upgrade to regain traction. Abenomics initially
made good progress in revitalizing the economy, but the targets for growth, inflation, and
the primary balance remain out of reach under current policies. Recognizing the risk of
falling short, the authorities introduced a negative interest rate policy, delayed the planned
consumption tax hike, and adopted additional structural reforms, but the outlook remains
weak. Abenomics can still achieve its ambitious targets through a comprehensive and
coordinated policy upgrade. In the absence of such a reload, policies and targets will need to
be reset for more gradual and realistic progress to avoid adding to volatility and uncertainty.
Ambitious income policies supported by demand stimulus are a priority to spur
inflation through wage–price pressures. This calls for (i) incentivizing profitable companies
to increase wages, (ii) raising administratively controlled wages in line with the inflation
target, and (iii) addressing labor market duality by promoting new hiring under contracts that
better balance job security and wage increases. Success will require concurrent sustained and
balanced fiscal and monetary support for demand.
A credible fiscal consolidation plan is urgently needed to address Japan’s looming
fiscal sustainability problem and create policy space. Replacing the planned 2 percentage
point consumption tax hike in 2019 with a path of gradual increases of about
0.5–1 percentage points over regular intervals until the rate reaches at least 15 percent will
better balance growth and fiscal sustainability objectives. Social expenditure reform,
especially of medical care, is urgent.
Bold structural reforms and stronger policy frameworks are needed to reinforce the
effectiveness of these policies. Reforms to improve medium-term prospects should
include (i) measures addressing the headwinds from demographics, (ii) strengthening the
medium-term fiscal framework through more independent and realistic macroeconomic and
budget projections and rules to curb expenditure, (iii) and improving monetary policy
communication and forward guidance.
Safeguarding financial stability is important to ensure a smooth transition to fiscal
sustainability and higher inflation and deal with external uncertainty. JGB markets
should be closely monitored for structural changes and measures taken to prevent sudden
dry ups in market liquidity and spikes in risk premia. Further strengthening the
macroprudential policy framework will be essential to preempt shock amplification through
macro-financial linkages.
Strengthening domestic policies is important to mitigate inward spillovers and secure
external balance over the medium term. The 2015 external position was assessed to be
moderately stronger than fundamentals. The appreciation of the real effective exchange rate
since early 2016 has moved it towards a level broadly consistent with medium-term
fundamentals suggested in the 2015 assessment but may undermine efforts to lower
deflation risks.
A supplement to this report will be issued to discuss the implications of Brexit.

ABENOMICS IS AT A CROSSROAD
1.
Abenomics met with initial success in tackling two decades of mild deflation and weak
growth. Strong coordination between the Bank of Japan’s (BoJ) unprecedented quantitative and
qualitative easing program and fiscal stimulus combined with an announcement of ambitious
structural reforms helped narrow the large output gap, reversed the undue appreciation of the yen,
eased financial conditions, boosted corporate profits, lifted actual and expected inflation into
positive territory, improved corporate governance and boosted labor force participation. The
economy reached full employment and modest, but historically significant, increases in base wages
took hold. Progress was made with fiscal consolidation.
2.
Three years after its introduction Abenomics needs a significant policy upgrade.
Inflation has lost its forward momentum and the BoJ has repeatedly pushed out its timeline for
hitting its inflation target. Public debt remains unsustainable while record corporate profits and
rising employment have failed to generate sufficient base wage growth. Investment and
consumption growth remain weak amid uncertainty surrounding the growth outlook and real
income. Finally, the global trade slowdown and effects of production offshoring have prevented
exports from benefitting substantially from the weak yen while the sharp fall in oil prices has put
downward pressure on headline inflation. To overcome these headwinds and safeguard against
associated risks, Abenomics needs a comprehensive upgrade.

Growth remains subdued. After a strong start, economic growth slowed to 0.5 percent in
2015 due to weak private consumption, hamstrung by timid wage growth despite an unemployment

While consumption picked up, investment remained weak, which could reflect increasing economic

 Debt and equity markets. The nominal yield
curve shifted down and flattened significantly
in the first half of 2016, with the 10-year benchmark JGB falling into negative territiory. The shift
in the yield curve also translated into lower lending rates and corporate bond yields, with
corporate debt issuance picking up, especially in long maturities. In contrast, equity prices
started to decline in the second half of 2015, led by finanical and energy sectors, and volatility
increased.
 Portfolio rebalancing: Households continued to increase the share of risky assets in their financial
portfolios, but the pace slowed recently, reflecting higher market volatility. Banks have
accelerated rebalancing towards domestic lending, equities and investment trusts, and foreign
securities (See Selected Issues Paper “Is Home Bias Weakening?”). Japan Post Bank continued to
reallocate investments towards foreign bonds, and similarly, life insurers, who used to actively
purchase super-long-term JGBs, increased the share of foreign bonds in their portfolios. The
Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) has almost reached its reduced target for JGB
holdings, while other pension funds continue to rebalance towards domestic and foreign
equities.

 Credit cycle. Domestic credit growth picked up in 2015 and the credit cycle continued to expand
(Table 2) (See Selected Issues Paper “QQEs Impact on Financing Conditions of Listed Firms”).
Overseas loans continued to grow rapidly as did loans for, and equity investment in, real estate.
Asset quality improved with the NPL ratio―including that of overseas loans—declining further.
Recently, financial institutions have become more cautious in extending overseas loans due to
global growth concerns, especially in emerging markets, and higher foreign currency funding
costs.
 Exchange rate. The yen depreciation started to
reverse in the second half of 2015 and its
appreciation accelerated in early 2016 to levels last
seen prior to the 2014 expansion of QQE.
Underlying drivers include safe-haven effects due
to global financial market volatility, a narrowing of
interest rate differentials with the U.S., market
perceptions of limits to BoJ’s stimulus, and a rising
current account surplus. So far the authorities have
verbally expressed concern about disorderly
market movements, but refrained from actual
foreign exchange interventions.

The weaker domestic and external economic environment triggered a sequence of
monetary and fiscal policy responses in the first half of 2016.
 Supplementary budget and earthquake relief. In January, a 0.6 percent of GDP supplementary
package was approved for FY2016.1 In addition, the government later announced a frontloading
of the FY2016 initial budget, and the Kumamoto earthquakes in April prompted the formulation
of a supplementary budget estimated to raise GDP growth by around 0.1 percent.
 Negative Interest Rate Policy: The adoption of the negative interest rate policy (NIRP) amid a
weakening of the outlook and higher global uncertainty reinforced the BoJ’s commitment to its
inflation target and added another tool to the policy framework, allowing it to be more open
ended. So far the NIRP has been successful in lowering the entire yield curve and has not
adversely impacted market functioning, beyond expected effects on JGB liquidity and bank
profitability (Figure 5). More time is needed to see its full transmission to the real economy
(Box 1) (See Selected Issues Paper “Negative Interest Rate Policy and Bank Deposit Rate”).
 Delayed consumption tax hike and planned stimulus. The authorities’ decisions to adopt
additional stimulus and to postpone the scheduled 2017 consumption tax hike by two and a half
years while maintaining the FY2020 primary surplus target, demonstrate the challenge of
1

The supplementary package focuses on (i) increased funding for medical and long-term care which involves
transfers to low-income households; (ii) boosting competitiveness in the agriculture sector through improvements in
infrastructure and measures to promote agriculture exports; and (iii) improving disaster recovery and raising
infrastructure spending.

simultaneously stimulating the economy and moving towards fiscal sustainability in a short
timeframe. While these decisions will reduce deflation risks and support near-term growth, they
will likely affect the achievement of the authorities’ medium-term fiscal target, unless abrupt
consolidation takes place, which would again undermine reflation prospects.
7.

Structural reforms progressed in some core areas.

 New “three-arrows”. In September 2015, PM Abe announced a plan to promote the “Dynamic
Engagement of All Citizens,” and a new “three-arrows” strategy consisting of: (i) a strong
economy, with a target of raising nominal GDP to 600 trillion yen; 2 (ii) childcare support to lift
the fertility rate and labor force participation; and (iii) a social security system to prevent people
from leaving employment to provide nursing care. Implementing measures remain to be
elaborated.
 Minimum wage and corporate tax. The government has been rightly calling for higher wage
increases through the tripartite dialogue and recently announced a floor of 3 percent on annual
minimum wage increases (See Selected Issues Paper “Minimum Wages as a Policy Tool”). The
government also cut the statutory corporate income tax rate below 30 percent in FY2016, one
year earlier than scheduled, to entice firms to deploy their cash, although the impact on
investment appears limited so far.
 Corporate governance reform. Progress so far includes acceptance of the Stewardship Code by
210 institutional investors; the application of the Corporate Governance code, inter alia requiring
listed companies to appoint at least two outside directors on a “comply or explain” basis; the
amendment of the Companies Act; and the launching of the JPX-Nikkei 400 index comprising
only profitable firms with good corporate governance and disclosure.
 Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). The government reached an agreement on the TPP, but the
ratification decision has been pushed back to the next Diet session in the fall. If fully
implemented TPP would raise the level of GDP by 2–3 percentage points in the long run and
associated deregulation would yield further significant benefits.

B. Headwinds and Policy Challenges
8.
Structural impediments hamper demand and wage growth. Low confidence in economic
prospects, related to an aging and shrinking population, is holding back investment and credit
demand, constraining portfolio rebalancing (See Selected Issues Paper “Impact of Demographics on
Growth and Inflation in Japan”). Labor market duality and inflexibility are limiting the pass-through
from a tightening labor market and high profits of large firms to wage increases (Figure 6).3 Weak

combining the old three arrows.

Porcellachia (IMF WP16/20) models conceptually how these features cause weak real wage growth and contribute
to deflationary pressures. Specifically, a rising share of non-regular workers who earn lower wages than regular
workers, not only reduces average wages directly, but also causes a decline in labor’s overall bargaining power,
hampering wage growth. See also Selected Issues Paper “Labor Market and Wage Developments”.

demand and a lingering deflationary mindset are
reducing the ability of firms to raise output prices.
Labor market duality is hampering lending owing to
the inability of part-time workers to obtain bank
credit, and hurting investment, corporate
restructuring and mergers and acquisitions due to
the high level of job protection. The financial sector
does not sufficiently support risk taking, limiting
access to risk-based capital, as suggested by high
reliance of banks on fixed asset collateral and slow
restructuring of non-viable SMEs.

efforts did not sufficiently address the abovementioned structural impediments, notably in the labor
market. Perceptions of weakness in the policy
framework have contributed to the tendency of the yen to appreciate when the Japanese economy
is hit by negative shocks.

periods (defined as when the SAAR real GDP growth falls below zero for at least two consecutive quarters).

10.
Global weakness and volatility constituted headwinds. Sluggish global growth and
overcapacity in the traded goods sector prevented the weaker yen from materially boosting exports
in 2014–15. Since mid-2015, concerns in emerging markets and revisions to the expected path of
monetary policy in advanced economies led to heightened volatility in financial markets and safehaven appreciation pressures, which intensified in early 2016. Declining commodity prices since mid2014 did not boost activity as expected, but instead put downward pressure on headline inflation
and forced the BoJ to repeatedly push out its timeline for hitting the inflation target.

Authorities’ Views
11.
The authorities emphasized that despite a deflationary mindset and structural
impediments to growth, policies are gaining traction. They recognized that the public’s
4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAPAN

deflationary mindset is changing more slowly than anticipated. Together with labor market rigidities,
this had led to a subdued response of wages to the very tight labor market. Low growth
expectations related to an aging and shrinking population and unfavorable external conditions had
dampened investment, exports, and credit demand, creating a challenging environment for
monetary policy. Nevertheless, the BoJ emphasized that QQE and NIRP significantly reduced real
interest rates and encouraged more risk-taking by banks as they rebalanced their portfolios away
from JGBs. The authorities also pointed out that they had met their commitment to cut the primary
deficit in half compared to the 2010 level while at the same time facilitating higher nominal growth
through flexible fiscal policy implementation. Meanwhile, structural reforms had helped to generate
a virtuous cycle between corporate profits, employment and real income, as evidenced by three
consecutive years of base wage increases.

C. Outlook and Risks
12.
Growth is expected to remain weak due to anemic consumption, lackluster investment
and fiscal drag. The economy is projected to grow in line with potential at 0.5 percent in 2016,
before slowing to 0.3 percent in 2017, excluding the possible effect of the yet-to-be-adopted
supplementary budget (Table 3).
 Consumption. Private consumption will grow modestly in 2016, underpinned by lower
commodity prices, targeted fiscal transfers, and rising labor force participation. The rising ratio
of retirees to workers, however, has increased the share of non-wage income to total net
disposable income, currently at 50 percent, making consumption less dependent on wage
developments.
 Public spending and taxation. Fiscal policy will pose a drag on growth in 2017, reflecting the
withdrawal of past stimulus and waning reconstruction spending.
 Net exports. A slow global recovery and yen appreciation are expected to dampen export
growth.
 Investment. High profits, an aging capital stock, and supportive credit conditions should provide
a favorable environment for investment. However, heightened uncertainty, sustained
appreciation of the yen and shrinking domestic markets will curb investment demand. As a
result, the expansion of the credit cycle is expected to be restrained in the medium term.
13.
Inflation will remain well below the BoJ’s inflation target. Average headline inflation is
projected to remain at around 0.2 percent in 2016, reflecting drag from low energy prices, the recent
yen appreciation, lower inflation expectations, and weakness in demand. Over time, inflation will
gradually rise, supported by energy price developments and slowly building wage-price pressures,
but with adaptive expectations progress will remain slow.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAPAN

14.
Risks to the near-term outlook are tilted to the upside from likely additional fiscal
demand support, but downside dominates in the medium term (Annex I).
 Domestic risks. Upside risks reflect the likely adoption of a substantial supplementary budget
for 2017. On the other hand, incomplete policies may lead to further appreciation of the yen,
triggering renewed deflation risks.
 External risks. A sharper-than-expected moderation of growth in China and/or weaker growth in
advanced economies – including due to the outcome of the Brexit referendum – could lead to
global financial turbulence causing safe-haven yen appreciation, potentially derailing the
recovery (See forthcoming Supplement to this report).
 Financial stability risks. If the decline in JGB market liquidity became structural, it could trigger
higher volatility in government bond yields. Moreover, risk exposures from equity price volatility
and from the rapid expansion of overseas loans could impact financial stability, particularly given
global financial volatility and rising USD funding costs.
15.
Macro-financial feedback loops could be shock amplifiers. At the core of the risk nexus
lies the sustainability of low risk premiums in a high public debt environment, and a stable financial
system in the context of unprecedented unconventional monetary policies. In this environment,
shock amplification can occur through macro-financial linkages between stagnation and deflation,
financial imbalances, or public debt dynamics (see figure). The main risk stems from loss of fiscal
confidence, leading to higher sovereign risk premiums, and forcing abrupt further fiscal adjustment
with adverse feedback loops to the financial system and the real economy. Risks from imbalances in
the financial system, although limited at present, constitute a tail risk with scope for an adverse
feedback loop if they triggered a sovereign backstop.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAPAN

Macro-financial Linkages as Shock Amplifiers

16.
Available buffers and policy responses to downside risks depend on the size and origin
of the shock. A coordinated response, making use of fiscal and monetary policies should be the first
line of defense to counter downside growth shocks. The fiscal response will need to be contingent
on the behavior of the sovereign risk premium and its impact on financial stability. Substantial
downward shocks with a large adverse impact on growth, inflation, and debt dynamics or the failure
of policies to make progress toward fiscal sustainability over the medium term could exhaust the
effectiveness of conventional buffers.

Authorities’ Views
17.
The authorities were confident that growth will pick up, and the BoJ was confident
that inflation could still reach its target in FY 2017. While noting recent weakness in
consumption, the government expected the economy to continue its modest recovery as investment
picks up and the employment and income situation improve. They noted that the decision to
postpone the consumption tax and introduce an economic stimulus package should prevent
demand from stalling and accelerate the recovery further. The authorities maintained their mediumterm growth target of 2 percent underlying the fiscal consolidation plan and would update their
medium-to long-term projections this summer. The BoJ noted that their inflation forecast hinged on
inflation expectations becoming more forward-looking and rising towards the target during their
timeframe, triggered by the emergence of a positive output gap, rising actual inflation, and their
strong commitment and recent policy actions. The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s risk
assessment, but highlighted that external factors dominated, including the slowdown in overseas
economies and volatility in global financial markets.

GETTING ABENOMICS BACK ON TRACK
Under current policies, the high nominal growth goal, the inflation target, and the primary budget
surplus objective all remain out of reach within the timeframe set by the authorities. A comprehensive
and coordinated policy upgrade, centered on income policies, would significantly increase chances of
achieving Abenomics’ ambitious targets. In the absence of such a reload, targets and policy
frameworks would need a reset to be consistent with a protracted adjustment process. More
unorthodox policy packages could pay dividends, but entail unacceptable risks at the current juncture.

A. Reloading Abenomics: Comprehensive and Coordinated Policy Package
18.
The staff’s reload package puts income policies at the fore in order to raise inflation,
combined with further demand stimulus in the near-term based on a temporary, modest,
fiscal expansion and further monetary easing. Ensuring coordinated demand support while
tackling labor market reforms and removing policy uncertainty will create important synergies. To
maximize long-term sustainability, these policies should be enshrined in stronger policy frameworks
and high-impact structural reforms to raise growth and address demographic headwinds.

Invigorating wage-price dynamics to raise inflation
19.
Sustained nominal wage increases can help trigger positive wage-price dynamics and
raise inflation expectations. A deflationary mindset and a secular decline in the bargaining power
of labor have led to upward wage inflexibility, while a rising share of non-regular workers with lower
wages has dampened average wage growth. This highlights the need for policies to directly target
the wage formation process and reforms to reduce labor market duality. Higher wages passed on to
prices will boost actual and expected inflation which would stimulate economic activity through
lower real interest rates and support fiscal consolidation.
20.
Despite important steps to encourage higher base-wage increases, bolder measures
are required to trigger positive wage-price dynamics.
 Income policies: The government could replicate the “comply or explain” approach adopted
under the corporate governance reform to ensure that profitable companies raise wages by at
least three percent (the inflation target plus average productivity growth) and back this up by
stronger tax incentives or penalties as a last resort, given that the latter would be contractionary
if they failed to trigger higher wages.5 In addition, the government can commit to raising
administratively controlled wages annually in line with the inflation target and ensure similar
policies are adopted at the prefectural level. These measures can be supported by calling for
supplementary wage rounds in addition to the “Shunto” and conversion of bonuses to base pay.

5

In FY 2014, about 78,000 enterprises made use of the tax incentives leading to foregone fiscal revenue equivalent to
0.05 percent of GDP. Applying the incentive to base wages and increasing the amount would raise the effectiveness
of the measure.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAPAN

 Labor market and corporate governance reforms: Promoting “intermediate” contracts that
balance job security and wage increases, including by clarifying the legal framework and
providing subsidies for converting non-regular workers to such contracts, would reduce labor
market duality and reinforce income policies provided new hiring is done under these contracts.
It would also stimulate productivity growth through greater incentives for skill formation.
Moreover, accelerating the recently introduced “equal-pay for equal work” program would help
close the wage gap between regular and non-regular workers faster. Eliminating disincentives to
full-time or regular work due to the tax and social security system such as the spousal deduction
and allowance, as well as raising the availability of child-care facilities through deregulation
remain critical. Further corporate governance reform—such as more ambitious requirements for
outside directors, greater transparency of beneficial ownership and explicit limits on crossshareholdings—would encourage corporates to use their high cash reserves more efficiently,
which could result in higher wages, dividends, and investment.
21.
More sustained, balanced, and coordinated demand support is needed to ensure the
success of income policies. To facilitate the pass-through of higher wages to prices it is imperative
that monetary and fiscal policy give a balanced and sustained growth impulse in the near term,
warranting a modest near-term fiscal expansion, calibrated on the need to accelerate the closing of
the output gap. Supportive demand policies are also critical to ensure that structural reforms to raise
potential growth such as policies to boost labor supply do not create deflationary pressures. Fiscal
stimulus should be coordinated with further monetary easing, where all policy tools should remain
on the table. Given the overriding importance of signaling the need for a comprehensive and
balanced policy package, there are merits in using all tools: some overall increase in asset purchases,
some shift to purchases of assets held outside the banking system, and a modest further cut in
deposit rates. Fiscal and monetary actions should be closely coordinated in terms of timing, mix,
and level of stimulus.6
22.
Generating wage-push inflation is not without risks and success is not guaranteed. The
main aim of income policies is to raise wages and prices in tandem, without increasing unit labor
costs, distorting relative prices, or undermining competitiveness. Nevertheless, incomes policies
may not successfully raise inflation, if for instance, firms increase hiring of non-regular workers, if
there are timing and coordination problems, if “comply-or-explain” policies do not deliver sufficient
compliance, or if there is the perception by firms or households that policies can be reversed.
Possible declines in competitiveness and profitability—especially for labor intensive SMEs and
export-oriented companies— could have an adverse impact on employment and growth in the near
term. Finally, efforts to increase public wages are likely to encounter political resistance in light of
ongoing fiscal consolidation plans.

6

In particular, building on their 2013 joint statement, the Government and BoJ could deepen their consultations–
through the established Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy–on macroeconomic conditions and how to most
effectively support income policies.

Achieving fiscal sustainability through reliance on gradual consumption tax hikes
23.
A credible fiscal consolidation course needs to be charted now, including a preannounced path of gradual consumption tax hikes (Figure 8 and Table 4). Given low potential
growth, and the need to avoid leaning excessively against the BoJ’s easing policies, committing to a
gradual increase in the consumption tax towards at least 15 percent, e.g., in increments of
0.5–1 percentage points over regular intervals, would better balance the objectives of supporting
growth and achieving fiscal sustainability in the long run. The precise path should be determined
mindful of the need to secure political buy-in, compliance costs for firms, and the administrative
burden for the tax authorities. Starting the increases as soon as possible and replacing the currently
planned 2019 hike with such a pre-announced, gradual path would enhance the credibility of the
long-run fiscal adjustment effort, reduce uncertainty for consumers, and avoid large intertemporal
shifts in spending around the time of the tax hikes (See Selected Issues Paper “Fading Ricardian
Equivalence in Ageing Japan”). The single rate structure should be maintained as much as possible
and concerns for the tax impact on low income households addressed by targeted cash transfers. A
steady fiscal consolidation by 0.5 percent of GDP per year through 2030 would be sufficient to put
the public debt-to-GDP ratio on a downward path. In addition to the consumption tax increase,
broadening the tax base, containing nominal social security spending growth to 0.5 percent and
implementing some other expenditure reforms would balance the adjustment between revenue and
expenditure side.7

Complementary policies to lift potential growth and strengthen policy frameworks
24.
More structural reforms especially in the labor market are the only viable option to
significantly raise growth prospects. A stronger push on structural fronts would increase the
chances of success of income policies by improving the effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policy
and raising growth expectations. In particular, reforms should aim to: 8
 Expand the labor force. Boosting the labor supply of women and older workers and allowing for
more foreign labor would be crucial to address a shrinking working-age population and protect
the tax base.
 Increase productivity. Significant benefits can be reaped from: (i) promoting trade, FDI, and
technology sharing by supporting the full implementation and possible expansion of TPP as well
as proceeding with other trade and bilateral investment agreements; (ii) reducing barriers to
entry to retail trade, professional services, and certain segments of network industries; and
(iii) expediting deregulation in Special Economic Zones (SEZs) and subsequent rolling out
nation-wide reforms to improve productivity and provide investment opportunities.
 Enable capital deepening. The financial sector’s role in promoting innovation and new growth
areas could be enhanced by encouraging securitization and private-equity funds; reducing

government guarantees to SME lending to promote restructuring of viable firms and exit of
nonviable ones; and fostering business succession.
25.
The fiscal framework should be strengthened to enhance policy credibility. The
authorities’ medium-term consolidation plan of achieving primary surplus by FY2020 should avoid
relying on optimistic growth assumptions, which undermines confidence by masking the required
amount of structural adjustment, leaving fiscal policy without a medium-term anchor. The
authorities use the revitalization scenario to anchor their policies, which expects more than
2 percent real and 3 percent nominal annual GDP growth over the medium-term on average. Their
more realistic baseline case anticipates a primary deficit of more than 2 percent of GDP in FY2020.
Strengthening the fiscal framework requires adopting rules to curb expenditure, especially on social
security, limits on the use of supplementary budgets, and publication of more independent
assessments of the outlook and budget projections (See Selected Issues Paper “An Independent
Fiscal Institution for Japan”). Social expenditure reform, especially of medical expenses, has taken on
added importance as fiscal revenues are being delayed. To this end, an independent fiscal institution
(IFI) could play an important role, including by preparing short and medium-term macro-fiscal
forecasts, and providing real time monitoring of fiscal policy making (Box 2). This would allow the
Ministry of Finance to adopt realistic macroeconomic assumptions.
26.
Clearer communication and better use of forward guidance can help strengthen
monetary policy credibility and raise inflation expectations. The BoJ has gradually enhanced its
transparency and communication framework over the past two decades. However, more can be
done to improve monetary policy credibility and reduce policy uncertainty by publishing the staff
forecast (Box 3). The BoJ could provide stronger forward guidance, including by communicating
willingness to overshoot the inflation target and maintaining a large balance sheet, even once
objectives are achieved, to strengthen its commitment and facilitate portfolio rebalancing.
Moreover, while maintaining the BoJ’s pre-specified time horizon for meeting its inflation target has
merit during the transition phase to higher inflation, its function as a commitment mechanism
should be gradually phased out as inflation expectations become better anchored.

B. Resetting Targets and Policies to Prepare for the Long Haul
In the absence of an ambitious policy shift, the timeframe for achieving all targets should be pushed
out and policies reset for steady but more gradual progress while building risk resilience. By embarking
on more realistic goals, these measures would help strengthen policy credibility and reduce
uncertainty. Nevertheless, compared to staff’s reload package, the reset option would generate weaker
nominal growth, higher and prolonged fiscal consolidation needs, and render the economy more
vulnerable to fiscal confidence and financial stability shocks.
27.
Policy space will be very limited and should be used sparingly. Without ambitious
income policies and the associated comprehensive reforms, an expansionary fiscal policy stance
could be counterproductive by raising risk premiums. Nonetheless, the weak outlook suggests that
the fiscal stance will need to be broadly neutral in the near term. Similarly, since achieving the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

JAPAN

inflation target will take longer, loose financial conditions will have to be maintained for an
extended period. Hence, monetary policy would have to be reset for the long haul and carefully
balance the benefits of providing further easing with the potential risks to medium-term financial
stability, including JGB market liquidity, the profitability of financial institutions, disintermediation,
and reduced market functioning, and limits to JGB purchases and negative interest rates.
28.
The resulting weak inflation and low growth require a drawn-out fiscal consolidation
and a more flexible monetary policy framework. Absent higher nominal growth, the required
fiscal adjustment would be cumulatively larger and have to take place over a longer time horizon to
avoid an excessive drag on growth, implying greater vulnerability to shocks. A gradual fiscal
consolidation by about ¼ to ½ percent of GDP per year in structural terms would need to be
maintained for as long as needed to turn debt dynamics around. The monetary policy framework
would need to become more flexible, with the BoJ abandoning the use of a specific calendar date
for achieving its inflation target. While such a shift should raise BoJ credibility by setting a more
realistic goal, the transition will need to be well communicated to avoid perceptions that the BoJ is
reducing its commitment to achieving its inflation target and to limit the potential for adverse
market reactions, including yen appreciation.

C. Unorthodox Polices to the Rescue?
29.
More unconventional policy packages have merit but could be risky compared to the
staff’s reload package. Unorthodox policy packages typically mentioned in Japan’s context include
a monetized fiscal expansion, a sharp fiscal expansion combined with continued low interest rates,
or a price level path target supported by a complementary exchange rate policy (Svensson’s
foolproof proposal). While these packages could generate reflation quickly, helping to reduce
government debt, they are subject to various risks. On balance staff analysis suggests that the reload
package has a better chance of success than these more unconventional policy alternatives from a
risk-return perspective.9 For example, if aiming for “escape velocity” through highly expansionary
fiscal policy leads to an increase in the term premium, government debt dynamics would deteriorate
further. Likewise, under the foolproof proposal, if the interest premium does not decline as
envisaged, the policy would rely mainly on expenditure switching. Inflation then fails to converge to
the inflation target and output only increases initially, worsening debt dynamics relative to the
reload package. In staff’s judgement, as the financial market reaction to these alternatives are
difficult to predict, relying on a broad set of instruments in a coordinated manner would be
preferable from a risk-management perspective.
30.
Likewise, risks from the oft-discussed monetized fiscal expansion likely outweigh
benefits. While this approach is likely to increase inflation expectations and nominal GDP, thus
reducing public debt, there is a major tail risk of an inflation scare leading to a spike in interest rates.
This could occur as the commitment to not resort again to monetary financing may not be credible
in an environment of elevated deficits and high debt, leading to fiscal dominance. The impact on
9

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAPAN

Japan’s prosperity and the global economy (given the role of the yen and JGBs in international
markets and Japan’s large NFA position) of such a tail risk scenario would be so severe that a riskreturn calculus would again favor the reload package.

Authorities’ Views
31.
The authorities argued that current policy frameworks are broadly appropriate. The
authorities stressed that the delay of the consumption tax and the planned implementation of
comprehensive and bold economic policies this autumn all aim to accelerate Abenomics in a
coordinated manner to achieve the promised targets. The authorities noted that public sector wages are
set based on private sector developments and that income policies are already incorporated in the
current policy package through the tripartite negotiations, the increase in minimum wage growth, and
the provision of tax incentives to firms that raise wages, and that it is necessary to consider the effects of
the policy at this point. They understood the need to consider the impact on the economy when
designing a consumption tax hike, but noted compliance costs for firms and the administrative burden
for the tax authorities due to gradual consumption tax increases. They also recognized the need for more
independent assessments of economic and fiscal developments, but felt this could be accomplished by
strengthening existing institutions.
32.
The BoJ maintained that the practice of mentioning the timing for reaching its inflation
target as a collective forecast of the policy board was useful for communication purposes.
Removing it was not needed given its forecast and its efforts to maintain credibility and raise
inflation expectations. In addition, the BoJ voiced concern that publishing a staff forecast could lead
to confusion given that the board members’ projections are already made public. Nevertheless, the
BoJ was aware that the current policy communication framework might be revisited if the BoJ judges
sometime in the future that it would take a considerably longer time to achieve two percent
inflation. More extreme unconventional policies, such as various forms of monetization, had been
offered as solutions to Japan’s woes in the past, but were seen as too risky and to varying degrees
not feasible within Japan’s current legal and institutional set up.
33.
The authorities remained determined to achieve the FY2020 primary surplus target.
They emphasized that the target constitutes an important commitment to debt sustainability and is
realistic under the current fiscal consolidation plan which calls for accelerated structural reforms
combined with expenditure reforms. In particular, building on achievements during the past 3 years,
the government will make efforts to enhance efficiency and promote institutional reforms, under the
benchmark of the levels equivalent to the sum of the expected increase due to population aging
(approximately 1.5 trillion yen in 3 years) until FY2018. The delay of the consumption tax should
have only a modest impact on the achievement of the fiscal consolidation target in FY2020 as its
primary impact is to shift the revenue increases from FY2017 to FY2019.
34.
The authorities emphasized that ongoing structural reforms are already in line with
staff’s advice. Efforts are underway to promote the improvement of involuntary non-regular to
regular workers. Also in order to provide women and young people with a wide range of choices on
how to work, consideration is being given to achieving equal-pay for equal-work. Removing

disincentives in tax and social security to full time work for spouses remains on the agenda. Efforts
to invite foreign professionals into the country have gained momentum, including through a
possible Japanese-version green card system for highly skilled foreign professionals. Finally, the
authorities noted that upcoming structural efforts will focus on product and regulatory reform and
deregulation in the services sector, and that they are considering changes to the credit guarantee
scheme.

SAFEGUARDING FINANCIAL STABILITY
Safeguarding financial stability, particularly in the context of prolonged unconventional monetary policy,
low growth, and demographic trends, remains essential.
35.
Preserving financial stability requires progress in upgrading macroeconomic policies.
Overall, the financial system has remained sound and resilient, with good capitalization and a
declining NPL ratio (Table 5). For the time being, systemic risks stemming from unsustainable public
finances are contained by the strong domestic demand for JGBs and the effects of the BoJ’s
quantitative easing policies which are keeping the sovereign’s funding cost and refinancing risks to a
minimum. However, over the medium term, failure to achieve reflation and higher growth and the
likely resulting absence of progress toward fiscal sustainability will create increasing vulnerabilities
from low nominal growth and low profitability as well as from possible reemergence of risk premia.
Moreover, in such a scenario, the likely need for prolonged unconventional monetary policies could
engender financial stability risks. Conversely, the financial system could help to reduce the likelihood
that these downside risks materialize and support growth in the medium term by adapting business
models, consolidation, and improving risk management to support more risk-taking by SMEs.
36.
Financial sector policies should safeguard the liquidity of JGB markets. Market

significant price impacts than before.11 Together with the increase in foreign participation in the JGB
market, these developments may expose the JGB and funding markets to higher volatility. In
addition to the recent measures taken which have helped to enhance liquidity, the authorities could
further strengthen their monitoring by regularly assessing the impact of developments in inventories
of primary dealers on their market-making activities.12
37.
Lower profitability and higher FX risks related to funding liquidity and international
equity holdings of financial institutions warrant close monitoring.
 Banks. The flattening of the yield curve has been putting pressure on net interest margins and
profitability, especially for regional banks which rely more on domestic activity. Moreover, the
sharp rise in USD funding cost since last year has increased FX funding pressure on banks
(Figure 4), as nearly 15 percent of their FX lending is funded by short-term market sources,
exposing them to rollover risk. The authorities have encouraged banks to secure stable deposit
bases in major foreign currencies. In addition, the authorities should ensure a sufficiently high
liquidity coverage for significant foreign currencies if FX loans keep growing more rapidly than
corresponding FX deposits. Finally, market risk associated with equity holdings has increased
due to higher volatility.
 Institutional investors. Insurers and pension funds have accelerated the rebalancing of their
portfolios towards more risky assets such as foreign bonds and equity. Most of the principal is
hedged against FX risk but interest and dividend income remain largely exposed. The surging
USD funding costs are raising the cost of these hedges which have shorter maturities than the
underlying assets. As a result, some life insurers appear to have increased purchases of
unhedged foreign bonds, raising concerns about their FX risk, as the USD funding cost could rise
further. Finally, the yen appreciation has significantly reduced profits derived from international
holdings.
38.
The resilience of regional banks should be bolstered through further regulatory
reforms. Major banks are on track to meet the Basel III capital and liquidity requirements according
to the phasing-in schedule. However, regional banks are facing additional challenges given lower
profitability, higher interest rate risk, and high real estate and FX exposures. The authorities should
reform the regulation of regional banks, including the required level of capital and the calculation of
risk-weighted assets while enhancing some elements of the core capital. Consolidation could help
improve profitability, but has been slow.
39.
The authorities have made significant progress to strengthen the macroprudential
policy (MaPP) framework, but inter-agency coordination could be further improved. Recent

Recent measures include (i) allowing for consecutive use of its Securities Lending Facility for a longer period,
(ii) raising the upper limit on the amount of sales per issue in February 2016, (iii) regularly publishing the bond

efforts include (i) establishing a macroprudential office in the FSA, (ii) launching the Council for
Cooperation on Financial Stability between the FSA and the BOJ at the management level, and
(iii) holding a monthly meeting between the MoF, FSA, and BoJ at the staff level for information
sharing on international financial and capital markets. However, the FSA and BoJ could continue to
intensify their cooperation via enhanced sharing of systemic risk assessments and findings from
supervisory activities. In addition, although the FSA has the ultimate responsibility and discretion to
implement regulations related to MaPP, it is important to ensure that the respective roles of the BoJ
and FSA in managing the relevant tools remain clear. The upcoming FY2017 FSAP will make a
detailed assessment.
40.
Reduction in corresponding banking relationships (CBRs) has not been observed. A
reduction in the provision of cross-border financial services by Japanese banks, especially CBRs, in
response to reduced risk-taking or regulatory changes has not been observed, but the situation
should be monitored.

Authorities’ Views
41.
The authorities highlighted the recent progress made to safeguard financial stability
and promote economic growth. They pointed out that absolute bank profits are still close to
historically high levels despite some recent declines. In addition, the expansion in overseas lending
required enhancing banks’ risk and credit assessment capacity. In response to the potentially
increasing FX liquidity risk, the authorities felt that supervisory dialogs regarding enhancing banks
risk management should be carried out, rather than imposing one-size-fits-all FX liquidity
requirements. The authorities expressed concerns over external risks, particularly the high leverage
in Asia and emerging markets resulting from the global monetary easing and which could be
affected by the slowdown in China and the Fed’s tightening. They noted that the adverse effects of
NIRP on bank profitability were limited and emphasized that the overall effect would be positive
once effects on economic growth and credit demand materialize and banks progress further in
adapting business models to cope with a structurally flat yield curve. The authorities have
encouraged regional banks to change their business models from collateral-based lending to
business potential-based lending and indicated that consolidation of regional banks should be
decided by themselves voluntarily as a management decision. The FSA highlighted the recent
progress in strengthening the macroprudential policy framework, acknowledging the need to
continue close inter-agency information sharing.

EXTERNAL POSITION AND SPILLOVERS
42.
The current account improved in 2015, due to declining oil prices and a weaker
currency. The goods trade balance increased, reflecting a significant reduction in the energy import
bill, while the services balance improved due to higher travel service receipts, boosted by rising
tourist arrivals in particular from China (Table 6). The income balance remained high, reflecting
Japan’s large and increasing net foreign asset position, relatively high rates of return on its net
foreign assets and the yen depreciation. The limited response to the oil windfall together with fiscal

remained very low and concentrated in the region—and are modest even when scaled by the
market capitalization of recipient countries. Going forward, capital outflows are expected to
strengthen further against the backdrop of ongoing NIRP and the diverging monetary policies in
other advanced economies, while the weaker outlook for emerging markets and higher USD funding
costs could be restraining factors.

Japan has absorbed global shocks during episodes of global risk aversion due to its
safe-haven status. As exemplified during the recent increase in market volatility, the yen tends to
appreciate during risk-off episodes, providing some offset to the associated decline in global
demand. Japan’s QQE policies and the associated confidence and expectations effects have had
modest positive spillovers on emerging Asian economies.13 Portfolio outflows, which are expected to
accelerate as portfolio rebalancing continues, foreign direct investment and the continued
expansion of Japanese banks abroad have been associated with positive spillovers.

45.
Strengthening domestic policies is important to mitigate inward spillovers and secure
external balance over the medium term. Inward spillovers from the slowdown in emerging
markets, bouts of global financial volatility, and lower oil prices are posing a challenge for Japan’s
efforts to raise growth and reduce deflation risks. The 2015 external position was moderately stronger
than the level consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies (Annex II). The
appreciation of the real effective exchange rate since early 2016 has moved it towards a level broadly
consistent with medium-term fundamentals suggested in the 2015 assessment while it may
undermine the effort to lower deflation risks. Strengthening domestic policies remains the most
effective tool to reduce deflation risks and increase resilience. Without bolder structural reforms and
credible fiscal consolidation, domestic demand could remain sluggish, and any further monetary
easing could lead to overreliance on depreciation of the yen. In this context, exchange rate
intervention should not be used as a policy tool nor aim at a specific exchange rate level, but reserved
to respond to disorderly market conditions, preferably coordinated with international partners to
ensure effectiveness.

Authorities’ Views
46.
The authorities accepted the 2015 external assessment, but expressed some concerns
about the staff’s approach. They noted that Japan’s strong current account position in 2015 mainly
reflected its income balance and falling oil prices, and expressed concern that the external
assessment methodology did not fully take these dynamics into account. Moreover, the authorities
stressed that the assessment should focus only on 2015 to avoid that references to developments in
2016 could be interpreted as a premature assessment for 2016.
47.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to mobilize all means to contribute to the
global economy. They emphasized that the planned acceleration of the pace of structural reform
and the deployment of the upcoming fiscal stimulus reflected the joint G7 commitment to
strengthen policy responses in a cooperative, forceful and balanced manner. Moreover, the
authorities noted that, as the G7 and G20 agreed, excess volatility and disorderly movements in
exchange rates can have adverse implications for economic and financial stability.

STAFF APPRAISAL
48.
The outlook for growth and inflation remains subdued with downside risks
dominating in the medium-term. Despite a tight labor market, domestic consumption and
investment remain sluggish and the weakness of the global recovery and yen appreciation are
combining with adverse demographics to create an uncertain outlook. Inflation will remain subdued
amid modest wage growth, rising gradually over the medium term but remaining below the BoJ’s
inflation target. The authorities have responded with welcome additional monetary and fiscal
support and plans for additional structural reform.
49.
Following initial success, achieving Abenomics’ ambitious targets now requires a
further comprehensive and coordinated policy reload. Income policies and labor market reforms
are a priority to generate wage-price pressures and lift nominal growth. Companies should be

22

induced to increase base wages while administratively controlled wages should be raised in line with
the inflation target. Labor market contracts that better balance job security and wage growth should
be promoted and disincentives to work full time abolished. Coordinated fiscal and monetary
demand support will be crucial to facilitate the pass-through of higher wages to prices and the
implementation of structural reforms.
50.
A credible fiscal consolidation course needs to be charted now, including a preannounced path of gradual consumption tax hikes. Together with social security reform, a
gradual but sustained increase in the consumption tax would address the looming fiscal
sustainability problem, reduce policy uncertainty, and create policy space. Such a gradual and steady
approach is essential to better balance support for growth and progress toward fiscal sustainability.
51.
Structural reforms and strong policy frameworks are needed to raise productivity,
address the demographic overhang, and enhance policy credibility. Structural reforms should
focus on boosting domestic labor supply, enhancing the financial sector’s role in promoting new
growth areas, and fully implementing trade and bilateral investment agreements. Stronger fiscal
institutions, including an independent assessment of the outlook and budget projections, should
lend credibility to fiscal policy and help curb expenditure. Clearer communication and better use of
forward guidance by the BoJ could strengthen monetary policy credibility and raise inflation
expectations.
52.
In the absence of a clear policy upgrade, policies will need to be reset for a prolonged
adjustment. The required fiscal consolidation would be larger and take place over a longer time
horizon, implying greater vulnerability to fiscal confidence and financial shocks. The BoJ would have
to abandon its pre-specified time horizon for meeting the inflation target and maintain loose
financial conditions for an extended period, requiring a careful balancing between benefits of
further easing and the costs to medium-term financial stability.
53.
Financial stability risks could emerge from prolonged unconventional monetary
policies or the failure to achieve reflation and fiscal sustainability. The financial sector remains
stable overall. However, JGB market liquidity appears to have fallen and financial institutions face
declining profitability and elevated market and FX risks due to increased risk-taking, which should
continue to be closely monitored. Measures to safeguard financial stability should include
enhancing the monitoring process of JGB market liquidity and strengthening the MaPP framework.
54.
Strengthening domestic policies would help mitigate inward spillovers and secure
external balance over the medium term. While the 2015 external position was moderately
stronger than the level consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desired policies, the
appreciation of the yen since the beginning of 2016, has moved it toward a level broadly consistent
with medium-term fundamentals, suggested in the 2015 assessment, and may undermine the
Japan’s efforts to lower deflation risks.
55.

It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12-

month cycle.

Box 1. Effectiveness and Limitations of the Negative Interest Rate Policy (NIRP) in Japan1
On January 29, the BoJ complemented its QQE program by announcing a negative interest rate on financial
institutions’ excess reserves held at the Bank. The intention was to (i) put downward pressure on short-term interest
rates while at the same time reinforcing QQE’s effect on the entire yield curve, and (ii) raise inflation expectations by
dispelling concerns that QQE had reached its limit and reconfirming the Bank’s commitment to its inflation target. To
mitigate the direct impact on the earnings of financial institutions – which might be significant with excess reserves of
more than 50 percent of GDP and more than 25 percent of total bank assets–the BoJ introduced a three-tiered reserve
deposit system where only the top tier receives a negative interest rate of -0.1 percent (currently accounting for
10 percent of total reserves).
The NIRP helped lower market rates and accelerate portfolio rebalancing. Immediately following the introduction of
the NIRP, the yield curve shifted down and flattened, with the 10-year benchmark yield falling below zero. Similar to
European peers with NIRPs, the impact on short-term money market rates has been almost complete with the interbank
funding rate (3-month TIBOR) falling from 17 bps at the beginning of the year to 6 bps. Lending and deposit rates have
also fallen, but the impact has differed across banks—reflecting banks’ different funding models. Meanwhile, financial
institutions accelerated the rebalancing of their portfolios in search of higher yields. Corporate debt issuance picked up,
especially in long maturities, as firms took advantage of low interest rates.

However, it is too early to assess NIRP’s full impact on the economy. In particular, higher asset prices and inflation
expectation have been overshadowed by lower stock prices amid yen appreciation, a slowing recovery, and persistent
doubts about the ability of the BoJ to reach its inflation target. Hence, it is too early to judge the full impact of the NIRP as
the second-round effects on credit demand and economic activity have yet to be fully observed.

Box 1. Effectiveness and Limitations of the Negative Interest Rate Policy (NIRP) in Japan
(concluded)
The NIRP raised concerns about market functioning and the profitability of financial institutions. As money
market rates dropped into negative territory, transactions and amounts outstanding declined. In the call markets,
investment trusts including money reserve funds and money market funds reduced their lending due to difficulties
in managing assets with a negative rate. In addition, many financial institutions on both the lending and borrowing
sides experienced practical difficulties in trading at negative rates, highlighting the need to upgrade IT systems. In
the JGB markets, measures constructed from transaction
data point to a decline in the market liquidity in both
futures and cash market after the introduction of the NIRP
(Figure 6). While bank profitability, already affected by
QQE, is likely to be further squeezed under the NIRP, the
direct impact has been offset to a large extent by the
three-tier system. Staff estimates that, to completely offset
the decline in net interest income, domestic loans need to
grow at an annual rate of about 4 percent, which is higher
than similar measures for most euro area economies, and
above the 3 percent average growth rate since the
introduction of QQE in April 2013.2 That said, major banks
could partly offset such losses by raising fee income or
cutting operational costs. However, the room for regional banks to do so may be limited due to high competition.
What are the limitations to the BoJ’s NIRP? Effectiveness of NIRP will depend on the trade-off between its ability
to stimulate growth and the associated financial costs. Several factors are likely to impact this net benefit
calculation. First, prospects of additional stimulus through lower interest rates may be limited due to weak credit
demand and already very low interest rates and inflation expectations. Second, compared to their European peers,
Japanese banks’ higher dependence on customer deposits might make it harder to pass through the NIRP to
lending rates.3 Third, bank profitability in Japan has been declining and further deterioration could impact credit
intermediation, particularly for regional banks. Fourth, while the current three-tiered system limits the direct impact
on profitability, it does not encourage banks to move existing excess reserves into riskier investments, mitigating
the policy impulse. Finally, how low and long the NIRP can go is affected by individual and corporate willingness to
store cash, which in turn depends on storage, transportation, convenience, and insurance costs.4 Taking these
factors together, there is a danger that wide spread skepticism about the efficacy of NIRP could by itself limit its
effectiveness by preventing inflation expectations from rising. Therefore, it is crucial that monetary easing is
complemented by other policies and reforms.

Box 2. Reforming Japan’s Fiscal Framework: Merits of an Independent Fiscal Council1
There are benefits to improving the fiscal policy framework in Japan towards greater credibility and
transparency. Japan’s fiscal policy has been conducted mostly in a discretionary manner, reflecting political
cycles and reactions to unanticipated shocks. For example, the 1997 Fiscal Structural Reform Act included
specific consolidation measures in major policy areas with an aim to reduce the headline fiscal deficit to
3 percent of GDP by 2005, but was suspended one year after its introduction partly due to its lack of flexibility in
the face of the Asian financial crisis. A medium-term framework was adopted in 2006 to achieve primary balance
in 2011, but it was abolished due to the global financial crisis. A three-year framework was created in 2010 to
contain primary spending, but this ended in 2012 when the current cabinet took office. The current cabinet set a
fiscal benchmark for FY2018 and a primary surplus target for FY2020, but the macroeconomic scenarios
underpinning them are overly optimistic. Mid-year supplementary budgets are the rule rather than the
exception—at least one every year and 41 since 1990. All combined, Japan’s fiscal framework creates policy
uncertainty and leaves fiscal expectations unanchored.
An independent fiscal institution (IFI) could play an important role in Japan, given its large adjustment
needs. With unsustainable debt, concerns about future JGB financing, and a drawn out fiscal consolidation
ahead, formulating a credible medium-term framework is essential. As part of this effort, an IFI could help
improve the quality and transparency of fiscal policy by providing real-time forward-looking surveillance of fiscal
policymaking in terms of its budgetary and macroeconomic consequences and to assess debt sustainability and
risk. Japan already has two councils providing advice on fiscal policy: the Fiscal System Council (FSC) (an
advisory board to the Finance Minister whose members include academics, business leaders and other experts)
and the Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy (an advisory board to the Prime Minister, whose members
include PM, ministers, the governor of the BoJ, academics and business leaders). While they play an important
role, neither of these councils meets the main attributes enumerated in the OECD Principles for IFIs: ownership;
independence and non-partisanship; mandate; resources; relationship with the legislature; access to information;
transparency; communication; and external evaluation.
Drawing on the successful experience of IFIs with a sufficiently long track record, designing an IFI in
Japan would involve the following considerations:2


Functions: should include preparation of short- and medium-term macro-fiscal forecasts analysis of the
government’s fiscal policy stance, reflected in the budget bill; oversight of compliance with the
government’s own medium-term fiscal goals; and assessment of public debt sustainability on the basis of
long-term quantitative scenarios, possibly adjusted for risk. The government would be required to respond
to reports produced by the IFI. While the FSC provides proposals for fiscal consolidation and produces longterm projections, it does not perform an analysis of the macro-fiscal forecasts of the government and
compliance with its medium-term fiscal goals.



Statutory basis: the IFI should be created through informed debate and legislation with broad political
consensus; although formally affiliated to the Diet, or with no affiliation at all, the IFI must enjoy de facto
independence; and the coverage of its remit may need to be extended beyond the national government, to
the rest of the public sector.



Structure: the IFI can consist of an individual head or a collective leadership, but its assessments and
projections should be based on impartial, expert opinion.

Box 3. Strengthening the Bank of Japan’s Communication Framework1
Effective BoJ communication, followed by consistent policy action, is essential to defeat Japan’s
deflationary mindset. Policy predictability and credibility are crucial for the central bank to impact long-term
interest rates, anchor inflation expectations, and reduce excessive asset price volatility. Achieving these objectives
requires the public to have a good understanding of the policy setting process and underlying assumptions. For
the BoJ, communication is likely to play a particularly important role because (i) with the policy rate close to the
effective lower bound, guidance about future policy actions is vital; and (ii) the BoJ faces the formidable challenge
of anchoring inflation expectations at a level well above those observed during the past two decades.
The adoption of an explicit inflation target in January 2013 constituted a major advance in transparency. It
was followed in April by the introduction of QQE and a pre-specified time-dependent guidance of achieving the
target “at the earliest possible time within a time horizon of about two years,” and “to continue with QQE until
2 percent inflation has been achieved in a stable manner.” The initial impact of the regime change was a boost to
policy credibility and a rise in inflation expectations. The BoJ took further measures to improve its transparency and
accountability framework late in 2015, including issuing a quarterly report discussing the baseline outlook and
associated upside and downside risks, providing board members’ point estimates for inflation and GDP growth,
and disseminating minutes and summary opinions from Monetary Policy Meetings.
However, three years have now past and long-term inflation expectations remain below the 2 percent
target. The fact that financial markets have been caught off guard repeatedly—when the BoJ adopted new easing
measures or made technical changes to its framework and when policy stayed passive despite a deteriorating
inflation outlook—indicate a low degree of policy predictability that at times has created uncertainty about the
BoJ’s commitment.
To reduce policy uncertainty and impact inflation expectations, the BoJ should clarify its current guidance
while strengthening the coherence of its monetary policy framework:


Move away from a pre-specified time horizon for meeting the target. This is particularly important in the absence
of a coordinated and comprehensive reload of policies. While the time-dependent guidance was intended to
demonstrate the BoJ’s strong commitment to reflate the economy, the opposite may have been achieved given
the large and persistent gap between BoJ and market forecasts for inflation and the fact that monetary policy
has, at times, remained passive in the face of large adverse shocks. Repeatedly pushing out the time horizon
for hitting the target has undermined policy credibility.



Clarify which inflation measure drives policy decisions. While the BoJ’s explicit inflation target is defined in terms
of headline inflation, board members and staff projections are specified in terms of a core measure that
excludes fresh food prices. Declining oil prices induced the BoJ to develop a third measure labeled core-core
inflation, excluding both energy prices and fresh food, to flag underlying price pressures. To avoid volatile
components such as energy prices from triggering changes in policy expectations or de-anchoring long-term
inflation expectations it is important that the BoJ clearly states which measure drives policy.



Publish the BoJ staff baseline forecast with confidence bands together with underlying policy assumptions. This
would (i) enable the Bank to present its detailed near-term outlook without a false sense of precision;
(ii) improve the public’s understanding of the relationship between policy instruments and the outlook; and
(iii) provide a useful reference point for Board members to discuss dissenting views.



Discuss alternative scenarios. This would clarify implications of selected shocks, or of basic differences in
forecast assumptions that may exist among policymakers. It would generate a better understanding of the
BoJ’s approach to managing the macroeconomic risks, and thus help improve policy predictability. It also
would reinforce that the baseline forecast is conditional.

(Over next 1–3 years)
 Successful
reflation
following
comprehensive
reforms

Low
Aggressive monetary policy
easing and a credible mediumterm fiscal and growth strategy
with incomes policies could lead
to a virtuous cycle of high
growth and positive inflation.

Impact and Policy Response
High. Credible policy frameworks with incomes policies and shortterm demand stimulus would quickly raise inflation and growth and
restore confidence in fiscal sustainability and medium-term growth
prospects.
Policy response: The BoJ should prepare a credible exit strategy.

 Persistently
low energy
prices

Medium
Supply factors may reverse only
gradually and partially, and/or
weaker-than-expected
aggregate global demand may
keep energy prices lower than
currently expected under the
WEO baseline.

Low. As a net oil importer (windfall gain of 1.6 percent of 2015 GDP),
Japan will benefit from higher real incomes of consumers and lower
production costs, but actual and expected inflation would fall further
reducing wage growth.
Policy response: The BoJ should ease further to prevent second-round
effects, including on wage bargaining, and strengthen its
communication framework by clarifying the indicators used to assess
whether inflation is on track.

 Protracted
period of
slower growth
in Euro Area
and Japan

High
Weak demand and persistently
low inflation from a failure to
fully address crisis legacies and
appropriately calibrate macro
polices, leading to “new
mediocre” rate of growth.

Medium. The output gap would widen and growth potential could
be adversely affected complicating efforts to restore public debt
sustainability.
Policy response: Despite limited policy space, the government should
deploy additional measures on all policy fronts (including incomes
policies) in order to restore growth and inflation momentum and
maintain confidence in Abenomics.

 Bond market
stress from a
reassessment of
sovereign risk
in Japan

Medium
Abenomics falters, resulting in
an eventual return of depressed
domestic demand and deflation
and leading to bond market
stress.

High. Staff’s DSA analysis shows that an increase in the sovereign risk
premium would worsen public debt dynamics gradually as the
average maturity is about 7 years. But such a shock could cause
distress in the financial sector with possible knock-on effects on debt.
Policy response: Fiscal policy will have to become more contractionary
and the fiscal framework needs to be strengthened, which together
with additional JGB purchases by the BoJ should contain the
immediate rise in bond yields. Unorthodox policy measures need to
be considered to support growth and inflation momentum.

 Sharp growth
slowdown and
financial risks
in China over
the medium
term

Medium
Insufficient progress with
reforms could lead to a
continued buildup of
vulnerabilities, resulting in a
significant slowdown in growth
over the medium term.

High. The recovery of exports would stall not only due to close trade
links with China but also because of safe-haven appreciation causing
a sharp correction in the stock market and sentiment.
Policy response: If the authorities commit to a credible fiscal
consolidation plan by passing concrete measures, the near-term
fiscal withdrawal could be made more gradual. Ambitious structural
reforms are important to boost domestic demand. Unorthodox
options to reflate the economy need to be considered.

 Uncertainty
related to
Brexit

High
Elevated financial volatility and
uncertainty could lead to
contagion and safe-haven
appreciation of the yen.

Low. The recovery of exports would stall and safe-haven appreciation
would cause a correction in the stock market and sentiment
Policy response: Fiscal and monetary policy space should be deployed
if elevated uncertainty starts to pose deflationary risks.

Overall Level of Concern
Likelihood
(Over next 1–3 years)
 A severe
earthquake hits
Japan

Medium
Earthquake leads to serious
production disruptions, sharp
yen appreciation and
adjustments in equity markets.

Impact and Policy Response
High. Growth and confidence would decline, together with safehaven appreciation, and equity price adjustments could hamper
domestic demand. Firms may increase production offshoring. Fiscal
position could deteriorate significantly, increasing future adjustment
needs and the risk of a jump in the risk premium.
Policy response: Despite limited policy space, the government should
deploy additional fiscal and monetary stimulus to restore growth and
inflation momentum and maintain confidence. Fiscal expansion
should be deployed together with a credible medium-term fiscal
strategy and structural reforms should be accelerated to raise
potential growth and increase confidence in the medium-term
prospects.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the
view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant
to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or
more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Nonmutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Overall Assessment

Background. The net international investment position (NIIP) position has doubled in the last ten years to close to 70
percent of GDP in 2015 (assets: 190 percent; liabilities: 122 percent). In the medium term it is projected to rise close to
75 percent with higher current account (CA) surpluses, before gradually stabilizing due to population aging.
Assessment. Vulnerabilities are limited (equity and direct investment comprise a rising share of liabilities, now at 35
percent of total). Assets are diversified geographically and by risk classes. The NIIP generates net annual investment
income at around 4 percent of GDP, keeping the current account balance positive amid a narrowing trade surplus.
Background. The 2015 CA increased to about 3⅓ percent of GDP from 0.8 percent of GDP in 2014, due to a significant
decline in the energy import bill (by about 2 percent of GDP) and an improvement in the services balance reflecting
higher tourism receipts (by ⅓ percent of GDP). Exports of goods increased by 0.9 percent in volume terms, despite the
slowdown in global trade, which reflects strength in the transportation equipment sector driven by a combination of
modest recovery in advanced economies, moving of production onshore and the release of new models. Import
volumes were weak, with goods imports declining by 1.1 percent.
Assessment. The CA assessment uses the EBA estimates, but makes adjustments to both the cyclically-adjusted CA
and the CA norm to reflect factors that are not fully captured in the EBA model. In particular:
EBA estimates the 2015 cyclically-adjusted CA at 2.8 percent of GDP which is adjusted to reflect temporary
factors (elevated energy imports with the nuclear power plant shutdown adjusted for the decline in energy
prices), to get an underlying, cyclically-adjusted CA of 3.1 percent of GDP.1/
EBA estimates the 2015 CA norm at 3.4 percent of GDP. Staff adjusts this estimate to account for factors not
captured by EBA - structurally lower exports reflecting production off-shoring and permanently higher domestic
demand and imports under structural reforms that would be implemented under complete Abenomics - to get a
norm of 1.4-2.7 percent of GDP. 2/
The underlying CA in 2015 is therefore assessed to be 0.4-1.7 percent of GDP higher than the norm, and moderately
stronger than the level consistent with desirable policies and medium-term fundamentals. 3/ The 2016 surplus is
expected to rise to about 3.5 percent of GDP under the current policy mix and due to lower oil prices. 4/
Background. The real effective exchange rate (REER) depreciated 6.7 percent between 2014 and 2015, reflecting
expansion of monetary easing in Japan and policy normalization in the US. As of June 2016, the REER has appreciated
15 percent relative to its 2015 average, reflecting the safe-haven status of Yen amid heightened risk aversion and the
narrowing of the interest rate differential relative to the US due to expectations of a more gradual increase in US
interest rates, and despite the introduction of negative rates on marginal excess reserves in Japan.
Assessment. The EBA REER Level model estimates the 2015 average REER to be 27 percent weaker (EBA Index REER
model: 33 percent weaker) than the level consistent with fundamentals and desirable policies, mainly from a large
unexplained residual as the model does not include fiscal policy and so the estimated policy gap is close to zero. Other
Japan-specific factors that affect the REER – JGB-UST spread, portfolio rebalancing, temporary speculative short
positions against the yen, and the shock requiring higher energy imports - are also not included. Because of these
missing factors, the EBA REER model is not used in Japan’s assessment. Instead, using the staff-assessed CA gap range
as reference, staff assesses a 2015 REER gap midpoint of -11 percent with an indicative range of -4 to - 17 percent.
Background. There has been a pick-up in portfolio outflows as institutional investors have begun to diversify overseas,
while FDI outflows also increased. Net short yen positions have eased from their extreme highs of last year and have
recently turned into net long yen positions, which could be a driver of the recent exchange rate strengthening.
Assessment. Vulnerabilities are limited (inward investment tends to be equity-based and home bias of Japanese
investors remains strong). So far there have been no large spillovers from QQE to domestic financial conditions in
other economies (interest rates, credit growth). If outflows from Japan accelerate, they could provide an offset to
tighter domestic financial conditions in the region due to normalization of policy rates in other advanced economies
Background. Reserves are about 30 percent of GDP, on legacy accumulation. There has been no FX intervention in
recent years.
Assessment. The exchange rate is free floating. Interventions are isolated (last in 2011) to reduce short-term volatility
and disorderly exchange rate movements.

Overall Assessment:
The 2015 external position was
moderately stronger than the level
consistent with medium-term
fundamentals and desirable policies.
Japan’s external position has
strengthened moderately relative to
2014, reflecting the reduction in its oil
import bill, the REER depreciation, and
some pickup in exports. The REER
appreciation compared to the average
of 2015 has moved the REER towards
a level consistent with medium-term
fundamentals while it may undermine
the effort to lower deflation risks.
Going forward, continued easing by
the BoJ while the US tightens,
combined with the lack of bolder
structural reforms and the absence of
a credible and specific medium-term
fiscal consolidation plan, could further
strengthen the external position.
Potential policy responses:
A more forceful and coordinated
policy package is needed to raise
growth and inflation. This includes
measures to boost wages and labor
supply, reduce labor market duality,
enhance risk capital provision, and
accelerate agricultural and services
sector deregulation. Fiscal
consolidation should proceed in a
gradual manner anchored by a
concrete plan to achieve the mediumterm target, and its conduct attuned
to economic conditions and
prospects. These ’desirable’ policies
are expected to support growth,
imports and prices, without
overreliance on yen depreciation, and
help prevent the external position
from moving out of line with
fundamentals over the medium term.

Technical
Background
Notes

Overall Assessment

1/ Last year, staff adjusted the EBA estimate of Japan’s cyclically-adjusted CA to account for factors that temporarily
reduced the CA. Those factors were delayed J-curve effects, regional tensions and higher reliance on energy imports after
the 2011 earthquake. This year the effects of these factors have dissipated except higher fuel imports. In fact, part of the
increase in Japan’s CA balance can be attributed to these factors dissipating. Furthermore, staff adjusted the impact of
elevated energy imports down to reflect the decline in energy prices.
2/ Japan’s norm is positive because of high corporate saving in excess of domestic investment opportunities, low
residential investment, and a sizable income account owing to the large NFA position and favorable return differential on
assets relative to liabilities. Staff makes two downward adjustments to the EBA CA norm: 1) Adjustment to account for the
structurally lower exports due to production off-shoring; 2) Adjustment to capture structural policies under complete
Abenomics that would permanently raise domestic demand and imports. Although fiscal and monetary policies are
captured in EBA, desirable structural policies that would lift domestic demand are not.
3/ The uncertainty in the CA gap results from (i) hard-to-quantify implications of Abenomics policies for the norm; and (ii)
uncertain effects of structural changes – higher off-shoring, reduced competitiveness of some tradable sectors – on the
trade balance.
4/ The energy balance deficit is projected to decline from 3.2 percent of GDP in 2015 to 2.5 percent in 2016.

Annex III. Debt Sustainability Analysis
Japan’s public debt is unsustainable under current policies. Although the gross debt-to-GDP ratio is
projected to rise only marginally during the WEO projection period (up to 2021) due to an
improving primary balance and a favorable differential between interest and growth rates compared
to past values, complementary analysis up to 2030 (Figure 6, bottom right chart) shows that the rise
in the debt ratio will accelerate after 2020, reaching around 280 percent of GDP in 2030.1 The debt
outlook is vulnerable to various shocks especially when financial sector shocks cause spillovers to
growth, the deficit, and the interest rate. Persistent shocks to growth and inflation could also have a
significant impact in the long run. Moreover, larger than projected public health spending is an
important downside risk. While all the debt profile indicators are below early warning benchmarks,
Japan’s extremely high financing needs point to vulnerabilities to changes in market perceptions
especially over the medium term once the Bank of Japan’s purchases of JGBs ends.
Baseline and Realism of Projections


Assumptions. The analysis is based on the following key macroeconomic projections and policy
assumptions (Table 5): potential growth will trend down from the current 0.5 percent to
0.4 percent by 2021 assuming that moderate gains from currently approved structural policies
will partially offset demographic headwinds, with actual growth being somewhat volatile in part
due to fiscal policy. Potential growth is estimated to decline further to 0.1 percent by 2030.
Monetary policy is assumed to remain accommodative during the entire projection period, with
CPI inflation gradually rising to above 1 percent over the medium term. Fiscal policy assumes the
rise in the consumption tax rate from 8 to 10 percent in October 2019 with the introduction of
multiple rates. However, offsetting measures, including to counter the expiration of the FY2016
supplementary budget, have not yet been announced and therefore are not included. As no
hikes in risk premia are assumed in the baseline, long-term interest rates are projected to only
gradually pick up, in tandem with rising inflation, to around 1¼ percent on new long-term bond
issuances. Because the average maturity of government bonds is about 7 years (including
financing bills), the nominal effective interest rate on public debt rises only gradually to
0.6 percent in 2021. This implies a favorable interest-growth differential of -0.8 with a nominal
GDP growth rate of 1.4 percent. Thanks to the second stage of the consumption tax hike, the
primary deficit will decline to around 3 percent of GDP in 2021.



Financing Needs. Japan’s gross financing need (defined as the public sector deficit, plus all
maturing debt) was 53 percent of GDP in 2015, the highest among advanced economies.
Despite the decline in the primary deficit in the next few years, the gross financing needs will
remain exceptionally large at around 50 percent of GDP over the medium term. Although the
government intends to lengthen the average maturity of JGBs, without specific plans, a similar

1

The debt ratio in 2030 is lower by around 10 percent of GDP than in the previous Staff Report due to an even more
favorable interest growth differential assumption reflecting a recent further reduction in government bond yields.

48

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAPAN

maturity structure to the one in the FY2016 initial budget is assumed throughout the projection
period.


Debt Profile. The debt financing conditions are helped in the medium-term by a number of
factors. The 10-year bond yield has been at a record low and its spread against the US is
negative at around 190 basis points. The external financing requirement, incorporating the
current account surplus, is well below the lower threshold at 5 percent of GDP. This reflects the
fact that foreign holdings of JGBs are relatively low at 11 percent. In addition, there are no direct
exchange rate risks as all debt is denominated in yen, which is assumed to remain the case in the
future.



Net Debt. Given the large financial assets held by the government, net debt is an important
indicator for Japan. It should be noted, however, that not all the financial assets are available for
debt repayment or easy to liquidate as, for example, they include assets for future pension
payments. The financial-assets-to-GDP ratio is assumed to be stable at around 120 percent.2



Realism of Baseline Assumptions.
-

Past assumptions on real growth have been neither too optimistic nor pessimistic compared
to peer countries, except for optimistic projections in 2011 when the earthquake hit. Past
forecast errors for the GDP deflator indicated a positive bias, but magnitudes were small.

-

Past assumptions on the primary balance have been neither too optimistic nor pessimistic.
While underperformance a few years ago stemmed from the response to the global financial
crisis and the 2011 earthquake, there has been overperformance since the start of
Abenomics. The size of Japan’s 3-year adjustment on a cyclically adjusted primary balance
(CAPB) basis is close to the top quartile of the historical experience for high-debt market
access countries, but the CAPB level is in the lowest quartile due to the large deficit. Fiscal
consolidation of around 0.6 percent of GDP in 2017 is assumed in the baseline, but as
argued in the main text, staff sees a need for targeting a neutral fiscal stance to maintain
growth and inflation momentum.

-

Had it not been for the planned fiscal adjustment, underlying growth would be above
potential for the projection period. This is due to a strengthening of the private-sector
recovery on the back of supportive monetary policy and declining oil prices. For the fiscal
consolidation in the baseline, the average fiscal multiplier is assumed to be 0.5, which is
lower than the default value of 1 because (i) about half of the adjustment is coming from
revenue measures (mainly the consumption tax increase to 10 percent with a multiplier of
about 0.7); (ii) offsetting rate reductions in more distortionary taxes such as the corporate
income tax; and (iii) expenditure reductions in areas with relatively lower multipliers such as
pension spending.

2

Major items include financial assets held by the Social Security Funds (about 47 percent of GDP), foreign currency
reserve (about 31 percent of GDP), and shares and other equities held by the central and local governments (about
25 percent of GDP), as of end-2014.

Shocks and Stress Tests


Fan chart. The fan chart, which incorporates feedback effects between macroeconomic variables
and relies on historical data to calibrate shocks, illustrates risks around the baseline. For
example, under the worst quartile case, the debt-to-GDP ratio could reach around 265 percent
of GDP in 2021, more than 10 percentage points higher than in the baseline. In addition, when
the possibility of positive primary balance shock is ruled out considering recent experience, the
debt-to-GDP ratio could be even higher by 5 percent of GDP in 2021.



Primary balance shock. The impact is estimated to be modest. The improvement in the primary
balance underperforms by half of the 10-year historical standard deviation of changes in the
primary balance, compared to the baseline. Additional borrowing cost of 25 basis points per
1 percent of GDP worsening of the deficit is assumed. The gross debt-to-GDP ratio will be
higher by around 4 percent of GDP in 2021 than the baseline.



Growth shock. The impact on the debt ratio is the second largest among the shock scenarios.
Real output growth rates are lower by a half of the 10-year historical standard deviation of
changes in growth, compared to the baseline, for 2 years starting in 2017. As a result, the
primary balance deteriorates, leading to higher interest rates as in the primary balance shock
scenario. Also, a decline in inflation is assumed at a rate of 0.25 percentage point per 1-point
decrease in growth. The impact is relatively large, bringing the debt ratio to above 260 percent
of GDP, around 10 percentage points higher relative to the baseline.



Interest rate shock. The effect becomes larger with the passage of time. A spike in JGB yields is
an important medium-term tail risk. A shock of 200 basis points is assumed to happen in 2016
and stay for the rest of the period. Although increasing only gradually due to the average
maturity of around 7 years, the effective interest rate is higher by more than 1 percentage point
in 2021 than the baseline, with the debt ratio higher by around 10 points. The difference with
the baseline does not look very large, but the impact will accelerate as the interest rate hike
becomes fully reflected. In addition, such a shock could have a material effect on the financial
sector with possible knock-on effects on the debt ratio and could lead to distress in the financial
sector (see next shock).



Interest rate and contingent liability shock. The impact is by far the largest among the scenarios.
A one-time capital injection equivalent to about 3.5 percent of banking sector assets
(approximately 10 percent of regional banks assets) will increase government spending by
around 6.0 percent of GDP. The interest rate is assumed to rise by 25bps for each percentage
point increase in the primary deficit. This is also combined with the real GDP growth shock. As a
result, the debt ratio will increase to around 280 percent of GDP in 2021, almost 30 percentage
points higher than in the baseline.

Longer-term Projections and Risks. Despite the relatively stable fiscal outlook in the medium term,
the gross and net debt-to-GDP ratios are projected to start increasing faster after 2020 and reach
around 280 percent and 160 percent of GDP by 2030, respectively. This increase is a reflection of a

54

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAPAN

gradual rise in the interest rate-growth differential towards the historical average of 1.1 Long-term
projections are sensitive to macroeconomic and policy assumptions.
2

One important downside risk is a larger increase in public health spending than assumed in the
baseline (Nozaki, Kashiwase, and Saito 2014). Maintaining the same macroeconomic assumptions as
in the baseline, this would imply a debt ratio of 295 percent of GDP by 2030, about 15 percentage
points higher than in the baseline. Other risks include a less favorable interest rate-growth
differential due to disappointing growth or interest rate hikes upon BoJ exit or both, and changes in
the investor base towards foreign sources of funding that will demand higher risk premia.

1

The differential is currently lower than the historical average, estimated at around -0.4 in 2016, partly reflecting
exceptional monetary easing. It is assumed at around 0.5 in 2030.

Annex IV. Main Recommendations of the 2015 Article IV Consultation
Fund Recommendations

Policy Actions

Policy Coordination:
All arrows of Abenomics need to be strengthened to lift Japan out
of its entrenched deflationary mindset and enhance growth.

Fiscal Policy:
The second consumption tax rate increase in 2017 should be
implemented with a single rate structure and its adverse impact
on low-income households should be addressed through
improving the existing cash transfer mechanism.
Planned adjustment for 2015-16 strikes a good balance between
reducing fiscal risks and maintaining growth momentum, but
mitigating measures of about 0.3 percent is necessary in 2017
given the planned consumption tax hike.

Although Abenomics has intended to fire all three arrows, in
reality the third arrow has lagged behind, reducing the
effectiveness of monetary and fiscal policies. There remains
scope to improve policy coordination.
The government has postponed the April 2017 consumption
tax hike to October 2019, when a reduced rate of 8 percent is
scheduled to be introduced.

 FY2015 supplementary budget was approved by the Diet in
January 2016, which is expected to boost growth in FY2016
by about 0.5 percentage point, and help maintain the
growth momentum. Together with the FY2016 budget, the
envisioned fiscal stance in 2016 is appropriate. With the tax
delay no mitigating measures for 2017 are needed.

 The authorities formulated FY2016 supplementary budget
for the Kumamoto earthquake, and plan to adopt another
one to address growth concerns this fall.

Further fiscal consolidation after 2018 is necessary to put debt on
a downward path. Consolidation should be balanced in terms of
its pace (about ¾ percent of GDP per year) and should comprise
both expenditure and revenue measures as outlined in the 2014
Staff Report. A concrete medium-term fiscal plan should use
prudent and realistic economic assumptions, adopt a long-term
goal of putting debt on a downward path, specify adjustment in
terms of structural fiscal balance and identify upfront structural
revenue and expenditure measures.

The authorities have identified specific expenditure measures
with the aim to improve the efficiency of public spending,
especially in the area of social security, but their fiscal impacts
are unknown. They are not considering any revenue-side
measures.

Stronger fiscal institutions will be necessary to restore fiscal
credibility. Rules to curb expenditures, limits on the use of
supplementary budgets, and publication of independent
assessment of the outlook and budget projections by the FSC
should be considered.

The Fiscal System Council has updated in October 2015 its
analysis of the long-term fiscal sustainability.

Monetary Policy:
The BoJ should stand ready to ease further and reiterate that it
remains open to all further avenues of easing when and if
appropriate by increasing asset purchases, lengthening their
duration, broadening their range, and further lowering the deposit
rate on excess reserves into negative territory.

In January 2016, the BOJ introduced a negative interest rate on
marginal excess reserves to complement QQE.

Enhance communication to focus on achieving 2 percent inflation
in a stable manner aided by a more transparent presentation of
the BoJ’s forecast and underlying assumptions. Clarify the
indicators used to assess inflation developments and spell out the
criteria for judging whether the inflation target is sustainably
achieved, and triggers for additional actions.

The BoJ modified its communication framework in June 2015,
which became effective in January 2016:



Preparing the Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices on
a quarterly rather than a semi-annual basis;



Releasing each board member’s forecasts for growth and
prices with a risk assessment and extending the forecast
period to 4 years;



Issuing the “Summary of Opinions” in about a week after
the monetary policy meeting (MPM), providing
information about the policy board's debates; and



Reducing the frequency of MPMs to 8 times a year from
the current 14 times a year.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAPAN
Financial Sector Policy:
Close monitoring of liquidity, especially in the JGB market is
essential given the potential spillovers to other financial market
segments. Ensuring resilience of the financial sector to higher
volatility is critical.

BoJ has taken measures to mitigate the negative impact of the
QQE on JGB market liquidity, including (i) the supplementary
measures for the QQE announced in December 2015, which
allowed for consecutive use of its Security Lending Facility (SLF)
for a longer period, and (ii) raising the upper limit on the
amount of sales per issue in February 2016. MoF planned to
issue additional off-the-run JGBs with remaining maturity of 1–5
years in the Auctions for Enhanced-Liquidity in FY2016 to
correct the demand-supply imbalances and enhance market
liquidity.

Strengthen risk management and change business models to
raise profitability in the banking system. Capital standards for
domestically oriented banks need strengthening by including
reassessing the treatment of unrealized losses in capital.
Insurance companies need to enhance profitability to work
through the legacy of guaranteed return products.

FSA announced to conduct a new interview survey to
one thousand regional companies (mainly SMEs and other
users) on 105 regional banks’ lending attitude. This is intended
to identify which regional bank is still depending on collateralbased lending, and which bank has improved their business
model to borrowers’ profitability (growth)-based lending. FSA
published the summary of the survey results in August 2015.
FSA also approved the Business Strengthening Plans of financial
institutions pursuant to the “Act on Special Measures for
Strengthening Financial Functions”.

Mitigate foreign-exchange funding risks for banks with overseas
activities by securing robust funding sources.

FSA encouraged the three megabanks to increase their capital
to comply with the implementation of Basel III, and also to
reduce cross-shareholdings to prepare for equity price drop
Also, FSA is considering strengthening its regulation on
insurance companies by 2020 assuming that large insurance
companies will adopt international standards which will be set
by FSB and IAIS.

Macroprudential policies should be readied in case financial
stability risks arise.

FSA has implemented the countercyclical capital buffer (CCB)
but maintained it at zero percent.

Growth Strategy
Raise labor supply by fully implementing plans to increase the
availability of child care, eliminating tax-induced disincentives to
work, incentivizing older workers to remain in the workforce and
relaxing immigration restrictions in areas with labor shortages.

On September 24, 2015, PM Abe announced a nominal GDP
target of 600 trillion yen, and added new arrows focused on
social security, child rearing support, and demographic growth.
On August 28th the Diet approved a bill (which took effect on
April 1, 2016) to promote the role of women in the workplace.
The act requires large companies (with 301 or more
employees) to set numerical targets for the employment and
promotion of women.

Clarify the legal and regulatory environment surrounding
“intermediate” contracts that balance job security and flexibility
to reduce labor market duality and raise horizontal mobility.

Amendments to the Worker Dispatch Law were approved by
the Diet, ending a requirement for companies upgrade their
temporary workers to regular employees after three years (or
otherwise terminate the contract). This measure goes in the
opposite direction of reducing labor market duality. The
amendments also obligate staffing agencies to support the
career enhancement of temporary workers by providing
training and to work to transition them into permanent
employment.

Strengthen the wage growth momentum by raising all
administratively controlled wages and prices, calling for a
supplementary wage round, the conversion of some of the
seemingly permanent bonuses into base wages, and a strongerthan-usual winter bonus round. Also consider higher-than-usual
minimum wage increases and strengthening tax incentives for
firms that raise wages.

Minimum hourly wage was raised by JPY 18 (15 cents) in 2015
and the government announced a floor of 3 percent on
minimum wage increases with a goal to reach 1000 yen/hour
(a cumulative increase of 25 percent).

58

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAPAN

Enhance risk capital provision by focusing on increasing credit to
new growth projects, unwind cross-shareholdings and promote
consolidation in the financial system, phase-out financial sector
support schemes for SMEs that do not invest or hire workers, and
promote the expansion of securitization.
In light of the important changes in GPIF’s portfolio allocation, its
governance structure can be strengthened.

The government approved GPIF’s reform plan to introduce
more consensus-based decision-making by establishing an
investment committee. GPIF announced to disclose stock
holdings for the first time on July 29, when it will report the
investment results for fiscal 2015.

To promote further portfolio rebalancing of households,
consideration should be given to extending the 5-year term limit
of tax-exempt individual savings accounts and raising the
maximum contribution limit.

Junior NISA (Nippon Individual Savings Accounts) was
introduced in April 2016, where parents and grandparents can
set up account for children who are 19 or below with an annual
limit of JPY 800 thousand. This is to tempt Japanese
households to invest in risk assets and to transfer financial
assets to younger generation.

Implement comprehensive corporate governance reform to
strengthen firms’ governance and potentially unlock corporate
savings for more growth effective use. Efforts should focus on
including more ambitious requirements for independent
directors, greater transparency of beneficial ownership,
introducing regulatory limits to discourage excessive crossshareholdings, removing bottlenecks which prevent takeovers
and introducing pre-packaged reorganization plans for
bankruptcy procedures.
Deregulate agriculture and domestic services sectors to raise
productivity and encourage inward foreign investment. Eliminate
most tariffs and non-tariff and investment barriers. Expedite
deregulation in SEZs to help quickly roll out reforms nation-wide.

Twelve countries including Japan and US have struck the
Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal on October 5th. Japan
will lower tariffs on several agricultural products (e.g. lowering
tariff on beef from 38.5 percent to 9 percent in 16 years).
Discussions to ratify the TPP are ongoing in the Diet.

Exchange Arrangement:
Japan maintains a free floating exchange rate regime. Since the 2015 Article IV consultation, Japan
has not had foreign exchange intervention. The ministry of finance publishes foreign exchange
intervention information on its website. The exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions, with the exceptions of restrictions
imposed solely for the preservation of national or international security that have been notified to
the Fund pursuant to Executive Board Decision No. 144–(52/51).
Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) Framework:
Japan underwent an assessment of its AML/CFT framework against the AML/CFT standard by the
Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the Asia/Pacific Group (APG) in 2008. Significant deficiencies
were identified, notably with respect to customer due diligence (CDD) requirements, transparency of
legal entities, the criminalization of terrorist financing and the freezing of terrorist assets. Since the
2014 Article IV mission, Japan has made significant progress in its commitment to strengthening its
AML/CFT legal framework through the FATF standards, notably by enacting the Amendment Act on
Prevention of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds, the Act to Amend the Terrorism Financing Act, and the
Terrorist Assets Freezing Act. Japan will continue to be monitored by the FATF on its progress
including the issuance of subsidiary legislations to implement the enacted Acts.
Article IV Consultation:
The 2015 Article IV consultation discussions were held during May 8–21, 2015; the Executive Board
discussed the Staff Report (IMF Country Report No. 15/197) and concluded the consultation on July
17, 2015. The concluding statement, staff report, staff supplement, selected issues paper, and PIN
were all published.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
Prepared By

Asia and Pacific Department

This supplement updates the staff report (SM/16/223) and does not alter the thrust of
the staff appraisal.
Taking into account weakness in recent high-frequency indicators, financial market
volatility and uncertainty associated with the leave vote in the Brexit referendum, staff
has marked down the outlook for growth and inflation. Domestically, the Upper House
elections strengthened the leading coalition, paving the way for new policy initiatives
which remain to be specified. Even though the initial market response may have overshot,
subsequent developments point to the anticipation of a policy response. Against this
background, the staff’s advice remains broadly in line with the “reload” package and the
need for supportive fiscal and monetary policies to deal with downside risks.

reduced by 0.1–0.2 percentage points, reflecting a stronger
yen, weaker commodity prices, and softer domestic demand. These projections assume a gradual
waning of uncertainty surrounding Brexit but do not factor in any policy response.
Repercussions from the Brexit referendum and expectations of a large policy response caused
market gyrations. Financial conditions tightened considerably on impact of the Leave vote: the yen
appreciated strongly amid safe-haven effects and expectations of further delays in rate hikes by the
U.S. Federal Reserve, and equity prices slumped, led by financial sector stocks.2 Short selling in the
Tokyo Stock Exchange (as a share of total selling) increased to historical highs in June. Yields on
Japanese government bonds (JGBs) declined further, reflecting higher risk aversion and expectations
of further monetary policy easing. In particular, the JGB yield curve shifted down and flattened, with
the 10-year benchmark rate falling by over 14 bps to -0.29 percent within two weeks after the
referendum.3 Moreover, USD funding costs increased sharply, with the 3-month JPY/USD basis swap
widening from -55 to -68 bps on the day of the Brexit. The BoJ’s provided USD$1.475 billion on June
28—the largest amount since December 2014, but assurances about availability of USD funding

Japan’s exports to the United Kingdom respectively the rest of Europe made up about 2 and 9 percent of its total

Japan’s total foreign claims, compared to 17 and 25 percent for the rest of Europe.

through a joint statement by Finance Minister Aso and BoJ Governor Kuroda helped stabilize
markets. Since the initial response, both the yen and the equity markets have more than retraced their
steps, helped by the broad victory of the leading coalition in the Diet Upper House elections and the
anticipation of a sizeable package of fiscal support measures. Market volatility has fallen back to prereferendum levels and equity valuations, including of financial institutions, are significantly above
these levels. JGB yields have reversed some of their decline, especially at the long end.

POLICY IMPLICATIONS
The staff advice remains broadly in line with the “reload package” of the staff report and the
need for near-term support for the economy to deal with downside risks. The reload scenario
should be accelerated as it remains the most effective response to recent developments and
uncertainty (¶18 of the staff report). The realization of downside risk justifies a fiscal response, to
target a modest positive fiscal stance in 2017, and some further monetary easing to underscore the
BoJ’s resolve to achieve its inflation target (¶16):


Fiscal policy: In the near term, fiscal policy should aim for a modest fiscal impulse, using
measures with high multipliers. A large stimulus would have merit only as part of the staff’s
comprehensive and coordinated “reload” package and support for labor market reforms. To
create the necessary near-term space and reduce policy uncertainty, the commitment to fiscal
consolidation over the medium-term should be enhanced and fiscal policy frameworks
strengthened.



Monetary policy: To create balanced support for the economy and exploit synergies, the fiscal
policy response should be complemented with additional easing by the BoJ to loosen financial
conditions and underscore its commitment to achieve the inflation target in a sustained and
stable manner. All easing options should remain on the table, including lowering of the negative
interest rate on marginal excess reserves and increasing annual targets for ETF and corporate bond
purchases.

AUTHORITIES VIEWS

4

The authorities consider that the impact of Brexit on growth is likely to be modest given
Japan’s relatively small export exposure to the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe. They
felt that the impact of Brexit was highly uncertain, and noted that the initial steep correction in the
Nikkei has reversed and that strong appreciation of the yen has moderated. The authorities
expected to revise their outlook shortly as the basis for new budget projections and preparation. In
terms of policies, they noted that details on the size and composition of the planned stimulus
package would be formulated soon and that the BoJ would not hesitate to take additional easing
measures, if necessary to achieve the 2 percent price stability target at the earliest possible time, in
terms of the three dimensions, that is the quantitative, qualitative, and interest rate dimensions.
