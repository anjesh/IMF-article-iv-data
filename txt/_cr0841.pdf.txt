EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Zambian economy has performed well in recent years. This reflects strengthened
macroeconomic policies, a favorable external environment, and extensive debt relief. Growth
picked up further in 2006 and inflation has been held in check. The revival of the mining
sector and high copper prices have contributed to a marked improvement in the trade balance
and a steep appreciation of the currency.
The exchange rate and domestic economic and financial policies are consistent with
external stability. The exchange rate is currently aligned with economic fundamentals,
including the large improvement in the terms of trade.
Despite the favorable economic performance, budget execution and liquidity
management have been problematic. Poor execution of the 2007 budget risks an excess of
liquidity late in the year. That would complicate the conduct of monetary policy, which needs
to hold firm to avoid an upsurge in inflation. The recent lowering of the statutory reserve
requirements could further increase short-term pressure on monetary policy. The authorities
believe that some of the budgetary releases already made will remain unspent, as it will not
be possible to implement all of the planned projects. Furthermore, to ease the burden on
monetary policy, releases for the last part of the year will be kept below planned levels in
nonpriority areas. The authorities stressed that they were prepared to take whatever action
needed to achieve the objectives of the monetary program.
To foster economic diversification, further raise growth, and enhance income
opportunities for the poor, Zambia will need to address several medium-term policy
challenges. These include creating fiscal space for increased spending on infrastructure and
the social sectors; strengthening the capacity to undertake an expansion in public
investments; managing the macroeconomic effects of high foreign exchange inflows; and
further improving the conditions for private sector growth.
Addressing these challenges will require better budget planning and execution, closer
coordination between fiscal and monetary policy, and enhancing the competitiveness of
the non-mining export and import-competing sectors. A secure and efficient supply of
energy will be critical to ensure that economic growth is not stifled by energy shortages and
high costs.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
The Zambian economy has performed well in recent years because of stronger
macroeconomic policies, a favorable external environment, and extensive debt relief.
The broad-based economic expansion has benefited greatly from the revival of the mining
sector and high copper prices. Public finances have improved markedly and inflation has
been brought under control. The external position has strengthened significantly, mainly due
to booming copper export receipts and debt relief through the HIPC Initiative and MDRI,
which have contributed to a substantial real appreciation of the exchange rate and a buildup
in international reserves.
2.
The improved economic position presents a historic opportunity for Zambia to
accelerate growth and reduce poverty. By maintaining macroeconomic stability and
implementing the economic reforms in the Fifth National Development Plan (FNDP)–
Zambia’s Poverty Reduction Strategy—economic growth could be sustained at a higher rate
that would benefit the poor.1
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
3.
The positive economic performance
of recent years continued in 2006 and the
first half of 2007. Poor execution of the
2007 budget, however, has created
considerable uncertainty about the end-year
fiscal and monetary outcome.

picked up in early 2007, but tighter monetary conditions and a turnaround in the
kwacha brought it back to single digits (9 percent) in October.
•

Fiscal consolidation continued in 2007, but budget execution has been
problematic (Table 2 and 3). Revenue rebounded to outperform projections through
September 2007, reflecting higher income tax payments from mining companies.
Expenditures were below projections owing to a large shortfall in releases for capital
projects and because the released funds were not fully spent due to delays in tender
procedures. This underspending resulted in a significant increase in government
deposits at the Bank of Zambia (BoZ) and a large discrepancy in the fiscal accounts.
The overall balance (including grants) was 0.8 percent of GDP through September—
about 2½ percentage points of GDP higher than projected.

•

The rate of monetary expansion has fluctuated widely (Table 4 and Figure 2).
Reserve money grew by about 30 percent in 2006 because the BoZ was unable to
sterilize fully the sizable foreign exchange purchases. Money growth slowed to
20 percent in June 2007, reflecting intensified open market operations and a tight
fiscal position. Reserve money growth again picked up in the third quarter and
additional liquidity was injected into the banking system through a reduction in the
cash reserve requirement from 14 percent to 8 percent on October 1. Nominal interest
rates on government securities have trended upward since late 2006, while real rates
have risen moderately since inflation peaked earlier in the year.

•

The exchange rate has been highly volatile in response to variations in the price
of copper and shifts in market sentiment toward emerging markets (Figure 2). In
late summer 2007, Zambia felt the effects of the increased risk aversion and flight to
liquidity that affected global financial markets. The currency came briefly under
strong downward pressure as copper prices fell sharply, prompting the BoZ to
intervene to maintain orderly market conditions. The kwacha subsequently
strengthened as markets settled and copper prices rebounded.

•

The banking sector remains sound. It is generally well capitalized, profitable and
liquid (Table 6).

•

The external position has strengthened considerably (Table 5). The current
account deficit (excluding grants) declined markedly to 1.3 percent of GDP in 2006,
as copper export receipts doubled and nontraditional exports increased by 30 percent.
Copper export receipts remained strong in the first half of 2007. The strong external
position and the tight fiscal conditions contributed to a build up of international
reserves to about 2.4 months of imports at end-June 2007.

•

Notwithstanding progress in some areas, the achievement of the MDGs remains
a challenge (Table 7).

8
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
4.
Zambia’s key medium-term objectives are to further raise growth and
enhance income opportunities for the poor while maintaining domestic and external
stability. The discussions with the authorities focused on the challenges they face in
reconciling the following objectives with domestic and external stability:
•

creating fiscal space for increased spending on infrastructure and the social sectors;

•
implementing the public expenditure and financial management reforms necessary to
strengthen the capacity to undertake the expansion in public investments and to increase
overall efficiency;
•
managing the macroeconomic effects of foreign exchange inflows from donors and
the mining sector; and
•

improving conditions for private sector growth.

5.
The authorities remain committed to a flexible exchange rate regime, which is
characterized as a managed float. Staff analysis indicates that the exchange rate is broadly
aligned with macroeconomic fundamentals, including the large improvement in the terms of
trade in recent years (Box 1). Despite a large real exchange rate appreciation in recent years,
nontraditional export receipts expanded by 30 percent in 2006 and remained strong in the
first-half of 2007.
A. Near-Term Policy Challenges and Medium-Term Outlook
Policies for the rest of 2007
6.
Incomplete execution of the 2007 budget through September will challenge
fiscal and monetary policy for the rest of the year. With about 1½ percent of GDP of
budgetary releases still unspent by mid-September, full implementation of the budget would
result in a large injection of liquidity in the last quarter of the year. The authorities argued
that a large proportion of these releases are likely to remain unspent because it will not be
possible to carry out all of the planned projects. To ease the burden on monetary policy,
however, the authorities will keep releases for the rest of the year below budgeted levels in
nonpriority areas. Lower expenditure, together with the overperformance on revenue, is
expected to result in net domestic financing for the year as a whole about 2 percentage points
of GDP below that budgeted. There is considerable uncertainty about the outcome, however,
since ministries may try to spend as much as they can before year end because under newly
implemented procedures to reduce the budget carryover from one fiscal year to the next, any
unspent funds at year-end must be transferred back to the treasury and new budget
authorization sought for the spending.

9
Box 1. Zambia: Assessment of External Stability
A balance of payments position consistent with external stability is one in which (i) the underlying current
account is broadly in line with its equilibrium, i.e., there is no fundamental exchange rate misalignment, and
(ii) the capital and financial account does not create risks of abrupt shifts in the capital flows.
Current account and fundamental misalignment. Directly estimating Zambia’s equilibrium and
underlying current account is complicated by data limitations, including the absence of international
investment position data, and structural breaks. Moreover, the long-run current account equilibrium (or
norm) is difficult to determine in a commodity-dependent economy, particularly one that is undergoing
major structural changes, including in its major export base. The exchange rate therefore is assessed by
(i) analyzing the relationship between the real effective exchange rate (REER) and a set of fundamental
macroeconomic variables; (ii) assessing the exchange rate policy framework; and (iii) assessing the
sustainability of domestic financial policies.
•

•

•

Equilibrium REER. Estimation of the
equilibrium REER for the period 1986–
2006 found that the long-run behavior of the
REER is explained by the terms of trade and
openness to trade. The estimates indicate
that the REER appreciation in recent years is
consistent with an appreciation of the
equilibrium exchange rate, driven mainly by
the large increase in copper prices. In the first
half of 2007, the REER was 3 percent above
the estimated equilibrium REER. Assessment:
the current exchange rate does not appear
fundamentally misaligned.
Exchange rate policy. The exchange rate is
determined in the interbank foreign exchange
market, with intervention by the BoZ
confined to keeping market conditions
orderly and meeting its international reserves
target. Since Zambia is a recipient of
sizeable aid inflows, the BoZ can accumulate
international reserves without intervening
directly in the foreign exchange market if it
does not sell all of the aid inflows.
Assessment: the exchange rate broadly
reflects market conditions and no important
market restrictions can be identified.

Domestic policies. The fiscal position is sustainable and is supported by a projected primary deficit of
1.1 percent of GDP in 2007 and expected medium-term real GDP growth of 6 percent. A firm monetary
policy has supported a declining trend in inflation. While keeping macroeconomic stability and
continuing with structural reforms are expected to generate productivity gains and REER appreciation,
all else being equal, the exchange rate adjustment is expected to be very gradual. Assessment: fiscal and
monetary policies are consistent with domestic stability and internal balance.

Capital and financial accounts and external stability. Private capital inflows are related primarily to
foreign direct investment in mining. Since 2005, some portfolio inflows into public securities have also taken
place. However, only about 15 percent of government securities (corresponding to about one-fourth of
international reserves) are foreign held and largely in securities with maturities of more than one year. There
is no significant secondary market for government securities. Assessment: the current structure of Zambia’s
capital and financial account suggests a relatively low risk of external instability.

10
7.
Monetary policy needs to remain firm to contain inflation risks.2 Liquidity
pressures are likely to pose a challenge in the last few months of 2007 as the pace of
government spending picks up. In the staff’s view, to contain these pressures, open market
operations would have to be stepped up. In addition, the BoZ would have to increase net
sales of foreign exchange. The BoZ was concerned, however, that further exchange rate
appreciation may constrain its ability to do so in the short-term. Staff therefore expressed
serious reservations about the timing, though not the principle, of reducing the statutory
reserve requirement. The authorities explained that they aim to offset part of the impact of
the lower reserve requirement on liquidity by moving government balances from commercial
banks to the BoZ, and that they were prepared to take whatever action was needed to achieve
the objectives of the monetary program.
Medium-term outlook
8.
Real GDP is expected to continue to expand at 6–7 percent a year over the
medium term (Table 1 and 8). This reflects continued large-scale investments in mining
and manufacturing and sustained growth in other sectors. The authorities reiterated their
commitment to prudent fiscal and monetary policies designed to bring inflation down
gradually to about 5 percent over the next two years. The current account deficit is expected
to widen with the projected decline in world copper prices of over 50 percent during the next
three years. However, strong export volume growth, from the increased investment in mining
capacity, will mitigate the effect from the deterioration in prices. The real exchange rate
would tend to depreciate in response to the projected deterioration in the terms of trade.
Monetary policy would thus need to remain firm to ensure that the pass-through to import
prices of the nominal depreciation does not translate into a rise in the overall rate of inflation.
International reserves would increase gradually to 3½ months of imports by 2010.
9.
The updated debt sustainability analysis (DSA) finds Zambia at low risk of
debt distress. External debt sustainability has improved substantially thanks to debt relief
under the HIPC Initiative and the MDRI. Debt ratios are expected to remain well below the
thresholds for both the baseline and alternative scenarios, including one in which large public
investment projects in the energy sector involve external financing on nonconcessional terms.

The chapter “Monetary Policy and Inflation” in the Selected Issues paper (to be published, www.imf.org)
analyzes the link between monetary policy and inflation in Zambia.

11
B. Creating Fiscal Space3
10.
Fiscal space needs to be created to increase spending on infrastructure and the
social sectors, as outlined in the FNDP. While pressing for donors to scale up inflows, the
authorities will strive to improve revenue collection by strengthening administration and
broadening the tax base, restraining nonpriority spending, and making spending more
efficient. Discussions with donors suggest that foreign support is not likely to be significantly
scaled up (total net inflows are expected to remain at about 5–6 percent of GDP over the
medium term). The authorities therefore intend to seek nonconcessional external borrowing
for a limited number of projects. Staff agreed that nonconcessional external borrowing could
be considered, but only for projects that are demonstrably economically viable and do not
jeopardize debt sustainability. Nonconcessional borrowing should only take place if there are
well-formulated debt management and project evaluation frameworks in place.
11.
The government’s draft medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF)
focuses on creating space for higher capital spending. Revenue is projected to remain
broadly stable at 18.4 percent of GDP in 2008 and to rise to 19 percent in 2010, largely
owing to strengthened administration. Tax revenue from the mining sector is expected to
remain at 1½ percent of GDP, as in 2007, though it could increase if the ongoing
renegotiations of the mining companies’ fiscal terms are successfully completed and
additional mines start declaring taxable profits. However, any gains could be negated by a
decline in world copper prices. Over time expenditure composition is expected to shift
increasingly towards capital spending in line with the authorities’ emphasis on investment in
infrastructure, but in 2008 the share will stay about the same due to large domestic arrears
payments and the need to finance the constitutional review. Wages and salaries are projected
to increase significantly due to assumed annual real wage increases of 3–5 percent. The
government intends to clear all current domestic arrears by 2009.
12.
The staff largely supported the draft MTEF. It has the right focus on capital
investments and arrears payments. The fiscal deficit, excluding grants, is estimated to decline
gradually to 5¾ percent of GDP in 2010 and domestic financing will hold at about 1 percent
of GDP a year. Staff expressed concern about the rise in the wage bill and noted that nominal
wage increases should decline in line with projected inflation. They further emphasized the
need to speed up the civil service and pay reform. Staff also noted that sound investment
planning will be critical to ensuring that the increase in capital outlays is effectively utilized.
13.
Reform of the tax system and administration will continue. No major tax policy
initiatives are expected in the 2008 budget as efforts are currently focused on renegotiating
development agreements with the mining companies. But next year attention is expected to
3

Issues paper (to be published, www.imf.org) discusses this issue in more detail.

12
shift to other reforms that will help to achieve the goals of broadening the tax base, unifying
rates at more moderate levels, and minimizing the number of exemptions. Consideration
should be given to calculating and publishing tax expenditures.
14.
The financial difficulties of the insolvent Public Service Pension Fund (PSPF)
may leave less fiscal space for investments. The PSPF is a defined-benefit scheme that was
closed to new entrants in 2000. The actuarial deficit is estimated at about 10 percent of GDP.
As the number of pensioners increases while the membership base declines, the annual cashflow deficit is projected to rise in the medium-term before falling as the scheme winds down
(the deficit is estimated at ½ percent of GDP over the next few years). The authorities
pointed out that the problem relates to too generous benefits that can only be changed
through a constitutional amendment. The staff stressed that until another solution on the
benefit level is found, budget allocations to the PSPF would need to increase to ensure that
pension obligations are met in full. This should be reflected in the revised MTEF and could
be partly financed by constraining current expenditures, including moderating the growth in
the wage bill.
C. Public Financial Management and Budget Execution
15.
Cash management and coordination of fiscal and monetary policy need to be
strengthened. The Ministry of Finance and National Planning (MoFNP) and the BoZ need to
cooperate more closely to anticipate and manage emerging liquidity pressures. The planned
establishment of a treasury department within MoFNP should improve coordination. The
department would prepare cash flow forecasts and coordinate all banking relations between
the government and the BoZ. Gradual implementation of both a treasury single account and
the IFMIS should further improve cash management.
16.
The government has taken steps to prevent a repeat of this year’s difficulties
in budget execution. Execution should improve in 2008 following the Zambia National
Tender Board’s recent decision that ministries can prepare the necessary papers as soon as
the budget is issued to parliament and can submit tenders immediately after budget approval.
However, until the budget cycle is brought forward, which the authorities noted is tied up in
the constitutional review process, continuing difficulties are likely.4
17.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ efforts to strengthen debt management. As a
first step, they have prepared a debt management strategy that describes the existing
institutional framework and procedures, and highlights the need to consolidate the legal
framework. The mission underscored the importance of implementing the debt management
strategy together with measures to improve the capacity to evaluate investment projects.
4

The budget can only be presented to parliament after the fiscal (calendar) year begins and traditionally takes
place on the last Friday in January. Parliamentary debate typically takes at least two months.

13
18.
Progress has been made toward signing up to the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative (EITI). The mission welcomed the government’s efforts, with
support from the World Bank, toward formally adopting EITI in a participatory process, in
line with EITI guidelines.
D. Managing Foreign Currency Inflows
19.
The authorities recognized the challenges a booming mining sector and donor
inflows pose for monetary policy and international competitiveness. The mission noted
that full absorption of aid inflows would require the BoZ to sell foreign exchange on the
market to mop up the domestic liquidity generated by spending the inflows. Although the
sales would inevitably put upward pressure on the real exchange rate, the BoZ should
carefully time them to limit exchange rate volatility. Though the excess liquidity could be
mopped up using open market operations, that would tend to raise interest rates and reduce
absorption. In view of these effects, the authorities recognized that to promote growth in nonmining sectors it is essential to improve the business environment and boost productivity
through, for example, investing in infrastructure and deepening financial markets.
20.
The volatility of the Kwacha has at times complicated the conduct of monetary
policy. The mission encouraged the authorities to improve the operation of the foreign
exchange market, including the need to develop a forward market. Although the performance
of the interbank market since its introduction in July 2003 has generally been satisfactory,
day-to-day exchange rate volatility has been high. The BoZ recognizes the problem and
welcomed the preliminary recommendations of a recent IMF TA mission.
21.
The accumulation of gross reserves remains an important objective for the
authorities. They expressed their

reserves falls somewhat short of the level required to meet a current account shock of two

shock.5
E. Improving Conditions for Private Sector Growth
22.
Improving Zambia’s business environment is crucial for enhancing
competitiveness and private sector growth. The discussions focused on three main areas
where resolute policy implementation could advance private sector growth: (i) financial
sector deepening; (ii) further opening of the trade regime; and (iii) energy sector
development.
23.
While the banking sector appears sound, more needs to be done to strengthen
supervision and broaden the availability of financial services.6 The BoZ is developing a
framework for risk-based supervision and implementation of the second phase of the
financial sector development plan (FSDP) is going ahead. Over the next year, draft
legislation on credit bureau services is expected to be enacted and draft amendments to the
Bank of Zambia Act that would make central bank operations more independent, are being
prepared. The second FinScope survey on the supply of financial services is being finalized;
together with the first survey on demand for financial services, it would provide the basis for
policies to expand access to financial services. Regarding the capital market, the authorities
will introduce measures to develop an active secondary market in government securities. On
the state-owned nonbank financial institutions, the authorities are considering options for
making them viable financial intermediaries. Staff emphasized the need for decisive action
based on a realistic assessment of their viability.
24.
The government is pursuing further trade liberalization. In 2008, Zambia will
complete the agreed tariff phase-down for 85 percent of the goods traded within the Southern
African Development Community (SADC). Tariffs on the remaining sensitive goods will be
eliminated during 2009–12. The authorities estimate the revenue impact to be small in the
short term because the value of goods that meet the rules of origin requirements is small. To
reduce the cost of trading across borders, the authorities intend to streamline procedures to
halve the processing time required for exporting and importing goods.
25.
The development of the energy sector is vital to achieving the government’s
objectives of sustained high growth and poverty reduction. In particular, greater
electricity generation will be needed to support the envisaged expansion of mining, private

15
sector growth, and the planned rural electrification program. Thus, it will be important to
move toward full cost recovery of electricity generation, transmission, and distribution. The
public utility ZESCO should improve corporate governance and efficiency and gradually
adjust the average electricity tariff to long-term marginal cost. Furthermore, to ensure
ZESCO’s profitability, the mining companies should also pay cost-based electricity rates.
Otherwise it will not be possible to undertake the additional investment in capacity needed to
meet future demand, including from the mining sector itself.
F. Other Issues
26.
The authorities have made efforts to settle arrears to external private
creditors stemming from the past imposition of exchange rate controls. Settlement of the
outstanding arrears to commercial creditors was offered on terms similar to those provided
by the Paris Club. The authorities are now verifying a small amount of claims outstanding to
private individuals. The exchange rate restrictions evidenced by the accumulation of these
external payments arrears are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII.
IV. STATISTICAL ISSUES
27.
Initiatives are underway to improve the quality of economic statistics. The
Central Statistical Office (CSO) has launched the very first economic census. It will provide
important information about the structure of the Zambian economy, which will be used,
among other things, to rebase the national accounts. The CSO is also testing a new, rebased
CPI. Compilation of the International Investment Position (IIP) has not yet begun owing to
capacity constraints. The authorities expressed their willingness to participate in a project for
countries that can publish on their own the Article IV Statistical Appendix. The mission
provided assistance to start up the process.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
The Zambian authorities continue to pursue sound macroeconomic policies
that are contributing to robust growth and bringing inflation down. While the economy
is expected to continue to perform well, there is a need to strengthen budget execution and
liquidity management—poor execution of the 2007 budget may result in excessive injection
of liquidity in the rest of the year, which would complicate the conduct of monetary policy.
29.
Monetary policy needs to hold firm to contain inflation risks. This may require
that the BoZ, in addition to its open market operations, step up net sales of foreign exchange.
The recent lowering of statutory reserve requirements could further increase the pressure on
monetary policy in the near term. The decision by the authorities to postpone some of the
releases for nonpriority projects in the last quarter and to transfer government deposits at
commercial banks to the BoZ will ease the burden on monetary policy. The staff is
encouraged by the authorities’ assurances to avoid wasteful year-end spending and by the
BoZ’s commitment to meeting its monetary targets.

16
30.
The exchange rate and domestic economic and financial policies are consistent
with external stability. In particular, the flexible exchange rate policy continues to serve
Zambia well. The exchange rate seems to be aligned with economic fundamentals, including
large improvement in the terms of trade. The large real appreciation in recent years
underscores, however, the need to step up reforms to boost productivity, expand access to
credit, and remove impediments to business. Some further modest buildup of international
reserves would enhance Zambia’s ability to weather external shocks.
31.
The authority’s development strategy to sustain growth and accelerate
poverty reduction faces challenges and risks. Among them are creating the fiscal space for
additional spending on infrastructure and the social sectors, implementing public financial
management reforms, managing the macroeconomic effects of marked foreign exchange
inflows, and improving conditions for private sector growth. Moreover, the limited
diversification of the economy heightens potential risks to the economic outlook, most
prominently, from a steep decline in copper prices.
32.
The preliminary MTEF and 2008 budget are broadly appropriate. The
targeted increase in revenue and the shift toward capital spending and arrears reduction are
welcome, through the projected increase in wages and salaries is a concern. While new hiring
in the social sectors is appropriate, there is a need to accelerate civil service and pay reforms,
which seem to have stalled.
33.
Better management of public expenditure is essential to ensure that it
generates high returns. Steadfast implementation of the public financial management
reforms will be key, in particular, establishing a treasury single account and completing the
IFMIS project. It will also be critical to align the budget cycle with the fiscal year.
34.
The authorities are working to strengthen debt management. Their approach to
external borrowing is appropriately cautious, relying on concessional loans and ensuring that
any new borrowing does not undermine debt sustainability. There is, however, a need to
complement the debt management strategy with measures to improve capacity to evaluate
investment projects.
35.
Development of the energy sector is vital to achieving a vibrant private sector
and reducing poverty. To this end, it is important to raise tariffs to levels consistent with
full cost recovery in electricity generation, transmission, and distribution. There is also a
need to strengthen the corporate governance and efficiency of ZESCO.
36.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation will be held on the standard 12month cycle.

Annex I. Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis 2007 under the
Debt Sustainability Framework for Low Income Countries1
External and public debt dynamics are assessed using the Low Income Country Debt
Sustainability Analysis (LIC DSA) framework.2 Fund and Bank staffs have concluded that
Zambia’s risk of external debt distress is low. Total public debt is sustainable under all
scenarios. Zambia’s debt sustainability outlook has strengthened substantially since 2005,
mainly because of higher copper export receipts and debt relief received under the HIPC and
MDRI Initiatives. The baseline scenario shows that Zambia’s public debt will improve
further over the medium term as long as economic policies remain appropriate. Debt ratios
are expected to continue to be manageable, well below the risk thresholds, through 2027.
I. UNDERLYING MACROECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS
1.
The medium-term framework assumes that the Zambian economy will
continue to perform well. The baseline scenario assumes that real GDP growth remains
strong, reflecting large-scale investments in mining and other sectors. The current account
deficit is expected to widen over the long run as copper prices fall. Fiscal policies are
assumed to remain targeted on limiting domestic borrowing to about one percent of GDP
annually. The key assumptions are summarized below. The assumptions for this LIC DSA
are broadly in line with those underlying the 2005 LIC DSA, except for GDP growth. The
more positive copper sector developments in 2006 and 2007 have been incorporated.
While stronger growth is assumed in the medium term, a more conservative approach is
taken over the long term.
2.

The baseline scenario is based on the following assumptions:

•

Economic growth: Real GDP would continue to grow at 6–6½ percent a year
through 2012, supported primarily by developments in the copper and construction
sectors. Over time, however, the Zambian economy is expected to diversify as
noncopper sectors expand in response to an improved business environment and
infrastructure. In the long run Zambia’s growth is expected to stabilize at 4½ percent.

•

Inflation: Inflation should decline to about 5 percent, if monetary and fiscal policies
continue to be prudent.

1
2

Prepared by the IMF and World Bank staffs.

The previous LIC DSA (IMF Country Report No. 06/39) showed that Zambia was at a low risk of debt
distress. At that time, Zambia had reached HIPC completion but relief under the MDRI has not yet been
delivered.

26
•

External sector: Copper export volumes would grow at an average annual rate of
about 10 percent through 2012 and then 4½ percent through 2027. While copper will
remain Zambia’s most important export, its share in total exports is expected to fall
from 78 percent in 2006 to 67 percent by 2012 and then to about 63 percent by 2027.3
Imports are assumed to grow in line with GDP in the long run. Annual foreign direct
investment would peak at 7 percent of GDP in 2007 and decline to an average of
2½ percent for 2008–12 and to 1½ percent of GDP over the long run.

•

Government revenue and expenditure: Government revenues would rise gradually
from 18.4 percent of GDP in 2007 to 20 percent by 2027, mainly from improvements
in tax administration; no change in the tax system is assumed. Expenditures stay
constant at about 25 percent of GDP.

•

Financing: Discussions with the authorities and main donors indicate that there are
no plans currently to scale up foreign financing (grants and loans), except for one
donor. The baseline scenario therefore assumes that annual external support will
remain at about 6 percent of GDP during 2007-12, and then decline to 4½ percent of
GDP during 2013-17 and to 3 percent of GDP by 2027.4 The baseline assumes
support from emerging creditors, albeit at low levels. Annual external borrowing
would remain at about 1 percent of GDP through 2012 and then decline to about
¾ percent through 2017 and ½ percent for the rest of the period. Domestic financing
would fall to 1 percent of GDP by 2009 and remain there over the long term. These
funds would be used mainly to finance infrastructure projects.

•

Contingent liabilities: Public Service Pension Fund’s liabilities would grow by
½ percent of GDP per year.
II. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

Background
3.
As a result of the HIPC and MDRI Initiatives, Zambia’s stock of external debt
has declined substantially.5 The external debt-to-GDP ratio declined from about 85 percent
3

The nominal growth of exports in U.S. dollar terms is negative for 2009–11 because the price of copper is
assumed to decline at an average annual rate of 20 percent over the next three years and at lower rates through
2013, in line with WEO projections. It is assumed that the price of copper will stabilize after 2013.
4

In the baseline scenario a sizeable portion of grants are allocated to finance investment projects and classified
as capital grants.

5

Zambia reached the completion point under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative in April 2005. MDRI relief was
delivered in January 2006.

27
at the end of 2005 to about 9 percent at the end of 2006. Several creditors have already
delivered their share of debt relief.6
•

Multilateral Creditors: All multilateral creditors have provided HIPC relief. The
AfDF, IDA, and the Fund have fully delivered their share of MDRI relief.

•

Paris Club Creditors: Brazil, a creditor invited to participate in the Paris Club
meeting in which relief beyond HIPC was agreed, has not yet delivered the relief
expected, but is seeking approval from its Senate to do so. Only one full member of
the Paris Club (Russia) has not granted beyond HIPC relief to Zambia, but
discussions have started.7

•

Non-Paris Club Creditors: Of the nine non-Paris Club creditors, China and India
have provided relief on claims held by their governments but not on those held by
public enterprises—Zambia plans to contact them. Two creditors, Bulgaria and Iraq,
have not yet provided HIPC relief, but the authorities have contacted them. Three
non-Paris Club creditors (Kuwait, Romania, and Yugoslavia) sold their claims on
Zambia to private creditors and have been fully repaid. Debt to the other two nonParis Club creditors was fully repaid without any HIPC relief.

28
Results of the External DSA
4.
External debt burden indicators have improved substantially and are expected
to remain well below the risk thresholds over the projection period in the baseline
scenario (Table 1). Zambia’s external debt ratios remain well below the risk thresholds.8 The
stock of debt is expected to increase to about 12 percent of GDP through 2011 and then
decline to single digits by 2017. The NPV of debt-to-GDP is expected to climb from about
6 percent in 2007 to about 7 percent by 2011 and then decline to about 4 percent—below the
40 percent threshold. As copper prices decline and production slows, the NPV of debt-toexports is projected to increase from 14 percent in 2007 to about 23 percent in 2012 and stay
there through 2027, well below the 150 percent threshold. The debt service-to-exports ratio is
expected to increase from 1 percent in 2007 to 2 percent by 2012 and to 2.2 percent by 2027.
5.
The standard sensitivity analysis points to a much reduced risk of debt distress
(Table 2). Zambia’s external debt position has become more resilient to exogenous shocks.
In the alternative scenarios, the ratio that deteriorates most is the NPV of debt-to-exports.
This occurs when key variables are assumed to grow at their historical averages (1997–
2006), which reflect the poor performance of the Zambian economy from 1997 through
2002. The external current account deficit would remain at 10.7 percent of GDP from 2008
to 2027—significantly higher than the deficit assumed in the baseline scenario (3 percent by
2020). As a result, the NPV of debt-to-exports rises to 45 percent by 2017 and to 106 percent
by 2027. All bound tests result in higher but stable ratios well below the thresholds. Thus,
even under difficult circumstances, Zambia’s risk of debt distress is low. The scenario based
on historical averages points to the need to diversify Zambia’s exports away from copper as a
means to make it even more resilient to external shocks.
6.
Plans for substantial investment in power generation have been under discussion
for a long time (Table 1). Therefore, the 2005 LIC DSA included an alternative scenario of
nonconcessional foreign borrowing (US$1 billion for 2008–11).9 The update assumes
construction of three new hydropower plants (Itezhi Tezhi, Kariba North, and Lower Kafue
Gorge) during 2009–15, the financing of which requires US$1.2 billion. However, slightly
more than 40 percent is expected to be financed with foreign direct investment, reducing the
nonconcessional borrowing required to about US$690 million.10 The non-concessional
borrowing will not significantly change the external debt outlook. During the construction
period, imports are expected to increase, but as projects are completed exports of electricity
8

The World Bank’s 2006 Country Policy and Institutions Assessment (CPIA) based on the three-year average
ranks Zambia as a medium performer. Thus, the external debt burden thresholds for Zambia are (i) NPV of
debt-to-GDP, 40 percent; (ii) NPV of debt-to-exports, 150 percent; (iii) NPV of debt-to-revenue, 250 percent;
and (iv) debt service to exports, 20 percent, and to revenue, 30 percent.

9

This scenario assumed an 8 percent interest rate, 5-year grace period, and 17-year maturity.

10

This scenario assumes a 6 percent interest rate, 5-year grace period, and 15-year maturity.

29
will come on stream. The NPV of debt-to-export ratio will peak at 37 percent in 2012
(23 percent in the baseline scenario) but will converge to the baseline scenario by 2027. The
assumed borrowing on nonconcessional terms does not pose any threat to the external debt
sustainability; debt indicators even under the bound test are below the thresholds.

debt have significantly changed. At end 2005,

8.
As of end 2006, the domestic debt had two main components (i) government
securities (15.9 percent of GDP), which are denominated in local currency only; and (ii)
domestic arrears (2.6 percent of GDP). Most securities are marketable (13 percent of GDP),
however, there is no significant secondary market. Foreign investment in government
securities began in early 2005, after Zambia reached its HIPC completion point. The
estimated stock of government securities in the hands of foreigners has increased from about
US$150 million at end-2005 to about US$200 million by end-September 2007 (about
13 percent of the total domestic debt), of which close to 70 percent is short-term debt. This
indicates that the rollover risk is low and the possible pressure on reserves of a change in
sentiment of foreign investors is moderate.
Results of the Public DSA
9.
In the baseline scenario, Zambia’s public debt is expected to decline over the
projection period (Table 3). The NPV of domestic debt would decline from 18.6 percent of
GDP in 2006 to 10.4 percent by 2027. As a result of this and the decline in external debt, the
NPV of public sector debt-to-GDP would drop from about 27 percent to 16 percent by 2027.
Thus, Zambia’s public debt is considered manageable, as long as the authorities implement a
cautious debt policy.
10.
The standard sensitivity analysis shows that Zambia’s public debt is also more
resilient to shocks. The alternative scenarios and bound tests show that the outlook for
public debt sustainability is benign, except in the case of permanently lower GDP. In this
scenario the NPV of debt-to-revenue rises from about 97 percent to about 139 percent. In the

30
bound tests, the NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio climbs to about 194 percent by 2027, which
underscores the importance of sound macroeconomic policies to achieve higher GDP growth.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
11.
Application of the LIC-DSA framework indicates that Zambia’s debt
sustainability outlook has strengthened substantially. Fund and Bank staffs consider that
Zambia is at low risk of external debt distress. The external debt indicators remain well
below the thresholds in the alternative scenarios and the bound stress tests. The risks to
public debt are also low.

Assumes that NPV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.

Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.

Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.

Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.

Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the NPV of new debt).

Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. It also includes grants allocated to finance investment projects, which are classified as
capital inflows in the balance of payments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.

1

Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.

2

Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.

3

Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly a
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).

4

Includes official and private transfers and FDI.

5

Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.

6

Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

IX.

Safeguards Assessment

Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Bank of Zambia (BoZ) is subject to an
assessment for the PRGF arrangement, which was approved on June 16, 2004 and is
scheduled to expire on June 15, 2007. A safeguards assessment of the BoZ was completed on
October 20, 2004.
The authorities have taken the following steps in response to the recommendations made to
address the weaknesses identified:
(i) In December 2004, the BoZ’s board adopted the International Financial Reporting
Standards as the basis for financial reporting.
(ii) In December 2004, the BoZ’s board adopted a policy for the appointment of external
auditors (three year-term appointment, renewable only once).
(iii) Pending the approval of an amendment to the Bank of Zambia Act, the BoZ and the
Ministry of Finance and National Planning (MoFNP) have adopted a Memorandum of
Understanding to exclude unrealized gains from profits available for distribution to
government.
(iv) The Finance Department of the BoZ and the Economics Department of the BoZ have
established a data monitoring committee to jointly reconcile the data reported to the Fund.
(v) Proposed amendments to the BoZ Act to strengthen the operational independence of the
BoZ have been submitted for consideration as part of the current review of the country’s
constitution.
X.

Exchange Rate Arrangement

The currency of Zambia is the kwacha. The exchange rate regime is a managed float with no
predetermined path for the exchange rate. The official exchange rate is determined in the
interbank market; the Bank of Zambia’s (BoZ) buying rate is the simple average of the
primary dealers’ low bid rates, and the BoZ’s selling rate is the simple average of the primary
dealers’ high offer rates. On April 19, 2002, Zambia accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Section 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement. However, the Fund urged the authorities to
eliminate the exchange restriction evidenced by the accumulation of external payments
arrears, which is subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, as soon as possible.

ANNEX III. ZAMBIA: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
A. Partnership for Development
1.
World Bank support to Zambia is based upon the country’s PRSP, which is
prepared through a participatory process led by the government. Zambia’s Fifth National
Development Plan 2006-10 (FNDP) serves as the country’s revised PRSP and has been
officially launched by the President in early 2007. In preparing the FNDP, the authorities
held discussions with local leaders in all of Zambia’s 72 districts. Sectoral Advisory Groups
(SAGs), chaired by government officials with stakeholder representation, were then tasked to
draft the comprehensive document, which underwent a review by stakeholders during the
second half of 2006.
2.
Debt relief. After reaching the HIPC completion point, Zambia was granted
additional debt relief under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). Effective July 1,
2006 IDA credits that had been disbursed prior to 2004 were cancelled.
B. World Bank Group Strategy
3.
In March 2004, the Bank’s executive Board discussed the Bank’s current Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS), which outlines the roadmap for the Bank’s country support for
the period 2004-2007. The CAS is explicitly rooted in a result-based framework, which links
overall goals of the PRSP/TNDP to specific strategic objectives. World Bank activities focus
on three strategic priorities:
1.
Strategic Priority 1: Sustained Economic Growth Anchored in a Diversified
and Export-Oriented Economy;
2.
Strategic Priority 2: Improved Lives and Protection of the Vulnerable;
3.
Strategic Priority 3: Efficiently and Effectively Managed Public Sector.
The Bank is in the process of preparing a new Country Assistance Strategy, which is planned
to be discussed with its executive Board in the first quarter of 2008 and will be aligned with
the FNDP and with the Joint Assistance Strategy for Zambia. The JASZ has been prepared
by the Cooperating Partners as a response to the FNDP and the harmonization agenda as
articulated in the Paris Declaration.
4.
Lending operations. In addition to ongoing Bank’s lending operations in the areas
of public sector reform, HIV/AIDS, malaria, education, agriculture, infrastructure, support
for diversification with an emphasis on tourism, and the environment, the CAS includes
development policy lending. The second EMGC/DPO for US$10 million is part of a
harmonized approach to budget support and has been appraised in June 2007. The DPO is
scheduled to be discussed with the Bank’s executive Board in December 2007.
5.
Country Diagnostic. The Bank continues to undertake substantive country
diagnostics providing a solid base for policy dialogue, design, and implementation of its

43
lending operations in Zambia. A combined Public Expenditure Review (PER), Country
Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR), and Country Financial Accountability
Assessment (CFAA), was completed in 2003 and forms the basis for the Public Expenditure
and Financial Accountability TA work jointly undertaken with cooperating partners. The
main economic sector works completed are a Country Economic Memorandum (CEM),
which was followed by a pro-poor growth study, an Investment Climate Assessment (ICA),
an Administrative Barriers study (AB), a collaborative Poverty and Vulnerability Assessment
(PVA), an integrated framework study for trade (DTIS), and a Strategic Country Gender
Assessment (SCGA). In addition, a Public Expenditure Review for the education has been
undertaken (FY07) and a PER for the health sector is currently being finalized while an
assessment of competition and regulation in Zambia’s infrastructure sectors has been
initiated. In FY08 a PER for the agricultural sector will be initiated as well as a Public
Expenditure Tracking Survey for secondary education. An update of the Investment Climate
Assessment is also under way. It is expected that the upcoming CAS will outline an
analytical program for the next three to four years.
6.
Projects under Supervision. IDA’s active portfolio as of April 2007 contains 12
credits and grants for a total initial commitment of US$319.5 million. During FY05, two
projects were approved i.e. SEED (US$32.2 mil.) to support economic diversification in July
2004 and the Economic Management and Growth Credit (DPL, US$40 mil.) in Dec 2004. In
FY06 three projects, the Malaria Booster Project (US$20 mil.), Public Sector Management
Project (US$30 mil.) and Agricultural Development Support Program (US$37.2 mil.) were
approved by IDA’s Board. In FY07 the Board approved a water and sanitation project
(US$23 mil.) and additional financing for the Road rehabilitation and maintenance project in
the amount of US$25 million.
7.
The International Finance Corporation (IFC) is very much aligned with the Bank’s
policy agenda in Zambia. The IFC currently has a small portfolio of 12 projects totaling
US$15 million outstanding. These are a mix of financial sector, agribusiness,
telecommunications (mobile telephone), and tourism projects. The IFC’s most prominent
project was for US$30 million in the equity of Konkola Copper Mines (KCM) with AngloAmerican in 2000. The IFC exited in 2002 along with Anglo, in accordance with the terms of
the investment agreement.
8.
MIGA’s outstanding portfolio in Zambia consists of four contracts of guarantee in
the agribusiness and manufacturing services sector with a US$36.1 million gross exposure
and a US$35.7 million net exposure as of December 2003. The projects are for the
privatization, modernization, and expansion of a foundry, and for cobalt and copper facilities.
They benefit the Zambian economy by saving production costs and by providing training to
personnel working on projects. The estimated total amount of foreign direct investment
facilitated to date is US$155.5 million

C. IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
9.
A summary of IMF-World Bank collaboration in Zambia is provided in Table 2.
There are a number of areas where the Fund leads and its analysis serve as inputs into the
World Bank policy formulation and advice, including policies to maintain macroeconomic
stability, fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policies. There are other areas in which the
Fund and the Bank share responsibility and are coordinating closely their policy advice to the
Zambian authorities, such as trade, financial sector, public expenditure management,
including debt management, and economic governance. The Bank has taken the lead in the
social sectors, including health, education, social protection, water and sanitation, agriculture
and rural development, private sector development including regulatory issues and the
environment.
10.
The Fund and the Bank share joint responsibility in supporting the Government in
the preparation of the PRSP and its annual progress reports on the implementation of the
PRSP. The Fund and the Bank have also jointly provided assistance to Zambia for evaluating
progress to reach the Completion Point under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative. In addition, the
Bank and the Fund are jointly assisting GRZ to improve its debt and cash management
practices.

45
C.1. Areas in which the World Bank leads and there is no direct IMF involvement
11.
Areas in which the Bank leads and there is no direct involvement of the IMF are
support for social sectors, agriculture and rural development, economic diversification,
infrastructure, and the environment with the aim of informing Zambia’s next povertyreduction strategy. For the same purpose, the Bank has undertaken a Poverty and
Vulnerability Assessment
12.
HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and health. At this time, IDA is assisting the Ministry of
Health with a US$42 million project under a multi-sectoral AIDS program (ZANARA) and
US$20 million under its Malaria Booster project. In addition, IDA has carried out an ESW
on human resources in the health sector (FY04) and is to complete a health sector PER in
FY07. Building on this, IDA will provide support, but not necessarily financially for the
Health Sector Support Program (SWAP) beginning in FY07. The improvement of water
supplies under the Mine Township Services Project will also contribute to health outcomes in
the areas served.
13.
In education, the Bank is currently supporting the Ministry of Education’s efforts
in the area of technical education, vocational, and entrepreneurship training (TEVET). The
Government is carrying out reforms aimed at improving the quality of training, making it
more responsive to labor market demand and financially sustainable. Reforms also aim at
increasing the participation of female trainees and trainees from socio-economically
disadvantaged groups.
14.
In agriculture and rural development, the Bank’s focus is two fold:
improvement of productivity of the sector and increase of overall food security. The Bank
has reengaged in the agricultural sector given the priority Zambia attaches to this sector, as
set out in the PRSP/TNDP and in the forthcoming FNDP. Indeed, in a stable macroeconomic
environment, if supporting infrastructure and adequate agricultural policies are in place, a
major effort could be launched to unleash growth and poverty reduction potential of the
sector, in particular through well-targeted interventions for both smallholders and
commercial agriculture.
15.
Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA) have been undertaken to support the
formulation of an agricultural policy consistent with the planned and ongoing projects in
related sectors, such as roads and electricity, to remove bottlenecks that prohibit and or make
difficult for farmers to produce for the market. Hence, the policy dialogue with the
Government on reforms and priorities of public spending for agriculture and rural
development will address both short run policy issues, as well as a long run strategy to tap
the large agricultural export potential of the country, focusing on investment in land
development, irrigation, and infrastructure. A balanced treatment of smallholders and
commercial agriculture is important for growth and poverty reduction. To support this effort

46
an Agricultural Development Support Project has been approved in FY06 to assist the
Government with these challenges.
16.
The Bank supports economic diversification directly through its SEED project,
which is assisting implementation of a diversification strategy in the tourism, agribusiness,
and gemstone sectors. In the initial phase, the SEED project will focus on supporting the
design and establishment of appropriate policy and legal frameworks to encourage private
investments in these three sectors, as well as investments, primarily in tourism-related
infrastructure. The tourism component will work toward making Livingstone the flagship
tourism destination in Zambia and strengthening management of national parks, which
underpin Zambia’s medium-term tourism development strategy. The interventions in the
gemstones and agribusiness subsectors are focused to strengthen the supply chain that links
rural/small-scale producers to local and export markets.
17.
Private sector development. To improve Zambia’s investment climate, the Bank
and the IFC have assisted the Government with analytical work, notably an Investment
Climate Assessment and a FIAS-led Administrative Barriers to Investment study. These
studies are geared to facilitate the adoption of a new and more business friendly Investment
Act and result in regular consultations between business and Government to discuss how to
strengthen Zambia’s business climate. As a result of this dialogue, the Government, with
support from the Bank and the IFC as well as other donors, prepared a private sector
development strategy. The strategy was developed through an interactive process, which
included intensive consultations with the private sector and other donors and coordination
within the Government itself. Implementation of some of the reform actions identified in the
strategy has already started through analytical support by the Bank and through programs
funded by other donors.
18.
In the infrastructural sectors, the Bank is assisting the authorities in the
commercialization of ZESCO, Zambia’s electricity conglomerate as well as its ability to
build and maintain roads. Analytical work aims at identifying the main bottlenecks with
regard to competition and effective service delivery. The policy recommendations and
institutional changes would be supported through adjustment operations. In particular, the
ongoing and proposed investment projects (Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project and
the Water Sector Reform Project) would provide the financial resources needed for
investments. Zambia will also benefit from the Southern African Power Pool Project.
19.
Environmental concerns are addressed as part of each individual project as laid
down in the Bank’s safeguard policies. They are also addressed through the Bank’s
environmental project in the Copperbelt, which will assist Government with the cleanup of
several hazardous sites in the Copperbelt and Kabwe area. The SEED project will assist the
Government in making environmentally sustainable tourism in protected areas.

47
C.2. Areas in which the World Bank leads and its analysis serves as input into the IMF
program
20.
The Bank leads the dialogue on institutional dimensions of public expenditure
management and financial accountability as well as public sector reform and restructuring
and privatization. The Bank program will support these areas through a combination of
lending and analytical work. In the area of institutional dimensions of public expenditure
management and financial accountability, the Bank’s long-term objective is to encourage
a more transparent and accountable public sector by improving budget management,
procurement systems, and the accountability for public funds. The public sector reform and
restructuring agenda centers on instilling a more productive and efficient public service.
To achieve this goal, reform efforts aim at promoting a more qualified and motivated civil
service, developing a strategic management orientation in line ministries, improving policy
coordination and implementation, and lastly, strengthening local government’s capacity to
participate in the development process.
21.
While the Bank has taken the lead in privatization, the IMF has also a strong
interest in these areas since many of the reforms are critical to achieving macroeconomic
stabilization and enhancing Zambia’s growth prospects. Accordingly, there is a high degree
of consultation and coordination between the two institutions on these matters.
C.3. Areas of shared responsibility
22.
The Fund and the Bank are working jointly in the following five areas (i) trade
policy; (ii) financial sector reform; (iii) debt management and domestic debt market
development; (iv) PRSP monitoring and evaluation; and preparation of a LIC debt
sustainability analysis.
23.
In the area of trade policy, the Bank, with collaboration from other partners, will
undertake an integrated framework exercise. The Fund and the Bank jointly reviewed the
Financial Sector Development Plan (FSDP). Follow ups on the FSAP and the FSDP will
guide the Bank’s policy dialogue and interventions in the financial sector in close
collaboration with the IMF. The PRGF and the Economic Management and Growth Credit
assist the Government on the resolution of three state-owned Non-Bank Financial Institutions
and the strengthening of the operational independence of the Bank of Zambia. An FSAP
update is planned for 2007.
24.
Assistance in the areas of central government debt management and domestic
debt market development will focus on reducing vulnerability and the cost of and the need
for domestic financing. The Bank, through its Treasury department, has under taken a debt
management and debt market development assessment (FY05) and currently assists the
Government in putting the recommended institutional changes in place.

48
25.
The Fund and the Bank are working closely to review progress with Zambia’s
PRSP. The Bank and the Fund jointly prepared the Joint Staff Assessment Note (JSAN) on
the third annual progress report in December 2006 and are in the process of finalizing the
JSAN for the Zambia’s second PRSP i.e. the Fifth National Development Plan. Finally, the
Fund and the Bank jointly prepared a LIC DSA in late 2005. Zambia reached HIPC
completion in April 2005 and its completion point document contained also debt
sustainability analysis.
C.4. Areas in which the Fund leads and its analysis serves as input into the
World Bank program
26.
The Fund leads the dialogue on macroeconomic framework, in particular with
regard to fiscal policy, advising the Government on the overall envelope for public
expenditures, tax policy, as well as monetary and exchange rate policy. In these areas the
Bank takes into account the policy recommendations of the Fund and ensures that its own
policy advice, embedded in its development policy operation (the Economic Management
and Growth Credit), is consistent.

ANNEX IV. ZAMBIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data are generally adequate for surveillance purposes, but there are serious
shortcomings in the national accounts, balance of payments, and consumer prices. The
present arrangements for compiling macroeconomic statistics involve duplication of effort
and insufficient coordination among the Bank of Zambia (BoZ), the Ministry of Finance
and National Planning (MFNP), and the Central Statistical Office (CSO). The situation
largely reflects resource constraints and organizational weakness within the CSO that have
affected its ability to produce economic statistics on a timely basis.
2.
Resource constraints have also hampered the capacity to absorb technical
assistance (TA) in statistics. A STA mission visited Lusaka in October 2006 to discuss
ways to enhance the effectiveness of technical assistance. Discussions with the authorities
and donors focused on the need to implement a number of the 2004 data ROSC mission’s
recommendations and address the inadequate resources that have hampered the
effectiveness of TA, particularly in the area of balance of payments statistics. The
authorities committed to augment resources to support the compilation and dissemination
of national accounts, prices, balance of payments and government finance statistics (GFS)
and implementation of outstanding data ROSC mission recommendations.
3.
As one of 22 countries participating in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS) Project for Anglophone African Countries, Zambia has undertaken to use
the GDDS as a framework for the development of its national statistical system. Zambia is
participating in the national accounts and the GDDS/PRSP modules of the Anglophone
Africa project (funded by the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID)).
This project aims to assist participating countries to implement plans for improvement
identified in the metadata and to meet GDDS recommended statistical practices. Zambia’s
metadata were posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board on November 1,
2002 and partially updated in June 2006.
Real sector statistics
4.
The national accounts estimates are compiled according to the conceptual
guidelines of the 1968 SNA, but a phased approach to the introduction of the 1993 SNA is
planned. For the production approach, 1994 is the latest benchmark year for value-added
ratios. For many important industry areas, such as wholesale and retail trade, construction,
business services and many other service industries, consisting mainly of small-scale
private service providers, there are no appropriate indicators. Data on total production and
intermediate consumption of establishments are not available. On the expenditure side,
there are no reliable indicators of household consumption and private final consumption
expenditure is derived residually. Source data for estimating gross fixed capital formation
and changes in stocks are incomplete.

52
5.
An IMF/DFID GDDS mission that visited Lusaka during February 2006 noted that
the CSO had obtained data comprehensive enough to enable it to produce a new
benchmark for 2003. A follow-up mission in July 2006, however, found little progress
producing one. The authorities plan to conduct a comprehensive economic census to
complete the rebasing of the national accounts in 2007.
6.
Current price estimates for both production and expenditure have been derived
from the constant price indicators using wholesale price indices (WPIs) and consumer
price indices (CPIs) as deflators. However, for the most recent period, the WPI were not
available and the CPI components were used throughout the system.
7.
The CPI broadly adheres to international methodological standards. The
classification system used for compilation closely follows the Classification of Individual
Consumption by Purpose. However, the frequency of the household budget surveys has
been insufficient to capture changes in consumer expenditure structure on a timely basis.
The authorities plan to launch a new rebased CPI in 2008.
Government finance statistics
8.
In 2007, the authorities made progress with improving reporting Government
Finance Statistics for publication in the GFSY. They submitted a consistent time series of
GFS data, covering only the budgetary central government, for 2001 through 2007, based
on the GFSM 2001 framework. The transactional coverage of these data is limited to
government operations (revenue, expense) and transactions in nonfinancial assets. Data on
transactions in financial assets and liabilities are still unavailable. No monthly or quarterly
fiscal data are reported for publication in International Financial Statistics (IFS). The
authorities report monthly budget data to AFR for operational use in a timely manner, but
the data are often subject to substantial revisions, and data on extra-budgetary institutions
and local governments are not available.
9.
An IMF/DFID GDDS mission visited Lusaka in March 2003 to provide technical
assistance to the MFNP on government finance statistics and to advise on migration to the
methodology of the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM2001).
10.
An IMF/GDDS mission visited Lusaka again in May 2005 to assess the overall
quality, coverage, and timeliness of fiscal data. The mission found that decentralization of
government activities in earlier years had led to the creation of numerous extra-budgetary
institutions. While the majority of these entities follow international accounting practices,
they are not obliged to report to the MFNP. Currently, an estimated 35 percent of
government activities are not captured in the data. The mission also noted that the
implementation of Integrated Financial Management and Information System (IFMIS) is a
long-term project with an expected completion date of 2009.

53
Monetary and financial statistics
11.
In 2003, the BoZ migrated to a new computing system for generating its monthly
trial balance, which makes it possible to produce monetary accounts on a timely basis. The
BoZ has also eliminated discrepancies between its records and those of the IMF’s Finance
Department and it now publishes a monetary survey on a monthly basis. Monetary data are
reported to STA using standardized report forms; these data have been published in the
IFS Supplement since September 2006.
12.
An April- May 2005 monetary statistics mission found that the authorities had
implemented most of the previous recommendations by STA with one notable exception,
overdrafts were still being netted against deposits. The institutional coverage of other
depository corporations has been expanded to include commercial banks (including three
banks in liquidation), building societies, and the National Savings and Credit Bank. Data
reported by commercial banks are considered generally adequate, but there are some
problems in the sectorization of public sector deposits, resulting in some central
government deposits in national and foreign currencies being included in the definition of
broad money. Also, some other depository corporations record repurchase agreements as
the outright buying or selling of the securities, rather than as collateralized loans. Deposits
of three banks that are currently in the process of liquidation are classified as restricted
deposits and excluded from broad money.
External sector statistics
13.
Balance of payments statistics are compiled and disseminated by the BoZ in
accordance with the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual. However, the CSO
is legally responsible for compiling all macroeconomic statistics. Reporting of balance of
payments statistics for publication by the IMF Statistics Department remains problematic.
The most recent balance of payments data reported to STA are for 2000. International
investment position (IIP) data are not compiled.
14.
The 2004 data ROSC mission found data sources poor and unreliable, while
compilers were using inadequate methodologies. Balance of payments data contain serious
omissions, including some affecting the important mining sector. Furthermore, it found
that resources (including staffing) were inadequate for the task of compiling good quality
balance of payments data. The ability to absorb further technical assistance was also found
compromised due to the aforementioned weakness. In October 2006, the authorities agreed
to provide more staff for the compilation of balance of payments statistics to ensure better
absorption capacity prior to the provision of additional technical assistance in this area.
15.
Significant gaps in data exist in various areas including reinvested earnings, trade
credits, and export proceeds held abroad by mining and nontraditional exporters. While the
source data are generally adequate in terms of timeliness, they fall short in terms of

54
coverage. As a result the shortcomings in source data coverage, indirect estimation
methods are used, some of which have remained unchanged for many years and are out of
date. Also, data on services, income and transfers are incomplete and valuation methods
need to be improved. Source data on private sector foreign assets and liabilities are
insufficient to compile an IIP statement.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
December 7, 2007

1.
This statement provides information that has become available since the staff report
was issued to the Board. The thrust of the staff appraisal remains unchanged.
2.
Macroeconomic indicators remain robust. Inflation fell further in November, to
8.7 percent year-on-year, mostly on account of lower growth in food prices. International
reserves have continued to increase and by mid-November 2007 exceeded US$900 million
(2.5 months of imports). While the kwacha has remained stable against the US dollar since
mid-summer, the real and nominal effective rate depreciated by around 3 percent from July
to September 2007. Annual broad money growth slowed to 24 percent at end-September
2007 from 36 percent at end-June 2007.
3.
Reserve money growth has remained volatile. While reserve money declined as
projected immediately following the reduction in reserve requirements on October 1, in
recent weeks, reserve money has risen to well above the end-year projection.
4.
Revenue performance remained strong through October. Revenue collections
were 0.2 percent of GDP higher than projected, because of higher income tax collections.
While current expenditures were broadly in line with the budget, releases for domesticallyfinanced capital expenditure continued to record a shortfall relative to the revised budget
projection. Based on preliminary information, the overall fiscal position through October
continued to be in surplus due to slow implementation of domestically-financed capital
projects.
4.
A recently published living conditions survey indicates a decline in overall
poverty. The poverty headcount declined from 68 percent of the population in 2004 to
64 percent in 2006. While poverty in the urban areas declined significantly, the survey shows
a slight increase in poverty rates in the rural areas.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with Zambia
On December, 7, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Zambia.1
Background
The Zambian economy has performed well in recent years because of stronger macroeconomic
policies, a favorable external environment, and extensive debt relief. The economic expansion
has been broad-based and has benefited greatly from the revival of the mining sector and high
copper prices. Public finances have improved markedly and inflation has been brought under
control. The external position has strengthened significantly, mainly due to booming copper
export receipts and debt relief through the HIPC Initiative and MDRI, which have contributed to
a substantial real appreciation of the exchange rate and a buildup in international reserves.
Poverty has been reduced, but remains high; and while progress has been made in some
areas, the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals remains a challenge.
The positive economic performance of recent years continued in 2006 and the first half of 2007.
Real GDP accelerated to 6.2 percent in 2006, driven by a vigorous expansion in mining,
construction and telecommunications. Inflation, after falling to single digits in 2006, picked up in

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
early 2007, but tighter monetary conditions and a turnaround in the kwacha brought it back to
single digits (9 percent) in October.
Fiscal consolidation has continued. Revenue outperformed projections through September
2007, reflecting higher income tax payments from mining companies. Expenditures, however,
were below projections owing to a large shortfall in releases for capital projects and because the
released funds were not fully spent due to delays in tender procedures. The overall balance
(including grants) was 0.8 percent of GDP through September—about 2½ percentage points of
GDP higher than projected.
The rate of monetary expansion has fluctuated widely, in part due to difficulties in managing the
monetary and exchange rate consequences of variations in capital inflows. On October 1, the
statutory reserve requirement was reduced from 14 percent to 8 percent, injecting additional
liquidity into the banking system and necessitating offsetting measures to contain monetary
growth. Nominal interest rates on government securities have trended upward since late 2006,
while real rates have risen moderately since inflation peaked earlier in the year.
The external position has strengthened considerably. The current account deficit (excluding
grants) declined markedly to 1.3 percent of GDP in 2006, as copper export receipts doubled and
nontraditional exports increased by 30 percent. Export receipts remained strong in the first half
of 2007. The strong external position and the tight fiscal conditions contributed to a build up of
international reserves to about 2.4 months of imports at end-June 2007.

Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the Zambian authorities for pursuing sound macroeconomic policies,
which, together with high copper export prices and debt relief, have contributed to a strong
economic performance. Economic growth is robust, inflation has been brought under control,
and public finances and the external position have both improved markedly.
Directors encouraged the authorities to take advantage of the favorable outlook to step up their
efforts to further strengthen growth and reduce poverty in the context of the Fifth National
Development Plan. The focus should be on improving budget execution and creating fiscal
space for increased spending on infrastructure and social sectors; strengthening project
evaluation and implementation capacity; diversifying the economy to reduce the vulnerability to
fluctuations in copper prices; and further improving the conditions for private sector growth.
Managing the effects of high foreign exchange inflows will be key to maintaining
macroeconomic stability.
Directors commended the reduction of inflation to single-digit levels, and recommended a
continued tight monetary policy in the period ahead. Directors noted the complications for
liquidity management that could arise from weaknesses in budget execution and the recent
lowering of statutory reserve requirements. In this respect, they welcomed the authorities’
decision to postpone some nonpriority project spending in the last quarter of the year, and the

3
transfer of government deposits from commercial banks to the central bank. Foreign exchange
sales to mop up excess liquidity could also be considered, although Directors recognized that
this should be balanced against the need for a further modest build-up of international reserves
to enhance the country’s ability to weather external shocks. Going forward, strengthened
coordination between fiscal and monetary policy, and the further development of the financial
system, would be important steps to improve liquidity management.
Directors believed that the authorities’ managed float exchange rate policy continues to serve
Zambia well. They welcomed the assessment that the current exchange rate is consistent with
external stability and aligned with economic fundamentals, including a significant improvement
in the terms of trade.
Directors commended the authorities’ disciplined fiscal stance, and welcomed the targeted
increase in revenues and shift towards capital spending and arrears reduction in the preliminary
2008 budget. They noted that the projected growth in the government wage bill heightens the
need to accelerate civil service and pay reform. Directors emphasized the importance of
strengthening tax administration and widening the tax base, and welcomed the efforts underway
to increase revenue by aligning the fiscal regime for mining companies with international
standards.
Directors saw further progress on strengthening public expenditure management as crucial to
enhancing the effective use of public resources. They encouraged the authorities to step up
implementation of the public expenditure management and financial accountability reform
program, including establishing a treasury single account and implementing the integrated
financial management and information system. Directors stressed the importance of aligning the
budget cycle with the fiscal year and finalizing the new procurement act in order to improve
budget execution.
Directors were encouraged that the risk of external debt distress in Zambia is currently low.
They commended the authorities’ efforts to strengthen debt management, and their cautious
approach to external borrowing, which focuses on concessional loans. While acknowledging
that, in the absence of concessional resources, some nonconcessional external borrowing could
be considered for projects that are economically viable, Directors cautioned that such borrowing
should not jeopardize debt sustainability. In particular, it would be important to complement the
debt strategy with measures to improve capacity to evaluate investment projects.
Directors welcomed the progress made on financial sector reform, and supported further efforts
to deepen the financial sector and lower intermediation costs. They encouraged the authorities
to develop an active secondary market in government securities, further improve the legal and
regulatory framework for financial activity, and broaden the availability of financial services.
Directors called for accelerated implementation of reforms to improve the business environment
and to enhance productivity and competitiveness. They welcomed the authorities’ commitment
to an open trade regime to accelerate export development. Directors considered the
development of the energy sector to be vital to achieving a vibrant private sector and reducing

4
poverty. They emphasized the importance of raising electricity tariffs to levels consistent with full
cost recovery, and of strengthening the corporate governance and efficiency of the public utility.
Directors welcomed the progress made toward participation in the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Peter Gakunu, Executive Director for Zambia and Dieudonne Nintunze,
Senior Advisor to Executive Director.
December 7, 2007

1.
The Zambian authorities are appreciative of the continued support by the Executive
Board and Management. They value the constructive policy dialogue and advice given by
staff under the program, and the candid exchange of views during the last discussions in
Lusaka under the 2007 Article IV Consultation, and welcome the comments and
recommendations in the well balanced report and analytical insights contained in the
selected issues paper.
Recent economic developments and prospects
2.
Over the recent years, the Zambian authorities have commendably pursued strong
economic and financial policies that have contributed to the improved economic conditions
and sustaining macroeconomic stability. Deepened implementation of the structural reform
agenda, notably the public sector reform, financial sector development plan, and private
sector development initiative, has resulted in robust and broad-based growth, improved
external position, and a recovery in employment creation. In addition, the poverty level,
though still high, has started to trend downward. For the fifth consecutive year, the Zambian
economy registered impressive performance, and the outlook is favorable. Real GDP growth
picked up to 6.2 percent in 2006 led by strong activity in mining, manufacturing,
construction, services, and other sectors, and is expected to continue expanding by 6-7
percent on average per year over the medium-term. Inflation was contained at its lowest
levels in three decades, and the authorities’ objective is to contain it further to lower single
digits in the medium-term. The level of international reserves has also strengthened over the
recent years, as external sector conditions improved substantially supported by increases in
copper export receipts and expansion of non-traditional exports, as well as extensive debt
relief.
3.
The authorities remain committed to fiscal consolidation, with revenue collection
expected to reach 18.4 percent of GDP in 2007 and should continue improving in the
medium-term, fueled by reforms in the tax system, improved tax administration, and higher
income tax payments from mining companies. Primary expenditures were contained in 2006
below the program target, while important social programs were protected from spending
cuts, in particular the objective of recruiting additional teachers and health workers. Spending
on domestically financed poverty-reducing programs was absorbed at 6.0 percent of GDP
and is expected to further increase to 8.3 percent of GDP in 2007. Nonetheless, the
authorities are aware of the existing difficulties in budget execution, including under

2
expenditure on capital projects and associated delays in tenders. As a result, expenditures
were below projection at end-September 2007, and government deposits at the Bank of
Zambia (BoZ) increased accordingly. The authorities are committed to reinforce
implementation of the Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Reform
(PEMFA) which will contribute to address the budget execution rigidities.
4.
The BoZ intensified its efforts of containing excess liquidity in the banking system
through its open market operations and auctions of government securities, with a view to
attaining its objective of low levels of inflation. In this connection, the reserve money
growth, which had accelerated in 2006, slowed down in June 2007. The authorities are aware
of liquidity pressures stemming from speeding up of budget execution in the last months of
2007, and the recent reduction in cash reserve requirement in October 2007. To this end, they
are initiating appropriate measures, including postponement of part of the budget releases for
non-priority projects and transfer of government deposits from commercial banks to the
BOZ.
5.
The exchange rate is aligned with macroeconomic fundamentals, and domestic and
financial policies are consistent with external stability. Financial conditions and performance
of the banking sector are broadly satisfactory. Capital and reserves are in compliance with
the prudential requirements, and the banking sector is well capitalized, while the asset
quality, earnings and liquidity ratios remain at sound levels.
Medium-term policy challenges and strategies
6.
Notwithstanding the impressive economic performance and positive medium-term
outlook, the authorities are concerned that Zambia may not be able to achieve the MDGs.
The main challenges include the need to further consolidate macroeconomic stability and
diversify the economy, with a view to sustaining high economic growth and enhancing
employment and income opportunities for the population. The authorities are committed to
strengthening implementation of their Fifth National Development Plan (FNDP) to achieve
their objectives of creating fiscal space, strengthening absorptive capacity of development
spending, managing macroeconomic effects of increased foreign exchange inflows, and
further improving conditions for private sector growth.
Fiscal policy
7.
In the FNDP, the authorities are committed to increasing spending for povertyreducing programs and growth enhancing infrastructure investments. They recognize that
attaining these objectives requires creation of appropriate fiscal space to preserve fiscal and
debt sustainability. To this end, the Government has recently conducted a comprehensive
review of the tax policy and tax administration, including tax holidays and mining taxation,
with the support of Fund TA. Implementation of the tax system and tax administration

3
reforms that would result in a more buoyant, simpler, broadened, equitable and well
administered tax regime, will continue. The Implementation of the recommendations of the
tax review has started with the 2007 budget, and the authorities will continue renegotiating
development agreements with the mining companies. It is expected that these actions will
substantially improve tax compliance and sustain revenue performance levels at above 19.0
percent of GDP in the medium-term.
8.
In addition to revenue enhancing initiatives, the authorities have made strong progress
in developing a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) to ensure allocation of higher
capital spending in the identified priority sectors. They remain committed to making further
progress in improving public expenditure management, with a view to addressing the
existing difficulties in budget execution, improving coordination between fiscal and
monetary policy, and enhancing absorptive capacity of public investment. To further increase
the effectiveness and productivity of the public sector, the authorities will accelerate
implementation of the PEMFA reforms, including the IFMIS. They have already taken
important steps to strengthen debt management, and will continue enhancing capacity to
formulate and execute investment projects.
Monetary and exchange rate policies
9.
The authorities’ main objective in monetary policy is to maintain low inflation levels.
In this connection, the BOZ will continue monitoring inflationary pressures and adopt
appropriate measures to keep reserve money in line with the targets. The managed floating
exchange rate regime has served the economy well, and will continue with BOZ limiting its
interventions to correcting transitory overshooting of the exchange rate and meeting its
international reserve targets. The authorities are aware of the challenges associated with
management of increased foreign currency inflows to monetary policy and competitiveness.
Capitalizing on their recent experience and the recommendations of a recent Fund TA, they
will use foreign exchange sales to mop up the excess liquidity generated by the increased
inflows from the booming mining sector and donor support. To avoid aggravating exchange
rate volatility, and raising interest rates, the authorities will carefully plan the time for the
sales and continue improving foreign exchange market.
Structural reforms
10.
The authorities’ structural reform agenda is mainly aimed at improving conditions for
private sector growth, in addition to strengthening public finance management. To this end,
they remain committed to enabling a friendly-investment environment and reducing cost of
doing business, notably through a combination of deepened implementation of the financial
sector development (FSDP) plan, a more open trade regime, and removal of infrastructure
bottlenecks especially by developing the energy sector. They are also strongly committed to
good governance, and have conducted a participatory process in accordance with the

4
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) guidelines and made important progress
toward its formal adoption, with the support of the World Bank.
11.
Improving access to financial services is important for private sector development
and economic growth. In this connection, the authorities are committed to taking steps to
strengthen supervision and broaden access to financial services. The BoZ is establishing a
framework for risk-based supervision, and is advancing with implementation of the second
phase of the FSDP which would help strengthen financial system stability and access to
credit. The establishment of a Credit Reference Bureau and an enabling environment for
microfinance are also underway and should positively change the credit culture and expand
credit and other financial services to rural businesses. The BoZ is also developing the capital
market, including support for the creation of an active secondary market in government
securities.
12.
The authorities are committed to further promoting a more open trade regime. They
are playing a pivotal role in regional economic integration within COMESA, and plan to
implement the Trade Protocol agreed under SADC. They will streamline procedures and
reduce the time required to process exporting and importing goods, with a view to
substantially reducing the cost of cross-border trading.
13.
Infrastructure bottlenecks have been identified as the main impediment to sustained
high growth as they increase the cost of doing business and reduce competitiveness and
productivity. In this connection, the authorities intend to upgrade quality, expand capacity
and increase efficiency in energy, transport, and telecommunications infrastructure.
Particular emphasis would be on increased investments in the energy sector. In doing so, the
authorities are aware of the need to improve governance and efficiency of the public utility,
ZESCO, including application of cost-based rates to mining companies.
Conclusion
14.
The Zambian authorities’ continued commitment to sound macroeconomic policies
and structural reforms is translating into robust economic performance over the recent years,
contrasting with episodes of stagnation of the past decades. They are conscious that further
reform effort is required to consolidate the progress made and sustain high economic growth
rates to effectively tackle the still widespread poverty and attain the MDGs. To this end, the
authorities count on continued support from the Fund, and are looking forward to the
finalization of the discussion on the successor program. They are committed to continue
consolidating macroeconomic stability and stepping up implementation of their structural
reform agenda through the FNDP, which they consider to be the appropriate framework.
