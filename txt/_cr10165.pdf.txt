May 7, 2010
Article IV consultation and program discussions were held in Dakar during March 11–
25, 2010. The team comprised Mr. Funke (head), Mr. Lakwijk, Mr. Gitton (all AFR),
Ms. Sancak (FAD), Mr. Painchaud (SPR), and Ms. Fichera (resident representative).
Mr. Sembene (OED) joined the policy discussions. The team met with Finance Minister
Diop, Budget Minister Diop, Agriculture Minister Sarr, Energy Minister Sarr, International
Cooperation and Infrastructure Minister Wade, BCEAO National Director Diop, other
senior government officials, and representatives of development partners and the private
sector. The mission cooperated closely with the World Bank.
Seminars and outreach. In two half-day seminars the authorities presented the findings of
their studies on (i) competitiveness in the West African Economic and Monetary Union
(WAEMU); (ii) intertemporal budget constraints and their impact on growth; and (iii) the
impact on growth of the state’s arrears to the private sector. The team made presentations
on (i) liquidity management; (ii) fiscal risks and debt sustainability; (iii) competitiveness of
the Senegalese economy; (iv) the role of the banking sector in government financing; and
(v) the revised debt sustainability framework. The mission met with representatives of
parliament, trade unions, and civil society organizations.
Article IV consultations. The discussions centered on how to regain sustained economic
growth after the external and domestic shocks of the past two years.
Fifth PSI and third ESF reviews. Staff recommends their completion. All but one
quantitative assessment/performance criteria have been met and most structural
conditionality has been observed. Staff supports the authorities’ request for waivers for
nonobservance of the assessment/performance criterion on the fiscal balance because of
corrective actions taken by the authorities.
Exchange restrictions and regime. Senegal, a member of the WAEMU, accepted the
obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3 and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement
as of June 1, 1996, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions. The WAEMU’s exchange
regime is a conventional peg to the euro.

Executive Summary
The external and domestic shocks of the past few years contributed to a major loss in output.
Senegal needs to accelerate structural reforms to regain its growth momentum. In a difficult
environment, program performance has been mixed on the macroeconomic front but
satisfactory on the structural side.
Signs of an emerging recovery: Recent indicators of activity, credit growth, and government
revenues suggest that growth may have bottomed out. Real GDP growth, which averaged about
2 percent in 2008 and 2009, is expected to pick up to close to 3½ percent in 2010. Consumer
price inflation, which was negative in the second half of 2009, is expected to return gradually to
its long-run trend of about 2 percent.
Raising growth as a policy priority: The oil, food, and financial crises, coupled with domestic
shocks, have contributed to a significant output loss. Improving nonprice competitiveness will
be crucial to regaining growth momentum. Authorities and staff agreed that Senegal must
accelerate structural reforms in the business climate, governance, the energy sector, and the
financial sector to boost competitiveness and growth. In line with findings for the WAEMU,
three different approaches suggest that the real effective exchange rate may be modestly
overvalued but the estimates are within the normal margin of error.
Broadly satisfactory program performance: All but one quantitative assessment/performance
criteria were met. The missed criterion on the fiscal balance points to continued weaknesses in
public financial management. Structural reforms were generally satisfactory. With the
authorities’ firm commitment to further public financial management reforms, on balance staff
recommends completion of the fifth PSI and the third and last ESF reviews and granting waivers
of nonobservance for the assessment/performance criterion on the fiscal balance because of
corrective actions taken by the authorities.
Persistent risks: Risks to growth and the program relate to unexpectedly subdued external
demand, financing constraints that limit the fiscal room for maneuver, and renewed problems
with electricity supply. Opportunistic changes in economic policies for political reasons could
also dampen prospects.

6
I. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND SHORT-TERM OUTLOOK: ECONOMIC ACTIVITY MAY HAVE
BOTTOMED OUT
1.
Following the food and fuel price shocks in 2008, economic activity slowed further
in 2009 because of the global economic downturn and domestic shocks, including
temporary electricity shortages (Figure 1, Tables 1–5).


Economic growth. Real GDP growth is estimated to have been 1½ percent in 2009
(Table 1). Lower external demand and downward pressure on remittances, tourism
receipts, and foreign direct investment (FDI) have reduced growth. The agricultural
sector, which benefited from supportive policies and favorable weather, helped to
mitigate the impact of depressed demand at home and abroad on the secondary sector
(construction, energy) and particularly the tertiary sector (transport, tourism services).



Inflation. The drop in crude oil and food prices pushed down consumer prices. Inflation
has been negative since the second half of 2009.



Fiscal balance: The overall fiscal deficit widened to 5.1 percent of GDP in 2009 from
3.7 percent of GDP two years earlier on account of lower tax revenues and higher
expenditure.



Balance of payments. The decline in the 2009 current account deficit reflected mainly
lower energy and food imports as export performance (outside the recovering chemicals
sector) was subdued (Table 2). The global economic downturn caused FDI to recede.1

2.
There are signs that economic activity
has bottomed out. Real GDP growth is
projected to reach 3½ percent in 2010. The
industrial activity index and credit growth to
the economy, which had been declining during
most of 2009, started to pick up toward yearend. Inflation should return gradually to
2 percent.

3.
Uncertainties about the short-term outlook persist. Risks to growth mainly relate to
sluggish external demand, financing constraints that limit the fiscal room for maneuver, and
renewed problems with electricity supplies. Opportunistic changes in economic policies for
political reasons could also dampen growth prospects. On the positive side, a faster than
expected pickup in global activity could have positive spillover effects.

II. PROGRAM PERFORMANCE
4.
Macroeconomic performance has been mixed. All
MEFP ¶4, 16, 17
quantitative performance/assessment criteria through end-December
2009 except the one for the (basic) fiscal balance were met. Revenues
fell short, mostly due to tax arrears of agencies and other public entities. But current
expenditure, which was well below program objectives during the first 9 months of 2009, was
also higher than programmed (Tables 3 and 4). The authorities explained that they had to pay
higher utility bills and use supplemental appropriation decrees (décrets d’avance) totaling some
0.5 percent of GDP, signed by the President and Prime Minister and permitted for emergency
measures by the 2001 organic law, including to pay contractuals in the education sector. As a
result, the end-2009 basic fiscal deficit was ¾ percent of GDP higher than targeted (Table 7).
While staff appreciated the authorities’ increased financial monitoring of public entities in 2010
in view of their tax arrears, staff stressed that the authorities should budget sufficient amounts
for essential spending and should have reduced other non-priority expenditure to maintain the
budget deficit target. To minimize the risks of higher than initially budgeted current spending,
the authorities expressed their intention to offset future supplemental expenditures. This year’s
budget, for the first time, has a contingency reserve for unforeseen current expenditure. These
actions increase the authorities’ spending control and form the basis for the waiver request for
the missed end-December 2009 performance/assessment criterion.
5.
Performance on the structural side has been satisfactory (Text
MEFP ¶5
Table 1) and structural benchmarks for the fifth review have
generally been met. The authorities have issued a press statement on the
settlement of extrabudgetary commitments, but some details of the modalities still need to be
spelled out. They also elaborated action plans to promote the financial sector and reduce tax
expenditures. Planned structural reforms focus on public financial management, settlement of
remaining extrabudgetary commitments and agency debt, and tax policy.

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS: REGAINING GROWTH MOMENTUM
A. Overview
6.
Article IV consultation discussions centered on how to return to higher growth and
reduce vulnerabilities to shocks. At the time of the last Article IV consultation, medium-term
economic growth was expected to average about 5½ percent, but annual growth averaged only
about 2 percent for 2008–2009 which likely implies a permanent output loss (Figure 2). While
Senegal has put in place policies that are consistent with past staff advice (Box 1), structural
reform has proved more challenging in part because of the difficult external environment.
Progress towards the MDGs has been mixed (Table 9). The successive shocks have complicated
the implementation of the authorities’ poverty reduction strategy and possibly reversed earlier
gains in poverty reduction. While the recent period has shown the limits of existing institutions
and policies to help the poor cope with such shocks, the authorities have reaffirmed their
commitment to achieve the PRS long-term objectives through the implementation of their
reform agenda and higher growth. Work on their PRSP-3 is ongoing and will likely be finalized
by the end of the year. Higher growth will be vital if Senegal is to reduce poverty and continue
to make significant progress toward the MDGs.
Box 1. Senegal’s Reactions to Past IMF Advice
Senegal and the IMF have a very good working relationship. The country’s policies have
been generally consistent with IMF recommendations, as reflected in the completion of past
ECF (formerly known as PRGF) arrangements and the first four PSI reviews. Authorities and
staff generally agree on the main bottlenecks to higher growth. The authorities aim to create a
more investment-friendly business environment to foster private sector development.
The authorities acted upon the policy recommendations, particularly in the fiscal area,
from the 2008 Article IV consultation and subsequent technical assistance. As was
recommended, they corrected much of the fiscal slippages. To reduce the risk of future
slippages, the authorities have applied their budget framework more rigorously. In line with the
PSI-supported program commitments, they have substantially reduced unpaid bills to the
private sector and launched far-reaching PFM reforms. But progress in some structural
reforms, outside the Fund’s core expertise and not covered by benchmarks, including related to
the energy sector and the business climate, has been mixed.

7.
Staff and authorities agreed that several complementary policies need to be put in
place to regain Senegal’s growth momentum and return to previous growth trajectories
(Figures 3 and 4): (i) maintaining supportive macroeconomic policies; (ii) fully and
expeditiously normalizing relations with the private sector; and (iii) accelerating structural
reforms to overcome such bottlenecks as cumbersome business procedures, governance issues,
frequent electricity outages, and limited access to finance.

B. Gradually Reducing Fiscal Stimulus
8.
With a higher than expected fiscal deficit in 2009, financing
MEFP ¶8, 12
constraints, and signs of a pick-up in activity, authorities and staff
concurred that the fiscal stimulus should be gradually reduced to
progressively achieve a medium-term deficit target of 4 percent of GDP (and somewhat
less in the long run). To contain the deficit, the authorities expressed their commitment to
reduce current expenditure and reinforce efforts to bring in more revenue
(including through preparing for tax expenditure rationalization—
MEFP ¶23
structural benchmark). To finance the deficit, they plan to tap the regional
market several times this year. It appears that tax revenues started to recover in early 2010, and
regional liquidity is high. But because of uncertainties about whether these developments will
persist, the authorities have agreed to slow expenditure (mostly investment) by about ½ percent
of GDP.2 Authorities and staff concurred that expenditure could be raised back to the budgeted
level later in the year, if revenue collection permits or additional financing becomes available
through privatization proceeds. To minimize liquidity and financing risks, staff encouraged the
authorities to update their treasury and bond issuance plans more often. A
MEFP ¶20, 21
gradual reduction in the fiscal deficit will help move Senegal back onto
the path of meeting WAEMU convergence criteria in the medium term.

Regularization of extrabudgetary spending and public institution/agency debt in the May 2010 supplementary
budget continues to be recorded below the line and excluded from the fiscal balance for program purposes (and in
Tables 3 and 4) pending finalization of modalities. To the extent that it will eventually be recorded above the line,
the fiscal deficit will increase.

C. Fully Normalizing Relations with the Private Sector
9.
The authorities have made more progress in normalizing financial relations with
the private sector than was expected during
Budgetary Float
(In Billions of CFA Francs)
the last program reviews (Box 2).
Representatives of the private sector confirmed
that past payment delays are being addressed. In
addition to advancing with the settlement of
extrabudgetary spending and public institution
and agency debt, the stock of unpaid bills within
the regular expenditure chain has been kept at
normal levels since mid-2009 (quantitative
performance / assessment criterion on the budgetary float).3 Tight monitoring and management
of unpaid bills within the expenditure chain (budgetary float) is important for improving cash
flow supervision and preventing budgetary slippages. Staff stressed that liquidity needs to be
better managed so that normal fluctuations in the flow of revenues and expenditures can be
absorbed without recourse to abrupt spending halts or arrears; to this end, a census of
government accounts will be completed (structural benchmark).

The authorities reiterated their commitment to speedily
MEFP ¶9,10
regularize the remaining extrabudgetary spending and public
institution/agency debt through a transparent and publicly
communicated process. This should bring financial relations between the government and the
private sector back to normal. The supplementary budget to be submitted to parliament by midMay 2010 will incorporate further regularization, consistent with the authorities’ commitment to
pay down at least 50 percent of extrabudgetary spending and public institution / agency debt by
the end of September 2010 (structural benchmarks). To help prevent a recurrence of payment
issues vis-à-vis the private sector, the SIGFIP budget system continues to
MEFP ¶17,18
be improved (structural benchmark), and financial relations between the
Treasury and public institutions/agencies have been strengthened.
D. Reaping the Benefits of Public Investment
11.
The authorities are putting more emphasis on public investment to support
economic development and diversification. With the support of donors, the authorities are
giving priority to extending and modernizing transport infrastructure to facilitate access to
markets. Several large infrastructure projects are progressing, including the Blaise Diagne
International Airport, the Dakar-Diamniadio toll road, other road projects, and modernization of
the port of Dakar. Plans for other new important projects, such as the establishment of a special
economic zone, conversion of the current airport into a business complex, road construction,
and water distribution and housing projects, are in various stages of development. The

Box 2. Extrabudgetary Spending and Public Institution/Agency Debt
The government’s financial relations with the private sector are returning to normal as
extrabudgetary spending and public institution/agency debt are settled. Of the estimated total of
CFAF 119 billion, CFAF 37 billion was found to be intragovernmental (taxes and social
security contributions) and to have no impact on the private sector. Out of the remaining total
of CFAF 82 billion (1½ percent of GDP) of extrabudgetary spending and public institution/
agency debt vis-à-vis the private sector, CFAF 35 billion was settled in 2009 and at least half
of the remainder will be paid by September 2010.


Of the extrabudgetary spending by ministeries of CFAF 36 billion (⅔ percent of GDP)
that the July 2009 audit identified, some CFAF 10 billion has been regularized in the
2009 and 2010 budgets, and the first supplementary budget for 2010 will regularize the
remainder (mid-May structural benchmark).



Public institution/agency debt to the private sector amounted to CFAF 45 billion
(¾ percent of GDP), of which two-thirds was paid in late 2009 when an easing cash
position allowed the Treasury to unblock amounts due. The remaining one-third is to
be settled in 2010–11.

authorities noted that these projects would support economic diversification, help reduce
poverty,4 and lessen Senegal’s vulnerability to external shocks.
12.
The authorities plan to look at a variety of financing options for their new
infrastructure projects. They intend to hold a donors’ conference on
MEFP ¶13, 14
infrastructure financing and seek economic profitability assessments for
their projects. Following the issuance in December 2009 of a US$200 million bond with a fiveyear maturity for the Dakar-Diamniadio toll road, the authorities inquired about possible room
for additional external nonconcessional financing. Staff stated that nonconcessional borrowing
for Senegal should for the time being stay linked to specific projects that have been assessed as
economically profitable by a reputable source, for which sufficient concessional financing or
financing in the regional market could not be mobilized. Projects must be analyzed case by case.
But given Senegal’s low risk of debt distress, confirmed by the latest Bank-Fund debt
sustainability analysis (DSA), there should in principle be some space for nonconcessional
financing for new infrastructure projects as long as they do not jeopardize Senegal’s debt
sustainability. Untied limits could become possible after PFM improves.
13.
Staff stressed that investment projects should be selected and
prioritized based on rigorous economic cost-benefit analyses. Careful
assessments, including analysis of maintenance costs, would make it

The livelihood of about half the population is still closely tied to subsistence agriculture.

MEFP ¶22

easier to select the highest-return projects and help raise the productivity of government
spending. Progress in this domain could be instrumental in improving Senegal’s capacity to
manage its finances, for example as reflected in the PEFA (Public Expenditure and Fiscal
Accountability) assessment and CPIA (Country Policy and Institutional Assessment).
E. Boosting Competitiveness and Growth Through Accelerated Structural Reforms
Price and Structural Competitiveness
14.
Despite a significant devaluation
in 1994, Senegal’s export performance
has been weak. Its share of world export
volumes has been declining gradually since
the mid-1980s, though recently production
improvements at ICS (phosphoric acid)
have slowed the decline.

While Senegal’s real effective exchange rate (REER) has appreciated over the past
two years, there is no conclusive evidence that the exchange rate is overvalued. This
conclusion is consistent with a recent regional external stability assessment that found the
WAEMU region’s REER not to be misaligned. It is based on an analysis of possible real
exchange rate misalignment undertaken using three complementary approaches (Box 3 and
Figure 5). Senegal’s competitiveness could be raised by improving the
MEFP ¶29-30
business environment and governance.
Energy Sector Reform
16.
Temporary electricity shortages add to the cost of doing business and fiscal risks.
Since 2006 power shortages and blackouts in Senegal have been frequent. The high cost and
poor quality of electricity supplies appear to be a major impediment to private investment.5 The
national electricity company, SENELEC, has been recapitalized in 2007 (CFAF 65 billion) and
in 2008 (CFAF 37 billion). But technical failures persist, leading to higher production costs,
constraints in fuel supply, delays in putting in place energy-saving measures, tax arrears, and
weaknesses in internal governance.
17.
Staff stressed that the government’s reform plan, in
MEFP ¶24-26
collaboration with the Bank and other donors, needs to be fully and
promptly implemented to limit fiscal and economic risks. The plan builds on a wide range of
measures, including restructuring of SENELEC’s short-term debt, fresh financing, some tax
breaks on new investment, and cost-recovering tariff adjustments. SENELEC will need to be
made financially sound on a permanent basis to ensure adequate electricity distribution.
Electricity production, transportation, and distribution are expected to be separated in the future.

Senegal ranks 113 out of 133 countries for quality of electricity supply in World Economic Forum, Global
Competitiveness Report 2009– 2010.

17
Box 3. Assessment of the REER and External Competitiveness
While Senegal’s real effective exchange rate (REER) has appreciated by almost
14 percent since 1994, there is no conclusive evidence that the exchange rate is
overvalued, and the recent depreciation of the euro has reduced pressure. An analysis of
possible real exchange rate misalignment was undertaken using three complementary
approaches:
Macroeconomic balance: The current account deficit “norm” is estimated at 5.5–6.0 percent of
GDP, while the “underlying” current account deficit is estimated at 9¼ percent of GDP,
consistent with the projected current account balance over 2012–15.1 Assuming a trade
balance elasticity for small countries of –0.71, the difference between the norm and the
“underlying” current account indicates that the REER is overvalued by 5 percent.2
Equilibrium exchange rate: A comparison of the current value of the REER and an estimate of
its equilibrium value indicates that the real effective exchange rate is close to its equilibrium.3
External sustainability: Assuming a negative net international investment position of 50
percent of GDP, Senegal’s current account deficit norm would be about 3.5 percent of GDP.
This norm is consistent with a REER overvaluation of about 8 percent. However, the most
recent DSA suggests that a larger current account deficit is sustainable given the projected FDI
inflows and the concessionality of external financing.
To improve its competitiveness, Senegal needs a better business environment. While its
ranking in the Global Competitiveness Report has recently improved, Senegal still ranks 92
out of 133 countries. Areas of weakness the report identified include: (i) higher education and
training; (ii) labor market efficiency; (iii) financial market sophistication; (iv) market size; and
(v) health and primary education. The World Bank Doing Business Report 2010, in which
Senegal ranked 157 out of 183 countries, highlights the need for improvement in the cost of
doing business in Senegal in areas such as: (i) hiring workers; (ii) registering property;
(iii) protecting investors; and (iv) paying taxes.
Senegal could also improve its competitiveness by enhancing its governance. In the latest
CPIA of the World Bank, Senegal ranked 57 out of 75 low-income countries, and areas for
improvement are: (i) social protection and labor; (ii) quality of budget and financial
management; and (iii) transparency, accountability, and corruption control in the public sector.

Financial Sector Reform
18.
The global crisis has had negligible effects on the banking system, but the sector is
affected by the slowdown in economic growth. Bank loan quality has deteriorated because of
domestic economic conditions. As in other countries in the WAEMU region, compliance with
prudential requirements has historically been mixed (Tables below). But most banks are on
track to meet the higher minimum capital requirements by December 2010. The authorities are
assessing the position of credit institutions likely to encounter difficulties in complying with the
new rules and proposing targeted measures. Some private sector participants saw a need to
review some prudential requirements (e.g., on the maturity matching of assets and resources),
which may be too conservative and hinder market development.

19.
Stress tests by the authorities suggest the banking system may have some resilience
to large credit shocks. Based on December 2009 data, if credit quality worsened and
provisioning needed to increase by 50 percent, the global capital adequacy of the banking
system would deteriorate by less than 1 percentage point, and no additional bank would violate
the regulation on the minimum capital adequacy ratio. Even if nonperforming loans increased
by 25 percent, the capital adequacy ratio of the banking system as a whole would be well above
the 8 percent threshold at 14.5 percent, although a third bank would breach the regulation.
20.
Authorities and staff saw scope to improve the contribution of
the financial sector to investment and long-run growth (Figure 6).

Surveys of firms identify inadequate access to finance as the leading constraint to private sector
development in Senegal.6 The authorities have taken stock of various reform initiatives in an
updated consolidated financial sector action plan (completed structural benchmark), taking into
account progress since the 2004 national FSAP and the 2007 regional FSAP. The action plan
lists a number of decisions to be taken in 2010–2011 to further improving the institutional, legal,
and operational environment of the financial sector, including increasing the rate of bank
penetration, while at the same time guarding against vulnerabilities.
IV. PROGRAM ISSUES
21.
The appended Letter of Intent and accompanying Memorandum of Economic and
Financial Policies outlines the authorities’ policy objectives for the remainder of 2010.
Quantitative assessment criteria for end-June 2010 are shown in Table 1 and structural measures
in Table 2 of Appendix I (see also Text Table 2). The thrust of the structural measures remains
unchanged.
22.
The program includes an adjuster for the basic fiscal balance if additional
privatization revenues materialize. In that case, the floor on the basic fiscal balance will be
adjusted downward by up to CFAF 35 billion. The adjuster would help the authorities to sustain
their original spending plans. Any additional privatization receipts could support new
infrastructure projects in next year’s budget.
23.
The program faces risks, notwithstanding the authorities’ commitment to their
program. These risks include continued revenue shortfalls, liquidity shortages in the regional
market, delays in implementing domestic reforms, and institutional and policy changes in the
run-up to elections intensifying spending pressures. Increased vigilance with the contracting of
external loans is also needed, in particular because two Ministers have signature authority for
external loans.
24.
The future relationship between Senegal and the Fund was discussed. The PSI ends
in early November. The authorities and staff expect continued close collaboration. Discussions
on a future program will take place closer to that time (Box 4).

Box 4. Key Medium-Term Policy Issues
Key issues are to accelerate growth, reduce vulnerabilities to shocks, and protect the most
vulnerable. The following reform areas will play a key role, and part of these could form
cornerstones for a next program with the Fund:


Continued PFM reforms: Significant progress has been made since late 2008, but
further public financial management reforms remain essential for more effective
expenditure planning and control.



Raising tax revenues: While already high in a regional perspective, the authorities aim
to increase tax revenues above 20 percent of GDP. Higher revenues, supported by
further strengthening tax and customs administrations, rationalizing tax expenditure,
and eventually other tax reform measures, would increase the fiscal space for priority
spending.



Expenditure composition and quality of spending: The authorities’ emphasis on the
importance of public investment, including infrastructure development, would be
supported by improved investment planning and a well-developed debt management
strategy.



Private sector development: Further reforms to support private sector development,
including in the business climate and governance, are essential for raising growth and
central to the authorities’ efforts. The energy and financial sectors will need to play a
supportive role.

V. STAFF APPRAISAL
25.
There are signs that Senegal’s economy has started to recover. Growth is projected
to reach 3½ percent in 2010, driven by a pick-up in external demand and supportive domestic
economic policies.
26.
While the risks of debt distress are low, the authorities will need to gradually
reduce the fiscal stimulus to reach a deficit target of 4 percent of GDP in the medium term
and somewhat less in the longer run, which is consistent with debt sustainability.
27.
A swift and transparent settlement of extrabudgetary spending and agency debt is
essential. Fast settlement will support the recovery and the authorities’ fiscal objectives of
raising growth-enhancing public investments and sheltering priority spending.
28.
Raising Senegal’s growth potential requires faster action on the authorities’ plans,
which specify improvements in nonprice competitiveness through a better business climate and
governance. In the energy sector, which is critical for growth, the plan, supported by the Bank
and other donors, needs to be implemented quickly to limit supply bottlenecks and fiscal risks.

24
29.
The contribution of the financial sector to growth needs to be enhanced. As the
financial sector action plan makes clear, it is essential to improve the institutional, legal, and
operational environment while at the same time guarding against vulnerabilities. The space for
greater financing by the financial sector of the government should be examined.
30.
While program implementation on the macroeconomic side has been mixed, solid
progress has been made on the structural side. The staff recommends that the waiver for the
nonobservance of the performance/assessment criterion on the fiscal balance be granted and the
fifth review of the PSI and the third and last review of the ESF arrangement be completed. The
2010 budget includes a contingency reserve, and the authorities are committed to making every
effort in the future to offset any increase in expenditure related to supplemental appropriation
decrees (décrets d’avance) by reducing nonpriority spending.
31.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place within
24 months, subject to the provisions of the decision on consultation cycles in program
countries.

APPENDIX I
LETTER OF INTENT
Dakar, Senegal
May 7, 2010
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, N.W.
Washington, DC 20431
Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
1.
The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) reviews
recent economic developments in Senegal and implementation of the government of
Senegal’s macroeconomic program under the three-year Policy Support Instrument (PSI),
which was approved by the IMF Executive Board on November 2, 2007, and the
Exogenous Shocks Facility (ESF) arrangement, approved on December 19, 2008 and
augmented and extended on June 19, 2009. The attached MEFP builds on previous
MEFPs and sets out the policies the government intends to implement, with emphasis on
measures and objectives for the remainder of 2010. The ESF arrangement will expire on
June 18, 2010 and the PSI on November 1, 2010.
2.
Most of the quantitative assessment/performance criteria for end-December 2009
and all quantitative indicative targets for end-March 2010 were met. The target for the
basic fiscal balance was exceeded by 0.8 percent of GDP, which is explained in part by
revenues that were lower than projected at the time of the last review and by increased
spending to meet urgent needs. In the future, the government will endeavor to offset
higher-than-budgeted spending by restricting nonpriority expenditures. It is requesting a
waiver for exceeding the ceiling on the basic fiscal deficit. The government is determined
to pursue sound policies and to bring the overall fiscal deficit down to 4 percent of GDP
in the medium term.
3.
Structural reforms, which are focused on fiscal management, governance, and
transparency, and the preparation of an action plan for the financial sector, have generally
progressed in line with the program despite some delays. Given the complexity of the
task, the development of procedures for the regularization of extrabudgetary
commitments has taken more time than expected. On the other hand, in the interim the
government has paid some agency debt and some extrabudgetary spending has already
been incorporated in the budget. The government will present a supplementary budget to
Parliament by May 15, 2010 that will contain specific line items to settle these payments.
Debts that do not require a budgetary allocation will be presented in an annex to the law.

35
As indicated in the attached MEFP, the authorities are continuing to pursue an ambitious
program of budgetary and financial reforms, as well as governance and energy sector
reforms.
4.
In light of overall program performance and based on the policies set forth in the
attached MEFP, the government requests completion of the fifth review under the PSI
and the third and final review under the ESF arrangement with a disbursement in the
amount of SDR 32.36 million.
5.
The government believes that the policies and measures set forth in the attached
MEFP are sufficient to achieve the objectives of the PSI-supported program during the
remaining months. It will promptly take any additional measures necessary for the
achievement of the objectives of the program. The government will consult with the
IMF—at its own initiative or whenever the Managing Director of the IMF requests such
consultation—before adopting any such measures or changes to the policies described in
the attached MEFP. The government will provide the IMF with such information as it
may request in connection with the progress made in implementing the economic and
financial policies and achieving the objectives of the program. It is expected that the sixth
and final review under the PSI will be completed by end-October, 2010, as the instrument
will expire on November 1, 2010. During the next review mission, the government
intends to examine with the IMF staff the possibility of another program.
6.
The government authorizes the IMF to publish this letter, the attached MEFP, and
the related Staff Report, which also includes the Article IV consultation report and the
Debt Sustainability Analysis.
Sincerely yours,
/s/
Abdoulaye Diop
Minister of State
Minister of Economy and Finance

ATTACHMENT I
MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES
Dakar, May 7, 2010
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This memorandum updates Senegal’s economic program under the threeyear Policy Support Instrument (PSI) for the period 2007–2010 and the Exogenous
Shocks Facility (ESF) arrangement approved in December 2008.1 The program
supported under the PSI focuses on: (i) following a prudent fiscal policy and avoiding a
recurrence of payment delays; (ii) strengthening governance and transparency;
(iii) promoting private sector activity; and (iv) enhancing the contribution of the financial
sector to the economy. This Memorandum describes recent economic developments and
program implementation, and discusses the economic outlook for the rest of 2010 and the
government's commitments regarding ongoing macroeconomic and structural reforms.
2.
The government remains committed to meeting the objectives of the program
supported by the PSI. It aims to preserve macroeconomic stability, foster good fiscal
management and governance, strengthen growth driven by the private sector, and make
rapid progress toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In
collaboration with the IMF, the government has demonstrated that it is determined to
overcome the budget execution problems encountered in 2008. Decisive improvements
were made in correcting payment delays to the private sector and implementing
ambitious reforms to improve the efficiency and transparency of fiscal management. The
settlement of extrabudgetary expenditures and public institution and agency debt still
outstanding in 2010 and 2011 should make it possible to fully normalize relations with
the private sector. This will also make it possible to broaden the focus of reform in
Senegal.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS, SHORT-TERM OUTLOOK, AND
PROGRAM PERFORMANCE
3.
Macroeconomic performance remains below trend. The global financial crisis
had a marked impact on Senegal's economy but domestic factors also played a role.


Real GDP growth was modest. In 2009, business activity remained weak. The
general activity index (excluding agriculture and government) was flat for most of
2009 (year-on-year), but there was a modest upturn in activity in the last quarter.
Estimated growth was around 1½ percent in 2009. The relatively robust
performance of the primary sector is attributable primarily to favorable climatic
conditions and a more dynamic agricultural policy. In the secondary sector,
Industries Chimiques du Sénégal (ICS) continues to recover but was faced with

____________
1

Details of this program were set out in the initial MEFP of October 3, 2007 and in the MEFPs of May 30,
2008, December 5, 2008, June 5, 2009, and December 4, 2009.

37
significantly lower export prices. Results in the tertiary sector, a traditional engine
of growth in the Senegalese economy, were poor.


The financial and operational difficulties of SENELEC (the public electricity
company) led to repeated power cuts that were detrimental to production and
investment by private sector enterprises.



Inflation measured by the consumer price index (year-on-year) has been negative
since May 2009, largely because of a decline in food and energy prices.



The external current account deficit is estimated to have improved compared to
2008, primarily as a result of the decline in oil and food prices for the year as a
whole.

4.

Most quantitative program criteria for end-December 2009 were met.

(a)
The ceiling on the basic fiscal deficit was exceeded by 0.8 percent of GDP in
2009. The basic fiscal deficit at end-December 2009 was CFAF 168 billion, while the
ceiling set in the program was CFAF 119 billion. Tax revenues from public entities were
lower than anticipated as they accumulated tax arrears. At the same time, current
spending was higher than expected in response to urgent needs. These expenditures were
based on budget appropriations authorized through supplemental appropriation decrees.
Current spending without firm spending limits in the budget, such as telephone,
electricity, and water charges, was also higher than expected. However, the government
continued to develop its investment program and capital spending reached 10½ percent of
GDP. The government will endeavor to limit recourse to supplemental appropriation
decrees and to better estimate spending that does not have firm spending limits in the
budget, and it notes that it has restricted this type of spending starting with the 2010
budget. In the future, the government will endeavor to offset budgetary expenditure
overruns by reducing nonpriority spending and will transmit all supplemental
appropriation decrees to Parliament in a timely manner. In accordance with applicable
law, the government will ratify supplemental appropriation decrees in the following
initial or supplementary budget. Given the need to support demand in a very difficult
external context and the measures that the government has taken, the government will
request a waiver for exceeding the ceiling on the fiscal deficit. According to preliminary
data, the (indicative) target for the basic fiscal balance at end- March 2010 was met.
(b)
At end-December 2009, the budgetary float had declined to a normal level of
CFAF 37 billion (⅔ percent of GDP) as compared to CFAF 175 billion (3 percent of
GDP) in October 2008. At end-March 2010, the budgetary float amounted to
CFAF 40 billion, below the (indicative) ceiling of CFAF 45 billion.
(c)

The government did not accumulate any external payment arrears.

38
(d)
In December 2009, the government successfully launched an international bond
issue in the amount of US$200 million (CFAF 87 billion) to finance the DakarDiamniadio highway, authorized under the program for up to CFAF 90 billion. The issue
was oversubscribed. The five-year bond bears a nominal interest rate of 8.75 percent and
an effective interest rate of 9.25 percent.
(e)
The government has not approved any Treasury cash advances since end-2008
and has executed budget expenditure according to the normal and simplified procedures.
As indicated above, in 2009 the government used supplemental appropriation decrees, in
accordance with the organic law of 2001 and signed by the President of the Republic and
the Prime Minister, to establish new budget appropriations for expenditures totaling
CFAF 30 billion, approximately half of which were used to finance the wages of
contractual workers in the education sector in order to avoid widespread strikes.
(f)
The government limited single-tender contracts to 6 percent of all government
procurement in the fourth quarter of 2009 and 15 percent in the first quarter of 2010
(compared to a program ceiling of 20 percent).
5.
On the whole, structural reforms continued in line with program
commitments. Most of the structural benchmarks were met:
(g)
As last year, the government followed applicable budget execution and
accounting closure rules. The cutoff date for budget commitments was November 30 and
only a few minor commitments were contracted during the early part of December. The
complementary period provided in the law, which ends the administrative phase of
budget execution (payment orders) at December 31 (structural benchmark), was
essentially respected. To the extent allowed by the available information, Treasury
suspense accounts were closed at the end of February to reduce the volume of pending
operations to the strict minimum at that time. After February 28, any operations from the
previous fiscal year affecting the government's cash flow were charged to the current
year. The data for fiscal year 2009 in the expenditure tracking system (SIGFIP) were
finalized as of April 30, 2010. To achieve greater transparency, the provisional end-ofmonth data from SIGFIP and the government financial operations table (TOFE) were
published on the website of the Ministry of Economy and Finance 10 and 45 days,
respectively, after the end of the month, beginning with the November 2009 TOFE and
the end-December 2009 SIGFIP.
(h)
The government has issued a press release summarizing the results of the audit of
extrabudgetary expenditure and public institution and agency debt, setting forth its
general strategy for settling payments in the first supplementary budget for 2010
(structural benchmark, January 31, 2010). Following the audit by the Office of the
Inspector-General of Finance (IGF), an independent external audit of extrabudgetary
expenditure completed in June 2009 identified extrabudgetary spending in the amount of

39
CFAF 37 billion and public agency and institution debt of CFAF 67 billion as of
December 31, 2008. Given the complexity of the task, more time was needed to
determine the amount to be settled and to establish the detailed terms and conditions.
(i)
The government has taken action following its study of tax expenditures, which
revealed that tax expenditures and other types of tax exemption could exceed 3 percent of
GDP. Bearing in mind the costs and benefits of specific tax expenditures, the government
has established a plan of action identifying the key measures that could be eliminated and
examining the legislative and regulatory amendments needed to eliminate them
(structural benchmark, March 2010).
(j)
The government has reviewed progress with the reform of the financial sector
since the 2004 update of the 2001 national Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP)
and the 2007 regional FSAP. The action plan for Senegal builds on existing plans and
measures, identifies the reform manager, distributes the main tasks, and provides an
indicative calendar for the reforms (structural benchmark, end-March 2010). The action
plan is wide-ranging and includes measures in the following areas: banking and insurance
sectors, microfinance institutions and other financial intermediaries, cash flow
management, legal framework, and access to financial services.
(k)
A supplementary budget will be submitted to Parliament no later than May 15
(structural benchmark). It will include the specific line items authorizing the Ministry of
Finance to settle in 2010 the extrabudgetary arrears of ministries and public institutions
and agencies and part of the public institution and agency debt identified in the July 2009
audit and not yet budgeted for. Debts not requiring a budgetary allocation will be
presented in an annex to the supplementary budget. A detailed analysis conducted by the
government has shown that in the interim some extrabudgetary expenditures have been
included in the 2009 and 2010 budgets, all required transfers have been made to the
public institutions and agencies, and these institutions now have full access to their
Treasury deposits. Nevertheless, despite this progress, public institutions still have debts
to the private sector, as well as tax and social security contribution debts, because of their
own budgetary imbalances.
III. MACROECONOMIC POLICIES FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2010 AND FOR 2011
A. Outlook
6.
Economic activity in Senegal remains weak, but signs of recovery are
appearing and the gradual upturn in the global economy should help to stimulate
domestic activity. Growth of about 3½ percent is expected in 2010, and inflation should
return to about 2 percent as oil prices recover.
7.
Uncertainties remain high. A more subdued international recovery than
anticipated could slow remittances, official development assistance, exports, and foreign

40
direct investment and have a negative impact on growth. Continued implementation of
energy sector reform is essential to minimize the risks that repeated power cuts pose for
economic activity.
B. Fiscal and Financial Policy Stance
8.
The 2010 budget aims to reconcile several objectives: provide some support
for overall demand, protect priority spending, and ensure debt sustainability. Given
the impact on revenue of a growth outlook that is slightly below forecasts at the time the
budget was prepared, high current spending, and financing constraints, the budget deficit
(including grants) will need to be reduced somewhat by restricting spending for a total
amount of CFAF 35 billion. Social spending ministeries (education and health) are not
affected by this adjustment. The overall budget deficit (including grants) would be about
4½ percent of GDP in 2010, which is slightly below the level foreseen during the last
review. The revised ceiling for the basic fiscal deficit in 2010 is CFAF 97 billion (CFAF
49 billion at end-June 2010—assessment criterion). However, in case privatization
receipts occur in 2010, spending will correspondingly be reinstated up to the level in the
initial budget for 2010. If privatization receipts occur in 2010, spending will be increased
and the ceiling on the basic fiscal deficit correspondingly raised by up to CFAF
35 billion.
9.
Given that the supplementary budget based on the macroeconomic
framework prepared with IMF staff will be submitted to Parliament no later than
May 15 (structural benchmark) along with the press release, the government
confirms that it is committed to rapidly and transparently settling all
extrabudgetary arrears and public institution and agency debt. According to the
precise assessment prepared by the authorities, extrabudgetary expenditure in the amount
of CFAF 30 billion and public institution and agency debt to the private sector in the
amount of CFAF 16 billion remain to be cleared, of which at least 50 percent will be
cleared by end-September 2010, in line with the commitment undertaken earlier to settle
at least 50 percent of extrabudgetary arrears and public institution and agency debt
identified in the July 2009 audit by end-September 2010 (structural benchmark, endSeptember 2010).
10.
The government will ask for another internal audit by the Office of the
Inspector-General of Finance to verify that no new extrabudgetary commitments or
new public institution and agency debt have been accumulated since end-2008. The
audit will assess the level of the debt at end-2009. The government will publish a new
press release at end-September 2010 that will report on the results of the audit and
summarize progress made in clearing the extrabudgetary commitments and public
institution and agency debt, to the extent that all claims have not been regularized, and
that will detail the next steps to complete this process (structural benchmark, endSeptember 2010).

41
11.
As part of the government's objectives, the composition of expenditure will
receive greater attention. Social spending will increase from 33 percent of total
spending in 2008 to almost 35 percent in 2010. The government intends to increase these
expenditures to 40 percent of GDP in the near future (the initial PRSP target for 2010
having proven to be overly ambitious). Spending on poverty reduction will be regularly
monitored. To support the ongoing development of Senegal's physical infrastructure,
which remains one of the government's key objectives, current expenditure on goods and
services and transfers will be reduced as a percentage of GDP in 2010. This will free
resources that will be used to finance a higher level of domestically financed capital
expenditure.
12.
The government bases its medium-term fiscal policy stance on debt
sustainability considerations and will continue to pursue a prudent fiscal policy. It is
committed to limiting the overall fiscal deficit to 4 percent of GDP over the medium term
and to approximately 3.5 percent of GDP in the longer term. The government's
semiannual public debt sustainability analysis will include a risk assessment for
contingent liabilities arising from guarantees issued by the government to Public-Private
Partnerships (PPPs) and operations of public enterprises.
13.
To ensure debt sustainability, the government will continue to favor
concessional financing and, in general, will not contract or guarantee any new
external borrowing on nonconcessional terms. The government will consult with IMF
staff in advance regarding any exceptions. Nonconcessional borrowing should be guided
by debt sustainability considerations and should be linked to specific economically
profitable projects for which sufficient external concessional financing or domestic and
regional financing could not be mobilized.
14.
In the future, the government hopes to continue its policy of developing
infrastructure and to benefit from the flexibility provided by the new rules on
external debt. It is working on new, large infrastructure projects, including the extension
of the Dakar-Diamniadio highway. The government will work in close collaboration with
its development partners to assess the economic profitability of these projects and
identify the necessary financing. It is planning to have an assessment ready before the
next PSI review so that concessional resources and domestic and regional financing may
be supplemented, if necessary, with other nonconcessional resources as a last resort. The
government is aware that any nonconcessional financing must be linked to economically
profitable projects (evaluated by a reliable entity such as the World Bank) and should not
jeopardize debt sustainability.

42
C. Structural Reforms
Budget reforms
15.
To build on progress already made, the government remains committed to
continuing its ambitious budget reforms. These reforms, based on an overall fiscal
reform program supported by the development partners (in particular the IMF technical
assistance report and the PEFA report), are essential to enhancing budget efficiency and
transparency, while also helping to protect macroeconomic stability.
16.
As indicated above, the government will endeavor to limit recourse to
supplemental appropriation decrees. The government will also endeavor to maintain
budgeted spending levels by offsetting expenditure overruns through equivalent
reductions in other spending and will transmit all supplemental appropriation decrees to
Parliament in a timely manner. In accordance with applicable law, the government will
ratify supplemental appropriation decrees in the following initial or supplementary
budget.
17.
The government has taken important steps to prevent the recurrence of
public institution and agency debt. It has based accountants in the public institutions
and agencies to track budget execution and regularly report to the Treasury on the
liquidity situation. To bolster agency cash flow, the government will ensure the timely
processing (no later than 90 days after the Treasury receives the check) of transfers to the
accounts of Treasury correspondents (particularly public institutions and agencies) and/or
payments to enterprises for invoices by withdrawals from the correspondents’ deposit
accounts with the Treasury. To this end, the following measures will be applied: (i) a
cash flow plan is established in advance between the Treasury and the correspondents
and this plan is updated regularly; (ii) the Treasury is notified of transfer or payment
intentions at least thirty days before the withdrawal or payment date.
18.
The government will continue to improve SIGFIP as a key budget
monitoring system and will implement the recommendations of the IMF technical
assistance missions in the area of public financial management. Following the audit
of SIGFIP and the two technical assistance missions in late 2009 that focused essentially
on the expenditure chain and budget execution, a follow-up technical assistance mission
took place in late February 2010. The government has made progress using SIGFIP and
ASTER as complementary information systems to improve the preparation, execution,
and tracking of fiscal and accounting operations and making the government financial
operations table (TOFE) more reliable. In the short term the government intends to
improve SIGFIP by incorporating payroll expenditure and implementing the SIGFIPASTER interface (structural benchmark, end-July 2010). Work on implementing the
interface in the ASTER-SIGFIP direction continues. The interface will strengthen the
linkages between fiscal and accounting operations and facilitate preparation of the

43
general account of the financial administration, thereby shortening the time required to
prepare the final budget review laws (lois de règlement). Moreover, the auxiliary
expenditure accounting module (CAD) will be operational in 2010. To press ahead with
these reforms, a high-level information systems steering committee has been established
within the Ministry of Economy and Finance.
19.
The preparation of draft budget review laws will continue. The draft budget
review law for 2008 was forwarded to the Audit Court by end-December 2009 and the
one for 2009 will be forwarded to the Audit Court by end-September 2010.
20.
To improve its cash management, the government is updating the 2006
census of all government accounts, including public institution and agency accounts,
with a view to finalizing the strategy to establish a single Treasury account. All
government accounts and public institution and agency accounts, including their bank
accounts, will be listed. For each account the list will include the number, name of the
holder, and the balances as at December 31, 2008 and 2009 (structural benchmark, July
2010). To ensure that the census is comprehensive, the government will ask ministries
and public institutions and agencies for a list of accounts and authorization for their banks
to provide the necessary information to the Treasury. The census is a significant step
toward establishing a single Treasury account, which is an essential tool for improving
the central government’s daily liquidity management. The government also intends to
strengthen liquidity tracking and forecasting at the Treasury by using all available
information and requiring the cooperation of all government entities concerned.
21.
The government will also improve its debt management. It recognizes the
importance of collecting all the necessary information and involving all units concerned.
The government intends to better coordinate the tracking of financing needs and
management of the government’s external and domestic debt, in line with the guidelines
given by the National Public Debt Committee. All data on the public debt will be
centralized whatever the origin of the loans contracted. In this way, the government
envisages establishing a global debt management strategy. These measures could also
help to improve indicators of public finance management capacity, such as the PEFA
(Public Expenditure and Fiscal Accountability) assessments and CPIA (Country Policy
and Institutional Assessments). To improve debt management, the government is also
regularly updating the rolling two-year calendar for the issuance of public securities,
either quarterly or after each issuance, in cooperation with the Central Bank of West
African States (BCEAO).
22.
The process of evaluating and selecting public investment projects will be
improved. It will be based on the Prime Minister’s circular of November 2008 and the
commitments undertaken in the initial MEFP (para. 25) and the MEFP for the first
review. New projects involving CFAF 500 million or more will be subject to a formal
economic cost-benefit/profitability analysis on which the selection process will be based.

44
The government also plans to improve the method of determining the order of priority of
projects. The government notes that the new airline that has just been created is a
majority privately owned company that will not benefit from additional funds or
guarantees from the government. Moreover, Air Sénégal International’s cessation of
operations has thus far required no financing from the government and no supplementary
financing is expected.
Tax administration
23.
Following the analysis of tax expenditures, the government prepared an
action plan designed to eliminate distortionary tax expenditures with significant
budgetary cost. For simplicity and effectiveness, the government will consolidate all
legislation relating to domestic taxation in a single document by October 15, 2010
(structural benchmark, October 15, 2010). The government has also committed to
conduct an ex ante impact evaluation prior to any adoption of new tax expenditures. This
evaluation will be designed to rigorously analyze a measure’s likely economic
consistency, efficiency, and effectiveness and to reject it if these criteria are not met.
Energy sector
24.
Progress has been made since the last review with the ten measures set out by
the government, in particular the implementation of the reform of SENELEC which
is progressing satisfactorily, and also the following measures that are in the process
of being carried out: strengthening the commercial performance of SENELEC and
the process to penalize fraudulent activities, implementing the recommendations of
the audit on accounting procedures, and implementing debt restructuring,
cancellation, and rescheduling.
The preliminary financial results of SENELEC for 2009 are below the forecasts made in
November 2009. The government intends to take the following measures in the shortterm:


Adjust tariffs, if necessary, effective April 1, complementing the measures
indicated above, to reduce the difference between tariffs and variations in
production costs or the cost of energy purchases;



Given SENELEC's tax arrears in 2009, ensure that tax payments by SENELEC
are included in calculations of the company's financial stability and take all legal
and regulatory measures to ensure that SENELEC regularly satisfies its tax and
customs obligations. SENELEC will provide a statement of its tax and customs
obligations, at a minimum on a quarterly basis, to the Minister of Finance;

45


Return the GTI power station to service while maintaining existing contractual
stipulations regarding the guarantee by the state without other financial risk for
the government;



Mobilize private bank loans in the amount of CFAF 36 billion against payment in
two tranches in 2011 and 2012 of the balance of the 2008 compensation to
SENELEC by the government for the freezing of electricity tariffs. However, the
net debt by SENELEC to the government resulting from the agreement to offset
mutual claims, as well as all new debt of SENELEC vis-à-vis the government
accumulated in 2010, will be deducted from the bank loans before the proceeds
are made available to SENELEC;



Finalize the terms and conditions for restructuring SENELEC’s short-term debt to
reduce the stock of arrears and the high cost of debt servicing; and



Undertake an assessment of the fuel supply and human resource management
functions.

25.
The government is committed to implement a detailed action plan in line
with regulations to meet the conditions of the second tranches of budget support
from the World Bank and AFD relating to the restructuring of the sector, currently
planned for 2011. In cooperation with the World Bank and AFD, the government
intends to unbundle SENELEC's activities (production, transport, and distribution) in the
medium term and to finalize its strategy for private participation.
26.
To improve tracking by the authorities, the government has transferred the
management of the amounts collected by SAR as FSIPP (Fonds de Sécurisation des
Importations en Produits Pétroliers) assessments from the Treasury to the DGID.
Despite some implementation delays, the DGID has begun collecting FSIPP payments
made by SAR clients. It deposits the payments in the account of the General Treasurer
opened at the BCEAO that is dedicated to FSIPP. On the 25th of each month, the General
Treasurer gives the BCEAO an order for a transfer to a SAR account opened at
ECOBANK to allow the bank to be reimbursed. The government is committed to include
all subsidies and transfers to SAR, including FSIPP payments collected by the DGID and
all strategic investments in the oil sector, in the first supplementary budget for 2010.
Financial sector reforms
27.
There were some cash flow difficulties in the financial sector in late 2008
linked to domestic factors as well as the global crisis. Nonperforming loans have
stabilized, but several banks still fail to meet certain prudential regulations. Against this
backdrop, the authorities are determined to make every effort to maintain stability in the
financial sector. The government action plan lists measures taken to date and identifies
priorities for the coming year. In particular, the authorities undertake to:

46
(a)
Continue to monitor the banks, including analyzing bank assets and liabilities, the
nature and concentration of financing sources, liquidity relationships with parent
countries or institutions in the same group abroad, and overall liquidity. It will also
intensify discussions with the WAEMU authorities and supervisors of foreign institutions
with a presence in Senegal;
(b)
Focus on macrofinancial risks arising from financing links between the
government, private sector, and financial system. Banks will be subject to regular stress
tests;
(c)
Step up consultations with the government and banks to anticipate financing and
cash requirements of the government and private sector;
(d)
In consultation with the central bank, closely monitor the entry into force of the
new minimum capital rules by end-2010. In this connection, a working group made up of
officials from the BCEAO and a representative of the Ministry of Finance has been
created in each WAEMU country at the initiative of the BCEAO and the Banking
Commission to review the position of credit institutions likely to encounter difficulties in
complying with the new rules and proposing targeted measures;
(e)
Further strengthen the capacity and resources of the directorate in charge of
regulation and supervision of microfinance institutions within the Ministry of Economy
and Finance.
28.
The government aims to improve the institutional, legal, and operational
environment for private sector financing to enhance household access to credit and
expand financial intermediation. The following initiatives will be taken:
(a)
implementation of an action plan to increase the rate of bank penetration to
20 percent by end-2012 through, inter alia, government promotion of noncash means of
payments;
(b)
establishment of a legal framework that supports the creation of credit
information bureaus;
(c)
finalization of legislation governing financial leasing to promote financing of
start-ups and growth of innovative small and medium-sized enterprises.
Developing the private sector and improving governance
29.
Accelerating growth requires rapid implementation of several key reforms.
The government is determined to accelerate the momentum to improve the business
environment and reach international standards. Senegal's position in the World Bank's
“Doing Business” indicators has fallen. Key areas for improvement include strengthening

47
contract enforcement, reducing delays in transferring property rights, modernizing labor
legislation, simplifying customs procedures, and improving access to finance. The
government specifically commits to achieve the following as soon as possible:
(a)
improve the efficiency of the commercial justice system by providing courts with
the resources required for the expeditious handling of economic disputes and
implementing administrative measures already identified;
(b)
reduce delays in the transfer of property rights as specified in office memoranda
issued in 2008 and adopt and effectively implement the Prime Minister’s circular
regarding reductions in the time it takes to issue construction permits and hook up water,
sewage, electricity, and telephone services;
(c)

extend possibilities for renewing fixed-term labor contracts;

(d)
implement the action plan that came out of the second national forum on credit,
which took place on March 16 and 17, 2010, according to a timetable to be agreed.
30.
The government is also introducing various measures designed to improve
governance as follows:
(a)
finalizing legislation on government property and real estate: (i) the law on real
estate ownership and its implementation decree; (ii) updating of the price schedules for
government-owned property;
(b)
strengthening of the Audit Court by providing it with the appropriate level of
resources and promoting the training of judges with the help of donors;
(c)
introducing measures to guarantee the availability of appropriate resources for the
procurement regulatory agency (ARMP); and
(d)
introducing measures to ensure that the National Commission to Enhance
Transparency and Combat Corruption and Extortion has sufficient resources to perform
its work.
IV. PROGRAM MONITORING
31.
Quantitative assessment criteria for end-June 2010 and quantitative
indicators for end-September 2010 have been set to monitor program
implementation in 2010 (see Table 1 below). The government and IMF staff also
agreed on the structural benchmarks listed in Table 2 below. The sixth review under the
PSI is expected to be completed by end-October 2010. The PSI expires on November 1.
The government is resolved to continue to work closely with the IMF. The terms and
conditions for the continuation of this collaboration will be examined during the next
mission.

ATTACHMENT II
TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
Dakar, May 7, 2010
1.
This technical memorandum of understanding (TMU) defines the quantitative
assessment (performance) criteria, indicative targets, and structural benchmarks on the basis
of which the implementation of the Fund-supported program under the Policy Support
Instrument (PSI) will be monitored in 2010. The quantitative program targets will also serve
as performance criteria under the Exogenous Shocks Facility (ESF). The TMU also
establishes the terms and time frame for transmitting the data that will enable Fund staff to
monitor program implementation
I.

PROGRAM CONDITIONALITY

2.
The quantitative assessment criteria for June 30, 2010 and the quantitative indicative
targets for September 30, 2010 are shown in Table 1. The prior actions and structural
benchmarks established under the program are presented in Table 2.
II.

DEFINITIONS, ADJUSTERS, AND DATA REPORTING
A. The Government

3.
Unless otherwise specified below, the government is defined as the central
administration of the Republic of Senegal and does not include any local administration, the
central bank, or any government-owned entity with a separate legal personality (e.g., public
universities and hospitals).
B. Basic Fiscal Balance (Program Definition)
Definition
4.
The basic fiscal balance (program definition) is the difference between the
government’s budgetary revenue and total expenditure and net lending, excluding externally
financed capital expenditure (financed by donors), drawings on on-lent loans (except on-lent
loans to the energy sector financed through donor budgetary assistance), expenditure funded
with HIPC- and MDRI-related resources, and expenditure related to the settlement of agency
debt and extrabudgetary arrears identified in the July 2009 audit and included in the first
supplementary budget for 2010. Budgetary revenue excludes privatization receipts and sales
of mobile telephone licenses or other government assets. Government expenditure is defined
on the basis of payment orders accepted by the Treasury (dépenses ordonnancées prises en

51
charge par le Trésor). This assessment/performance criterion is set as a floor on the
cumulative basic fiscal balance since the beginning of the year.
Example
5.
The floor for the basic balance (program definition) as at June 30, 2010 is –
CFAF 49 billion. It is calculated as the difference between budgetary revenue
(CFAF 614 billion) and total expenditure and net lending (CFAF 834 billion), excluding
externally financed capital expenditure (CFAF 137 billion), drawings on on-lent loans
(CFAF 5 billion), and expenditure funded with HIPC-and MDRI-related resources
(CFAF 30 billion).
Reporting requirements
6.
During the program period, the authorities will report provisional data on the basic
fiscal balance (program definition) and its components monthly to Fund staff with a lag of no
more than 30 days. Data on revenues and expenditure that are included in the calculation of
the basic fiscal balance, and on expenditure financed with HIPC- and MDRI- related
resources, will be drawn from preliminary Treasury account balances. Final data will be
provided as soon as the final balances of the Treasury accounts are available, but not later
than two months after the reporting of the provisional data.
C. Adjuster for the Basic Fiscal Balance
Definition
7.
The floor on the basic fiscal balance does not take into account any privatization
receipts. However, if privatization receipts occur in 2010, spending will be increased and the
floor on the basic fiscal balance correspondingly raised by up to CFAF 35 billion.
Example
8.
If CFAF 100 billion in privatization receipts were to become available in 2010,
spending would be carried out in line with the initial budget and would be raised by CFAF 35
billion, from CFAF 1668 billion to CFAF 1703 billion. The floor on the basic fiscal balance
would be lowered by CFAF 35 billion, from –CFAF 97 billion to –CFAF 132 billion.
D. Budgetary Float
Definition
9.
The budgetary float (instances de paiement) is defined as the outstanding stock of
government expenditure for which bills have been received and validated but not yet paid by
the Treasury (the difference between dépenses liquidées and dépenses payées). The

52
assessment/performance criterion is set as a ceiling on the budgetary float, monitored at the
end of the quarter.
Reporting requirements
10.
The authorities will transmit to Fund staff on a weekly basis (i.e., at the end of each
week), and at the end of each month, a table from the expenditure tracking system (SIGFIP)
showing all committed expenditures (dépenses engagées), all certified expenditures that have
not yet been cleared for payment (dépenses liquidées non encore ordonnancées), all payment
orders (dépenses ordonnancées), all payment orders accepted by the Treasury (dépenses
prises en charge par le Trésor), and all payments made by the Treasury (dépenses payées).
The SIGFIP table will exclude delegations for regions and embassies. The SIGFIP table will
also list any payments that do not have a cash impact on the Treasury accounts.
E. Spending Undertaken Outside Simplified and Normal Procedures
11.
This assessment/performance criterion is applied on a continuous basis to any
procedure other than the normal and simplified procedures to execute spending. It excludes
only spending undertaken on the basis of an advance decree in cases of absolute urgency and
need in the national interest, in application of Article 12 of the Organic Budget Law. Such
spending requires the signatures of the President of the Republic and Prime Minister. This
criterion has been monitored from the time of the second PSI review.
12.
The authorities will report any such procedure, together with the SIGFIP table
defined in paragraph 8, to Fund staff on a monthly basis with a maximum delay of 30 days.
F. Government External Payments Arrears
Definition
13.
External payments arrears are defined as the sum of payments owed and not paid on
the external debt contracted or guaranteed by the government. The definition of external debt
given in paragraph 13 is applicable here. The assessment (performance) criterion on external
payments arrears will be monitored on a continuous basis.
Reporting requirements
14.
The authorities will promptly report any accumulation of external payments arrears to
Fund staff.

53
G. Contracting or Guaranteeing of
New Nonconcessional External Debt by the Government
Definition
15.
This assessment/performance criterion applies not only to debt as defined in Point
No. 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt (Executive
Board Decision No. 6230-(79/140), last amended by Executive Board Decision No. 12274–
(00/85), adopted August 24, 2000, but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed by the
government for which funds have not been received.1 The criterion does not apply to:
(i)

CFAF debt contracted or guaranteed by the government with WAEMU residents;

(ii)
CFAF debt initially contracted or guaranteed by the government with WAEMU
residents subsequently acquired by nonresidents;
(iii) CFAF government or government-guaranteed debt where the agreement is between
the government and a WAEMU resident entity and there is no ensuing contractual obligation
between the government and a nonresident entity, regardless of whether the resident
WAEMU entity resells the debt to a nonresident;
(iv)
and

debt rescheduling transactions of debt existing at the time of the approval of the PSI;

(v)
external debt contracted by the airport project company (AIDB) to finance
construction of the new Dakar Airport.
16.
This criterion is measured on a cumulative basis from the time of approval of the
fourth program review and applies continuously. No adjuster will be applied to this criterion.
17.
For purposes of this assessment/performance criterion, government is understood to
include the government as defined in paragraph 3 above, as well as public institutions of an
industrial and commercial nature (EPIC), public administrative institutions (EPA), public
institutions of a scientific and technical nature, public institutions of a professional nature,
public health institutions, local administrations, public enterprises, and government-owned or
controlled independent companies (sociétés nationales) (i.e., public enterprises with financial

autonomy where the government holds at least 50 percent of the capital), and government
agencies.
18.
Any external debt of which the net present value, calculated with the reference
interest rates mentioned hereafter, is greater than 65 percent of the nominal value (grant
element of less than 35 percent) is considered nonconcessional, with the exception of IMF
lending. For debt with a maturity of more than 15 years, the average of the ten-year
commercial interest reference rates (CIRRs) published by the OECD is used to calculate the
grant element. The average of the six-month CIRRs is used for debt with shorter maturities.
For loans in foreign currencies for which the OECD does not calculate a CIRR, calculation of
the grant element should be based on the CIRR in SDRs.
Reporting requirements
19.
The government will report any new external borrowing and its terms to Fund staff as
soon as external debt is contracted or guaranteed by the government.
H. Public Sector Contracts Signed by Single Tender
Definition
20.
Public sector contracts are administrative contracts, drawn up and entered into by the
government or any entity subject to the procurement code, for the procurement of supplies,
delivery of services, or execution of work. Public sector contracts are considered “singletender” contracts when the contracting agent signs the contract with the chosen contractor
without competitive tender. The quarterly indicative target will apply to public sector
contracts examined by the Central Public Procurement Directorate (DCMP).
Reporting requirements
21.
The government will report quarterly to Fund staff, with a lag of no more than one
month from the end of the observation period, the total value of contracts signed by all
ministries and agencies and the total value of all single-tender contracts signed by these
ministries and agencies.
III.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
AND
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
SENEGAL
Joint IMF/IDA Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by the Staffs of the International Monetary Fund and the
International Development Association
Approved by Roger Nord and Thomas Dorsey (IMF)
and Sudhir Shetty and Sudarshan Gooptu (World Bank)
May 7, 2010
Senegal remains at a low risk of debt distress. Under the baseline scenario and various shock
scenarios, all the debt burden indicators remain well below their indicative policy-dependent
thresholds. External debt is vulnerable to a permanent deterioration in borrowing terms,
which highlights the need for prudent debt management especially as the authorities seek
greater access to external resources on nonconcessional terms. While the inclusion of
domestic debt does not alter the overall assessment of Senegal’s debt vulnerabilities, it raises
the debt burden indicators (under the baseline and stress tests), suggesting the need for fiscal
consolidation once the impact of the crisis subsides.
I. BACKGROUND
1.
Most of Senegal’s external debt is concessional. More than 60 percent of end-2009
external debt was owed to multilateral institutions (especially the World Bank and AfDB).
Major bilateral creditors include France, Kuwait, Spain, China and India.
2.
In December 2009, Senegal issued its first Euro Bond. The US$200 million bond
has a maturity of 5 years, and a coupon of 8.75 percent, but was priced to yield 9.25 percent.
The proceeds of the issuance will finance the Dakar-Diamniadio toll road.
3.
Domestic public debt is low. At end 2009, domestic debt reached 8 percent of GDP,
or one-fourth of total debt.1 This debt is denominated in local currency and mostly held by
WAEMU banks. In 2009, net domestic debt issuance reached almost 3 percent of GDP.

1

Domestic debt includes debt issued in the WAEMU financial market.

2
4.
Private sector exposure also appears relatively limited. Private external debt was
estimated at 20 percent of GDP at end-2009, limiting concerns about potential fiscal
contingent liabilities stemming from private debt.
II. UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS
5.
The macroeconomic framework rests on the implementation of sound
macroeconomic and structural policies (Box 1).


Growth is projected to accelerate over the next few years, as the effects of the
international economic and financial crisis dissipate and the authorities continue their
structural reforms aimed at raising growth.



Over the long run, real GDP growth is projected to exceed 5 percent. Between 1995
(after the devaluation) and 2007 (before the food, fuel and financial crisis), real GDP
growth averaged about 4½ percent. The long-run projections assume that Senegal
reduces constraints to growth through continued structural reforms, including in the
business climate, the energy and financial sectors, as well as labor markets. The
projections also assume successful implementation of its infrastructure program
(including road, port, and airport).



FDI (net) is expected to remain relatively low over the short run, in part owing to the
financial crisis. It is expected to pick up, as economic prospects improve and
uncertainty is reduced, to average about 3 percent of GDP in the long term.



The primary fiscal deficit is expected to decline over the medium term, as the impact
of the crisis subsides. Fiscal consolidation is expected to continue in order to
safeguard debt sustainability. Most of Senegal’s public financing needs are projected
to be filled through external concessional borrowing.

6.
Compared to the previous DSA, macroeconomic assumptions have been revised
to reflect more updated information regarding the impact of the crisis.2 GDP growth has
been revised down from 3.1 percent in 2009 to 1.5 percent, while long-term real GDP growth
remains unchanged. The current account deficit (excluding interest payments) in 2009 has
been revised down by about 2 percentage points, reflecting a sharper-than-expected
contraction in imports and stronger-than-expected remittances.

2

In the previous DSA, completed in June 2009 (Country Report 09/205). Senegal was classified as a low risk of
debt distress.

3
Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions for 2010–30
Real GDP growth: Real GDP growth is expected to pick up once the effect of the global
economic and financial crisis subsides. In particular, growth is expected to increase from
1.5 percent in 2009, to an average of 3.8 percent over 2010-11, 4.8 percent over 2012–15, and
over 5¼ percent over the long term.
Inflation: Inflation, as measured by the GDP deflator (in US. dollar), is expected to increase as
excess capacity is reduced. Inflation is expected to stabilize at around 2 percent.
Current account deficit (excluding interest payments): the current account deficit is expected
to deteriorate slightly over the medium term as uncertainty abates and economic prospects
improve. The current account deficit excluding interest payments is expected to stabilize at
around 8.5 percent by the end of the projection period, as the growth of exports overtakes that
of imports. Remittances are expected to grow slowly over the medium term after a strongerthan-expected performance in 2009 (despite the crisis).
Fiscal deficit: after a primary deficit of 4.4 percent of GDP in 2009, modest primary fiscal
deficits averaging 3.4 percent of GDP are expected in 2010 and 2011, reflecting a reduction in
the need for countercyclical fiscal policy. Thereafter, the primary deficit gradually declines as
public expenditure management—a reform focus under the program supported by the IMF’s
Policy Support Instrument and the Bank’s budget support operations (PFSC and PRSCs)—
continues to be improved, and further efficiency gains are being made in tax administration.
Aid flows (grants and concessional loans): access to concessional resources is expected to
decline as Senegal’s development improves. Grants are expected to decline gradually from
2.7 percent of GDP in 2010 to 2.1 percent of GDP by the end of the projection period, while
concessional loans are expected to decline from 1.9 percent of GDP to 1.7 percent of GDP over
the same period.
Public domestic borrowing: as the WAEMU debt markets become more liquid and efficient,
Senegal is expected to rely increasingly on domestic financing. Senegal’s domestic borrowing
is expected to be less than one-third of the total public financing needs and claims on the
government are expected to be largely held by commercial banks.

III. EXTERNAL DSA
7.
External PPG debt burden indicators under the baseline scenario remain well
below their policy-dependent thresholds (Figure 1, Table 1).3 Workers’ remittances
represent a reliable and large source of foreign exchange for Senegal, accounting for around
10 percent of GDP and more than 40 percent of exports over the projection period. As such,
they are explicitly considered in this DSA (Figure 2).4 The modified debt burden indicators—
3

The indicative external debt burden thresholds for Senegal are shown in Figure 1. They are based on Senegal’s
classification as a “medium” performer given its (three-year average) score of 3.67 on the World Bank’s
Country Policy and Institutional Assessment index (CPIA). The CPIA measures the quality of policies and
institutions; weak performers score below 3.25, strong performers above 3.75.

Application of the Joint Fund-Bank Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries,” SM/10/16.

4
the PV of external debt and external debt service as ratios to the sum of exports and gross
remittances, and to the sum of gross domestic product and gross remittances, respectively—
are significantly lower than the updated DSF thresholds (10 percent lower than the usual DSF
thresholds).
8.
Stress tests do not reveal serious vulnerabilities for external public debt, as the
various indicators remain below the thresholds (Figure 2, Table 2). The most common
extreme stress test is a general deterioration in the terms of external borrowing, i.e., an
increase by 2 percentage points in the interest rate on new external public borrowing. Despite
this adverse shock, the debt burden indicators remain well below their thresholds.
IV. PUBLIC DSA
9.
Indicators of overall public debt (external plus domestic debt) and debt service
follow a similar pattern as those for external public debt alone (Table 3, Figure 3). While
more elevated than under the external DSA, the public debt burden indicators do not suggest
increased concerns for debt sustainability.
10.
Public debt sustainability hinges on containing the fiscal deficit in the medium
and long term. If the fiscal balance were to remain at its 2010 level, the debt burden
indicators would appear to be on an upward trend, suggesting that the debt situation is
unsustainable, highlighting the importance of an exit strategy for fiscal stimulus.
11.
The public debt position is also vulnerable to shocks to real GDP growth. Under
a scenario with permanently lower real growth, the PV of debt-to-GDP stabilizes at close to
50 percent, which is about 10 percentage points above the baseline. This highlights the need
for the authorities to continue pursuing their goal of raising potential output growth.
V. CONCLUSION
12.
Senegal’s external debt burden is subject to a low risk of debt distress. The
sustainability of Senegal’s external PPG debt seems to be vulnerable to a permanent
deterioration in its borrowing terms. This highlights the need for prudent debt management
by Senegal, especially as it seeks to gain greater access to external resources on
nonconcessional terms. Adding domestic debt, while raising the debt burden indicators, does
not change the overall assessment of Senegal’s debt vulnerabilities, but highlights the need
for fiscal consolidation once the impact of the crisis subsides.

Includes both public and private sector external debt.
Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms .
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gros s foreign ass ets ; and valuation adjus tments . For projections als o includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
As s umes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt s tock.
His torical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years , s ubject to data availability.
Defined as grants , conces s ional loans , and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Safeguards Assessments:

The Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) is the common central bank of the
countries of the West African Economic and Monetary Union, which includes Senegal. A
safeguards assessment of the BCEAO was completed on November 4, 2005. The assessment
indicated progress has been made in strengthening the bank's safeguards framework since the
2002 assessment and identified some areas where further steps would help solidify it.
1

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms at the
completion point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in NPV terms at the
decision point. Hence the two amounts be added.
2

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point corresponding to
interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed during the interim
period.

3

The MDRI provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member countries that qualified for the assistance.
Grant assistance from the MDRI Trust and HIPC resources provide debt relief to cover the full stock of debt
owed to the Fund as of end-2004 that remains outstanding at the time the member qualifies for such debt relief.

The BCEAO now publishes a full set of audited financial statements and improvements have
been made to move financial reporting closer to International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS). Furthermore, an internal audit charter has been put in place, mechanisms for
improving risk management have been established, and follow-up on internal and external
audit recommendations has been strengthened.
The most recent safeguards assessment of the BCEAO was completed on March 1, 2010. The
2010 update assessment found that the BCEAO continues to have controls in place at the
operational level. The overall governance framework should nonetheless be strengthened by
the addition of an audit committee to ensure that the Board of Directors exercises appropriate
oversight over the control structure, including the audit mechanisms and financial statements.
The upcoming implementation (2010) of the Institutional Reform of the WAMU and the
BCEAO should help correct that situation. Efforts to implement fully the International
Financial Reporting Standards reporting framework should also be pursued.
X.

Exchange System:

Senegal is a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). The
exchange system, common to all members of the union, is free of restrictions on the making
of payments and transfers for current international transactions. The union's common
currency, the CFA franc, had been pegged to the French franc at the rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02.
Effective January 12, 1994, the CFA franc was devalued and the new parity set at CFAF 1 =
F 0.01. Effective December 31, 1998, the parity was switched to the euro at a rate of
CFAF 655.96 = €1.
The authorities confirmed that Senegal had not imposed measures that could give rise to
exchange restrictions subject to Fund jurisdiction. They will inform the Fund if any such
measure is introduced.
Aspects of the exchange system are also discussed in the February 2010 report on economic
developments and regional policy issues of the WAEMU.
XI.

Article IV Consultations:

The previous 2008 Article IV consultation was completed by the Executive Board on June
18, 2008 (Country Report No.08/209). In concluding the 2008 Article IV consultation,
Executive Directors encouraged the authorities to maintain prudent macroeconomic policies
and persevere in implementing their structural reforms to encourage private-sector led
growth. They considered that Senegal’s sluggish export performance over the last decade
was largely related to structural impediments in the economy, and encouraged the authorities
to improve the business environment to make it more conducive to private-sector led growth,
raise external competitiveness, and strengthen and diversify exports. They underlined that it
was critical to contain the fiscal deficit to preserve debt sustainability, respect the limited
financing capacity of the regional financial market, and help contribute to domestic stability
in the WAEMU. Directors urged the careful review and expeditious settlement of payment
delays, with a view to rigorously applying the existing budget framework. They welcomed
the authorities’ commitment to continue public financial management reform.

XII.

Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) and Report on the Observance
of Standards and Codes (ROSC) Participation:

A joint team of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund conducted a mission
under the FSAP program in November 2000 and January 2001. The Financial System
Stability Assessment (FSSA) was issued in August 2001 (IMF Country Report No. 01/189).
An FSAP update was undertaken in June 2004, focusing on development issues (in particular
nationwide supply of basic financial services and access of SMEs to credit), in line with the
priorities defined in the PRSP (IMF Country Report No. 05/126). A regional FSAP for the
WAEMU was undertaken in the second half of 2007.
A ROSC on the data module, based on a September 2001 mission, was published on
December 2, 2002. An FAD mission conducted a ROSC on the fiscal transparency module in
January 2005.

Anti Money Laundering / Combating the Financing of Terrorism

The onsite visit for Senegal's AML/CFT evaluation took place in July/August 2007 in the
context of ECOWAS Inter-Governmental Action Group Against Money Laundering
(GIABA). The report was adopted in early May 2008 by the GIABA Plenary held in Accra,
Ghana. The report highlighted several areas of weaknesses in the AML/CFT system,
confirmed by the score of 12 Non-Compliant and 16 Partially Compliant ratings out of the
40+9 FAF AML/CFT recommendations. GIABA’s first follow up report on the
implementation of the recommendations contained in the Mutual Evaluation (2009) mentions
that Senegal’s adoption of Uniform Law No. 2009-16 of 02 March 2009 against terrorist

8
financing enables the country to broadly comply with all the Recommendations and special
recommendations concerning the issue, including customer Due Diligence (especially as
regards politically exposed persons (PEP). It also notes that legal provisions made by Senegal
in order to prevent the abuse of new technologies, namely the adoption of Law No. 2008–11
of 25 January 2008 on cyber criminality, enable the country to adapt its criminal system and
subsequent procedures to crimes related to new information and communication
technologies. GIABA Secretariat concludes that Senegal deserves encouragement for its
endeavour to reinforce its AML/CFT scheme and recommends, at this juncture, the
maintenance of Senegal within a regular follow-up process, pending the results of measures
taken and the adoption of new measures aimed at amending the above-mentioned scheme.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Senegal – Statistical Issues Appendix
As of April 13, 2010
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance and
program monitoring. There are weaknesses in data on national accounts, production, and social
indicators. The authorities are committed to improving the quality and availability of economic,
financial and social indicators, partially relying on technical assistance from the Fund and other
international organizations and donors.
National accounts: The compilation of the national accounts generally follows the System of
National Accounts, 1993. Despite staff’s professionalism, the lack of adequate financial resources
has constrained efforts to collect and process data. Data sources are deficient in some areas,
particularly the informal sector. Owing to financial constraints, surveys of business and households
are not conducted regularly. However, efforts are being made to improve data collection procedures,
strengthen the coordination among statistical agencies, and reduce delays in data dissemination. The
Regional Technical Assistance Center for West Africa (West AFRITAC) has been assisting member
countries, including Senegal, with the improvement of their real sector statistics, in particular annual
and quarterly national accounts (QNA). Progress reported by the advisor includes: i) completion of
national accounts for 1980–2004 with 1999 as the base year; ii) dissemination of the 1980–2003
series in hard copy and on the internet; iii) production of accounts by institutional sector (first series
covers 2004 institutional sector accounts); and iv) production of national accounts in accordance
with the dissemination schedule. The authorities plan to start production of quarterly national
accounts in view of the country’s intention to subscribe to the SDDS. The recent West AFRITAC
missions have assisted with training to support compilation of the QNA and initiating their
compilation for the period 1990-2007. The West AFRITAC and the authorities agreed on a detailed
work program initially aimed at starting regular dissemination of the QNA in March 2010. A stocktaking mission is scheduled in April 2010.
Government finance statistics (GFS): GFS are compiled by the Ministry of Economy and Finance
from customs, tax, and treasury directorate sources. Data last reported to STA for electronic
redissemination and publication in the 2007 Government Finance Statistics Yearbook were for fiscal
year 2001. Higher frequency data are not provided for redissemination in IFS, but the ministry
compiles and disseminates quarterly government financial operations tables (TOFE) in their own
publications. An AFR team worked with the authorities in February 2004 to improve fiscal reporting
in the context of the last PRGF-supported program. The team focused on (i) public accounts that are
outside of the direct purview of the treasury; (ii) the treatment of correspondents’ accounts in the
TOFE; and (iii) ensuring consistency between treasury and banking system information concerning
government transactions. The proposed changes are now being implemented. They have improved
the presentation of government financial operations and are the first step toward bringing the TOFE
more in line with the extended WAEMU TOFE. Other steps will include implementing the
WAEMU fiscal directives that are being revised. A regional advisor in GFS has been conducting
technical assistance missions aimed at improving the consistency of fiscal reporting and migrating to
the methodologies of the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001. The regional advisor also
supported efforts to resume reporting of annual and higher frequency data for publication in
International Financial Statistics (IFS) and electronic dissemination of the GFS Yearbook.

11
Monetary and financial statistics: Preliminary monetary data are compiled by the national agency
of the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) and officially released (including to the IMF)
by BCEAO headquarters. The authorities are now reporting monetary data to STA on a regular
basis, with a reduction in the lag from about six months to about three to four months. There has also
been an improvement in the timeliness of reporting interest rate and main depository corporation
data (central bank, commercial banks and postal checks center). An area-wide page for the WAEMU
zone was introduced in the January 2003 issue of IFS. In 2005, the BCEAO made substantial
revisions to the estimates of banknotes in circulation in member states resulting from cross-border
banknote movement. These revisions were due to changes in the method to estimate currency in
circulation in the WAEMU countries. The revised method, based on updated sorting coefficients
(“coefficients de tri”), has been applied retroactively from December 2003. In August 2006, as part
of the authorities’ continuing efforts to implement the statistical methodology recommended in the
Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual, the BCEAO reported to STA test monetary data for June
2006 for all member countries using the Standardized Report Forms (SRF). In response to STA’s
comments, the BCEAO has provided a revised central bank report form (1SR) as well as test data on
other depository corporations (2SR) for review by STA.
External sector statistics: Balance of payments statistics are compiled by the Senegalese national
agency of the BCEAO. With STA support over the past few years, several steps have been taken to
address certain shortcomings, including: (i) implementation of the Balance of Payments Manual,
fifth edition; (ii) modification and simplification of related surveys for companies and banks;
(iii) improvement in the computerization of procedures; and (iv) significant strengthening of staff
training. Nevertheless, further steps could be taken to enhance the quality and coverage of the
balance of payments statistics. Although definitive balance of payments statistics can now be
provided with a delay of less than one year, there are significant delays in reporting the data to STA.
II. Data Standards and Quality
The country has begun the process of regional harmonization of
statistical methodologies within the framework of the WAEMU.
It participates in the General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS), and its metadata were posted on the Fund’s
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board on September 10, 2001.
In September 2006, the authorities expressed their commitment to
work toward subscription to the Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS) and have appointed a national SDDS
coordinator. The November 2008 SDDS assessment mission
evaluated dissemination practices against SDDS requirements for
coverage, periodicity and timeliness and, in cooperation with the
authorities, developed an action plan to address identified gaps.

IMF Completes Third and Final Review Under Senegal’s ESF Arrangement, Approves
US$47.7 Million Disbursement and Completes Fifth Review Under PSI
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed the third and final
review of Senegal’s performance under an economic program supported by an Exogenous
Shock Facility (ESF) arrangement. The approval enables Senegal to draw the remaining
amount equivalent to SDR 32.36 million (about US$47.7 million), bringing total
disbursements under the ESF arrangement to SDR 121.35 million (about US$178.8 million).
The Executive Board also approved waivers for the nonobservance of the performance
criteria on the basic fiscal balance and nonconcessional external debt.
The ESF arrangement for Senegal was approved on December 19, 2008 (see Press Release
No. 08/334) to help the country meet a larger balance of payments need brought about by
higher food and energy prices. On June 19, 2009, the Executive Board approved a financial
increase under the ESF arrangement by SDR 72.81 million (about US$107.3 million) to
SDR 121.35 million (about US$178.8 million) and an extension of the arrangement from 12
to 18 months to help finance the balance-of-payments impact of the global economic crisis
(See Press Release No. 09/223).
The Executive Board has also completed the fifth review under the Policy Support
Instrument (PSI) for Senegal. The three-year PSI for Senegal was approved on November 2,
2007 (see Press Release No. 07/246) to support the country's economic reform efforts. It is
aimed at consolidating macroeconomic stability, increasing the country's growth potential,
and reducing poverty. The Executive Board also approved a waiver for the nonobservance of
the assessment criterion on the basic fiscal balance.
Following the Executive Board discussion on Senegal, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:
“Following food and fuel price shocks in 2008, economic activity slowed further in 2009
because of the global economic downturn and domestic shocks, including temporary
electricity shortages. While some uncertainties about the economic outlook persist, recent

2
indicators suggest that economic growth may have bottomed out. Growth is projected to
gradually recover. Consumer price inflation, which was negative in the second half of 2009
due to international price developments and the absence of domestic demand pressures, is
expected to return to its long-run trend.
“The government is envisaging medium-term fiscal consolidation and continuing to fully
normalize relations with the private sector. While the risks of debt distress are low, the
temporary fiscal stimulus will need to be gradually reduced to reach the deficit target
consistent with debt sustainability. The government is committed to a swift and transparent
settlement of remaining extrabudgetary spending and agency debt. This should support the
economic recovery and allow more space for the government to pursue its objectives of
raising growth-enhancing public investments and sheltering priority spending.
“It will be important to continue with structural reforms to help achieve the objective of
raising growth. Further public financial management reforms are needed to make expenditure
planning and control more effective. Investment projects should be selected and prioritized
based on rigorous economic cost-benefit analysis to raise the productivity of government
spending. The energy sector reform plan needs to be fully and promptly implemented to limit
fiscal and economic risks. Sustained efforts are also required to enhance the financial sector’s
contribution to the economy.”

Statement by Laurean Rutayisire, Executive Director and
Kossi Assimaidou, Alternate Executive Director for Senegal
May 19, 2010
1.
We thank the staff for a balanced report. Since the last program review, the
authorities have continued to forcefully implement their economic program supported by the
Policy Support Instrument (PSI) and the Exogenous Shocks Facility (ESF) with a view to
making further inroads into poverty reduction through strong growth and good economic
governance. After growth performance weakened last year largely on account of a slowdown
in FDI inflows and reduced external demand, there is now scope for cautious optimism about
growth prospects in view of latest economic developments. Indeed, clear signs of economic
recovery are emerging, underpinning growth projections for 2010 which more than double
last year’s estimates.
Program Performance
2.
Since the last PSI and ESF reviews, program developments have been broadly
positive. Program implementation has been characterized on the quantitative front by the
observance of four out of five quantitative criteria set forth by the program at end-December
2009. Notably the authorities have fully discontinued the use of Treasury cash advances,
contained the budgetary float, maintained prudent management of external debt, and have
exercised limit on recourse to single-tender contracts. However, the criterion on the basic
fiscal balance was missed following a combination of lower-than-projected revenues and
higher-than-expected current expenditures which were notably aimed at addressing urgent
needs, particularly in the education sector, and entailed the use of legally permissible
supplemental appropriation decrees. Going forward, the authorities are determined to limit
recourse to such decrees and to accommodate any resulting spending increase by reducing
nonpriority expenditures. In this light, we would welcome Directors’ support of the
authorities’ request for a waiver of nonobservance of this criterion.
3.
In line with commitments made on the structural front, the authorities took steps to
comply with existing budgetary procedures, essentially ensuring timely execution and
accounting closure of the 2009 budget and systematically publishing budgetary and fiscal
tables. They also made continuous efforts to clear the remaining extrabudgetary
commitments and debt contracted by public institutions and agencies. In this connection,
settlement of part of these liabilities was already programmed in the 2009 and 2010 budgets.
Moreover, these liabilities were audited last year and a summary of the results made public.
The authorities have elaborated and submitted to the parliament a supplementary budget for
2010 that accounts for the settlement of extrabudgetary commitments as well as part of
remaining debt of public institutions and agencies.
4.
After completing a study according to which estimated tax expenditures and other tax
exemptions could amount to over 3 percent of GDP, the authorities worked forcefully on

4
developing an action plan aimed at reducing them. This plan was finalized according to
schedule and some of the proposed changes are expected to be reflected in the next budget.
Going forward, the authorities have stated their intention to ensure that any new tax
expenditures will have to go through successfully an impact assessment prior to its approval.
5.
In the financial sector, the authorities made progress in following up with FSAP
recommendations. In this regard, consolidated action plan was finalized to implement these
recommendations notably with the aim at promoting financial sector development and
intermediation, strengthening the legal and institutional framework of the sector, and
safeguarding financial stability.
Policy and Reform Agenda for 2010 and 2011
6.
Macroeconomic policy will continue to aim at laying down the basis for continued
private sector development and progress toward poverty reduction while taking care to
safeguard fiscal and debt sustainability and financial stability. In particular, this policy
orientation is mirrored on the fiscal front by the budgeted increase in social expenditure from
33 percent of total expenditures in 2008 to 35 percent in 2010. At the same time, efforts to
close the infrastructure gap will be pursued and to this end additional fiscal space is expected
to be freed, among others, by the projected decline in current expenditures by about 0.8
percent of GDP between 2009 and 2010. Overall, fiscal policy will be conducted with
prudence, taking into account potential adverse implications of domestic and external
developments for revenue performance and financing prospects. Reflecting the authorities’
attachment to fiscal prudence, program fiscal targets have been revised on the basis of more
conservative assumptions about revenue and financing. Over the medium term, the
authorities remain firmly committed to constraining the overall fiscal deficit to 4 percent of
GDP over the medium term.
7.
The authorities attach a high premium to continued improvements in public financial
management (PFM) and high value to Fund technical assistance in this area. As rightly
underscored in the staff report, the authorities’ positive reaction to Fund advice materialized
inter alia into the launch of far-reaching PFM reforms building notably on the
recommendations formulated by Fund technical assistance missions. The authorities’ PFM
reform agenda also sets forth further improvements in the budget monitoring system
(SIGFIP) notably through the inclusion of payroll data and the implementation of an
interface between SIGFIP and the Treasury accounting system (ASTER).
8.
Relations with the private sector will be further normalized, notably with the planned
clearance of at least 50 percent of the estimated remaining unsettled extrabudgetary spending
and public institutions and agencies’ debt. In parallel, an audit will be carried out to ascertain
if new extrabudgetary commitments were made or additional debt accumulated by public
institutions and agencies since end-2008. The results of this audit will be made public along
with the status of the clearance process and the prospective steps to be taken to make these
extrabudgetary expenditures and agency debt history. It is expected that the new reporting
mechanisms which are now in place in public agencies and institutions, coupled with
improved management of their cash flow transactions at the Treasury, will facilitate

4
monitoring and strengthening their liquidity situation, thereby helping them avoid
accumulation of new debt.
9.
More generally, the authorities are taking steps to improve liquidity management by
finalizing a strategy for establishing a Treasury single account. In this respect, an exhaustive
census of government accounts is being updated and the Treasury’s liquidity forecasting
capacities are intended to be upgraded.
10.
Among other main areas covered by the authorities’ ambitious reform agenda are the
reforms of the energy and financial sectors. In the energy sector, efforts that are underway
are geared towards strengthening performance and the financial and debt situation of the
electricity company, SENELEC. To this end, the authorities are working in close
collaboration with key country’s partners, including the World Bank, with a view to
disaggregating SENELEC’s activities into production, transport, and distribution of
electricity. To ensure improved tax compliance of the company, the envisaged
implementation of legal and regulatory measures will be helpful.
11.
With regard to the financial sector, the encompassing reform agenda set forth in the
government action plan will be pursued. In particular, it will entail continued, close
monitoring of banks’ soundness indicators and introduction of new minimum capital rules,
conduct of regular stress tests, and capacity building at the finance ministry’s unit in charge
of regulating and supervising microfinance institutions.
12.
The authorities’ attention was recently drawn on the fact that the grant element of a
loan equivalent to less than 0.1 percent of GDP which was contracted last September with a
regional bank was about one point of percentage short of the 35 percent required by the
program. As the loan was yet to be disbursed, they promptly contacted the lender upon being
informed of this unintentional deviation from this program requirement, requesting an
increase in the grant element of the loan to make it concessional in the program sense. Going
forward, the authorities’ intention to consult more closely with staff in similar situations will
help avoid recurrence of this kind of incident.
13.
In light of the authorities’ strong commitment to the program and sound policy
implementation, we would appreciate it if Directors would consider favorably today’s request
for completion of the fifth PSI and third ESF reviews.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation
with Senegal
On May 24, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Senegal.1
Background

Following the food and fuel price shocks in 2008, economic activity slowed further in
2009 because of the global economic downturn and domestic shocks, including
temporary electricity shortages.
Real GDP growth is estimated to have been 1½ percent in 2009. Lower external demand
and downward pressure on remittances, tourism receipts, and FDI have impacted growth.
The agricultural sector, which benefited from supportive policies and favorable weather,
helped to mitigate the impact of depressed demand at home and abroad on the secondary
sector (construction, energy) and particularly the tertiary sector (transport, tourism services).
The drop in crude oil and food prices pushed down consumer prices. Some fiscal easing
has helped to cushion the impact of the global financial crisis. The overall fiscal deficit
widened to 5.1 percent of GDP in 2009 from 3.7 percent of GDP two years earlier on
account of lower tax revenues and higher expenditure. Inflation has been negative since the

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds discussions with each
member, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

3
second half of 2009. The current account deficit declined mainly because of lower energy
and food prices.
There are signs that Senegal’s economy has started to recover. Growth is projected to
reach 3½ percent in 2010, driven by a pick-up in external demand and supportive domestic
economic policies. Risks to the outlook relate to unexpectedly subdued external demand,
financing constraints that limit the fiscal room for maneuver, and renewed problems with
electricity supply. Opportunistic changes in economic policies for political reasons could
also dampen prospects.
Senegal is pursuing its macroeconomic policies within an economic program supported by
the IMF's Policy Support Instrument (PSI), which was approved in November 2007 (see
Press Release No. 07/246). The authorities' program has four pillars: (i) containing the fiscal
deficit to underpin macroeconomic stability and safeguard debt sustainability; (ii) improving
fiscal governance and transparency so as to enhance policy credibility and sustain external
assistance; (iii) encouraging private sector activity by improving the business environment
and addressing structural impediments to economic growth and competitiveness; and
(iv) limiting financial sector vulnerabilities and raising the sector's contribution to the
economy.

Executive Board Assessment
Directors welcomed the broadly satisfactory implementation of the Senegalese authorities’
economic program supported under the PSI and the ESF. However, a difficult external
environment and domestic shocks, including in the energy sector, had slowed down the
growth momentum. Directors noted that signs of a recovery have become visible and
emphasized that prudent domestic macroeconomic policies and an accelerated
implementation of structural reforms would help to strengthen growth further and reduce
poverty.
While Senegal’s risk of debt distress is low, Directors underscored the need to gradually
withdraw the temporary fiscal stimulus and reduce the budget deficit to a level consistent
with debt sustainability. They welcomed the authorities’ plans to further strengthen revenue
collection, which is already higher than the regional average, and encouraged the authorities
to ensure that public entities pay their taxes on time. Directors stressed that spending
pressures had to be contained to preserve macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability
and meet the WAEMU convergence criteria, while safeguarding priority spending.
Directors welcomed the progress made by the authorities in eliminating payment delays to
the private sector. They supported the authorities’ commitment to finalize the full
normalization of financial relations with the private sector by settling remaining
extrabudgetary spending and public institution and agency debt through a transparent and
publicly communicated process.
Directors supported efforts to reform public financial management and emphasized the need
to maintain the reform momentum. They encouraged the authorities to improve their liquidity

3
and debt management to complement the increasing integrity of their budget framework and
expressed concern about program slippages that indicate that closer attention needs to be
paid to spending procedures and control mechanism. Directors saw room for further
strengthening the authorities’ investment planning and evaluation with a view to ensuring
high productivity of government spending.
While Senegal’s real effective exchange rate has appreciated over the past years, Directors
noted staff’s assessment that it is not significantly overvalued. They underscored the need
to overcome the weak export performance and to improve competitiveness through a more
supportive business climate and better governance that would stimulate private-sector
growth.
Directors underlined that other complementary policies need to be put in place to regain
Senegal’s growth momentum and return to previous growth trajectories. Sustained efforts
are required to enhance the financial sector’s contribution to the economy. Directors also
encouraged the authorities to implement their energy sector reform plan to limit supply
bottlenecks and fiscal risks.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
