(In collaboration with other departments)
Approved by Peter Allum and Dominique Desruelle

Executive Summary
Consultation focus: The discussions focused on adverse shocks that hit Burkina Faso in 2008-09 and the appropriate
policy response, the medium-term outlook, and program performance. Fiscal policy, debt sustainability issues, and
obstacles to sustained growth dominated the consultation agenda. The authorities’ plea for an augmentation of access
under the PRGF featured prominently in fiscal policy discussions.
Assessment: The global food, energy, and economic crises of 2008-09, and heavy flooding in September 2009
adversely affected Burkina Faso’s short-term outlook, the fiscal position, and the economic welfare of the population.
The global economic crisis hit the cotton sector particularly hard, exacerbating its financial difficulties. Two of the
three ginning companies, including the publicly owned SOFITEX need to be recapitalized. Some improvement is
envisioned for 2010, though there are risks. Social indicators have deteriorated because of the crises, and the flooding
has left many people homeless and added to the authorities’ challenges to improve infrastructure. Performance under
the program was satisfactory.
Staff recommendations: (i) An expansionary fiscal policy in 2009 is consistent with the need to support economic
recovery, and mitigate the impact of adverse shocks. Some fiscal consolidation should be possible in 2010. The
momentum of tax and expenditure management reforms must be maintained to safeguard medium-term fiscal and
debt sustainability; (ii) Restructuring the cotton sector is critical for the economy and for poverty reduction; and
(iii) Structural reforms to support diversification, productivity and competitiveness gains, and to develop the financial
sector are crucial to reduce vulnerability to exogenous shocks, and support growth. The authorities should remain
engaged with donors to mobilize budget support.
The authorities’ position: The authorities shared the staff assessment and concurred with the recommendations.
They agreed that limited administrative capacity might continue to constrain investment execution. They are
concerned about increased vulnerabilities in the cotton sector caused by the continued weak global demand for
textile, low international cotton prices, and structural problems in the sector.
PRGF arrangement: The Executive Board approved the three-year PRGF arrangement on April 23, 2007, with
access of 10 percent of quota, which was augmented by 15 percent of quota on January 9, 2008. The authorities are
requesting additional financing under the PRGF arrangement, equivalent to 55 percent of quota in a single
disbursement at the conclusion of the fifth PRGF review. Staff supports the request and recommends the completion
of the fifth review based on Burkina Faso’s good performance under the program.
Staff: The mission met with the authorities in Ouagadougou during September 17-October 2, 2009. It also met with
donors, the business community, labor union representatives, civil society organizations, and the press. The team
comprised Ms. Malangu Kabedi-Mbuyi (head), Ragnar Gudmundsson, Roland Kpodar, Charles Yartey (all AFR),
and Isabell Adenauer (Resident Representative).

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The Executive Board approved Burkina Faso’s PRGF-supported program on
April 23, 2007, in an amount of SDR 6.02 million, equivalent to 10 percent of quota. On
January 9, 2008, the Board approved an access augmentation of 15 percent of quota, to help
Burkina Faso address the impact of exogenous shocks in 2007–08. Reform and policy
implementation have been solid, despite some delays in structural reforms; and all reviews
have been completed as scheduled.
2.
The policy dialogue between Fund staff and the authorities is excellent. The
authorities have generally agreed with Fund advice and responded favorably to technical
assistance recommendations. Progress in implementing the Fund’s 2007 surveillance advice
was generally satisfactory (Box 1).
3.
Despite a difficult environment in 2009, the authorities implemented the
program consistently with the objectives. All quantitative benchmarks and performance
criteria at end-June were observed, and all structural benchmarks through September were
met except for one that was delayed to mid-October.
4.
In the attached Letter of Intent, the authorities are requesting the completion of
the fifth PRGF review, and an augmentation of access equivalent to 55 percent of quota
to cope with the impact of exogenous shocks that affected the economy in 2008–09. They are
also seeking a modification of the performance criterion on the overall deficit for December
2009.
II. BACKGROUND
5.
Economic activity slowed in 2009, mainly reflecting the impact of the global
economic downturn, particularly on the cotton sector and related activities. A sustained
output level in agriculture and the expected doubling of gold production would support
growth, forecast at 3.1 percent (Table 1, Figure 1).
6.
The increase in global food and fuel prices, the global economic and financial
crisis, and heavy flooding in September 2009 affected the population’s welfare. In
particular, the flooding left many households homeless, and made their living conditions
more precarious (Box 2). The World Bank estimated that because of the food and energy
crisis of 2008, the incidence of poverty rose from 42 percent in 2006 to over 46 percent in
2008. The impact of the global crisis on the cotton sector affected several portions of the
population whose livelihood depends on cotton production.
7.
The political and social situation is calm. The next presidential election is
scheduled for late 2010.

(PFM)

Staff Recommendations During the
2007 Article IV Consultation

Outcome

Modernize tax administration and
reform the tax regime to enhance
revenue performance.

In 2008-09, the authorities put in place
important tax administration measures that
helped contain somewhat the adverse impact of
the economic slowdown. In addition, in July
2009, they adopted a tax reform strategy
covering a VAT reform, an overhaul of
corporate taxation, and a change in tax
incentives.

Implement PFM reforms to improve
efficiency of public resources and
strengthen governance.

In 2007, the authorities completed a PFM
strategy. Progress includes computerization of
expenditure management systems; preparation
of the sectoral policies needed for MediumTerm Expenditure Frameworks in key line
ministries; completion of an action plan for the
implementation of program budgeting; and
improvement of the system for monitoring
poverty-reducing expenditure.

Cotton sector

Implement reforms of the cotton
sector to restore its viability, and
strengthen competitiveness.

Measures put in place include: the audit of the
main ginning company (SOFITEX), the setting
up of a price-smoothing fund for ginneries, and
the adoption of a producer- price setting
mechanism. The global economic crisis revealed
that these reforms needed to be strengthened.

Private sector
development

Improve the business environment to
sustain growth.

There was important progress as evidenced by
Burkina Faso’s strong performance under the
World Bank Doing Business Indicators. Key
areas include contract enforcement and business
registration.

Financial sector

Implement financial sector reforms.

The authorities completed a reform strategy
building on the FSAP recommendations, and are
currently preparing the action plan with donors
support.

External debt

Maintain a prudent borrowing policy
to safeguard long-term debt
sustainability.

Burkina Faso observes the continuous
performance criterion on non-concessional
borrowing under the PRGF-supported program.

Box 2. Impact of Flooding in Ouagadougou
On September 1, 2009, there was exceptionally heavy rainfall in the capital city of Ouagadougou that
caused flooding, casualties, and left some 180,000 people homeless. The impact on infrastructure was
significant:





Twelve bridges were damaged, and several roads were partially destroyed.
The main hospital was flooded, destroying expensive and critical bio-medical equipment.
Government buildings were damaged, office equipment was lost, and an important storage
facility for agriculture seeds was destroyed.
Some 24,000 private houses were destroyed, and about 1,360 small agricultural producers
lost their crops and reserves.

Macroeconomic impact
The impact on growth should be limited because agricultural production and the road network outside
Ouagadougou were unaffected. However, the fiscal impact is substantial because of higher
expenditure to cover the cost of temporary housing and basic necessities and the rapid restoration of
key infrastructure.
Costing and financing
The impact of the flooding is estimated at some CFAF 82 billion (2 percent of GDP). The authorities
have allocated CFAF 26 billion in the 2009 Supplementary Budget and CFAF 18 billion in the 2010
Budget to address humanitarian, relocation, and reconstruction needs. A thorough costing will be
carried out in the next few weeks, with assistance from the World Bank. The authorities hope to
mobilize financing from donors, which has been limited so far.

8.
Inflation declined in 2009 mostly because of a good harvest, and the decline in
global food and fuel prices, easing pressure on the real effective exchange rate (REER).
The average 12-month inflation rate stood at 5.3 percent in September, compared to
8.5 percent in 2008. In recent months price developments also benefited from the freeze in
fuel retail prices. Inflation is expected to slow to less than 3 percent by year-end. This would
reduce pressure on the REER, which appreciated in 2008 because Burkina Faso’s inflation
was high compared to its trading partners and the Euro appreciated against the US Dollar
(Figure 2). Although quantitative analysis indicates that the REER is broadly in line with
fundamentals, non-price factors continue to weigh on Burkina Faso’s competitiveness,
underlining the need for continued structural reforms (Box 3).

and food prices. The current account deficit widened to almost 12 percent of GDP as
imports surged and terms of trade deteriorated. Estimates for 2009 point to an improvement
supported by the decline in oil prices for the major part of the year, and a significant rise in
gold exports. The current account deficit would decline to 9 percent, which is still above the
pre-crisis level of about 8 percent. Terms of trade should improve in 2009, as gold prices
continue to be strong and cotton prices recover (Table 2).

10

Box 3. Competitiveness and Real Effective Exchange Rate Assessment
A quantitative assessment of the REER using the Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate and the
External Sustainability methodologies found the REER to be broadly in line with
fundamentals. This is consistent with the most recent assessment for WAEMU. Nonetheless,
other indicators show that non-price factors hamper competitiveness, suggesting the need for
structural reforms to support private sector development.
Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate Approach: The equilibrium REER was modeled as a
function of a set of fundamental factors: terms of trade, trade openness, government
consumption and productivity. The bound testing approach and an Autoregressive Distributed
Lag technique were used with data for 1980–2009 to estimate the equilibrium REER (EREER).
The results show that fundamentals account for most of the fluctuation of the REER. In
particular, much of the long-run behavior of the REER can be explained by fluctuations in the
terms of trade, government consumption, productivity, and openness. Based on these
fundamentals, the REER was found to be close to equilibrium, with an overvaluation in the
range of 0-4 percent.

External Sustainability Approach: This approach, which estimates the current account
balance that can stabilize net foreign assets at a given benchmark level found that the
“stabilizing” current account deficit is between 6.5 and 8.6 percent of GDP. The current
account deficit including official transfers averaged 10 percent of GDP for 2003–08, which
would indicate that the REER is not significantly misaligned.
Business Climate: Assessments of competitiveness compiled by the World Economic Forum
suggest that Burkina Faso dropped a few places from 112 in 2008 to 127 out of 134 in 2009
under the Global Competitiveness Index. Firm level surveys identify inadequate access to
finance, poor infrastructure, an unskilled workforce, and weak regulation as major constraints
to private sector development. Compared to Burkina Faso’s good performance on the Doing
Business indicators, these results underline the need for further progress to create a businessfriendly environment.

11
10.
Fiscal performance in the first half of 2009 was mixed. Revenue was below target
because tax revenue was negatively affected by the economic slowdown. Current expenditure
was slightly above target, mostly because of higher wages and transfer payments. However,
capital expenditure was lower than anticipated due to administrative delays linked to the
strengthening of public procurement procedures. The overall budget deficit (excluding
grants) stood at 3.8 percent of GDP through June 2009, compared to a full-year deficit of
5.1 percent in the program (Table 3).
11.
Money supply accelerated in the first half of the year as net foreign assets
increased. The government position in the banking system stabilized, partly reflecting the
increased use of the regional
market to finance the budget.

The financial health of the banking system remains broadly satisfactory despite
vulnerabilities linked to developments in the cotton sector. Banks are generally well
capitalized, and observance of regional prudential norms improved slightly at end-June, as
more banks complied with the liquidity ratio. The main vulnerability in the system relates to
banks’ overexposure to the cotton sector, particularly in the current global environment
marked by weaknesses in cotton prices and the appreciation of the Euro. As a result, none of
the banks complies with the portfolio structure ratio (See Text Table 1).

12
III. MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK
13.
Prospects for 2010 are promising. Agricultural and mining production is expected
to remain robust, and activity in the services sector should benefit from the anticipated
rebound in the cotton sector. Public investment would remain strong given infrastructure and
reconstruction needs. On this basis, growth is projected at 4.2 percent. Aided by increased
supply of food crops, inflation is expected to remain below 3 percent, thus complying with
the WAEMU convergence criterion. The external current account is expected to widen
somewhat to 10.5 percent of GDP as imports increase, consistent with the expected economic
recovery and higher oil prices (Table 5).
14.
The medium-term forecast is for further improvement in the macroeconomic
outlook. Growth would return to historical trends, nearing 6 percent on average, with low
inflation. Supporting factors include higher investment in infrastructure, a recovery in credit
to the private sector, an expansion in the mining sector, and favorable developments in the
cotton sector. Despite an increase in growth-related imports, the external position would
strengthen over the medium term, as the terms of trade stabilize, and cotton and gold exports
expand (Figure 3).
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
The challenge of addressing the impact of exogenous shocks, while preserving medium-term
fiscal sustainability, and fostering economic growth guided the discussions.
A. Fiscal Policy: Addressing Exogenous Shocks and Sustainability Challenges
15.
Adverse external shocks in 2008-09 had a significant impact on Burkina Faso’s
fiscal position.


The global economic crisis triggered measures to support SOFITEX and cotton
farmers to mitigate the impact of the significant decline in cotton prices, and the
increase in the import price of cotton fertilizers. In particular, SOFITEX needs to be
recapitalized by the end of 2009 to avoid bankruptcy. In addition, the authorities
decided to address the impact of the global slowdown on the economy through
accelerated payments of outstanding bills to utility companies.



To support economic activity, and taking advantage of the new SDR allocations, the
authorities decided to clear domestic payments arrears outstanding at the end of 2008.



Heavy flooding in September 2009 added to pressure on expenditure, as the
authorities had to provide emergency and humanitarian support to the displaced, and
rehabilitate key infrastructure. Emergency and humanitarian spending cover
temporary shelter and food for the homeless, the payment of a housing allowance,
and the rehabilitation of roads, bridges, health care facilities, and schools.

13


The 2009 budget had to accommodate the lagged impact of the food and energy
crisis. In this context, the authorities had to intensify social safety net programs
introduced in 2008 in support of vulnerable groups through cash transfers in two
major cities, and school lunches. They also intend to implement salary adjustments
agreed upon with labor unions after the 2008 social unrest. The agreement covered a
4 percent salary increase and the clearance of overdue payments for past promotions.

The authorities have estimated the cost of these measures at about 3½ percent of
1
GDP (Text Table 2). In response to staff’s concerns on availability of financing, they agreed
to reduce originally programmed transfers and domestically financed investment. The
authorities insisted that implementing the fiscal stimulus and emergency measures in 2009
would help Burkina Faso address pressing needs, particularly in relation with the floods, and
avoid a prolonged slowdown in economic activity.

1

The authorities decided to record expenditure linked to the flooding, the social impact of the global economic
crisis, and the recapitalization of SOFITEX in domestically financed investment, which include capital
transfers.

Fiscal policy would be expansionary in 2009 because of the shock mitigating
measures. In the 2009 supplementary budget, the overall deficit (commitment basis,
including grants), is estimated at 6.7 percent of GDP, compared to 5.1 percent in the
program. With the accelerated repayment of domestic payment arrears, the overall deficit on
cash basis (including grants), would widen to 7.3 percent of GDP, or 2 percentage points
above the program level (Text Table 3). Despite the impact of the global economic
slowdown on economic activity, revenue is estimated at 13.2 percent of GDP as
programmed, thanks to administrative measures taken by the authorities to step up controls
and enhance efficiency in revenue collecting agencies. In particular, the authorities connected
seven major border customs offices to the main server and to the import supervision
company; introduced joint inspections by the tax and customs departments; and improved
controls for transit trade (MEFP ¶ 17, 18). Total expenditure is estimated at 27 percent of

15
GDP in 2009, up from 21.7 percent in 2008, and 24.6 percent in the program. This significant
increase is due to the cost of measures against adverse shocks, and to the return to trend in
externally financed investment. The latter is forecast to reach 7 percent of GDP in 2009,
increasing by more than 3 percentage points, as some of the projects delayed in 2008 would
be completed in 2009.

Although fiscal policy will remain geared to supporting economic recovery,
consolidation is expected in 2010 as pressure from exceptional needs eases. The
authorities view the exceptional measures introduced in 2009 as temporary, and intend to
maintain the momentum of fiscal reforms to strengthen fiscal consolidation. The overall
fiscal deficit (commitments basis, including grants) is projected to decline from 6.7 percent
of GDP in 2009 to 5.4 percent in 2010. Revenue is expected to rise to 13.6 percent of GDP,

16
reflecting a gradual pick-up in economic activity, tax administration measures, and tax policy
reforms (MEFP, ¶ ¶ 21, 22). Expenditure would decline to 25.3 percent of GDP, from the
high level of 2009 that was due to exceptional needs. Priority outlays would remain high in
2010 (Table 8), while other expenditure would be at levels comparable to or slightly lower
than in 2009. Current transfers would stabilize at 4 percent of GDP. They provide for a
3 percent increase for social safety nets and an allocation of some 0.3 percent of GDP for the
organization of presidential elections planned for late 2010.
20.
Financing constraints are likely to persist in 2010, and may limit the scope for
fiscal support to economic recovery. Since revenue is projected to increase moderately, and
domestic and external financing to decline, there is a financing gap of about 1 percent of
GDP. The projected last PRGF disbursement will cover a small portion of the gap. The
authorities indicated that the financing gap would also be filled with IMF resources from a
new arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (MEFP ¶ 25), and borrowing from the
regional bond market. They also plan to mobilize financial support from other development
partners. In case of a shortfall in budgetary resources, the authorities will scale back non
priority expenditure.
21.
The medium-term fiscal strategy focuses on enhancing revenue performance,
preserving growth-enhancing investments, and protecting poverty-reducing
expenditure. The introduction of a comprehensive tax reform in 2010 (Box 4) and sustained
efforts to strengthen tax administration and combat tax evasion are expected to boost revenue
to 14.5 percent of GDP in 2011 which would help tighten the overall deficit to 3.9 percent of
GDP. Expenditure is forecast to remain at about 24.5 percent of GDP for 2011–14 (Figure 4).
Pro-poor spending will increase significantly, reflecting the authorities resolve to combat
poverty and make progress on the Millennium Development Goals, where Burkina Faso lags
behind comparator countries in several areas (Figure 5). The overall fiscal deficit
(commitments basis, including grants) would therefore decline from 5.4 percent of GDP in
2010 to 3.7 percent in 2014.
22.
Burkina Faso is at a high risk of debt distress. The debt sustainability analysis
carried out by IMF and World Bank staff in June 2009 showed that, as a medium performer,
Burkina Faso’s risk of debt distress was high because of the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio.
Other debt indicators were below their policy-dependent thresholds, and the rate of external
debt accumulation was projected to remain manageable. However, sensitivity tests revealed
that the debt outlook was vulnerable to persistent large fiscal deficits, underscoring the need
for fiscal consolidation and prudent borrowing policies over the medium term. During the
discussions, staff reemphasized the need for Burkina Faso to continue seeking grants and
highly concessional financing for infrastructure projects. Although the increase in domestic
and external financing to cope with the impact of exogenous shocks in 2009, including
additional Fund support, does not lead to a significant deterioration in debt indicators, staff
insisted that debt sustainability should continue to guide the authorities’ expenditure policy,
particularly its public investment program (See Appendix II for a DSA update).

Box 4. Fiscal Reforms for the Medium Term
The authorities intend to accelerate fiscal reforms in 2010 to strengthen revenue collection and
reduce Burkina Faso’s high reliance on external budget support, and strengthen expenditure
management.
On the revenue side, a tax strategy was finalized in 2009 with technical assistance from the
IMF and financial support from Switzerland. The strategy focuses on: (i) streamlining tax
incentives; (ii) simplifying and modernizing tax legislation; and (iii) improving the
management and yield of indirect taxes.


Streamlined tax incentives. Amendments to the investment code will limit incentives
mainly to VAT and tariff exemptions. Moreover, eligibility for benefits under the
investment code will change from CFAF 20 million and the creation of three jobs to at
least CFAF 100 million and the creation of 30 jobs. Up to 50 percent of the investment
amount will be deductible from taxable profits if it does not exceed 50 percent of taxable
profits.



Simplified and modernized legislation: The reform introduces a corporate income tax
(IS) with a reduced rate of 25 percent in lieu of the schedule system previously in force.
Besides improving the business climate, the introduction of the IS would generate
efficiency gains in resource mobilization. Simulation results using reconstructed revenue
data for a sample of corporate entities for 2006-07 show that the reform could increase
revenue by 10-13 percent.



Improving management and performance of indirect taxes: The reform proposes
broadening the application of VAT by revising the list of exemptions and exclusions from
deductibility, raising the threshold for the VAT credit refund from CFAF 250,000 to CFAF
1 million, simplifying VAT credit refunds and making them more secure, and eliminating
the VAT withholding tax.

Public financial management reforms: will focus on meeting preconditions for the setting up
of a program budgeting system, as well as measures to enhance expenditure and treasury cash
flow management (MEFP, ¶ 26). Moreover, after granting a salary increase in 2009, the
authorities have decided to get a better handle of the wage bill by enforcing the merit-based
promotion system and accelerating civil service reform in 2010. A study for a 10-year plan to
modernize the civil service is under preparation. It focuses on three areas: (i), enhancing human
capital and increasing the productivity of civil servants; (ii) controlling the growth in the size
of the wage bill, notably through an audit of the civil service that should be completed during
the first half of 2010; and (iii) establishing a Disciplinary Council by end-2009 that will be
responsible for taking sanctions against civil servants at fault and identifying ghost workers.

23.
The authorities concurred with staff on the need to reconcile the twin objectives
of accelerated growth and fiscal sustainability over the medium term. While agreeing
that the scope for reducing expenditure was limited, staff emphasized that in light of the
deteriorating debt-to-GDP ratio over the medium term, investment projects should be
selected based on a clear positive economic rate of return. This would be key to ensure that
higher indebtedness in the medium term would translate into faster growth and declining debt
ratios over the long term.
B. Fostering Economic Growth
24.
Improving the business environment is critical to support private sector activity
and boost growth. The authorities continued efforts to improve the business climate as
evidenced by Burkina Faso’s ranking as the best performer in Africa for several of the World
Bank Doing Business indicators (Text Table 4, and Figure 6). Recent reforms include the
introduction of specialized commercial chambers in the general courts, which would lower the
cost of enforcing court rulings, a reduction in the cost of property registration; and the setting up
of a one-stop shop for company registration. Despite recent progress, several factors continue to
hinder private sector development, including poor infrastructure, insufficient energy supply,
and limited access to finance. The authorities intend to address these impediments to growth
through an ambitious public investment program centered on closing the infrastructure gap,
and further structural reforms. In addition, they believe that measures taken in 2009 to
facilitate land transactions, and those introduced in the 2010 budget to reduce transactions
costs, will support private sector development (MEFP, ¶ ¶ 17, 22).

Raising public investment, particularly in infrastructure would support
productivity gains. The authorities intend to accelerate implementation of the public
investment program and plan to give priority to rebuilding road infrastructure damaged or
destroyed by recent flooding. They also agreed with staff that extending the road network to
facilitate access to markets for rural production would promote diversification while
providing income-generating opportunities. They have initiated preparatory work and studies
for the first stage of the Samendeni dam project which is expected to increase energy supply
and agriculture production (Box 5).

Box 5. The Samendeni Dam Project—Supporting Growth and Poverty Reduction
The authorities are planning to build a dam in the Samendeni region of Burkina Faso, which
they consider to have an important economic potential because it would generate the water
needed to increase agricultural production and energy supply. The authorities expect the dam to
facilitate their effort to improve food security, generate employment, and reduce poverty.
The project cost is estimated at US$362 million, spread over several implementation phases.
The first phase, the construction of the dam, would cost US$130 million, which the authorities
are seeking to cover with donor financing. At the end of 2008, they had mobilized concessional
financing from seven donors, most of them development banks. Considering Burkina Faso’s
high debt vulnerability, the authorities agreed with staff to seek only concessional financing for
the project. In the current financing framework, over 40 percent of the project would be
financed with domestic resources, which may prove challenging.
The 2010 budget provides for about US$12 million from domestic resources and
US$16 million from external loans for the implementation of the project. Although it is already
incorporated in current debt estimates, the impact of the project on Burkina Faso’s external
debt indicators will be reassessed in the context of the next joint Bank/Fund DSA that is
scheduled for the first half of 2010.

26.
Economic diversification will support growth and help Burkina Faso reduce
vulnerability to exogenous shocks. The authorities are hopeful that recent developments
and prospects in the mining sector, notably for expanding gold production will bring some
improvement. They also believe that agricultural diversification prospects will be stimulated
by the land reform recently adopted by Parliament.

23
27.
The authorities explained that the cotton sector is vital for growth and poverty
reduction. Cotton accounts for 60 percent of exports, and the sector’s contribution to growth
covers valued-added from cotton production and ginning, and from downstream activities,
and banking services. Agricultural output also benefits from cotton production as farmers use
cotton fertilizers for cereal production. An estimated 250,000 households derive their income
from cotton production, and in several rural areas, the sale of cottonseeds is the main source
of income. Against this backdrop, the authorities continue to support the sector while
implementing needed structural reforms (Box 6).
28.
Recent developments have increased vulnerabilities in the cotton sector, raising
concerns for all stakeholders. Developments in 2008–09 showed the limits of past reforms.
The sector remains vulnerable to price shocks and weather conditions; and ginning
companies’ financial situation continues to be fragile, with an unsustainable level of losses.
In addition, low productivity and the appreciation of the Euro against the US dollar are
important hindrances to the sector’s recovery. In discussing prospective reforms for the
sector (See Box 6), staff agreed with the areas of emphasis identified by the authorities, and
cautioned them about the increasing weigh of the sector on the government budget.
29.
The authorities agreed that limited access to finance is an important obstacle to
growth. They prepared a strategy to develop the financial sector, building on the
recommendations of the 2008 FSAP report. They have made progress in the preparation of
the action plan for implementation of the strategy in early 2010. The strategy aims to:
(i) enhance the stability and depth of the financial sector; (ii) boost competition among
financial institutions; (iii) promote the insurance sector; (iv) improve access to financing in
rural areas and for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises; (v) promote housing financing to
facilitate access to home ownership; and (vi) enhance the legal and judicial framework for
the financial sector (MEFP, ¶ 32).
V. FIFTH PROGRAM REVIEW, CAPACITY TO REPAY THE FUND AND PROGRAM
MONITORING
30.
Performance under the program was satisfactory (MEFP, Tables 1 and 2). All
quantitative benchmarks at end-June 2009 were met, as were all structural benchmarks
through end-September, although one with a two-week delay. In particular, the performance
criterion on the overall budget deficit was met, partly because of lower-than-programmed
capital expenditure. The indicative target on fiscal revenue was missed by a small margin
notably because of lower than anticipated corporate income tax receipts, due to the impact of
the global economic slowdown. The indicative target on poverty-reducing spending was
nearly on target, despite slower execution of domestically financed investment.

24

Box 6. Cotton Sector—Past Reforms and Challenges
In 2007, Burkina Faso’s cotton production declined by more than 40 percent because of late
rainfalls and low world prices. To revive the sector, the authorities implemented several
reforms including: (i) adoption of a market-based producer price-setting mechanism, which
sets producer prices at the beginning of each growing season based on a five-year centered
average of world prices; (ii) creation of a price-smoothing fund to support the price mechanism
for producers and compensate ginning companies when global cotton prices fall below
producer prices; (iii) recapitalization of ginning companies in view of large accumulated
losses. Government ownership of the largest ginnery (SOFITEX) rose from 35 percent to
65 percent after its recapitalization.
Adverse developments in the international cotton market in 2008-09 affected the sector
dramatically, and highlighted the need for continued reforms. Cotton prices fell by more than
20 percent between August 2008 and October 2009, and demand for cotton fiber dropped as
the global economic recession took hold.
The new producer price mechanism reassured farmers about sale prices at the beginning of the
2008/09 season, isolating them from the price decline later in the year. A further price decline
in early 2009 led to a 3 percent cut in the producer price for the current crop year. The increase
in the import price for fertilizers, and delays in payment from ginning companies with cash
flow problems also affected farmers’ incomes.
The decline in global prices and demand for cotton exacerbated financial difficulties of ginning
companies. Moreover, given uncertainties in the sector, financing costs have increased.
Resources in the price-smoothing fund will be insufficient to compensate ginneries for the
expected 2009/10 losses which are estimated at about 0.5 percent of GDP. Two ginning
companies need to be recapitalized by year-end to avoid bankruptcy.
The authorities plan to focus prospective reforms in three areas: (i) Restructure SOFITEX
through recapitalization, the implementation of the audit recommendations (MEFP, ¶ 31), and
ongoing cost cutting measures; (ii) Identify sustainable mechanisms to finance cotton inputs,
while contributing to the strengthening of cotton producers’ associations (MEFP, ¶ 30) ;
(iii) Identify a financing scheme to support a viable price-smoothing mechanism for ginning
companies (MEFP, ¶ 30).

25

31.
There was progress on structural reforms. The authorities completed a tax reform
strategy, enhanced the system for monitoring poverty-reducing expenditure, finalized a
financial sector strategy, and prepared an action plan for restructuring SOFITEX. These
measures have laid the foundation for structural reforms for the remainder of the program
period. Structural measures were also taken to enhance tax administration and transparency.
The authorities connected seven major border customs offices to the main server and to the
import supervision company; introduced joint inspections by the tax and customs
departments; and stepped up controls for transit trade. On transparency, the High
Government Supervision Authority published its first public report in May 2009, and has
been monitoring implementation of its recommendations (MEFP, ¶ ¶ 14, 15, 17).
32.
The authorities seek an augmentation of access of SDR 33.11 million (55 percent
of quota) to help cover the increased fiscal and external financing needs in 2009. The
augmentation is justified by the adverse impact of the global economic crisis and recent
flooding that have put a significant strain on the government budget. In addition, the severe
impact of the global economic slowdown on the cotton sector has brought ginning companies
near bankruptcy, forcing the government to bailout SOFITEX. It also illustrates Burkina
Faso’s prolonged balance of payments needs because cotton remains Burkina Faso’s primary
export commodity and plays a dominant role in the economy. Since Burkina Faso is a
member of a CFA Franc currency union, balance of payments support from the Fund would
help fill the fiscal financing gap by the same amount.
33.
The authorities are requesting that the additional IMF resources be made in one
disbursement at the completion of the fifth review. This is justified by the pressing nature
of the additional spending, and the need for the authorities to allow automatic stabilizers to
work in support of economic activity, while consolidating progress achieved under the
program. It also reflects the IMF ability to respond faster to shocks than other donors. In
addition, the largest share of the spending generated by the adverse shocks of 2008–09,
notably for emergency, humanitarian and social needs has to be made in 2009.2 Staff supports
this request because the spending needs are pressing, particularly in relation to the flooding.
Furthermore, despite continuing dialogue with other donors, additional budget support for
2009 will be limited.
34.
Burkina’s capacity to repay the Fund is sound. Debt service to the Fund is
projected at SDR 0.9 million at the end of 2010, equivalent to 0.1 percent of exports of goods
and services, and 0.1 percent of government revenue. The proposed augmentation of access
totaling SDR 33.11 million (55 percent of quota) would increase total PRGF access to

allowing 60 days for payments on expenditure committed by end-December.

26
80 percent of quota. This takes into account the country’s current indebtedness to the Fund
and its excellent debt servicing record (Table 6).
35.
Program monitoring will be based on quantitative and structural criteria agreed
with the authorities (MEFP, Tables 1 and 2). Quantitative financial targets for endDecember 2009 are performance criteria. The sixth PRGF review is expected to be
completed by April 15, 2010.
VI. RISKS TO THE OUTLOOK
36.
The economic outlook is subject to downside risks related to the uncertain
external environment and domestic factors.


A slow recovery in the global economy and the corollary weakness in the cotton
market could prevent the expected resumption of activity in the cotton sector, with
repercussions for the banking sector, the government budget, and economic activity.



Slow progress in restructuring the cotton sector could also strain budgetary resources
and hamper economic recovery.



Burkina Faso is highly dependent on external budget support. Failure to mobilize
enough resources to finance the budget, and particularly the investment program may
limit scope for fiscal support to economic growth.



Failure to improve revenue mobilization significantly could lead to excessive
borrowing in the regional financial market.
VII. STAFF APPRAISAL

37.
Major adverse shocks in 2008-09 affected Burkina Faso’s macroeconomic
outlook and deteriorated social indicators. The compound effects of high energy and food
prices, the global economic crisis and the heavy flooding in September have lowered growth
prospects for 2009, undermined the fiscal position and deteriorated the population’s welfare.
38.
Fiscal policy aims to address the resultant challenges, while consolidating the
fiscal position. Staff commends the authorities for acting promptly in dealing with the
impact of the flooding in Ouagadougou, and for the fiscal stimulus measures introduced in
the 2009 supplementary budget. Their efforts to enhance revenue performance in 2009
through administrative measures, under difficult circumstances, are commendable. To
consolidate the fiscal position further, the authorities need to maintain the momentum of
fiscal reforms. Staff encourages them to proceed with tax reform and the additional
efficiency gains measures planned for 2010. The authorities need to accelerate public

27
financial management reforms, and to reinforce the monitoring of pro-poor spending further.
Their initiative to advance civil service reforms bodes well with the need to maintain a
prudent wage policy.
39.
Fiscal consolidation and prudent borrowing policies are critical to improve
Burkina Faso’s medium-term debt outlook. As Burkina Faso is at a high risk of debt
distress, staff recommends that the authorities continue to seek grants and highly
concessional loans for their financing needs, particularly for infrastructure projects.
40.
Addressing impediments to growth and reducing the economy’s vulnerability
to shocks has become more pressing. Financial sector reforms will play an important role
in this regard by supporting private sector development and diversification. Staff encourages
the authorities to proceed with the implementation of the financial sector strategy in early
2010 as planned. Similarly, cotton sector reforms should remain a priority. With support
from the World Bank and other donors, the authorities should continue to seek ways to
protect farmers’ income, restructure SOFITEX, and identify sustainable mechanisms for
financing the price-smoothing fund.
41.
Quantitative assessments indicate that the real effective exchange rate is
broadly in line with fundamentals. However, non-price factors continue to hamper
competitiveness. Staff encourages the authorities to proceed with structural reforms needed
to promote productivity and competitiveness gains, and foster private sector development.
42.
Staff recommends completion of the fifth review of the PRGF arrangement.
Despite a difficult environment in 2009, program performance was satisfactory, and the
authorities have made commitments on the reform agenda through the end of the program in
tax policy, public financial management, and the cotton and financial sectors.
43.
Staff supports the authorities’ requests for an augmentation of PRGF access
with a single disbursement at the completion of the fifth review. Higher Fund resources
will help Burkina Faso finance additional expenditure generated by the adverse shocks of
2008–09, and support economic recovery. Making the additional resources available in one
disbursement at the completion of the fifth review is justified because the largest share of the
spending, notably for emergency, humanitarian and social needs has to be made in 2009.
44.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Burkina Faso takes
place in line with the July 15, 2002 decision on consultation cycles.

APPENDIX I – LETTER OF INTENT
Ouagadougou, November 24, 2009
Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director,
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street NW
WASHINGTON, DC 20431 (USA)
Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
1.
The fourth review of our economic and financial program, supported by the Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF), was approved by the IMF Executive Board on June
22, 2009.
2.
The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) reviews
recent economic developments and progress made in the implementation of our program
through end-June 2009. It also sets out the policies the government intends to pursue during
the remainder of 2009 and in 2010.
3.
In 2008-09, the Burkinabè economy suffered three major shocks: the energy and food
crisis, the international financial and economic crisis, and a natural disaster in the form of
torrential rains, which caused severe floods on September 1, 2009. These three shocks had an
important impact on the external sector and on the fiscal position, and they affected the
welfare of the population. They resulted in: (i) a decline in cotton prices, Burkina Faso’s
primary export commodity; (ii) the increase in the oil bill and the cost of cotton fertilizers;
(iii) the slowdown in economic growth; (iv) the decrease in certain categories of budget
revenues; (v) the destruction of road and administrative infrastructure; (vi) a humanitarian
crisis involving 180,000 people that the government had to cater, with the support of donors,
humanitarian agencies, and the collective efforts of the population; and (vii) the destruction
of critical biomedical equipment and health infrastructure. Based on initial estimates, the
impact of the flooding amounts to about 2 percent of GDP. This challenging environment has
put an important strain on the budget framework for 2009 and 2010.
4.
In spite of the difficult economic environment, the government continued its reform
and fiscal consolidation efforts. All quantitative objectives under the program for end-June
were met. However, the indicative target for revenue could not be achieved because of the
impact of exogenous shocks on economic activity. Some delays in expenditure execution
also hampered the attainment of the indicative target for social spending. Structural
benchmarks for end-September were observed, except for one that was met in mid-October.

39
5.
Steady progress was made to enhance revenue performance. With respect to tax
reform, detailed proposals were adopted by the Council of Ministers and forwarded to the
National Assembly at end-October. They cover the introduction of the corporate tax, the
rationalization of the investment code, and the strengthening of the VAT system. These
proposals were prepared based on the guidelines for the comprehensive tax policy reform
strategy, WAEMU directives, and IMF recommendations. They also reflect the findings of
the tax policy simulations.
6.
Despite the challenging environment, the government remains committed to
achieving further fiscal consolidation, with the aim of safeguarding fiscal sustainability in the
medium term, while strengthening the outlook for growth. In this context, as indicated in the
attached MEFP, for 2010, the government intends to implement major tax reforms,
strengthen the expenditure management, and pursue other structural reforms initiated in 2009
in the cotton and financial sectors.
7.
In light of its overall performance and based on the policies set forth in the attached
memorandum, the government requests the completion of the fifth review of the PRGFsupported program and the sixth disbursement, for SDR 1.004 million.
8.
However, given the increase in budget financing needs in the aftermath of the
exogenous shocks referred to above, the government—while exploring the possibilities for
raising additional resources from Burkina Faso’s other development partners—is seeking
additional resources from the IMF through an augmentation of access under the PRGF for
SDR 33.11 million (55 percent of quota) to be made available in one disbursement at the
completion of the fifth review; and the modification of the performance criterion on the
overall fiscal deficit for the sixth review.
9.
The government believes that the measures set forth in the attached MEFP will allow
it to achieve the objectives of its program in a challenging economic environment,
characterized by repercussions from the global economic and financial crisis compounded by
the humanitarian and reconstruction challenges created by the September 1, 2009 the natural
disaster. The government remains determined to take any other appropriate measures that
may prove necessary to achieve the program objectives. Burkina Faso would then consult
with the Fund before revising any of the policies contained in the attached MEFP, in
accordance with the Fund’s policy on such consultation.
10.
It is expected that the sixth review of the PRGF-supported program will be completed
by April 15, 2010.
11.
The government wishes to substitute the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) for the
existing PRGF once the amendments to the PRGF-ESF Trust that create the ECF have been
approved. A new three-year program under the ECF will serve to support the government’s

40
development efforts whose general principles, currently being reviewed, will be defined in a
strategy for faster growth and sustainable development (Stratégie de croissance accélérée et
de développement durable—SCADD), currently under preparation.
12.
The government plans to make available to the public the content of this Letter of
Intent and its attachments, i.e., the MEFP and the Technical Memorandum of Understanding,
as well as the IMF staff report and annexes for information. Therefore, the government
authorizes the IMF to publish these documents on the IMF website once the Executive Board
completes its review.
Sincerely yours,
/s/
Lucien Marie Noël BEMBAMBA
Minister of Economy and Finance
Officier de l’Ordre National

APPENDIX I―ATTACHMENT 1
MEMORANDUM ON ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES FOR 2009/10
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The economic recovery that began in 2008, slowed down in 2009, mostly because
of the global economic and financial crisis. Economic growth reached 5.2 percent in 2008,
after a slowdown in 2006-07, thanks to an expansion of agricultural production and an
increase in investment in the mining sector. In 2009, economic growth is expected to decline
to 3.1 percent, primarily reflecting the impact of the international financial crisis on the
economy, particularly in the cotton and service sectors.
2.
The agriculture sector performed well in 2008-09. Food production increased by
41 percent, while cottonseed production amounted to 447,100 tons, up by 26 percent.
However, the collapse in international cotton prices led to a cumulative loss of CFAF 12.2
billion for the three cotton ginning companies. The 2009/10 crop year is taking place in a
difficult economic environment marked on the one hand by difficulties for ginning
companies to get sales contracts because of low demand for textile, which has caused delays
in shipping out ginned cotton; and on the other hand by the late arrival of rains.
3.
The mining sector expanded considerably in 2008-09. Three new mines became
operational, while older ones increased their output. Therefore, overall gold production is
expected to double, from 5.6 tons in 2008 to 11 tons in 2009.
4.
Inflationary pressures have eased, helping to stabilize the real effective exchange
rate. The slowdown in international food prices, coupled with a tax suspension on some
basic consumption items and measures to boost agricultural production, have helped to bring
down domestic prices. The inflation rate moved from 8½ percent in 2008 to 5.3 percent in
August 2009. As a result, the inflation gap between Burkina Faso and its trading partners
narrowed, mitigating the earlier appreciation of the real effective exchange rate.
5.
Burkina Faso suffered another major exogenous shock in 2009. Torrential rains
fell on several towns, with loss of human life and destroying or damaging roads, dams,
government buildings, hospitals and health centers, and displacing some 180,000 individuals.
Preliminary estimates put the cost of this natural disaster at around CFAF 82 billion.
6.
The overall net external position, which had weakened in 2008, recovered in
2009, in spite of adverse developments in international markets. The decline in the price
of cotton, combined with the surge in food and oil prices, led to a major deterioration in the
trade balance, which moved from a deficit of 8.8 percent of GDP in 2007 to a deficit of
11 percent in 2008. In 2009, this deficit is expected to narrow to 9.1 percent, thanks to higher
gold production. The current and financial accounts also recorded a downturn reflecting an
increase in the cost of services, and a reduction in direct investment. The current account

42
deficit (including transfers) increased from 8.3 percent of GDP in 2007 to approximately 12
percent of GDP in 2008, and is forecast to narrow to 9.1 percent of GDP in 2009.
Accordingly, the overall balance moved from a surplus of 5.8 percent of GDP in 2007 to a
deficit of 1 percent in 2008, and is expected to approach equilibrium in 2009. As a result,
international reserves moved from 6.8 months of imports in 2007 to 5.4 months of imports in
2008, and would improve in 2009.
7.
Fiscal consolidation efforts have continued, despite the difficult context. The
measures implemented in 2008 and 2009 to strengthen revenue collection had mixed results,
partly on account of the adverse effects of the global economic and financial crisis on certain
tax categories. Accordingly, revenue stabilized at about 13.3 percent of GDP in 2008-09,
compared with 13.6 percent of GDP in 2007. Expenditure declined to 21.7 percent of GDP in
2008, compared to 25.8 percent of GDP in 2007, primarily reflecting the low execution rate
of externally-funded investment.
8.
In 2009, expenditure is programmed to increase significantly, reaching
27.0 percent of GDP. This increase reflects government’s measures to mitigate the impact of
the global financial crisis, in particular on the cotton sector, as well as the impact of the
September 1, 2009 floods. In its supplementary 2009 budget, the government decided to
increase expenditure in several categories in order to: (i) ease the adverse effects of the
financial crisis on the domestic economy; (ii) support the cotton sector through: higher
subsidies for agricultural inputs to mitigate the impact of higher import prices on producers’
income and protect production, assistance to cotton producer associations to enable them to
clear their cross-arrears, and recapitalization of the main ginning company, SOFITEX in an
amount of CFAF 18.5 billion; (iii) stimulate economic activity through a more rapid
reduction in audited domestic arrears; (iv) provide emergency assistance to those affected by
the floods; and (v) finance the rebuilding of roads, government buildings, and health facilities
destroyed or seriously damaged by the floods.
9.
The overall budget deficit (payment order basis, excluding grants) is expected to
reach 14.4 percent of GDP in 2009, compared with 8 percent of GDP in 2008. These
estimates form the basis of the supplementary budget for 2009, which the government
submitted to Parliament at end-September.
10.
A new bond issue by the Public Treasury, and the use of the new SDR allocation
provided additional financing. In 2009, two bond issues raised CFAF 80.7 billion, with
maturities of 5-7 years, and an interest rate of 6.5 percent. Furthermore, reflecting a decision
of the WAEMU Council of Ministers, the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO)
lent CFAF 38.8 billion to Burkina Faso, corresponding to the new SDR allocation granted by
the IMF. In accordance with regional arrangements, these resources will help expedite
repayment of the audited stock of domestic payments arrears, amounting to CFAF 22.9
billion.

43
11.
In 2009, trends in the monetary sector were characterized by an increase in
money supply in line with the increase in net foreign assets. Credit to the economy
decelerated mainly because of lower economic activity. With stronger reliance upon the
regional financial market, net credit to the government remained virtually unchanged in
2009. Although the financial position of banks remains sound overall, the slowdown in
economic activity and the difficulties experienced by some economic operators have resulted
in an increase in non-performing loans.
II. PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION
12.
The quantitative performance criteria for end-June, as well as the structural
benchmarks for end-September were observed. In the fiscal area, the budget deficit
ceiling (commitments basis and including grants) was respected, thanks to rigorous
expenditure management, which helped offset revenue losses and a shortfall in program
grants. Indeed, the floor for revenues could not be adhered to, because of the repercussions of
the economic and financial crisis on the tax base, as well as the impact of a number of tax
measures in 2008-09, in particular the decrease in the rate of the industrial and commercial
profits tax (BIC), the elimination of withholding taxes and levies at source on large
enterprises, and the authorization granted to banks and financial institutions to deduct
provisions from the taxable base. The other quantitative targets were met, except for povertyreducing expenditure, which was slightly lower than the target. Moreover, the structural
benchmarks regarding the tax reform, tracking poverty-reducing expenditures, and cotton
sector reform were observed (Tables 1 and 2), though the latter with a small delay.
13.
Significant progress has been made with the implementation of other fiscal
reforms. With respect to tax administration, the management of taxpayer files has improved,
and the rollout of the computerized tax management system (SINTAX) at the tax divisions of
the Regional Directorate of the Center was achieved. At the Large Taxpayer Office (LTO),
the measures taken regarding (i) the issuance of the list of late filers and nonfilers in the case
of the VAT, the BIC, and IUTS, and (ii) the sending of reminder letters for these various
taxes, meant that the weighted average overall nonfiler rate at end-June 2009 stood at
4.75 percent (4 percent for the VAT and the IUTS, 5 percent and 6 percent respectively for
the BIC PM and the BIC PP), against a target of 7 percent. With the aim of revamping the
database of the LTO and the Medium Taxpayer Office (MTO), the government adopted
legislation to deactivate non-active taxpayers.
14.
Several measures to strengthen customs administration will enhance its
efficiency. The connection of seven major border customs offices to the single server at the
General Directorate of Customs is in place, as is the interconnection with the import
supervision company. This will facilitate the cross-checking of data and thus enhance
controls. The objective of assigning at least 40 percent of all customs declarations to the
green and blue channels through the use of the ASYCUDA selectivity module was
overachieved, with actual performance being 42.5 percent. Moreover, efforts to improve

44
customs controls are continuing through the introduction of joint customs/tax inspections,
and through enhanced controls of final destinations of duty-free merchandise.
15.
Enhancing fiscal transparency remains a major policy objective of the
government. Accordingly, the government has engaged in outreach efforts on the 2009
budget, encompassing the media, civil society, and the country’s 13 regions. Similarly, the
High Authority for State Oversight (Autorité Supérieure de Contrôle de l’Etat—ASCE)
published its first report in May 2009, and conducted a wide-ranging campaign of education
and outreach on corruption. After the adoption of the new procurement regulations in 2008,
steps aimed at strengthening their implementation were undertaken in 2009, including their
dissemination and the provision of training for various stakeholders. In addition, the
regulatory framework was supplemented by the provision of the General Administrative
Clauses (Cahiers des Clauses Administratives Générales—CCAG) and sets of standardized
files pursuant to decrees and circulars issued in July 2009.
16.
The second midterm budget review was carried out in May 2009. This exercise
focused on the execution of the 2009 budget. It identified adjustment measures in response to
(i) the international economic crisis, (ii) the revenue collection outturn, (iii) expenditure
execution, and (iv) new financing needs. As a result, appropriations were re-affected to
priority spending.
17.
The government has continued its efforts to promote the private sector. To
facilitate transfer of ownership, the government set up one-stop shops for land transactions
(Guichets Uniques du Foncier—GUF) in Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso. These were
launched in May and September 2009, respectively. To make the GUF operational, manuals
were prepared and training exercises for revenue collectors and external stakeholders
organized. The implementation of the Real Estate File Information System (système
d’information du dossier du foncier—SIDOFO) is expected to help expedite the processing
of applications submitted to the GUF.
18.
The government’s economic and financial policies seek to promote growth and
alleviate poverty. They are aligned with the strategic priorities as laid out in the Poverty
Reduction and Strategy Paper (PRSP), namely: (i) to accelerate equitable growth; (ii) to
increase the poor’s access to basic social services and social protection; (iii) to strengthen
income generation activities; and (iv) to promote good governance. Moreover, the
government’s program with the IMF included measures to increase poverty-reducing
expenditure, and significantly improve the monitoring of such expenditure. The government
also took measures to cushion the impact of the food and oil price shocks on the poor, such
as subsidies to stimulate food production and establishing a cash transfer system for the
urban poor. As a result of the program, growth–promoting structural reforms were
implemented and macroeconomic stability was maintained, allowing for the creation of fiscal
space for poverty-reducing expenditure, which increased from an average of 22 percent of

45
total expenditure and 5 percent of GDP between 2001 and 2006, to an average of 24 percent
of total expenditure and 5.9 percent of GDP between 2007 and 2009.
III. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES FOR 2010 AND MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK
A. Macroeconomic Framework
19.
The government will pursue its efforts to support economic growth and to ease
the impact of the 2008-09 crises and the floods. In an economic environment that will
remain challenging in the aftermath of the successive crises that occurred in 2008-09, the
government will continue its efforts to achieve fiscal consolidation, strengthen its social
policies, and press ahead with the reforms necessary to enhance growth prospects while
reducing poverty. Against this background, economic growth is projected at 4.2 percent in
2010, with inflation kept within limits compatible with WAEMU convergence criteria.
20.
The government is mindful of several obstacles that could slow down mediumterm growth. The government intends to enhance the effectiveness of its development
policies through the new Strategy for Faster Growth and Sustainable Development (Stratégie
de Croissance Accélérée et de Développement Durable—SCADD) under preparation. In this
context, the government is determined to promote the diversification of the productive base
to reduce dependency on cotton and vulnerability to exogenous shocks. Meanwhile, the
government intends to improve the business climate further and to increase investment in
infrastructure to support productivity gains in the private sector. Cotton sector reforms and
the implementation of the financial sector strategy scheduled for 2010 are also expected to
enhance growth prospects. In addition, the strong expansion anticipated in the mining sector
would help speed up economic growth.
B. Fiscal Policy
21.
Fiscal policy will primarily support economic recovery, while safeguarding
medium-term fiscal and debt sustainability. Accordingly, reform measures to strengthen
revenue and expenditure management will be continued and intensified. The fiscal stance
will provide budgetary room for reconstructing infrastructure and delivering social assistance
to those affected by the recent flooding, as well as to other vulnerable groups. However, the
government will also take measures to avoid any slippages that could undermine continued
fiscal consolidation. Consequently, budget revenue and expenditure are forecast to attain 13.6
percent of GDP and 25.3 percent of GDP respectively in 2010. Thus, the budget deficit
(commitments basis and excluding grants) will reach 11.7 percent of GDP.
22.
Revenue is expected to increase slightly in 2010, amounting to CFAF 556 billion,
equivalent to 13.6 percent of GDP. They will benefit from the anticipated recovery of
economic activity and mining receipts boosted by the higher gold production, and from
administrative and tax reform measures introduced in 2009, particularly the agency-byagency contracts with quantitative targets that has produced encouraging results since it was

46
introduced in early 2009. Revenue performance should further be enhanced by the tax reform
strategy submitted to the National Assembly in October 2009, which encompasses the
following main areas: improvement in the management and yield of indirect taxation, in
particular the VAT; the creation of a corporate tax through the merger of the various
schedules of taxes on the income of legal entities; and the streamlining of tax incentives
granted under the various investment promotion codes. With respect to VAT reform, the
proposals focus inter alia on eliminating the 20 percent withholding tax by way of advance
payment (acompte), reviewing the refund mechanism through enhancing the transparency of
procedures and expediting the pertinent operations, broadening the scope of the VAT to
encompass goods previously exempt and extending the exclusion of the deduction
entitlement to encompass particular goods, abolishing the principle of outright exemptions
previously granted to NGOs, and raising from CFAF 50 to 100 million the thresholds for the
simplified tax regimes (régimes simplifiés d’imposition (RSI)) for purchases/resales and from
CFAF 25 to 50 million for other activities. However, those enterprises covered by the RSI
system—whose yield is in the range of 4 to 5 billion per year (a comparatively substantial
sum)—and which according to the analysis do not transfer deduction entitlements to
enterprises covered by the standard taxation regime (réel normal d’imposition (RNI)), shall
continue to be subject to the VAT. It is expected that these reform measures, coupled with
more rapid economic growth, will help to bring revenue to a level of 15.7 percent of GDP by
2014.
23.
The draft 2010 budget makes provisions for new tax measures, and was
submitted to the National Assembly. These include a specific tax of 2 percent on access to
or use of telecommunications networks. There are also plans to introduce tollbooths on paved
roads to facilitate the collection of fees from users. Furthermore, in regard to improving the
business climate, the draft budget for FY 2010 has made provision for lowering the
registration duty on commercial leases from 10 to 5 percent; for reforming the rules
governing mortgages by making the deletion process (radiation) non-mandatory; and for
paying a fixed duty in lieu of the proportional duty in the case of deletion and mortgage
renewal.
24.
The pricing mechanism for petroleum products will be reviewed in 2010. The
authorities have entrusted its management to an ad-hoc committee, independent of the
national petroleum company (SONABHY). This committee will propose a reform agenda,
with the aim of enhancing the transparency of the current system, and for taking account of
the pricing formulae in neighboring countries. The automatic pass-through mechanism for
pump prices of petroleum products was suspended in 2008, in response to the upsurge in
international oil prices, which adversely affected SONABHY’s cash flow and tax collection
on petroleum products. However, since pump prices have not been revised in the same
magnitude as the recent decline in international oil prices, SONABHY should be in a
position to recoup the losses before end-December 2009.

47
25.
Total expenditure and net lending will total CFAF 1,036 billion, equivalent to
25.3 percent of GDP in 2010. Efforts to control expenditure will remain a major objective of
the government. In particular, its wage policy will remain cautious in the context of the
implementation of the merit-based system. The wage bill for 2010 will reflect the impact of
the 4 percent pay increase and the catching up on payments for promotions granted in 2006
that were granted in 2009, recruitments in priority sectors, and the return to the merit-based
system for promotions. In addition, the authorities have laid the ground for the
implementation of the General Reform of the Civil Service (Réforme Globale de
l’Administration Publique—RGAP). They also intend to prepare a plan to modernize the civil
service and improve the payroll management system to ensure proper control over the wage
bill, which currently amounts to over 40 percent of budget revenue. Efforts to support the
population affected by the 2009 floods will continue, in the context of an overall increase in
priority expenditures. Current expenditure and domestically financed capital expenditure will
remain high, compared with pre-crisis levels, totaling 18.7 percent of GDP, down from 20.2
percent of GDP in 2009. This level also reflects expenditure in the education sector related to
the Fast-Track Initiative, as well as investment in the water and sanitation sector, which will
be financed through sectoral budgetary support from the government’s technical and
financial partners. Overall, capital expenditure would reach 12.4 percent of GDP in 2010,
compared to a projection of 13.7 percent of GDP for 2009, and approximately 8.9 percent of
GDP in 2008.
26.
In 2010, the overall budget deficit (commitments basis, excluding grants) is
projected at 11.7 percent of GDP. It will be financed by budgetary assistance from Burkina
Faso’s development partners, working together within the General Framework of Budgetary
Support for Implementation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper in Burkina Faso
(CGAB/CSLP), and disbursements anticipated in the context of the IMF-supported program.
The government also plans to carry out a bond issue on the regional financial market.
27.
Efforts to strengthen expenditure management and the tracking of povertyreducing expenditure will continue. Accordingly, the government will seek to reduce the
lag between payment verification and actual payment from the current 72 days to 62 days—
the goal as defined in the PFM framework for 2010. In this context, measures to streamline
the review and verification of supporting documents will allow for less red tape and speed up
overall expenditure execution. Since emergency outlays related to the 2009 floods will be
phased out, expenditure in 2010 will follow the normal expenditure commitment and
payment procedures, with emergency or treasury prepaid expenditure being regularized in
full at the end of the 2009 budget cycle. The tracking of poverty-reducing spending will be
fine-tuned in 2010 thanks to the new tracking system introduced in September 2009, and a
quarterly report will be prepared. The first such report, covering poverty-reducing
expenditure execution through end-December 2009, will be produced by end-March 2010
(structural benchmark).

48
C. Balance of Payments and External Debt
28.
The external current account deficit (excluding official transfers) is expected to
reach 14.9 percent in 2010, compared to 13.8 percent projected for 2009. This
deterioration reflects mostly (i) moderate increase in exports because cotton prices are
expected to remain stable; (ii) an increase in imports because of the expected increase in oil
prices, the anticipated economic recovery, and increased investment, particularly in
infrastructure. With the forecast level of project loans and grants, and the expected
improvement in the financial account, the overall balance of payments should move into a
surplus in 2011, allowing Burkina Faso to contribute to the regional reserve pool. In the
medium term, the outlook for cotton prices is expected to improve, and exports of gold and
other minerals should increase further. The external current account deficit (excluding
official transfers) is expected to narrow to 10.3 percent of GDP by 2014.
29.
The government is committed to continue with its prudent borrowing policy, to
safeguard external debt sustainability. Furthermore, the government intends to remain
selective regarding its investment projects, focusing on their impact on economic growth and
on needed improvement to the quality of basic services, particularly for the most vulnerable
segments of the population. Accordingly, the government has ultimately decided not to
contract a loan, which had been under discussion with the Islamic Development Bank to
finance the Samendeni dam project. Rather, the government intends to finance a part of this
strategically important project by tapping into its own resources, while trying to identify
additional concessional loans.
D. Structural Policies
Management of government expenditure
30.
The pace of public finance reform will accelerate in 2010. A key focus of this
reform will be to pave the way for program budgeting. Crucial measures in this regard
include: (i) strengthening the medium-term budget framework and the sectoral medium-term
expenditure frameworks; (ii) improving the expenditure execution process, particularly by
ensuring capacity-building for the entities responsible for monitoring and auditing the
budget; (iii) strengthening the capacity to mobilize resources and manage liquidity; and
(iv) enhancing the transparency and reliability of budgetary and financial data. In order to
overcome any delays in implementing these budgetary reforms, the authorities intend to give
priority to the above-described measures during 2010. They will attach particular importance
to preparing the medium-term expenditure frameworks at the six ministries initially
considered, in line with the timetable agreed upon with the IMF technical assistance mission.
Reform of the cotton sector
31.
Ensuring the viability of the cotton sector will remain a major policy goal for the
authorities. In 2010, the reform agenda covers the restructuring of the cotton parastatal

49
SOFITEX, the reorganization of producer associations to prevent the resurgence of crossarrears which creates cash flow problems between these associations, and measures to ensure
the financing of inputs for producers, in particular through the setting up an input Fund, and a
mechanism designed to provide adequate financing for the Price-Smoothing Fund (fonds de
lissage).
32.
The restructuring of SOFITEX will be based on the action plan adopted by the
SOFITEX board of directors on October 16, 2009. This plan includes the following
measures: (i) disseminating information on genetically modified cotton seeds throughout the
SOFITEX zone; (ii) strengthening supervisory structures; (iii) reviewing the staffing plan and
updating the procedures manual; (iv) optimizing the information system; and (v) lowering
operating costs. The status of implementation of these key measures will be reviewed in a
report at the end of the first quarter of 2010 (structural benchmark). In 2009, SOFITEX had
already undertaken a number of adjustment measures, the most important of which focused
on reducing costs, in particular, the wage bill.
Reform of the financial sector
33.
Financial sector reform is designed to deepen the sector and improve access to
financial services. Based on FSAP recommendations, a financial sector development
strategy has been prepared, which is designed to promote the following objectives: (i)
enhance the stability and depth of the financial sector; (ii) boost competition among financial
institutions; (iii) promote the insurance sector; (iv) improve access to financing in rural areas
and for Small-and-Medium-Sized Enterprises; (v) promote housing finance to facilitate
access to real estate ownership; and (vi) enhance the legal and judicial framework. In the
context of this strategy, the government—working in cooperation with its partners in the sub
region and with assistance from the Bretton Woods Institutions—has prepared a
comprehensive action plan. This plan will be implemented in 2010 following its adoption by
the Council of Ministers by January 2010 (benchmark). It will take into account the impact of
the financial crisis and will cover in detail the following areas: banking and insurance
sectors, microfinance, retirement systems, postal finance, cash flow management, the legal
environment, and access to financial services.
E. Program Monitoring
34.
The program will continue to be monitored based on quantitative performance
criteria and benchmarks, and structural benchmarks which have been agreed between
the government and the IMF (Tables 1 and 2). The authorities will report to the IMF data
needed to monitor the program in accordance with the definitions in the attached Technical
Memorandum of Understanding. Furthermore, during the program period, the government
will not introduce restrictions on payments and transfers on current international transactions,
or tighten any such restrictions without first consulting the IMF; introduce or modify
multiple currency practices; conclude bilateral payment agreements not compatible with

50
Article VIII of the IMF Articles of Agreement; or introduce restrictions on imports for
balance of payments purposes.
35.
The sixth review is expected to be completed by April 15, 2010. For this review,
the quantitative financial objectives for end-December 2009 are performance criteria.

APPENDIX I―ATTACHMENT II
TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
Ouagadougou, November 10, 2009
1.
This memorandum defines the quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets
for the program supported by the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF). It also sets deadlines for reporting data to Fund staff to
facilitate program monitoring.
I. DEFINITIONS
2.
For the purposes of this memorandum, the following definitions of “debt,”
“government,” “payments arrears,” and “government obligations” will be used:
●
Debt, as specified in point 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect
to Foreign Debt adopted by the Executive Board of the IMF on August 24, 2000, will be
understood to mean a current, not contingent, liability, created by contract through provision
of value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, that requires the obligor to
make one or more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at one or
more future points in time; these payments being made to discharge principal and interest
liabilities incurred under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones
being:
(i) loans, consisting of advances of money to the obligor (e.g., deposits, bonds,
obligations, commercial loans, and buyers’ credits), who undertakes to repay the funds in the
future, and temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans
where the obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the
collateral from the buyer in the future (e.g., repurchase agreements and official swap
arrangements);
(ii) suppliers’ credits, which are contracts where the supplier lets the obligor defer
payments until after the date on which the goods have been delivered or the services
provided;
(iii) leases, which are arrangements in which property is provided for the use of the
lessee for a specified period, usually shorter than the total expected life of the property, while
the lessor retains title to the property. For purposes of this guideline, the debt is the present
value at the inception of the lease of all lease payments expected to be made during the
period of the agreement, except payments that cover the operation, repair, or maintenance of
the property; and

55
(iv) Treasury bills and bonds issued in CFA francs on the WAEMU (West African
Economic and Monetary Union) regional market are included in domestic debt for purposes
of this memorandum.
●
Government is defined as the central government of Burkina Faso and does not
include any political subdivision, government-owned entity with a separate legal personality,
or the central bank.
●
External payments arrears are external payments due but unpaid. Domestic arrears
are domestic payments due but unpaid after a 90-day grace period, unless the obligation
specifies a different grace period.
●
Government obligation is any financial obligation of the government accepted as
such by the government (including any government debt).
II. QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
3.
The numerical values for quantitative performance criteria, indicative targets, and
adjusters are set out in Table 3 of the attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial
Policies (MEFP).
A. Overall Deficit Including Grants
Definition
4.
For the program, the overall deficit including grants is valued on a commitment basis
(base engagement). It is defined as the sum of foreign and domestic financing (net) of the
government measured from the financing side plus cash basis adjustment. Net foreign
financing is the sum of foreign borrowing and debt relief minus amortization. Net domestic
financing is the sum of (i) net bank credit to the government, including both net bank credit
to the treasury as defined below and other government claims on and debts to national
banking institutions; (ii) unredeemed government bills and bonds held outside national
commercial banks; and (iii) privatization receipts. Net bank credit to the treasury is the
balance of the treasury’s claims and debts vis-à-vis national banking institutions. Treasury
claims include the cash holdings of the Burkinabè Treasury, deposits with the central bank,
deposits with commercial banks, secured obligations, and government deposits with the
postal system (CCP). Treasury debt to the banking system includes funding from the central
bank (including statutory advances, consolidated advances, IMF financing, and refinancing
of secured obligations), government securities held by the central bank, funding from
commercial banks (including government securities held by commercial banks), and CNE
(Caisse Nationale d’Épargne Postale)/CCP securitized deposits. Net bank credit to the
government is calculated by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), whose
figures are recognized as valid for program purposes. The stock of treasury bills and other
government debt, as well as net foreign financing, is calculated by the Ministry of Finance.

56
Cash basis adjustment is the sum of (i) expenditure commitments not paid (engagées nonpayées); and (ii) change in treasury deposits.
5.
All these items are valued according to the statement of government budgetary
execution established monthly in the central government’s financial operations table. This is
prepared by the Permanent Secretariat for the Monitoring of Financial Policies and Programs
(SP-PPF), in collaboration with the other directorates of the Ministry of Economy and
Finance.
Adjustment
6.
The overall deficit including grants is adjusted upward by the amount that grants fall
short of what is programmed up to a maximum (see the MEFP, Table 3). It will not be
adjusted if grants are higher than programmed.
7.
The overall deficit including grants will also be adjusted upward by the amount that
concessional loans exceed what is programmed up to a maximum (see the MEFP, Table 3).
Reporting deadlines
8.
The ministry in charge of finance will forward data to the IMF on the overall deficit
excluding grants within six weeks after the end of each quarter.
B. Nonaccumulation of External Arrears
Performance criterion
9.
The government’s external debt is the stock of debt owed or guaranteed by the
government. External arrears are external payments due but not paid on the due date. Under
the program, the government undertakes not to accumulate arrears on its external debt,
except those arising from government debt that is being renegotiated with creditors,
including non-Paris Club bilateral creditors. Nonaccumulation of external arrears is a
performance criterion, to be observed continuously.
Reporting deadlines
10.
Data on outstanding balances, accumulation, and repayment of external arrears will
be forwarded within six weeks after the end of each month.
C. Nonconcessional External Debt Contracted or
Guaranteed by the Government
Performance criterion
11.

The government undertakes not to contract or guarantee any external debt maturing in

57
one year or more that has a grant element of less than 35 percent (calculated using the
interest reference rate for borrowed foreign currencies provided by the IMF) beyond the
ceiling indicated in the MEFP (Table 3). This performance criterion applies not only to debt
as defined in point 9 of the Guidelines (see ¶2), but also to all commitments contracted or
guaranteed for which value has not been received. However, it does not apply to treasury
bills and bonds issued in CFA francs on the WAEMU regional market. This performance
criterion is to be observed continuously.
Reporting deadlines
12.
Details on any loan (terms and creditors) to the government or guaranteed by the
government must be reported within four weeks of the end of each month. The same
requirement applies to guarantees granted by the government.
D. Government Short-Term External Debt
13.
The government undertakes not to accumulate or guarantee any new external debt
with a contractual maturity of less than one year. This performance criterion applies not only
to debt as defined in point 9 of the Guidelines (see ¶2), but also to commitments contracted
or guaranteed for which value has not been received. Excluded from this performance
criterion are import- and export-related loans and treasury bills and bonds issued in CFA
francs on the WAEMU regional market and normal short-term suppliers’ credits. This
performance criterion is to be observed continuously. As of April 1, 2007, the government of
Burkina Faso had no short-term external debt.
III. OTHER QUANTITATIVE INDICATIVE TARGETS
14.
The program also includes indicative targets on total government revenue, povertyreducing social expenditures, nonaccumulation of domestic arrears, and large taxpayer nonfiler rates.
A. Total Government Revenue
Definition
15.
Total government revenue is valued on a cash basis. It includes all tax and nontax
revenue collected by the Directorate General of Taxation, the Directorate General of
Customs, the Burkinabè Treasury, and revenue collection units at ministries and institutions,
and it also includes revenue from treasury checks.
Reporting deadlines
16.
Details on total revenue will be sent to IMF staff by the SP-PPF of the Ministry of
Finance and Budget within six weeks after the end of each month.

B. Poverty-Reducing Social Expenditures
Definition
17.
Poverty-reducing social expenditures are defined by the PRSP priority sector
programs designed to accelerate the reduction of poverty. They cover all spending categories
for the following ministries: Primary Education and Literacy; Health; Social Action and
National Solidarity; Promotion of Women; Labor and Social Security; Employment and
Youth; Agriculture, Water and Fishing Resources; Animal Resources; and Environment and
Living Conditions. They also cover rural roads and HIPC resources (Category 5) for
infrastructure spending and HIPC expenditures only for the Justice Ministry and the Ministry
of Economy and Development. These expenditures are monitored directly through the
budget.
Reporting deadlines
18.
The government will report within six weeks after the end of each month the monthly
data on poverty-reducing social expenditures.
C. Nonaccumulation of Domestic Arrears
Definition
19.
The government will not accumulate any arrears on domestic government obligations
during the program period. This is a benchmark to be observed continuously.
Reporting deadlines
20.
Data on balances, accumulation, and repayment of arrears on domestic government
obligations will be reported within four weeks after the end of each month.
D. Large Taxpayer Nonfiler Rate
Definition
21.
The large taxpayer nonfiler rate is defined as the ratio of late and nonfilers in the
Large Taxpayer Office (LTO) relative to the total number of taxpayers obligated to file in
LTO. A late filer is anyone who files a tax return after the deadline. A nonfiler is anyone in
the database who did not file taxes. The main tax categories are the VAT (TVA), the
corporate income tax (BIC), and the tax on wage income (IUTS). Filing deadlines for the
main tax categories are set in the tax code.
Reporting deadlines
22.

The government will report within two weeks after the end of each quarter the total

59
number of late and nonfilers as well as the total number of taxpayers obligated to file in LTO
for the main tax categories.

APPENDIX II. DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS (UPDATE)
This appendix updates the joint Bank/Fund debt sustainability analysis (DSA) from June
2009. Compared to the previous results, the debt sustainability outlook worsens over the
medium term because of faster debt accumulation in the short term, but improves in the long
term with continued fiscal consolidation efforts. Burkina Faso is still classified as a medium
performer and the country remains at high risk of debt distress.
I. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
A. What Has Changed Since the Last DSA?
1.
The medium-term economic outlook remains broadly unchanged. Real GDP
growth for 2009 has been lowered by 0.4 percentage points because of the greater impact of
the global economic downturn, but projections remain unchanged over the medium term
(Box 1). Real GDP growth is projected to average 6 percent in the long run, in line with the
average for the past ten years. Export diversification and structural reforms implementation
remain key to sustain growth over the medium term (Figure 1).

Box 1. Burkina Faso—Macroeconomic Assumptions
Real GDP growth is projected to average 6 percent in the medium and long run.
Growth in 2009 and 2010 is projected to be below trend as a result of exogenous
shocks (global economic crisis in 2008-09 and heavy flooding in September 2009).
Over the medium and long term, growth is expected to reach 6 percent, as a result of
improvements in productivity, enhanced infrastructure, and export diversification.
Inflation is expected to average about 2 percent over the medium and long term.
The overall fiscal deficit, with and without grants, is projected to decrease over time
as revenue increases towards the WAEMU tax revenue target of 17 percent of GDP.
The revenue increase is supported by ongoing efforts to strengthen tax and customs
administration, and comprehensive tax policy reforms. Expenditure is projected to
remain high to meet the authorities’ PRSP objectives. External financing requirements
are to be met equally by grants and loans, a conservative assumption based on recent
experience.
The current account deficit is expected to narrow in the medium and long run as the
tighter fiscal stance dampens import demand and gold production contributes to an
increase in exports.

2.
Fiscal developments reflect the impact of recent shocks to the Burkinabè
economy. The deterioration in the overall fiscal deficit in 2009 and 2010 leads to an increase
in the NPV of debt-to-revenue and NPV of debt-to-GDP ratios from 2011 onwards, but the
impact of the deterioration diminishes over the medium and the long term because of fiscal
consolidation efforts, which will notably benefit from higher revenue linked to ongoing tax
policy reform and planned measures to control current expenditure.
B. Assessing Vulnerabilities
3.
Stress tests show that a worse-than-expected export performance and less
favorable financing conditions pose the greatest risks to the external debt outlook.
Burkina Faso remains heavily dependent on cotton and gold exports. Therefore, downside
risks are related to fluctuations in production and terms of trade shocks. This underscores the
importance for the authorities to secure sufficiently concessional financing.
4.
A continuous decline in the fiscal deficit is key to ensure that the rate of external
debt accumulation remains manageable. Following an increase in debt accumulation in the
short term, which contributes to a worsening of revenue and GDP debt sustainability
framework (DSF) indicators over the medium term, sustained fiscal consolidation efforts
would lead to significantly lower debt accumulation and a clear improvement in debt
indicators over the long run (Figure 2).
C. Risk of Debt Distress
5.
The risk of debt distress is high because the threshold for the NPV of debt to
exports ratio is breached. The peak ratio of about 203 percent in the baseline projection of
the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio is well above the 150 percent threshold, warranting a
classification of high risk of debt distress under DSF guidelines. The GDP- and revenuebased DSF indicators remain below their indicative thresholds, including under the
alternative scenarios and stress tests.

II. PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
6.
The results for the fiscal DSA are similar to those of the external DSA. The
domestic debt stock is low. Gross domestic debt is estimated at about 2.7 percent of GDP at
end-2008, and the net debt at 1.3 percent of GDP. Although domestic debt increases in 2009
and 2010 because of increased financing needs triggered by exogenous shocks, it is assumed
to decline over the projection period as the authorities seek to avoid more costly domestic
financing of the fiscal deficit. Public debt dynamics are thus largely determined by the
evolution of external debt. Stress tests and alternative scenarios show that failure to reduce
the current fiscal deficits would lead to ever-increasing debt indicators, demonstrating the
importance of fiscal consolidation efforts.
III. CONCLUSION
7.
Burkina Faso’s risk of debt distress is high on account of the NPV of debt-toexports ratio; all other debt indicators remain comfortably below their policy-dependent
thresholds under the baseline scenario. Nevertheless, the high risk of debt distress and the
accumulation of debt as a result of recent shocks underscore the importance of limiting
external borrowing to concessional loans, implementing a prudent fiscal policy, and making
continued efforts to diversify and increase exports. Moreover, the authorities should continue
to improve their policy and institutional environment, which over time may result in a higher
CPIA rating and higher debt thresholds.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (US$ terms), non–interest current account in percent of GDP, and non–debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly
assumingan offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms at the
completion point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in NPV terms at the
decision point. Hence, these two amounts cannot be added.
2

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point corresponding to
interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point, but not disbursed during the interim
period.
3

The Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member countries
that are qualified for the assistance. Grant assistance from the MDRI Trust and HIPC resources provide debt
relief to cover the full stock of debt owed to the Fund as of end-2004 that remains outstanding at the time the
member qualifies for such debt relief.

IX.

Safeguards Assessments:

The Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) is the common central bank of the
countries of the West African Economic and Monetary Union, which includes Burkina Faso.
The most recent safeguards assessment of the BCEAO was completed on November 4, 2005.
The assessment indicated progress has been made in strengthening the bank's safeguards
framework since the 2002 assessment and identified some areas where further steps would
help solidify it.
The BCEAO now publishes a full set of audited financial statements and improvements have
been made to move financial reporting closer to International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS). Furthermore, an internal audit charter has been put in place, mechanisms for
improving risk management have been established, and follow-up on internal and external
audit recommendations has been strengthened.
The results of continuous safeguards monitoring indicate that while certain vulnerabilities
remain in internal control systems and legal structure, there has been some progress in other
areas, including through: (i) improving the external audit process by adopting a multi-year
audit program; (ii) establishing an audit committee; (iii) expanding disclosures on financial
positions of WAEMU countries with the Fund in the notes to the annual financial statements;
and (iv) further strengthening of the effectiveness of the internal audit function.
X.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:

Burkina Faso is a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU)
and has no separate legal tender. The union’s common currency, the CFA franc, is pegged to
the euro at a rate of CFAF 655.957 = EUR 1, consistent with the official conversions rate of
the French franc to the Euro and the previous fixed rate of the CFA franc to the French franc
of CFAF 100= F 1. On November 10, 2009, the rate of the CFA franc in terms of SDR was
CFAF 702.03 = SDR 1.0. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange arrangement of the
WAEMU countries has been reclassified to the category of conventional pegged arrangement
from the category of exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new
classification is based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous
classification was based on the lack of a separate legal tender. The new classification thus
only reflects a definitional change, and is not based on a judgment that there has been a
substantive change in the exchange regime or other policies of the currency union or its
member. The exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers
on current international transactions.
XI.

Article IV Consultations:

The periodicity of Burkina Faso’s Article IV consultation is set in accordance with the
July 15, 2002 Executive Board Decision on consultation cycles. Discussions on the 2007

6
Article IV consultation and first review under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF) were held during the period September 19–October 4, 2007 in Ouagadougou. The
staff report and the Selected Issues and Informational Annex were considered by the
Executive Board on January 9, 2008. The next article IV consultation is scheduled for
September 2011.
XII.

ROSC/AAP:

An FAD mission visited Ouagadougou during May 7–18, 2001 to assist the authorities
undertake a draft fiscal module of a Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes
(ROSC). The final report, which was issued in July 2002, found that Burkina Faso was
making good progress in a number of areas to increase the transparency and accountability of
government. Additional efforts are needed to bring a number of improvements to the point of
implementation, particularly with regard to expenditure tracking at the local level and
external audit functions. Initial discussions indicated that the authorities broadly concurred
with the mission assessment. On July 31, 2002, the authorities formally adopted an action
plan based on the recommendations of the final ROSC.
An STA mission during May 8–21, 2003 assisted the authorities in preparing a data ROSC.
The report was published in March 2004. The mission found that most of the methodologies
used in the compilation of macroeconomic statistics are in broad conformity with
internationally accepted guidelines. However, most datasets are affected by limited or
impaired source data arising from irregularity in the conduct of surveys (national accounts),
use of outdated weights (CPI), or low response rate to surveys (balance of payments). For
CPI and government finance statistics, data dissemination meets the SDDS requirement, but
for other macroeconomic datasets, timeliness falls short of GDDS recommendations. The
authorities broadly concurred with the main findings of the mission as well as the
recommendations made to address them.
The team, jointly with World Bank staff, also discussed a HIPC Initiative Assessment and
Action Plan (AAP) with the authorities. The aim was to assess the capacity of the public
expenditure management system to track poverty-reducing public expenditures under the
HIPC Initiative and the need for technical assistance to enhance that capacity. The mission
secured the officials’ approval of the jointly prepared preliminary assessment; identified the
main needs for technical assistance on upgrading the capacity to track such expenditures; and
drew up a draft outline action plan. This plan identifies the main needs for further technical
assistance to improve tracking of poverty-reducing expenditures. The AAP has been
endorsed by the authorities.

III. Statistical Issues
Burkina Faso—Statistical Issues Appendix
As of November 16, 2009
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
The most affected areas are: national accounts and price statistics. Burkina Faso has received
technical assistance (TA) from the IMF; the TA has been partially financed by Japan.
National accounts: Annual GDP estimates are compiled by economic activity, by
institutional sector accounts and by expenditure categories at current and constant prices
(1985=100). The quality of the national accounts estimates is affected by the scarcity of
suitable data sources and by deficiencies in statistical practices. The informal sector is not
properly captured—estimates are derived from limited surveys of the informal sector
conducted in 1989 and 1996. Most medium and small enterprises in the “modern sector” fall
short of submitting accounting statements or tax declarations. Private household consumption
is estimated as the residual and is not adequately validated with supply-use tables.
Price statistics: The CPI (1996=100) only covers households living in the capital; it
excludes non-African households, various types of purchased goods and services, and
services of owner-occupied dwellings. Compared to neighboring countries, the weight for
“food, beverages, and tobacco” is very low. The prices of unavailable products are presumed
unchanged for a period of up to three months—best practice would impute a price change for
these items based on the recorded prices changes for closely related products. The software
package used for calculating the CPI needs to be improved. The producer price index and the
wholesale price index are not compiled and the development of these indices is not
envisaged.
Government finance statistics: Compilation is constrained by a lack of coordination among
fiscal agencies. The data areas for improvement are the production of functional and
ministerial breakdowns of expenditure, the extension of coverage of the TOFE to the general
government, and basing the compilation on the Treasury ledger.
Monetary finance statistics: Most of the problems in monetary statistics are not specific to
Burkina Faso but affect all member countries of the WAEMU. The BCEAO has encountered
difficulties in estimating currency in circulation in each WAEMU member country due to
large backlogs of unsorted banknotes held by the central bank in its various national
agencies.
Balance of payments (BOP): The coverage of informal trade is incomplete. Improvements
in the coverage of services and transfers (especially workers’ remittances) depend on the
intensification of contacts with reporting bodies. The 2003 data ROSC mission found that the
response rate for the survey among industrial and commercial enterprises was only
40 percent. Annual surveys, reporting foreign direct investment transactions, are at a
preliminary stage. To improve the quality of the BOP reports, the BCEAO authorities plan to

15
integrate two additional data sources: the regional stock exchange transactions and the firms’
balance sheet database. The BCEAO authorities have indicated that quarterly data, derived
from banking settlement reports, will be used to assess the existing BOP reports. BOP
compilers receive payment statements every ten days; however, the information is not used in
the compilation of the annual BOP statements, but rather to support data quality controls and
to provide early information to the BCEAO authorities.
II. Data Standards and Quality

III. Reporting to STA (Optional)
In October 2009, annual data and quarterly data for 2006-2008 covering budgetary central
government were reported to STA for publication in International Financial Statistics and
the Government Finance Statistics yearbook. The BCEAO reports monetary data to STA
with a lag of at most three months. Despite requests, BOP and IIP data have not been
reported to STA for publication in IFS and the BOPSY since 2001.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 17, 2009

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with
Burkina Faso
On December 14, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund concluded the
Article IV consultation with Burkina Faso.1 The Executive Board also completed the fifth review
of Burkina Faso’s performance under its Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
supported program.
Background
The 2009 Article IV assessment follows a decade of generally good macroeconomic
performance in Burkina Faso, with real gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 5.5 percent and
inflation of 2.7 percent annually on average. Macroeconomic stability provided a favorable
environment for reducing poverty, which declined from about 55 percent of the population in
2000 to about 46 percent in 2006. Notwithstanding this generally good performance, reaching
the Millennium Development Goals will prove challenging in several areas, including education
and health.
In 2008-09, economic activity was negatively affected by the increase in global food and fuel
prices, the global economic and financial crisis, and heavy flooding in Ouagadougou in
September 2009. These shocks are estimated to have contributed to a deterioration in poverty
indicators. Following 5.2 percent real GDP growth in 2008, led by a rebound in agricultural
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

production and an expansion in the mining sector, growth is projected to slow to 3.1 percent in
2009, reflecting the impact of the global downturn, particularly on the cotton sector and related
activities. Inflation rose to close to 11 percent in 2008 because of high commodity prices, but is
set to decline to about 3½ percent in 2009. The current account deficit, which widened to almost
12 percent of GDP in 2008 as imports surged and the terms of trade deteriorated, is projected
to narrow to 9.1 percent of GDP in 2009, mostly on account of higher gold exports.
A generally expansionary fiscal policy in 2009 responded to the external shocks. Spending on
emergency and humanitarian needs rose after the 2009 flooding, and fiscal stimulus measures
were also adopted to support economic activity, and the cotton sector in particular. Increased
financing in 2009 does not lead to a significant worsening of debt indicators.
For 2010, economic growth is projected at 4.2 percent, supported by robust agricultural and
mining production, an anticipated rebound in the cotton sector, and public investment related to
infrastructure and reconstruction needs. Notwithstanding the latter, the fiscal deficit is projected
to narrow in 2010 as growth strengthens.
Over the medium-term, growth is forecast to return to historical trends of close to 6 percent,
supported by investments in infrastructure, private sector reforms, and expansion of the mining
sector. Inflation is expected to remain below 3 percent, thus complying with the West African
Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) convergence criterion.
Progress has been made with regard to structural reforms in 2008-09. In the fiscal area, tax
administration was modernized, helping to contain the impact of slower growth, and a tax reform
strategy was adopted at end-2009. In the cotton sector, reforms covered the setting up of a
price-smoothing fund for ginneries, the adoption of a producer-price setting mechanism, and an
audit of SOFITEX, the main ginning company. In the financial sector, a comprehensive reform
strategy building on the Financial Sector Assessment Program recommendations was also
completed in 2009.
Key risks to the economic outlook include a slower recovery in the global economy that would
undermine demand for cotton, reduced external budgetary support, and a possible revenue
shortfall that would limit scope for fiscal support to economic growth.

3

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Burkinabè authorities for implementation of appropriate
macroeconomic policies and structural reforms, despite a difficult environment marked by
several adverse exogenous shocks. In particular, fiscal policy helped moderate the impact of
the global economic downturn in 2009. Looking ahead, Directors called for fiscal consolidation,
improved execution of the public investment program, and further structural reforms to support
growth and poverty reduction objectives.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ resolve to enhance revenue performance and expenditure
management, while unwinding exceptional expenditure generated by adverse exogenous
shocks. They commended the authorities’ actions to mitigate the impact of the shocks,
especially on the most vulnerable. As growth strengthens, Directors noted that emphasis should
be placed on fiscal consolidation to restore debt sustainability. They encouraged the authorities
to implement the tax reform and other revenue-enhancing measures scheduled for 2010, and
highlighted the need to take additional expenditure measures should expected budgetary
resources fall short. Directors noted that Burkina Faso is at a high risk of debt distress on
account of the net present value of debt-to-exports ratio, although other debt indicators remain
comfortably below their indicative thresholds. They emphasized the importance of a prudent
borrowing policy, tapping highly concessional financing and grants, that would contribute to
long-term debt sustainability.
Directors noted the staff’s assessment that although Burkina Faso’s real effective exchange rate
is broadly in line with fundamentals, non-price factors continue to hamper competitiveness.
They encouraged further progress on structural reforms, including financial sector reforms in
line with the 2008 Financial Sector Assessment Program assessment, to support private sector
development and diversification. Directors also encouraged the authorities to press forward with
cotton sector reforms with the aim of putting ginning companies on a solid financial footing.
They observed that a successful restructuring of the cotton sector would help support economic
recovery and reduce vulnerabilities in the financial sector.

IMF Executive Board Completes Fifth Review
Under PRGF with Burkina Faso and Approves US$54 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the fifth
review of Burkina Faso’s performance under an economic program supported by a Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement. The Executive Board also approved an
augmentation of access of SDR 33.11 million (about US$ 52.52 million; and 55 percent of
quota) to help cushion the adverse impact of the global economic crisis and recent flooding
that have put a significant strain on the government budget. The completion of the review
enables the disbursement of SDR 34.114 million (about US$54.11 million), bringing total
disbursements under the program so far to about SDR 47.156 million (about US$74.80
million).
The PRGF arrangement for Burkina Faso was approved on April 23, 2007 (see Press Release
No. 07/77) to support the government's economic reform program for 2007-10. The
augmentation approved today will bring the total financial support under the PRGF
arrangement to SDR 48.16 million (about US$76.40 million). On January 9, 2008, the
Executive Board already approved an increase in access to help Burkina Faso address the
impact of higher oil prices and the adverse shock to the cotton sector (see Press Release No.
08/04).
The Executive Board today also concluded the 2009 Article IV consultation with Burkina
Faso. A Public Information Notice and the staff report will be published in due course.
Following the Executive Board's discussion on Burkina Faso, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:

2

“The Burkinabè authorities are to be commended for good macroeconomic management in a
challenging external environment, with the program supported by the PRGF arrangement
implemented in line with expectations.
“An expansionary fiscal policy stance responded to the challenges posed by the economic
downturn and the heavy flooding in Ouagadougou in September. The increase in public
expenditure in 2009 has helped minimize the negative impact of shocks on the most
vulnerable segments of the population while providing for reconstruction needs and growthenhancing investment outlays. Consequently, notwithstanding the authorities’ continued
efforts to enhance revenue collection and to contain non-priority spending, the overall fiscal
deficit has risen compared to the originally-envisaged level.
“Looking ahead, the Burkinabè authorities recognize the importance of fiscal consolidation
to safeguard long term debt sustainability. The fiscal deficit is projected to decline in 2010 as
the economy recovers and pressure from exceptional needs eases. Revenue mobilization
efforts will benefit from the continued strengthening of the tax and customs administrations,
and the implementation of a tax reform strategy covering an overhaul of corporate taxation,
the streamlining of tax incentives, and the improved management of indirect taxes. In
addition, the authorities’ plans to improve expenditure and treasury cash management and
accelerate civil service reform are welcome steps to enhance public financial management.
“Structural reforms will be key to accelerating economic growth and strengthening the
resilience of the Burkinabè economy. In 2010, efforts will focus on the implementation of the
recently completed financial sector reform strategy and on improving management of the
largest cotton ginning company. In conjunction with ongoing diversification efforts and
improvements to the business environment, these reforms will help place Burkina Faso on a
sustainable growth path generating the additional resources required for poverty reduction,”
Mr. Portugal said.

Statement by Laurean Rutayisire, Executive Director for Burkina Faso
December 14, 2009

On behalf of Burkina Faso’s authorities, I would like to thank the Executive Board and
Management for the Fund’s continued support to Burkina Faso. I would also like to thank
Staff for the close and constructive policy dialogue during the discussions held recently in
Ouagadougou in the context of the fifth review of the PRGF arrangement and the 2009
Article IV consultation.
Burkina Faso has been beset by a succession of adverse exogenous shocks including the fuel
and basic commodities price increases, deteriorations in terms of trade, the global economic
and financial crisis, and recently massive flooding which directly impacted major cities,
including the capital city in particular.
The flooding which were of an unprecedented scale in a country usually stricken by drought,
led to losses of lives and created a humanitarian crisis with an estimated 180,000 persons left
without a shelter, disruptions in economic activities, and damaged critical infrastructures,
including medical and pharmaceutical facilities, dams and roads.
My authorities are appreciative of the strong support they have received from the
International Community in the wake of the natural disaster. The IMF in particular responded
swiftly by sending a mission to Burkina which has been helpful in designing an appropriate
policy response to the crisis.
Although faced with a succession of severe exogenous shocks, Burkina Faso’s authorities
steadfastly implemented their economic program under the PRGF arrangement which aims at
reducing poverty, fostering growth while preserving macroeconomic stability. They realized
all the quantitative performance criteria. They also met all structural benchmarks, although
one benchmark was met with slight delay.
Notwithstanding the progress achieved, my authorities are fully cognizant of the challenges
ahead as they seek to meet their development objectives. They are committed to adhere to
sound policies going forward and would appreciate continued Fund support of their reform
agenda. To that regard, they are requesting completion of the fifth review under the PRGF,
and the 2009 Article IV consultation. They also request an augmentation of access to help
meet additional financing needs stemming from the exogenous shocks, and the natural
disaster in particular, and modification of performance criteria.
I. RECENT ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE
Reflecting the impact of the shocks, Burkina Faso’s growth prospects deteriorated, with real
GDP growth projected to decline to 3.1 percent in 2009. Inflation declined, following oil
prices decreases. The current account position is projected to improve as oil prices decline
and exports prices recover.

2

In spite of a challenging external environment, the authorities made inroads in realizing their
fiscal policy objectives, which aimed at creating the fiscal space required to address the
economic and humanitarian crisis in the short term, and in the medium term, to ensure of
fiscal sustainability and support the authorities development agenda. Their revenue collection
efforts, including through customs and tax administration reforms, helped stabilize revenues
in spite of the economic downturn. Overall, spending declined in 2008 due to spending
controls. However, in 2009, crisis related emergency spending led to a higher than planned
increase in spending. Priority spending increased significantly, with the share of spending
specifically earmarked towards poverty reduction efforts increasing to reach a quarter of
overall spending. At the same time, the authorities strived to improve spending efficiency, by
reinforcing expenditure controls and audits, and by enhancing the system for monitoring
poverty-reducing expenditure.
My authorities welcomed the recent allocation of SDRs by the IMF which they used in
accordance with the regional Central Bank’s guidelines, to retire domestic debt, hence
improving medium-term fiscal sustainability while supporting demand.
Monetary and exchange rate policies, which are implemented at the regional level
complemented fiscal policies in supporting demand in the face of the shocks while
effectively anchoring inflation expectations. The authorities realized further progress towards
finalizing a comprehensive financial sector strategy, which incorporates the 2008 FSAP
recommendations and aims at promoting the development of the financial sector and
ensuring of its stability.
On structural reforms, my authorities pursued their efforts aimed at promoting a private
sector-led sustainable growth. In particular they implemented reforms to further improve the
business climate which led to Burkina Faso’s favorable ranking of Burkina Faso in the Doing
Business Report of the World Bank. Amongst the reforms undertaken, they established a
one-stop window for land transactions in two cities, in order to improve the ease of transfer
of ownership in the real estate sector. On the key cotton sector, the authorities aimed to put in
place sustainable policies, including by preparing an action plan for restructuring SOFITEX,
in line with the recommendations of the audit of this company, the adoption of a producerprice setting mechanism. The authorities also realized progress on governance reforms as
well. The Government supervisory body, have made public its first report and is monitoring
its implementation.
II. POLICIES GOING FORWARD
Going forward, the authorities will seek to consolidate economic recovery in the short term,
and in the medium term the promotion of a sustainable and pro-poor growth.
Fiscal policy
In fiscal policy they plan to intensify efforts to create the adequate fiscal space in order to
support demand while preserving medium-term fiscal sustainability. To achieve this

3

objective, they will pursue reforms aimed at improving revenue collection, including through
reforms of the customs and tax administrations and the adoption of a comprehensive tax
reform strategy. Their fiscal reform strategy submitted to parliament, will broaden the tax
base by eliminating or rationalizing exemptions, streamline investment tax incentives,
reforming the VAT tax to broaden its base, and introducing a new corporate income tax. On
spending, the authorities will pursue efforts aimed at improving expenditure controls by
reigning in on the wage bill and reforming public service. They will also strive to reallocate
spending towards priority sectors such as infrastructure, and improve spending efficiency
through the implementation of the new system to track poverty reduction spending. To
further enhance spending efficiency, they plan to focus on completing preparatory work to
the implementation of a program budgeting system, and to undertake expenditure and
treasury cash flow management reforms.
The authorities are determined to preserve debt sustainability, by pursuing prudent debt
policies, medium-term fiscal consolidation and the promotion of exports diversification.
They plan to continue seeking financing preferably in the form of grants or concessional
borrowing. They are determined to select investment projects based on their economic
returns, and in accordance with their growth and poverty reduction priorities, with the view
to ensuring that the returns on the debt accumulated more than compensates over time, the
short-term worsening of debt sustainability indicators.
Financial sector policies
My authorities are determined to implement reforms aimed at deepening the financial system
and improving access to financial services. They are committed to adopting and
implementing a comprehensive financial sector development strategy in line with
recommendations from the 2008 FSAP. With donors support, they are preparing an action
plan to that end, and envision measures aimed at promoting competition in the financial
sector, improvements in the legal framework, and micro-finance promotion.
Structural reforms
Burkina Faso’s authorities are committed to intensifying structural reforms aimed at
broadening the basis for growth and diversifying the economy with the view to reducing its
vulnerability to exogenous shocks, further reducing poverty, and achieving a sustainable
growth path. Their reforms will be guided by a new poverty reduction strategy which they
are in the process of finalizing.
The authorities are aware of the importance of promoting private sector development in
achieving their objectives, and plan further reforms aimed at improving the business climate,
and the economy’s competitiveness, by scaling up productivity-enhancing infrastructure
projects and developing financial intermediation. They will also focus on improving
agriculture productivity and diversifying the economy in order to reduce its exposure to the
cotton sector. With respect to the cotton sector in particular, the authorities plan to pursue
reforms aimed at restoring its viability, including through a restructuring of SOFITEX in

4

order to increase its efficiency, and the recapitalization of cotton ginning companies. They
will also seek to secure funding for the cotton price-smoothing mechanism.
III. CONCLUSION
The Burkina Faso’s authorities strongly implemented the PRGF supported program
notwithstanding a succession of severe exogenous shocks. They are determined to advance
sound reforms going forward with the view to making further progress towards reaching the
Millennium Development Goals and their growth objectives.
In this endeavor, they critically need the continued strong assistance of their development
partners in general, and the IMF particularly. To that end, they have expressed an interest in a
successor program with the Fund, following expiration of the current PRGF arrangement.
Based on the authorities’ continued track record of strong implementation, and their
commitment to sound policies going forward, I call on Executive Directors to support my
authorities’ requests.
