KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS—ARUBA
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation Discussions
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2007 Consultation Discussions
with the Kingdom of the Netherlands—Aruba
Approved by Alessandro Leipold and Martin Fetherston
January 24, 2008
Executive Summary
Background. Aruba—pursuing open, market-friendly policies—continues to do well as one of the
most developed islands in the Caribbean. Still, it is vulnerable to external shocks owing to its heavy
dependence on tourism and a steady increase in public debt from 39 percent of GDP in 2000 to
46 percent of GDP in 2006. The economy’s exposure to external shocks was apparent in 2006
when—following a pronounced drop in tourist arrivals—GDP growth virtually stalled and the non-oil
current account deficit widened sharply. However, a gradual tightening of macroeconomic policies
since 2005 has helped to slow the rise in public debt and maintain a sufficient level of foreign
exchange reserves.
The task is now to implement policies to support further fiscal consolidation and boost Aruba’s
growth potential. Against this background, consultation discussions centered on the following key
issues, with broad agreement on the identified priorities:
•

Maintaining macroeconomic stability. Consolidation of the fiscal accounts has advanced
commendably and should continue. Immediate action is needed to address the renewed
financial problems of the general health insurance (AZV). Monetary policy is being
appropriately kept on hold until there are clear signs that inflationary pressures are abating.
The peg of the florin to the U.S. dollar provides an effective nominal anchor, and the current
exchange rate is at a competitive level.

•

Ensuring medium-term fiscal sustainability. The authorities are targeting to balance the
budget by 2009 and reduce public debt to less than 40 percent of GDP, but supporting
measures have yet to be identified. More emphasis to limiting growth of personnel costs and
better control of spending on goods and services would help to achieve the target. Advancing
pension reforms, in particular increasing the retirement age from 60 to 62, would help to
ensure the pension system remains financially sound in the face of rapid population ageing.

•

Strengthening policy frameworks and public institutions. Good progress is being made in
improving the budget process and work is underway to strengthen fiscal responsibility. At the
same time, the central bank’s de facto independence could be usefully formalized in the
central bank law. Improving Aruba’s statistical base would help support effective
policymaking.

•

Boosting potential growth. To create an environment that is conducive to investment and
diversification, additional tax reforms—with a greater reliance on indirect taxes and a
reduction of the high marginal personal income tax rate—would be beneficial. Plans to
eliminate the credit ceilings and make greater use of indirect monetary policy instruments are
well-placed and should be taken forward to promote more efficient financial intermediation.

Aruba is among the most developed islands in the Caribbean (Figure 1). Its per capita GDP
has increased from US$6,662 in 1986, when it gained autonomy from the Kingdom of the
Netherlands, to US$23,550 in 2006. This impressive gain has been achieved with the help of
market-friendly policies that have fostered a stable macroeconomic environment and a rapid
expansion of the tourist sector, now accounting for more than half of GDP. However, the
heavy dependence on tourism has rendered the economy vulnerable to external shocks, a
situation that has been aggravated by a steady increase in public debt. The Article IV
consultation discussions consequently focused on strategies for reducing Aruba’s external
vulnerability and strengthening institutions and policy frameworks necessary for sustained
growth.
I. A REBOUNDING ECONOMY
1.
Following a sharp deceleration in 2006, real GDP growth has rebounded driven
by a recovery in tourism (Tables 1 and 2; Figure 2). Tourism receipts, which account for
80 percent of export revenues, declined by 2 percent in 2006 as tourist arrivals fell following
negative publicity and because of extensive upgrading of hotel rooms. The slowdown was
only partially offset by an expansion of construction and investment activities in the hotel
and real estate sectors. As a result, real GDP growth decelerated to 0.6 percent in 2006. The
deceleration proved to be temporary, however, as tourist arrivals picked up again in the last
quarter of 2006. The rebound in the tourist sector continued in 2007, while activity in the
construction and utility sectors was also robust.
2.
Inflation has accelerated, but mainly owing to one-off supply shocks. After
several years of broadly following changes in the U.S. CPI, inflation in Aruba almost tripled
from 2.5 percent year-on-year in December 2006 to 7.3 percent in October 2007. The
acceleration is largely due to the introduction of a turnover tax in January 2007 and to a
lesser extent higher utility tariffs. Official estimates suggest that the turnover tax has directly
contributed about 3 percentage points to inflation
With the REER slightly below its level in
in 2007.
3.
Although there are signs that the labor
market has tightened, Aruba has maintained
its international competitiveness. Preliminary
estimates by the authorities suggest the
unemployment rate has dropped appreciably, from
6.9 percent in 2000 to 3.8 percent at present.
However, wage pressures have been contained by
a large inflow of low-skilled migrant workers
from the region into the tourism and construction
sectors. This influx contributed to maintaining
Aruba’s international competitiveness.

2000, Aruba is maintaining its international
competitiveness.

The rebound in tourist arrivals is contributing to a recovery in the non-oil
current account (Table 3).1 The deficit in the non-oil current account widened sharply from
some 7½ percent of GDP in 2005 to over 13 percent of GDP in 2006, mainly as a result of
declining tourism revenue, increasing outflows of workers’ remittances, and strong growth in
merchandise imports driven by robust investment activity. Following the rebound in tourism,
the deficit in the non-oil current account has begun to narrow again, coming in at 6 percent of
GDP in the year ending in June 2007.
5.
Capital inflows have increased sharply as a result of increased investment
activity. FDI inflows more than doubled in 2006, reaching 13½ percent of GDP, though
preliminary estimates indicate a slowdown in inflows in the first half of 2007. Official
reserves have increased to US$408 million, equivalent to about three months of imports of
goods and services, but the ratio of external debt to official reserves remains high at more
than 300 percent (Table 4).
6.
The authorities have tightened macroeconomic policies to stem the rise in public
debt and maintain a sufficient level of foreign exchange reserves.

After a jump to an unusually large fiscal deficit (including losses of the AZV) of
8½ percent of GDP in 2004, the deficit narrowed to 2½ percent of GDP in 2006. The

The operations of a foreign-owned refinery, which re-exports oil products and accounts for about 5 percent of
GDP, create large swings in the current account, but these operations are financed directly by the owners from
abroad. The analysis of Aruba’s external position is thus based on the non-oil current account, which excludes
the activities of the refinery.

II. WHAT LIES AHEAD?
7.
The near-term outlook is mostly favorable. Staff projects real GDP to expand by
about 2 percent in 2007 and 2008. The tourist sector is making a strong comeback and will,
together with continued robust investment, be a key engine of growth in the near term.

Improved cost control and a hike in medical insurance premiums in 2006 had resulted in an almost balanced
AZV budget in 2006.

8
Inflation is projected to ease from slightly over 6 percent in 2007 to just under 4 percent in
2008 as the impact of the one-off supply shocks gradually dissipates. The deficit in the nonoil current account is projected to decline to about 8 percent of GDP in 2007 and 6¾ percent
of GDP in 2008. The main risks to the outlook are a more pronounced and protracted
slowdown in the U.S. economy and a further increase in oil prices. It is also possible that the
full impact on inflation of the turnover tax will take longer to materialize, which, together
with further increases in the oil price and signs of tightness in the labor market, could
provide additional impetus to inflation.
8.
Despite the tightening of macroeconomic policies and the rebound in growth,
Aruba remains vulnerable to external shocks. The continued vulnerability emanates
mainly from the high dependence on the often volatile tourist sector and the state of Aruba’s
public finances, which, although sustainable, remains fragile. Absent further fiscal
consolidation, the room for maneuver of macroeconomic policies in case of unforeseen
events remains limited; a negative shock to the economy would almost certainly require the
authorities to tighten pro-cyclically to avoid a sharp loss of international reserves and an
unsustainable rise in the level of public debt (Table 7; Figure 3). While the large current
account deficit does not pose an immediate threat to external stability, it leaves little room for
maneuver. It is projected to improve appreciably over the medium term, as export revenues
increase following the expansion in room capacity, and import growth slows after the current
construction and investment boom in the hotel sector tapers off. However, the improvement
in the debt-creating deficit (current account balance plus FDI) will be appreciably smaller,
because the moderation in investment activity will also be reflected in lower FDI inflows. As
a result, external debt is projected to decline only gradually (Tables 8-9; Figure 4).
III. HOW CAN ARUBA REDUCE ITS EXTERNAL VULNERABILITY?
9.
The task for Aruba is to implement policies that will keep public finances on a
sustainable path and boost its economic potential. Key in this regard are: (i) maintaining
macroeconomic stability, (ii) reducing public debt, (iii) strengthening public institutions and
policy frameworks, and (iv) creating an economic environment that is conducive to
investment and diversification. These goals are broadly shared by the authorities, who intend
to achieve a balanced budget by 2009, but their growth strategy remains insufficiently
focused on creating conditions for increasing potential.
A. The Near Term: Maintaining Macroeconomic Stability
10.
A key priority of the government is further consolidation of the fiscal accounts,
but the renewed problems at the AZV are posing a serious challenge. The 2008 budget
entails a further reduction in the fiscal deficit to 1 percent of GDP. Contrary to previous
years, the adjustment in 2008 is to be achieved mainly by containing growth in current
expenditures. However, the financial problems at the AZV are casting a cloud over the 2008

9
budget. Absent corrective measures, staff estimates that the fiscal deficit would exceed the
budget target by about ½ percent of GDP.
11.
The authorities have made resolving the losses of the AZV a top policy priority.
They have begun to investigate possible measures, including an increase in premiums,
introduction of co-payments, and caps on expenditure. Measures to strengthen financial
monitoring of the AZV would also be considered. The authorities indicated they intend to
close the deficit of the AZV in 2008, but noted that, given the size of the shortfall, this will
be a challenge.
12.
Staff warned that the losses of the AZV should not lead to slippage in the
ongoing fiscal consolidation. It supported a quick resolution of the AZV’s financial
problems, but stressed that to the extent the situation cannot be remedied in the short run,
offsetting savings in current expenditure should be identified in the 2008 budget so as to
keep the fiscal deficit on a firm downward trend. Cuts in public investment, which is already
at a low level, would best be avoided, while any larger-than-budgeted revenues should be
saved.
13.
Monetary policy is set to remain on hold in the near term. The monetary
authorities intend to lower the credit ceilings to 4 percent at the beginning of 2008. The
modest tightening is motivated by the uncertain inflation outlook and the challenges facing
fiscal policy. The authorities noted, however, that, contrary to previous years when credit
ceilings were set for an entire year, they will adopt a more flexible approach in 2008,
allowing an increase in the credit ceilings during the year to up to 7 percent if there are clear
signs that inflationary pressures are abating and international reserves remain at a
comfortable level.3 The authorities are also planning a gradual increase in the use of indirect
monetary instruments in 2008 with the aim of abolishing the credit ceilings by the end of the
year.4 Staff agreed that under the current outlook it was prudent to err on the side of caution
and that credit growth of 4-7 percent, depending on the economic situation, was appropriate.
It welcomed the planned move to indirect instruments, noting that the CBA should stand
ready to increase interest rates and absorb excess liquidity if credit growth accelerated
excessively.
14.
There was agreement that the fixed exchange rate regime remained appropriate
for Aruba, and that the exchange rate was at a competitive level. Although the fixed
exchange rate policy has limited the flexibility of policymakers to respond to external
3

The objective of the authorities is to maintain a level of net foreign assets in the banking system (central bank
plus commercial banks) that is close to six months of merchandise imports, excluding the oil refinery. Note that
staff uses a different definition to calculate import coverage (Table 3b).

10
shocks, it has provided an effective nominal anchor that has been instrumental in achieving
generally low inflation. With the United States accounting for 70 percent of tourist arrivals
and almost 60 percent of imports of goods, the authorities felt that the peg to the U.S. dollar
remained appropriate. Staff and the authorities agreed that, assessed against the medium-term
balance of payments outlook (paragraph 8), the exchange rate was at an appropriate level. In
addition, although Aruba’s immigration policy has been tightened recently, it is expected that
the continuing inflow of migrant workers will act as a safety valve against wage pressures,
thus helping Aruba to maintain its international competitiveness. Staff cautioned, however,
there may be a limit to the number of migrant workers the island can accommodate. It also
stressed that for the CBA to maintain a sufficient level of foreign exchange reserves to
support the current exchange rate peg it is important that fiscal consolidation and structural
reforms move forward.
B. The Medium Term: Ensuring Fiscal Sustainability
15.
The authorities are committed to balancing the budget by 2009 and reducing
public debt to less than 40 percent of GDP. The key objectives of this policy are to ensure
long-run fiscal sustainability and create room for spending on infrastructure and education by
reducing the share of interest payments in the budget. To achieve these objectives the
authorities intend to limit annual growth of personnel costs to 3 percent and that of spending
on goods and services to 2 percent.
16.
Staff supported the government’s goal, but noted that its achievement would
require additional measures. Staff projections, based on the government’s medium-term
fiscal framework and the projected shortfall in the AZV, indicate that the government will—
in the absence of further measures—run a deficit of about 1½ percent of GDP in 2009 and
that fiscal balance will not be achieved until after 2012 (Box 1). To achieve a broadly
balanced budget from 2009 onward staff suggested a temporary freeze of personnel costs at
the level of the 2008 budget and 3 percent annual growth thereafter. Staff argued that to
achieve this target the government should consider rationalizing Aruba’s relatively large civil
service as it will be difficult to restrict wage growth to the rate of inflation over the medium
term. Staff also recommended the authorities make a greater effort to limit growth of
spending on goods and services as the 2008 budget allows for an expansion of 7-8 percent,
well above the government’s 2 percent target.
17.
The authorities acknowledged their plan was ambitious and welcomed staff’s
recommendations. They recognized that limiting growth in personnel costs will be difficult
without a reduction in the size of the civil service, but—2009 being an election year—were
reluctant to consider more than a hiring freeze for now. They explained that the large
increase in spending on goods and services in 2008 was the result of unanticipated outlays
following the completion of public investment projects. They expected to gain better control
over these expenses as they moved to a full-fledged medium-term fiscal framework.

11
Box 1. Aruba: Fiscal Sustainability
While Aruba’s present fiscal situation is not unsustainable, it leaves little room for maneuver in the event
of an unforeseen shock. Under staff’s baseline scenario, which assumes no changes in current policies, the
government will not achieve a balanced budget over the medium term. Public debt will, however, continue to
decline gradually, although it will not fall below 40 percent of GDP. Under this scenario, an unexpected GDP
shock would lead to an unsustainable rise in public debt absent a pro-cyclical tightening of fiscal policy. By
contrast, under an adjustment scenario—assuming the government realizes a balanced budget in 2009 and
resolves the financial problems of the AZV in 2008—public debt declines to about 35 percent of GDP over the
medium term. In this case, public debt would remain below 45 percent of GDP in the event of an unexpected
GDP shock.

18.
Notable progress has been made in pension reform but additional reforms are
needed to support medium-term fiscal sustainability. The civil service pension fund
(APFA) was partially reformed in 2005, which contributed to a considerable, albeit still
insufficient, improvement in its coverage ratio. The final stage of the reform is expected to
raise the fund’s coverage ratio to 100 percent. At that point, it will also come under the
supervision of the central bank. Staff called for early completion of the reforms and urged the
government to settle its remaining payment arrears with APFA. By contrast, much less has
been achieved in the reform of the universal pay-as-you-go pension system (AOV)—an
increasingly pressing issue in light of rapid population ageing. Starting in 2012, the AOV
will begin to run down its reserve to cover pension obligations. Without adjustment in the
AOV’s parameters the reserve could be depleted by as early as 2020. Against a background
of increased life expectancy and a shortage in the domestic supply of labor, staff
recommended a gradual increase in the effective retirement age. It also suggested other

12
options, including raising the income ceiling, increasing premiums, and lowering the
replacement ratio.
19.
The authorities agreed that additional pension reforms are needed. They were
optimistic about the final stage of the reform of APFA and expected that it would be
completed in 2008, including the settlement of arrears. As to the reform of the AOV, the
authorities’ preferred option was to increase the retirement age from 60 to 62, but noted that
sufficient public support was still lacking.
C. Strengthening Policy Frameworks and Public Institutions
20.
The authorities have made progress in improving the budget process and work
is underway to strengthen fiscal responsibility. Staff welcomed the timely submission of
the 2008 budget to parliament—the first time the budget was submitted on time in several
years—and the inclusion of a medium-term fiscal framework in the budget documents,
noting these were useful steps toward a more transparent budget process. The authorities are
preparing changes to the budget law, to be implemented in 2008, which they expect will
provide additional institutional support for fiscal consolidation by imposing greater fiscal
discipline, improving fiscal management, and strengthening the fiscal framework.
21.
Little progress has been made in strengthening central bank independence.
Although in practice the CBA enjoys a high degree of operational independence, staff saw a
need to formalize this in the central bank law to provide a safeguard against potential
government interference. The authorities acknowledged the need for formalizing central bank
independence and noted that plans to that extent were being developed. However, the
government remains wary of giving the CBA greater budgetary independence. They also
noted that the CBA had not provided direct financing to the budget for many years and did
not intend to do so in the future.
22.
The authorities have made substantial improvements in Aruba’s statistical base,
but more work is needed to support effective policymaking. Great effort has been made to
update national accounts and labor market statistics. Staff recommended that, next, attention
should be given to national accounts in constant prices and new weights for the consumer
price index as the current weights are outdated. The authorities noted that the Central Bureau
of Statistics is developing plans to address these issues.
D. Bolstering Long-Run GDP Growth
23.
Aruba’s potential GDP growth is driven to a large extent by increases in the
labor force. In particular, the expansion in the tourist sector and the attendant construction
activity are labor intensive and rely predominantly on immigrant workers. However, with a
population density that is already more than 500 inhabitants per square kilometer, this growth

13
model is bound to come under pressure at some future point. The discussions thus focused on
developing a sustainable growth strategy and creating an environment that is conducive to
more investment and diversification. Key in this regard are further tax reform and more
efficient financial intermediation.
Reforming the tax system
24.
Aruba’s tax system is geared heavily toward direct taxation. As a small open
economy, staff noted that Aruba

consumption-based taxes.
25.
Recent tax reforms were an important step toward a more investment friendly
environment, but more can be done. There was agreement that the introduction of the
turnover tax is an important achievement that will increase the share of indirect taxes in total
tax revenue. Aruba being a small island economy, the cascading effect, inherent in turnover
taxes, has been limited thus far. In addition, the authorities reduced the number of import
duty rates from eight to four in 2006 and cut the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to
28 percent in combination with a reduction in exemptions and incentives. Staff welcomed
these reforms, but suggested the following additional measures.
•

Further rationalization of import duties as a number of goods continue to be subject to
special duty rates.

•

Reduction of the personal income tax. The highest marginal rate is currently
58 percent, compared to an average of 34 percent in the Caribbean region.

•

Elimination of the tax on foreign exchange transactions. This tax is a nuisance to
foreign investors and constitutes an unapproved exchange restriction under
Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement.

26.
The authorities agreed that there is scope for additional tax reforms to enhance
the investment environment. They stressed, however, that any changes had to be revenue
neutral with cuts in direct taxes being offset by an expansion of indirect tax revenue or a
broadening of the tax base. The authorities intend to eliminate the foreign exchange tax, but
could not commit to a timeframe.

14
Strengthening financial intermediation
27.
Aruba’s banking sector is characterized by a limited degree of financial
intermediation and a low level of competition. Although Aruba’s banking sector is large
relative to the size of its economy, with banking sector assets close to 100 percent of GDP,
domestic financial intermediation is limited, with private sector credit amounting to only
59 percent of GDP. The low level of competition among banks is reflected in very high
profitability arising mainly from a wide margin between lending and deposit rates.
28.
The characteristics of the banking system reflect in part the CBA’s reliance on
credit ceilings and capital controls (Box 2). Although these quantitative measures have
been effective in containing domestic credit growth, staff noted they have also hindered
greater competition between commercial banks and contributed to excess liquidity in the
banking system.

Box 2. Aruba: Towards Indirect Monetary Policy Instruments
The CBA has relied mainly on credit ceilings and capital controls in conducting its monetary policy. The
ceilings, which were reintroduced in 2003, are announced at the beginning of each year and limit the nominal
expansion of gross credit of each individual commercial bank. The capital controls include a cap on banks’ net
foreign asset positions and a 60-40 rule, which limits the amount that institutional investors can invest abroad. This
framework has been effective under the fixed exchange rate regime in maintaining price stability.
However, these direct controls have hindered efficient financial intermediation. The credit ceilings have created
a disincentive for banks to compete.1 This is manifest in the high profits in the banking sector and the large spread
between lending and deposit rates, which is among the highest in the region. The combination of credit ceilings and
capital controls has also contributed to a considerable amount of unremunerated excess liquidity, thus raising the
cost of intermediation.

Following the example of several other islands in the region, the CBA plans to make greater use of indirect
monetary instruments. This will give the CBA more flexibility in the conduct of its monetary policy and is
expected to promote more efficient financial intermediation.

Although foreign banks can set up branches in Aruba, none of the major international banks have a presence in Aruba.

15
29.
A key step toward the creation of a more competitive and efficient banking
sector would be for the CBA to make greater use of indirect monetary instruments.
Staff therefore welcomed the CBA’s plan to abolish the credit ceilings by the end of 2008
and to begin issuing central bank certificates to manage liquidity. Staff noted that the CBA
would have to issue a significant amount of certificates at commercially attractive rates to
mop up the excess liquidity, but that the CBA’s financial position is sufficiently sound to
carry out this operation. Staff also recommended that the CBA strengthen its liquidity
forecasting framework.
30.
The financial system is generally sound, but the large exposure of commercial
banks to the tourist sector warrants continued supervisory vigilance. In this regard, the
CBA raised the minimum risk-weighted capital adequacy ratio from 10 to 12 percent in
2007. Staff recommended that banks and the CBA consider employing stress tests to gain
additional insight in the banking sector’s capacity to withstand large shocks.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
Aruba remains one of the most developed islands in the regions. This success has
been the result of market-friendly policies that have fostered a stable macroeconomic
environment and a rapid expansion of the tourist sector. Equally important has been the
openness of the economy as foreign investment and, in particular, migrant workers have been
key contributors to economic growth.
32.
However, heavy dependence on tourism has rendered the economy vulnerable to
external shocks. This vulnerability has been aggravated by a steady increase in public debt,
owing to an unfavorable fiscal trend during 2000-04. Against this background, the recent
tightening of macroeconomic policies was both welcome and timely.
33.
The task is now to implement policies that will support further fiscal
consolidation and boost Aruba’s growth potential. It is important, therefore, that Aruba
adopts a strategy for keeping public finances on a sustainable path and bolstering potential
growth. Key in this regard are maintaining macroeconomic stability, reducing public debt,
strengthening public institutions and policy frameworks, and creating an economic
environment that is conducive to investment and diversification.
34.
Maintaining macroeconomic stability in the near term will require further fiscal
adjustment and an appropriately tight monetary policy. Immediate action is needed to
address the renewed financial problems of the AZV. To the extent that these problems cannot
be resolved in the short run, offsetting savings in current expenditure should be identified.
Monetary policy should remain on hold until there are clear signs that inflationary pressures
are abating. The peg of the florin to the U.S. dollar should be maintained as it is providing an
effective nominal anchor, while the current exchange rate is at a competitive level.

16
35.
The government’s plan to balance the budget by 2009 and reduce public debt to
less than 40 percent of GDP needs to be supported by additional measures. Emphasis
should be given to limiting growth of personnel costs, including through rationalizing the
civil service. Control of spending on goods and services should be strengthened and
additional reforms are needed to ensure the pension system remains financially sound in the
face of rapid population ageing.
36.
More needs to be done to strengthen policy frameworks and public institutions.
While good progress is being made in improving the budget process and work is underway to
strengthen fiscal responsibility, there is a need for formally strengthening the independence
of the central bank. Aruba’s statistical base also needs to be improved to support effective
policymaking.
37.
Bolstering Aruba’s long-run growth potential will require creating the right
conditions for private investment and diversification. Such a strategy will need to be
supported by additional tax reform―aimed at further simplification and greater reliance on
indirect taxes―and by steps toward more efficient financial intermediation. These steps
would need to include elimination of the credit ceilings and greater use of indirect monetary
instruments, and plans in this direction are welcome.
38.
The financial system is generally sound, but the large exposure of commercial
banks to the tourist sector warrants continued supervisory vigilance. The CBA should
consider employing stress tests to gain additional insight in the banking sector’s capacity to
withstand large shocks.
39.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Aruba be held on the
24-month cycle.

1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and
e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

U.S. dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total
external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic
currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent

APPENDIX I. KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS—ARUBA: FUND RELATIONS
(As of November 30, 2007)

•

The consultation discussions, which are part of the 2007 Article IV consultation
discussions with the Kingdom of the Netherlands, were held in Oranjestad during
November 27–December 4, 2007. The staff team comprised Messrs. Zebregs (head),
Daal, and Xiao (all EUR). It met with the governor, the prime minister, the finance
minister, the president of the central bank, the labor minister, senior officials at the
central bank and several ministries, representatives of labor unions, employer
organizations, trade associations, and members of parliament. Mr. Bakker, Executive
Director, also participated in the discussions.

•

As part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Aruba has accepted the obligations under
Article VIII and, apart from the foreign exchange tax described in the text, maintains an
exchange system free of restrictions.

•

The authorities held a joint press conference on the mission’s concluding statement and
have agreed to publish the staff report.

I.

Membership Status: The Kingdom of the Netherlands is an original member of the
Fund. On February 15, 1961, the Kingdom accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement for all territories.

VII.

Exchange Arrangements:

The Aruban florin has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at Af. 1.79 per US$1 since January 1,
1986. In compliance with relevant UN resolutions, Aruba maintains exchange restrictions on
financial transactions with Iraq and Kuwait.
There is an unapproved foreign exchange restriction arising from the foreign exchange tax on
payments by residents to nonresidents. This tax, which amounts to 1.3 percent of the
transaction value, was introduced when Aruba was part of the Netherlands Antilles to
generate revenue for the government. Aruba adopted it after gaining autonomy (status
aparte) in 1986. Since then, it has served as a source of general tax revenue for the central
government of Aruba.

Article IV Consultation:

The Board concluded the last Article IV consultation discussions for Aruba on May, 25,
2005 on the basis of the staff report (IMF Country report 05/204) and the statistical appendix
(IMF Country report 05/204). Consultations are conducted on a bi-annual cycle.

OFC Assessment:

The Offshore Financial Sector Assessment was published in June 2002. An update of the
assessment is scheduled to take place in the spring of 2008.

Technical Assistance:

Aruba participated in the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) in 2000–01 with
the assistance of the Statistics Department. To assist the authorities in a self-assessment of
the financial standards of its offshore center activities, a special mission from the Monetary
and Exchange Affairs Department visited Aruba in late 2000 and early 2001.

APPENDIX II. KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS—ARUBA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Aruba’s statistical base is broadly adequate for surveillance, but several shortcomings hinder
effective policymaking. While the coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of balance of
payments and monetary data are adequate, reporting of fiscal, national accounts, and labor
market statistics needs to be strengthened.
1.

Real sector

The Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) has published national accounts for 1995 through
2002, as well as preliminary estimates for 2003–06. More detailed sector accounts have been
made available for the years 1995–2000. The country also compiles CPI data.
2.

Fiscal sector

Government finance statistics are not reported to STA, neither for publication in the GSF
Yearbook nor in the IFS.
3.

Monetary sector

The Central Bank of Aruba (CBA) reports monetary data to STA on a timely basis. The
authorities have submitted test data in the format of Standardized Report Forms developed by
STA for reporting monetary data, and work on finalizing these data is under way.
4.

External sector

The CBA reports quarterly balance-of-payments data and annual IIP. It would be useful to
publish a more detailed breakdown of exports and imports, for example by economic use
(consumer goods, fuels, raw materials, and capital goods) and/or by commodity. It would be
desirable to narrow––to the extent possible––the differences between trade data from the
CBA and those from the CBS.
Monthly data on the official reserve position are published with a lag of one month. A
breakdown in holdings of gold and foreign currency is provided. As prescribed by the SDDS,
data on foreign liabilities of the monetary sector—including a breakdown by maturity and
instrument—and the central government are published on a quarterly basis, with a lag of
about one quarter. Data provision on foreign debt of the nonfinancial private sector is on an
annual basis. A debt survey covering both the public and private sector provides information
on the amount, average maturity, and currency denomination of foreign debt outstanding, but
there is no disaggregation by instrument or information on amortization payments coming
due.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with the
Kingdom of the Netherlands—Aruba
On February 8, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Kingdom of the Netherlands—Aruba.1
Background
Aruba—pursuing open, market-friendly policies—continues to do well as one of the most
developed islands in the Caribbean. Currently, the economy is on the rebound helped by a
recovery in tourism, on which the economy is heavily dependent. A decline in tourist arrivals led
to a slowdown in real GDP growth to 0.6 percent in 2006, but the deceleration proved to be
temporary, and arrivals picked up again in the last quarter of 2006. The rebound in tourism
continued in 2007, while activity in the construction and utility sectors was also robust.
Inflation has accelerated owing to one-off supply shocks. After broadly following changes in the
U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) for several years, inflation in Aruba almost tripled from
2.5 percent year-on-year in December 2006 to 7.3 percent in October 2007. The acceleration is
largely due to the introduction of a turnover tax in January 2007, which is estimated to have
contributed 3 percentage points to CPI inflation in 2007.
There are signs that the labor market is tightening amid a further expansion of the tourist sector.
The unemployment rate is estimated to have dropped from 6.9 percent in 2000 to 3.8 percent at
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

present. Wage pressures have been contained, however, by a large inflow of low-skilled migrant
workers. This influx has helped Aruba maintain its international competitiveness.
Following the rebound in tourism, the deficit in the non-oil current account balance has begun to
narrow again, coming in at 6 percent of GDP in the year ending in June 2007. The deficit had
widened sharply to over 13 percent of GDP in 2006, as a result of declining tourism revenue,
increasing workers’ remittances, and strong investment activity. Capital inflows have increased
sharply as a result of increased investment activity. Foreign direct investment inflows more than
doubled in 2006, reaching 13½ percent of GDP, though preliminary estimates indicate a
slowdown in inflows in the first half of 2007.
The authorities have tightened macroeconomic policies to stem the rise in public debt and
maintain a sufficient level of foreign exchange reserves. After a jump to an unusually large fiscal
deficit (including losses of the general health insurance, AZV) of 8½ percent of GDP in 2004,
the deficit narrowed to 2½ percent of GDP in 2006. The 2007 central government budget
envisioned a further decline to 1½ percent of GDP but, because of renewed financial problems
at the AZV, staff estimates a fiscal deficit of 2 percent of GDP in 2007. The monetary authorities
have tightened credit ceilings and reserve requirements of commercial banks, contributing to a
slowdown in the growth of real money balances.
Staff estimates real GDP to have expanded by about 2 percent in 2007 and to continue at this
pace in 2008. The recovery in the tourist sector, together with continued robust investment,
stands to be a key engine of growth in the near term. Average inflation is projected to ease from
slightly more than 6 percent in 2007 to just below 4 percent in 2008 as the impact of the one-off
supply shocks gradually dissipates. The deficit in the non-oil current account is projected to
decline to about 8 percent of GDP in 2007 and 6¾ percent of GDP in 2008. The main risks to
the outlook are a more pronounced and protracted slowdown in the U.S. economy and a further
increase in oil prices. It is also possible that the full impact on inflation of the turnover tax will
take longer to materialize, which, together with further increases in the oil price and signs of
tightness in the labor market, could provide additional impetus to inflation.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities’ promotion of an open economy and continued
pursuit of market-friendly policies, which have fostered economic growth and stability. Directors
noted that the outlook remains broadly favorable, although, given the heavy dependence on
tourism and increasing public debt, the economy remains vulnerable to external shocks.
Reducing this vulnerability will hinge on maintaining sustainable public finances and boosting
economic growth.
Directors considered that, in the near term, maintaining macroeconomic stability will require
further fiscal consolidation and an appropriately tight monetary policy. In order to meet this
objective, they recommended prompt action to address the renewed financial problems of the
general health insurance and, if needed, offsetting savings in current expenditure.

3
Directors supported the authorities’ intention to keep monetary policy on hold until there are
clear signs that inflationary pressures are abating. They welcomed plans to eliminate the credit
ceilings and gradually increase the use of indirect monetary instruments.
Directors agreed that the peg of the florin to the U.S. dollar has served Aruba well and provides
an effective nominal anchor. They considered the current exchange rate to be at a competitive
level. Directors urged the authorities to eliminate the tax on foreign exchange transactions,
which detracts from the investment climate and constitutes an unapproved exchange restriction
under Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ plan for medium-term fiscal consolidation, and noted that
additional measures to lower the growth of personnel costs and strengthen spending controls
over goods and services would help achieve this objective. They observed that encouraging
progress has been made in reforming the civil service pension fund, and underscored the
importance of ensuring the financial soundness of the universal pay-as-you-go pension system
in the face of rapid population ageing.
Directors welcomed improvements in Aruba’s policy frameworks and public institutions, and
encouraged the authorities to strengthen them further, including by advancing plans for
increasing fiscal discipline through changing the budget law, improving fiscal management, and
enhancing the fiscal framework. Recognizing that, in practice, the central bank enjoys a high
degree of operational independence, Directors, nonetheless, viewed that formally establishing
this principle in the central bank law would safeguard against undue interference. They noted
that improving Aruba’s statistical base would support more effective policymaking.
Directors looked forward to the development of a sustainable growth strategy and further
improvements in the environment for private investment and diversification. In this regard, they
welcomed recent tax reforms, and underscored the value of further simplification and greater
reliance on indirect taxes.
Directors considered the financial system to be generally sound. They noted that the large
exposure of commercial banks to the tourist sector warrants continued supervisory vigilance,
and recommended that the central bank consider employing stress tests to gain additional
insight in the banking sector’s capacity to withstand large shocks.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Age Bakker, Executive Director
for the Kingdom of the Netherlands—Aruba
February 8, 2008
I thank staff for their valuable work and subscribe to the main conclusions of the report.
Since the last Article IV mission in 2005, Aruba went through a difficult time as a
consequence of a decline in tourism. However, a pick-up in tourist arrivals during 2007
and continued sound macroeconomic policies put the Aruban economy firmly back on
the upward trend witnessed over the past 20 years. Due to the progress made over this
period, Aruba has achieved a relatively high standard of living, a remarkable achievement
given the challenges small open island economies typically face. While some short-term
risks may arise from the slowdown of the U.S. economy, the solid economic
fundamentals give reason for an optimistic medium-term outlook.
Fiscal policy
Staff rightly point out that the main challenge for Aruba lies on the fiscal front. Good
progress has been made here in the past few years, with net lending on a declining path
since 2004. The government is committed to further progress.
As regards the revenue side, a new turnover tax was introduced on January 1, 2007,
which supported an increase in total government revenues of 3.8 percent in the first nine
months of 2007. Staff point at the need to move away from direct taxation towards
indirect consumption-based taxes given the mobility of capital and skilled labor, which
certainly for a small and open economy as Aruba implies risks for government revenues.
In fact, the shift towards indirect taxation is taking place. The introduction of the new
turnover tax led to an increase of tax revenue on commodities by 4.8 percent in the first
nine months of 2007, while the revenues from direct taxation decreased as a consequence
of reductions in the wage tax rate and the corporate income tax rate.
Staff make three further concrete recommendations affecting government revenue (page
13). Concerning the recommendations on the rationalization of import duties and the
reduction of income tax rates, the authorities tend to take these up as part of their midterm policy objectives. The first priority in tax policy lies in assessing the full impact of
the introduction of the turnover tax as well as an organizational restructuring of the tax
department. Prudence requires to first reaching a period of relative calm in the tax
administration before heading into the next phase of reform. At the same time, the
changes in the foreign exchange taxation regime suggested by staff can be implemented
at an earlier date as proposals have already been designed, which now have to be
followed by a more detailed assessment of their fiscal impact and by translation into
legislation to be submitted to Parliament.

2
The authorities are currently taking remedial measures to address the revenue shortfalls
and expenditure overruns in the general health insurance (AZV) with the aim of closing
the deficit by the end of 2008. Already before the identification of the AZV-deficit at the
end of 2007, contingency plans had been drafted in order to deal with a hypothetical
situation of deficit. The plans include the introduction of co-payments by the insured and
a limitation of services provided, the latter being supported by the creation of possibilities
for private sector parties to provide additional health insurance packages. These
additional packages are targeted at health care for which the private sector is better suited
to calculate the risks involved. Moreover, as a first immediate step, an increase in the
government's contribution to the scheme has been effectuated amounting to 0.2% of
GDP. Through expenditure cuts elsewhere in the budget the effects on the budget
envelope have been limited.
The authorities realize well that further measures may be needed to address the mediumand long-term budgetary costs of an ageing population. In 2005, an initial reform of the
civil servant pension fund has taken place, and this year reforms aiming at a further
improvement of the coverage ratio to fully match future obligations are expected to be
implemented. The authorities are aware that the public pay-as-you-go system should be
reformed next. To contribute to the long-term sustainability of public finances, they also
plan to balance the budget in 2009 and intend to bring the debt ratio below 40%. The
latter will also help to create a safety buffer for dealing with external shocks and this
buffer build-up is planned to be supplemented with a debt restructuring plan.
As the economic literature shows, strong budgetary institutions are a necessary condition
for lasting budgetary consolidation and Aruba is making further progress on this front. A
medium-term plan has been included in the budget and significant changes to the budget
law will be implemented during the course of 2008. The reform initiatives aim for
improved transparency in the budgetary process, among other things through the
improvement of periodical reporting requirements regarding the budget execution.
Moreover, the ability for the government to set numerical norms and enforce the fiscal
envelopes in the medium term is ready to be introduced. The medium-term budgetary
framework will include nominal expenditure ceilings which will be derived from revenue
developments based on the economic growth assumptions, and which will target a
decreasing deficit-to-GDP ratio.
Monetary policy and financial sector
The main objective of the CBA’s policies is to maintain relative price stability with the
peg of the Aruban florin to the U.S. dollar as the key target in this regard. The Bank will
therefore remain vigilant in monitoring foreign exchange flows and the net foreign
exchange position of financial institutions to ensure that the level of international reserves
remains appropriate. Official reserves at the end of the third quarter 2007 stood slightly
below the 2006-level with an import coverage ratio of 3 months. Following the recovery

3
of tourism, the non-oil current account improved sharply to -6 percent of GDP with the
total current account registering a surplus.
During the last months of 2007, inflationary pressures have noticeably increased, which
resulted in an inflation figure of 6.0 in 2007, the highest since 1994. To avoid a negative
impact on the competitiveness of the island and to keep inflation expectations anchored,
the central bank (CBA) has decided to put a ceiling on credit growth of 5% for 2008.
Should there not be any comforting signs that inflation fades in the first months of this
year, the Bank will take corrective measures to mop up excess liquidity and to curtail
commercial lending below the ceiling, as has already been communicated to the banking
sector.
Concerning the monetary policy framework, the authorities are working hard on further
improvements. In 2007, a new President for the CBA has been appointed and the
authorities wish to thank the IMF for their help in the selection process. Furthermore, the
Bank started working towards further refinements in the policy framework, in line with
staff’s recommendations. 2008 will be a transition period, in which the reliance on more
market-orientated indirect monetary instruments will be gradually increased, entailing
initially cash reserve and liquidity requirements. By the end of the year credit ceilings are
expected to be abolished.
The use of more market-orientated instruments should help to advance competition
within the banking sector. The Aruban financial sector can be characterized as stable with
profit margins on the high side. Nevertheless, the exposure of the banks to the tourist
sector warrants special attention, especially in light of the slowdown of the US economy.
While a negative impact on tourist arrivals cannot be excluded, the most recent figures
based on preliminary bookings for the first quarter of 2008 do so far not point at a
slowdown. To further improve the resilience of the sector, the CBA has increased the
risk-weighted capital ratio from 10 to 12 percent in 2007. The international financial
market turmoil has so far not affected the Aruban financial sector significantly, but the
Bank remains vigilant in monitoring the situation and stands ready to take measures if
need may be.
