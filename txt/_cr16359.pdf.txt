IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with Mexico
On November 16, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with Mexico.
Mexico has navigated successfully a complex external environment, characterized by heightened
global financial market volatility. The economy continues to grow at a moderate pace and
inflation is close to the target. The flexible exchange rate is playing a central role in helping the
economy adjust to external shocks. Macroeconomic policies remain focused on maintaining
strong fundamentals. Continued implementation of the structural reforms agenda should help lift
potential growth over the medium term.
The economy is projected to grow by 2.1 percent in 2016. The main driver of activity remained
private consumption, supported by a rise in remittances and improving labor market conditions.
Weakness on U.S. industrial activity led to lower demand for Mexico’s manufacturing exports,
and a slowdown of investment in machinery and equipment. Growth is expected to remain at a
similar level in 2017, supported by strengthening external demand. Year-on-year headline and
core inflation are close the 3-percent target. There is no evidence of second-round effects from
the exchange rate depreciation and medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.
The stance of macroeconomic policies has turned more restrictive. Since last November, the
Bank of Mexico increased the monetary policy rate by cumulative 175 basis points to 4.75
percent. The public sector fiscal deficit will be reduced from 4.1 percent of GDP in 2015 to
3 percent of GDP this year. The authorities are taking measures to strengthen PEMEX’s financial
position through sizable permanent expenditure cuts, a reform of its pension scheme, and
financial assistance from the federal government.
The external sector position remains broadly consistent with medium-term fundamentals and
desirable policy settings. The current account deficit is projected to remain unchanged at about 3
percent of GDP in 2016, as the reduction in the hydrocarbons trade balance has been offset by

stronger remittances and net service exports. The net international investment liability position is
sustainable and foreign exchange reserves remain adequate.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors noted that Mexico continues to grow at a moderate pace despite a
challenging external environment. However, the country remains exposed to external
shocks, including risks of growing protectionism, given its strong financial and trade
linkages with the rest of the world. Directors expressed confidence that Mexico’s strong
fundamentals and policy frameworks will continue to underpin the economy’s resilience,
but urged vigilance to potential shocks. They noted that the Flexible Credit Line
arrangement with the Fund provides additional insurance against tail risks. Continued
implementation of the structural reform agenda and further progress in improving security
and the rule of law should help lift potential growth in the medium term.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to continued fiscal consolidation.
They emphasized that adhering to the planned fiscal consolidation is critical in order to bring
the ratio of public debt to GDP on a downward path. They welcomed the ongoing efforts to
strengthen the financial viability of the petroleum company (PEMEX), which is an important
element of the consolidation plan. They generally urged the authorities to take advantage of
revenue windfalls, including any future transfers of surplus from the Bank of Mexico, to reduce
the public sector borrowing requirement below target. They also encouraged elimination of
electricity subsidies while protecting vulnerable households through targeted social assistance
programs.
Directors recommended that the authorities consider boosting fiscal revenues in the medium
term to avoid constraining capital spending excessively. Raising pension contributions under
the defined-contribution system would help ensure adequate pension replacement rates and
diminish pressures on public social spending in the future. Directors also encouraged the
authorities to further strengthen the fiscal framework, including improving the link between
desirable levels of public debt and medium-term fiscal deficit targets, and reducing discretion
under the exceptional circumstances clause.
Directors agreed that future monetary policy decisions should remain data-driven and urged the
authorities to be vigilant. Clear communication by the central bank will remain important in
guiding market expectations. Directors emphasized that the flexible exchange rate should
continue to act as the key shock absorber to help the economy adjust to external shocks.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Directors welcomed the conclusion of the 2016 Financial Sector Assessment Program that the
balance sheets of financial and non-financial corporations are resilient to adverse shocks. They
noted that enhancing some elements of the crisis-preparedness and deposit insurance frameworks
would ensure an agile and well-coordinated response in times of stress. Strengthening the
independence of the supervisory agencies would also be important. Directors welcomed the staff
clarification that decisions of the Financial Stability Council (CESF) have not been hampered by
political considerations and encouraged the authorities to maintain their efforts in this regard.
Some Directors noted that the appropriate structure and governance of the regulatory and
supervisory framework depends on each country’s circumstances and that there is no one-sizefits-all model.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ progress on structural reforms. They encouraged continued
efforts to reduce poverty and inequality, increase female labor force participation, and enhance
access to financial services. They supported efforts to improve the efficiency of social spending,
increase access to child-care services, and better enforce anti-discrimination laws in the labor
market. They looked forward to the implementation of the new national strategy for financial
inclusion to improve access to financial services for low-income households and small
enterprises. They also recommended continued efforts to tackle corruption and strengthen the
anti-money laundering framework.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
November 4, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Outlook and Risks: Mexico is confronting a complex external environment characterized
by heightened risk of trade protectionism and financial markets volatility. Real GDP
growth is projected to moderate to 2.1 percent in 2016, with inflation remaining close to
the 3-percent target. Looking ahead, the expected recovery in external demand and
investment should support economic activity. The main risks include a rise in global
protectionist tendencies, weaker-than-projected growth in the United States, renewed
surge in capital flow volatility, and further decline in domestic oil production.
Macroeconomic Policies: Policies and policy frameworks remain very strong. It is critical
to continue adhering to the fiscal consolidation plan to maintain market confidence and
put the public debt-to-GDP ratio on a downward path. To achieve this goal, the
government has to control effectively the growth of public spending and save one-off
revenues. Turning PEMEX into a profitable company through a focus on improving the
efficiency of core business activities should remain a critical element of the consolidation
plan. A pause in monetary policy tightening appears warranted in the near term, given
the moderation in economic activity, absence of second-round effects from the
depreciation, and limited wage pressures. On the structural front, strengthening the rule
of law and raising female labor force participation would help boost potential output
and reduce inequality.
Financial System Stability Assessment: The 2016 FSAP recommended strengthening
consolidated supervision and the governance of the financial supervisory agencies and
the deposit insurance institute. Developing formal contingency plans and simulation
exercises will help enhance the crisis preparedness framework. Quantitative credit
targets for development banks should be eliminated, and performance should be based
in part on indicators of financial inclusion and private sector crowding in.
Advice from previous Article IV Consultations: Consistent with past Fund advice, the
authorities maintained their commitment to the fiscal consolidation path over 2015–18.
In 2016, they started liberalizing fixed fuel prices, with implied excises near the optimal
carbon tax levels proposed by staff. The authorities also discontinued rules-based
foreign exchange interventions in favor of discretionary intervention, in line with staff
advice.

CONTEXT
1.
Mexico continues to navigate a complex external environment. The exchange rate has
been affected by heightened risks of a rise in protectionism in major trading partners. In the context
of elevated external risks, policies in Mexico remain focused on maintaining strong fundamentals
and financial stability. The flexible exchange rate continues to play a key role in facilitating
adjustment to external shocks. The authorities remain committed to a gradual reduction in the
public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR). Financial and non-financial companies’ sector balance
sheets are resilient to downside risks, in part due to strong financial sector supervision and
regulation.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
2.
Mexico’s economy is growing at a moderate pace. Real GDP growth is projected to slow
to 2.1 percent in 2016 (from 2.5 percent in 2015). The main driver of activity over the past year has
been private consumption, supported by a rise in remittances, robust employment and real wage
growth, as well as a pick-up in household credit growth. The labor market remained strong, with
steady job creation in services and residential construction. However, weakness in U.S. industrial
activity led to lower demand for Mexico’s manufacturing exports, and a slowdown of investment in
equipment and machinery in the first half of 2016. On the supply side, the strong performance of
the service sector offset the fall in oil extraction and the moderation of manufacturing production
(Figure 1). Year-on-year headline and core inflation are now close to the 3-percent target, up from a
historical low of 2.1 percent in 2015, with no evidence of second-round effects from the exchange
rate depreciation (Box 1).1 Services inflation has been broadly stable and medium-term inflation
expectations remain well anchored (Figure 2).

Asset prices in Mexico have been affected by the heightened volatility in global
financial markets and uncertainties related to the risk of rising protectionism. As of endSeptember, the peso had depreciated by about 25 percent vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar over the 2015
average. Foreign exchange implied volatility and bid-ask spreads have also increased. Net portfolio
inflows into Mexico turned negative in the second quarter as non-resident investment in short-term
government securities declined. More recently, Mexico has benefitted from the strong recovery of
capital flows in emerging markets, although the exchange rate remains volatile. The yields on localcurrency long-term government bonds have remained broadly stable, and Mexico continues to
place sovereign and corporate bonds in international capital markets at low interest rates (Figure 3).2

Development bank credit continued to
grow at a rapid pace, expanding by 19 percent in the twelve months through August 2016. Overall
credit expansion (including bond financing) is broadly consistent with trend financial deepening.
5.
Private sector balance sheets remain relatively strong. Total private corporate debt is low
at about 25 percent of GDP, and foreign currency exposure is largely hedged through natural and
financial hedges. In addition, corporations maintain strong liquidity buffers and have long average
debt maturities (Figure 8). Only 15 percent of total debt matures over the next five years. Measures
taken by the authorities to support PEMEX have reduced balance-sheet stress for the oil company’s
suppliers.5 Households also have very low debt, and hold significant financial and non-financial
assets. Bank are well capitalized, and have high liquidity ratios and low NPLs. The balance sheets of
other financial institutions (insurance, mutual funds, and pension funds) are also healthy.

See the selected issues paper for an analysis of the transmission of policy rates to lending and deposit rates.

4 The apparent rapid pace of credit growth reflects trend financial deepening, starting from a very low level of bank
intermediation (see the 2015 Article IV Selected Issues Paper). The ratio of bank lending to the non-financial private
sector to GDP has been growing steadily, from 13.2 percent in 2010 to 17.5 percent in 2016.

Actions to support PEMEX’s suppliers included extension of MXN 15 billion (0.1 percent of GDP) in development
bank loans to pay outstanding debt to small suppliers, direct financial support to PEMEX (used to reduce liabilities to
large suppliers), and exempting banks in five oil-rich states from classifying restructured loans as NPLs for twelve
months (until the end of 2016).

Box 1. Exchange Rate Pass-through Estimates
Estimates of the exchange rate pass-through to headline consumer prices for Mexico show no
evidence of second-round effects. The estimation was based on monthly data over 2000-15, using as
explanatory variables the import-weighted nominal effective exchange rate, international oil and food prices,
production costs in trading partners, and the output gap.1 If absence of second-round effects, the passthrough should be close to the import content of household consumption since the response of inflation to
a currency depreciation would only reflect the relative-price adjustment between tradable and non-tradable
goods and services.
The pass-through in Mexico is low owing to a low import content of consumption and well-anchored
inflation expectations. The 2-year cumulative pass-through from nominal effective exchange rate
depreciation to headline consumer prices is about 7 percent, slightly below the import content of
consumption. In a cross-country comparison, countries with better anchored expectations—and hence with
more credible central banks—have empirical estimates of pass-through that are close or even below the
import content of consumption, suggesting an absence of second-round effects.

A temporary increase in inflation due to the exchange rate depreciation would not necessarily
warrant a policy response. Even with a low exchange rate pass-through coefficient, a large depreciation
would lead to an increase in inflation due to the relative price adjustment between tradable and nontradable goods and services. However, with well-anchored medium-term inflation expectations, such an
increase in inflation is likely to be temporary. Credible central banks may have space to allow the price
adjustments to take place without an aggressive response to the increase in inflation.

others, 2016, “Monetary Policy Credibility and Exchange Rate Pass-through.”

6.
The external sector position remains broadly consistent with medium-term
fundamentals and desirable policy settings. The current account deficit is projected to remain
unchanged at about 3 percent of GDP in 2016, as the reduction in the hydrocarbons trade balance
has been offset by stronger remittances and net service exports. The cyclically-adjusted current
account deficit is broadly in line with fundamentals and desirable policy settings (Annex II). In real
effective terms, the peso has depreciated by about 12 percent in 2016 relative to its 2015 average,
reflecting lower oil production and exports, weaker domestic growth prospects, further deterioration
in the terms of trade, and increased uncertainty related to rising protectionism risks. In the staff’s

The stance of macroeconomic policies has tightened. The Bank of Mexico increased its

once since then.7 The authorities project that
the headline fiscal deficit (PSBR) will narrow to 3 percent of GDP in 2016 (compared with an original
PSBR target of 3.5 percent), helped by a one-off transfer of Bank of Mexico’s surplus (amounting to
1.2 percent of GDP) to the federal government.8 Excluding the Bank of Mexico transfer, revenues are
projected to be broadly on target, with the decline in oil income offset by stronger-than-expected
VAT, income, and excise tax revenues and the oil-price hedge. The structural primary deficit is
projected to improve by about ¾ percentage points of GDP.

This judgement is consistent with the overall results from the external balance assessment, which finds that the
current account deficit is close to the norm (0.8 percentage points of GDP wider than the norm, see text chart), and
the real effective exchange rate level approach, which shows a small undervaluation of 11.5 percent.

Mexico had two rules-based intervention schemes in place in 2015: preannounced daily auctions of U.S dollars and
additional auctions when the daily exchange rate depreciation exceeded a certain threshold. The first scheme was
suspended on November 19, 2015, and the second was discontinued on February 17, 2016. Discretionary
intervention was used only on one occasion in February.

The central bank law requires the Bank of Mexico to transfer to the federal government its surplus (including from
exchange rate valuation gains) after increasing its capital sufficiently to ensure that it grows at least at the projected
growth rate of nominal GDP. When the profits are from unrealized asset price gains (such as unrealized gains on FX
reserves), the Bank of Mexico Board has discretion to increase its capital by more than that. The Bank of Mexico is not
consolidated in the public sector fiscal accounts, so these one-off transfers affect the headline fiscal deficit.

PEMEX is adapting to the new reality of persistently lower oil prices. The company’s
balance sheet has been affected by a decline in oil production and prices, resulting in a significant
increase in its outstanding debt to suppliers (Box 2). The rating agency Moody’s downgraded
PEMEX’s debt to the lowest investment grade level (Baa3) in early 2016.9 A new management team
was appointed in February and several measures to strengthen the finances of the state-owned oil
producer have been taken in the course of this year. The Federal Government provided financial
assistance to PEMEX to improve its liquidity. PEMEX announced permanent expenditure cuts of
about 20 percent of its budget in early 2016. The company also restructured its pension scheme,
generating savings of 1 percentage point of GDP in net present value terms.10 In addition, the
federal government assumed a fraction of PEMEX’s pension liabilities in an amount equal to the
savings from the reform.
9.
Implementation of the key structural reforms is broadly on track. On the energy front,
auctions of oil fields and electricity permits for generation are proceeding as planned (the first two
auctions for electricity permits are expected to lead to an increase of electricity generation capacity
of 10 percent). Three rounds of auctions of oil contracts have been completed successfully. The next
milestones are the auctions for deep water oil fields and for PEMEX’s first joint venture, scheduled to
take place in December. Some positive results from the reforms are already visible. Private
investment in natural gas pipelines, electricity generation, and telecommunications has picked up,
and the financial reform has helped spur competition in the banking sector. Increased competition
in telecommunication services has led to a significant reduction in prices. The education reform is
also in the process of implementation, although it has faced resistance in some states.
10.
The authorities are taking steps to improve the rule of law. A 2015 constitutional reform
created a new National Anticorruption System, the main goal of which is improved coordination
among the relevant authorities in the prevention, detection, and penalization of acts of corruption.
Secondary legislation, promulgated in July 2016, included financial disclosure requirements for
recipients of public funds, creation of a specialized federal court for corruption cases, and stricter
penalties and statutes of limitations.

PEMEX’s woes have also affected the assessment of the sovereign credit. In March, Moody’s revised the outlook for
Mexico’s sovereign credit rating from stable to negative, citing subdued economic growth, continued external
headwinds, and the deterioration in PEMEX’s finances. The current sovereign credit rating by Moody’s is A3 (one
notch above the BBB+ rating of S&P and Fitch). In August, S&P also changed the outlook for Mexico from stable to
negative, while reaffirming its BBB+ rating.
9

The state-owned electricity company (CFE) also reformed its pension scheme this year. The estimated savings from
this reform are 0.8 percent of GDP in net present value terms. Similar to the arrangement with PEMEX, the federal
government will assume a fraction of pension liabilities equal to the amount of savings from the reform.

Box 2. Pemex: Key Reforms and Recent Developments
Declining oil production and prices have affected PEMEX’s liquidity and profitability in 2015 and
early 2016. PEMEX’s equity shrank by 7 percent of GDP between 2013 and 2016Q1 due to rising losses. Its
market debt increased from 5 percent of GDP to around 9 percent of GDP over the same period. Moreover,
the company accumulated significant debt to suppliers: 0.9 percent of GDP as of end-2015, up from an
average of 0.4 percent of GDP over 2009-12. In addition, PEMEX had significant unfunded pension liabilities
(8½ percent of GDP as of June 2015). Similar to other oil producers, PEMEX had to undertake an adjustment
to return to profitability. The federal government provided financial support to the company in 2016 to ease
the immediate liquidity problems, while PEMEX restructured its pension scheme and announced permanent
expenditure adjustments.
Federal government support. In April, the
authorities announced a capital injection, liquidity
support, and a reduction of the fiscal burden on
PEMEX. Altogether, these measures amounted to 0.6
percent of GDP. Pemex announced in June that it had
settled 0.5 percent of GDP of debt to suppliers.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
11.
Real GDP growth is projected to remain moderate at around 2¼ percent in 2017. The
baseline projections are predicated on a continued steady recovery of the U.S. economy. The impact
of tighter domestic macroeconomic policies on Mexico’s growth is expected to be offset by a boost
to manufacturing production and exports due to stronger U.S. industrial production, the
depreciation of the peso, and lower electricity prices.11 Machinery and equipment investment and
export-related services are also expected to firm up in line with the recovery in external demand.
Strong labor market conditions and robust credit growth will continue to underpin private
consumption. Staff projections are within the authorities’ projected range for 2017 growth of 23 percent.
12.
Financing conditions are expected to remain supportive in the baseline scenario.
Commercial banks can support continued credit expansion as they remain well capitalized, liquid,
and profitable. Banks’ capital adequacy ratio stood at 15 percent, among the highest in emerging
markets, and non-performing loans are low. The financial reform has led to greater competition
among banks and lower interest rates in some sectors (such as mortgages), although there is room
to strengthen competition further. In the baseline, the overall nominal credit growth is projected to
remain healthy at around 12 percent in the medium term, reflecting trend financial deepening and
strong credit demand. Global financial conditions have eased in recent months and corporations
have been able to continue to issue FX
bonds at relatively low interest rates.
13.
In the baseline, export growth
is projected to recover in line with the
recovery of manufacturing production
in the United States. Historically, exports
have been a key growth engine for the
economy, with strong spillovers to
domestic demand. Due to Mexico’s
integration in the North-American
manufacturing value chain, the slowdown
of global trade could have affected
Mexico’s non-oil exports over the last
year.12 The depreciation of the peso
The macroeconomic effects of fiscal policy tightening should be manageable with output close to potential and
low energy prices (staff estimates the fiscal multiplier to be about 0.7 when the output gap at its current level). A 1percent decline in electricity costs, a 1-percent increase in U.S. industrial production, and a 1-percent depreciation of
the currency in real effective terms lead to an increase in manufacturing output in Mexico by 0.3 percent, 0.5 percent,
and 0.3 percent respectively within one year (Alvarez and Valencia, IMF working paper 2015).
11

Analysis presented in Bank of Mexico’s August 2016 Inflation Report suggests that Mexico’s non-auto
manufacturing exports to the U.S. are affected not only by U.S. domestic demand but also by the performance of U.S.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

MEXICO

should help boost exports, but the effects could take some time to materialize as it takes time to put
in place new production capacity. There are substantial risks around the projected recovery in
exports, related to increased protectionism. If export performance remains weak, it is likely to have
negative spillovers to domestic demand.
14.
Inflation is projected to converge to the 3-percent target by end-2018. Rising fuel
prices, in the context of a gradual liberalization of domestic fuel markets, and continued passthrough from the depreciation of the currency are expected to push consumer prices temporarily
above the target in the near term. However, inflation is expected to converge to the target by end2018 as the effects of these factors taper off. A faster-than-expected dissipation of slack in the
economy or a rebound in food prices could lead to a larger overshooting of the inflation target. On
the downside, a slower economic growth or further decreases in telecom services prices would put
downward pressure on inflation.
15.
Growth is projected to strengthen in the medium term due to the positive effect of
structural reforms. The implementation of structural reforms in the areas of energy, education,
labor markets, competition, telecommunications, and the financial sector is projected to boost
growth by about ½ percentage point over the medium term through higher investment,
productivity, and improved access to finance. 13 As private investment related to the reforms
accelerates, the current account deficit could remain elevated, but should decline gradually in the
longer term as oil production and exports increase.
16.
There was agreement between staff and the authorities that there are substantial risks
around the baseline growth projections.


Rise in protectionism. In the near term, uncertainty about the likelihood of increased barriers to
trade and financial flows is likely to cause a delay in investment projects. A materialization of this
risk could have a major impact on Mexico: exports, FDI in the manufacturing sector, and
portfolio inflows could decline, with a negative impact on growth (see Annex 1).



Weaker-than-expected global growth, and particularly U.S. growth. Mexico’s outlook is heavily
influenced by U.S. growth prospects given the close ties between the two economies. The
persistent appreciation of the dollar and weak global demand pose downside risks to the
recovery of manufacturing production in the United States.



Renewed volatility in global financial markets. Capital flows to emerging markets have
rebounded in recent months. However, the risk of sharp reversals remains elevated. Renewed

non-auto manufacturing exports, probably due to integration through the North-American production value chain.
Therefore, weak global demand and the strong dollar could have an indirect negative impact on Mexico’s exports to
the U.S., reducing the positive effects of a weaker peso on export demand.
The medium-term growth projections have been revised down by ½ percentage point since the last Article IV
consultation in line with the downward revisions in domestic oil production and medium-term growth in the US.
13

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MEXICO

concerns about a greater-than-expected slowdown in China or other large economies could also
lead to a pullback of capital from emerging markets, including Mexico.14


A lower-than-expected path for oil prices or domestic oil production. A slower-than-expected
reversal of global supply factors could lead to persistently lower oil prices. A materialization of
this risk would increase the fiscal consolidation burden and discourage private investment in the
oil sector. Further declines in PEMEX’s oil production is an important domestic risk.



On the upside, a dissipation of the risk of increased protectionism, a stronger recovery in U.S.
manufacturing activity, or a faster-than-expected recovery in oil prices could lead to a rebound
in exports and stronger growth.15

KEY POLICY ISSUES
A. Fiscal Policy
17.
The mission welcomed the authorities’ commitment to continued fiscal consolidation,
which is critical to reduce the ratio of public debt to GDP. Staff’s debt sustainability analysis
suggests that public debt is sustainable over the medium term (see Annex III). However, gross public
debt reached 54 percent of GDP in 2015 (up from 42 percent in 2010). The steady increase in public
debt has prompted some rating agencies to place Mexico on a negative watch. The authorities’ plan
to reduce the PSBR to 2½ percent of GDP by 2018 would set the public debt-to-GDP ratio on a
downward path (Table 2 and DSA annex). Staff and the authorities agreed that continued adherence
to the multi-year consolidation path will be important to maintain market confidence in an
environment of high financial markets volatility. Staff also noted that setting a more ambitious fiscal
deficit target beyond 2018 would help bring public debt down faster, which would prepare the
country to deal better with long-term demographics-related fiscal pressures. Mexico has limited
fiscal space to respond to adverse external shocks given its relatively high debt level, rising social
security spending, a negative watch by credit rating agencies, and likely pressures on funding costs
in case of materialization of tail risks.
18.
In that context, staff urged the authorities to use positive revenue surprises to reduce
the PSBR below the target. Tax revenue has repeatedly surprised on the upside in recent years,
increasing the space for discretionary spending in some cases. The Bank of Mexico surplus transfer is
a more recent example of a positive revenue surprise, which should be saved. Part of the space
created by the transfer (0.4 percent of GDP) was used to reduce the obligations of PEMEX to
suppliers to normal levels. Based on the latest projections by the authorities, the overall fiscal deficit

Staff analysis presented in a Selected Issues Paper shows that Mexico is particularly sensitive to shocks to
emerging market capital flows.
14

Growth in non-oil export so far in 2016 has been smaller than suggested by historical elasticities. Based on staff
analysis, 10 percent depreciation of the real effective exchange rate boosts export volumes by 2–3 percent over the
medium term.
15

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

MEXICO

in 2016 will improve by ½ percentage point of GDP relative to the original target, implying that part
of the windfall will be used to relax the overall budget spending limit. Staff recommended adhering
to the budget for overall spending during the remainder of 2016, and using the remaining portion
of the transfer (0.3 percent of GDP) to further reduce the 2016 PSBR. This would be consistent with
the Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL), according to which public savings should increase by the full
amount of the transfer. It would also ease the adjustment necessary to achieve the fiscal target in
2017 and help maintain investors’ trust in the credibility of fiscal commitments. Any additional profit
transfer from the Bank of Mexico in 2017 should be used in its entirety for a net reduction of the
PSBR. The authorities noted that a large fraction of the 2016 transfer is already being saved for the
first time in history, and explained that the rest of the windfall was being used to meet an
unanticipated increase in non-discretionary spending (PEMEX support, interest and pension
payments, and tax revenue sharing with local governments). They stated that they will follow the FRL
regarding the use of future transfers of surplus from the Bank of Mexico, if any.
19.
The 2017 budget envisages a further reduction of the fiscal deficit to 2.9 percent of
GDP, which is in line with the medium-term consolidation path. The consolidation will be
achieved through an ambitious rationalization of expenditure, since overall revenue in percent of
GDP is projected to decline in 2017 due to lower oil income and one-off revenues. PEMEX accounts
for a large share of the projected decline in public capital spending, and will rely increasingly on
production and exploration partnerships with private companies to maintain production levels. More
generally, public-private partnerships are envisaged to play a greater role going forward, especially
in infrastructure development. This strategy is expected to offset in part the effects of the
compression in capital spending envisaged in the fiscal consolidation plan. Staff noted that further
revenue measures could be considered in the medium term to avoid constraining capital spending
excessively. 16 The authorities explained that the current administration had committed to not raising
taxes further to allow the economy to adjust to the 2013 tax reform.
20.
Staff suggested that the current low energy prices present an opportunity to eliminate
the non-targeted electricity subsidies, estimated at about ¼ percent of GDP. Low-income
households could be compensated through well-targeted cash transfers. The authorities noted that
the ongoing restructuring of the state-owned electricity company (CFE) will allow a more precise
measurement of the subsidies and an assessment of the possibility to make them more targeted.
Staff supported the proposed further liberalization of gasoline prices, which will allow them to move

fully in line with international prices.17 There was agreement that it would be useful to evaluate the
benefits and costs of expanding the hedging program to cover oil-price risk from domestic sales.18
21.
Turning PEMEX into a profitable and efficient company would be critical to maintain
market confidence. Staff and the authorities agreed that it is important to present a multi-year
business plan, focused on improving efficiency, strengthening core business activities, and
divestment of non-core assets and subsidiaries. The board of PEMEX recently approved a business
plan which will be made public in the coming weeks. The energy reform increased the autonomy of
PEMEX, allowing it to enter into joint ventures with the private sector and shift resources toward
more profitable activities. The first auction for a joint venture with the private sector in deep water
exploration and production will take place in December, and a second joint venture for shallow
water production will be auctioned in March 2017. Additional joint ventures in refining activities and
onshore fields are expected to be part of the business plan.
22.
Staff welcomed the approval of a fiscal responsibility law for state and local
governments. The law strengthens data reporting requirements and is expected to impose greater
fiscal discipline at the state and municipal levels. Staff noted that regulations supporting the
implementation of the law have to be issued in a timely manner. Continued capacity building at the
state and municipal level (including auditing capacity), together with consistent enforcement, are
crucial for effective implementation.
23.
As discussed in the 2015 Article IV, further enhancements of the fiscal framework
would strengthen its credibility. Staff reiterated its recommendation to create a non-partisan fiscal
council with a formal mandate to provide an independent expert evaluation of fiscal policy and
compliance with the FRL. Staff also noted that it is desirable to have a tighter link between the
desired level of public debt and PSBR targets. The use of the exceptional circumstances clauses
should be limited to cases of large output or oil price shocks to constrain discretion. The fiscal
framework needs to have explicit rules to bring the PSBR to the medium-term target after an
exceptional circumstance clause is invoked. The authorities responded that, in their view, the best
way to maintain credibility is to deliver consistently on fiscal commitments. Starting in mid-2016,
they will publish quarterly updates of the forecast for key fiscal indicators for the current year, which
should increase transparency.
24.
Population aging will put additional pressure on fiscal spending in the long term. The
ongoing shift from a defined-benefit to a defined-contribution pension system will reduce fiscal
liabilities over the long term. However, in the transition period, the public pension deficit will
increase until about 2040, before gradually coming down (Box 3). Health spending will put

In 2015, the authorities introduced a price band of -/+3 percent for gasoline and diesel, as a first step toward a
liberalization of the domestic fuel markets. The budget proposes a full liberalization of oil prices starting in January
2017, with some remaining restrictions on charges for transportation costs to be phased out over the next two years.
17

Staff analysis in a Selected Issues Paper finds that the hedging program has led to welfare gains, mostly through
lowering borrowing costs for the sovereign. Insuring a larger fraction of the oil production could be beneficial since
the volatility of oil revenues will increase once domestic fuel prices are fully liberalized.

additional pressure on the budget over the long term as the old-age dependency ratio increases.
Staff encouraged the authorities to periodically publish long-term projections of age-related
spending, and take them explicitly into account when setting medium-term budget targets.
Reducing more aggressively public debt levels in the medium term would provide a buffer for
addressing long-term demographic pressures. Staff also suggested that the defined-benefit system
could be closed to further accumulation of rights in order to save public resources and gradually
reduce the inequity between the replacement rates under the two pension systems.
Box 3. Pension Issues
Mexico has adopted a defined-contribution pension system since the late 1990s. The traditional payas-you-go defined-benefit (DB) pension system was replaced with a defined-contribution (DC) system with
individual accounts managed by pension fund administrators (in 1997 for private sector workers and in 2007
for most public sector workers).1 However, individuals who were already participants in the DB system prior
to the reform were grandfathered, allowing them not only to retain the entitlements already accumulated at
the time of the reform, but also to continue accumulating entitlements thereafter. Mexico’s pension system
also includes the national housing fund (unused balances in which are converted to pension savings) and a
means-tested noncontributory pension for the poorest.
The current system faces a number of challenges, including rising fiscal costs, low coverage, and low
replacement rates under the DB system. The shift to a defined-contribution system will reduce fiscal costs
in the long run, but during the transition public pension spending will keep increasing until about 2040 due
to demographic changes (spending is projected to increase by 1 percentage point of GDP over the next five
years). Second, replacement rates of the two pension systems differ significantly: they are 80-100 percent for
those grandfathered under the DB system, but expected to be about 30 percent for those in the DC system
(corresponding to the low pension contribution rates).2 Finally, pension coverage is relatively low since a
large share of the population is employed in the informal sector.

discouraging formal employment). Replacement rates
can also be improved by shifting savings from the housing fund to the private pension funds (which have a
high rate of return). To reduce inequities in the replacement rate, the DB could be closed for all future

mixture of DB and DC pensions.

pension schemes exist for some public sector workers, such as those employed by state-owned
enterprises, the states, universities and armed forces.
2 Even after accounting for savings in the national housing fund, the expected average replacement rate for a
worker who has not bought a house is only about 47 percent, which is likely to be inadequate for low-income
workers.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MEXICO

25.
Staff recommended raising pension contributions to boost replacement rates under
the defined-contribution system. The projected replacement rates under the new definedcontribution system are very low (about 30 percent, or up to 47 percent including additional savings
through Infonavit, the national housing fund).19 The low retirement income is likely to put pressure
on public social spending in the long term. Staff recommended considering different policy options
to raise the pension contribution rate from its current low level of 6.5 percent of earnings in order to
achieve an adequate replacement rate in retirement. The authorities agreed that this was an
important long-term issue and that it would be desirable to increase replacement rates, while being
careful to avoid discouraging formal employment. They suggested as one option strengthening the
integration between the mandatory contributions to Infonavit and the pension system, which would
increase investment returns. Staff noted that recent proposals by CONSAR to increase the voluntary
retirement savings rate, including through an automatic enrollment of new employees in plans with
higher pension contribution rates with an opt-out clause, could also be very effective in increasing
pension savings.

B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
26.
Monetary policy accommodation has been withdrawn steadily over the past year. Staff
analysis suggests that Mexico’s policy rate is currently close to the estimated neutral rate, which is
consistent with a small output gap, headline and core inflation at the target, moderate wage
increases, and anchored inflation expectations (Box 4). In the baseline projection, demand pressures
are expected to remain subdued over the next year, while inflation would rise temporarily above 3
percent due to relative price changes before converging to the inflation target in 2018. Staff argued
that under the baseline forecast for output and inflation, a pause in monetary policy tightening is
warranted. Risks to the inflation outlook are broadly balanced. Upside risks to the inflation outlook
include a greater-than-expected increase in fuel prices and a possible intensification of passthrough effects from the currency depreciation. However, second-round effects are likely to remain
limited as demand pressures are subdued and medium-term inflation expectations are wellanchored. In that context, a temporary move of inflation above the target due to relative price
changes in tradable versus non-tradable goods would not necessarily warrant a policy response. On
the downside, risks to the growth outlook have increased. If these risks materialize, increasing slack
in the economy would ease wage and inflation pressures. Future monetary policy decisions should
remain data driven, and clear communication by the central bank will continue to be important in
guiding market expectations.

OECD (2015) estimates a replacement rate from the defined-contribution pension system of about 30 percent.
Formal employers in Mexico are required to contribute 5 percent of their worker’s salary to the national housing
fund. In return, employees are entitled to get a mortgage from Infonavit at relatively low rates. Workers may also use
their contributions as retirement savings, although the returns have been substantially lower than the returns of
private pension funds in recent years. CONSAR estimates that the expected replacement rate from Infonavit savings
is about 17 percent for contributors who have not taken out a mortgage loan, bringing the overall replacement rate
to 47 percent for these workers.

The Taylor rule estimates Banxico’s historical

brought the policy rate slightly above what the
estimated historical reaction function would
suggest. This is consistent with Bank of Mexico’s
message that they are tightening policy preemptively to rebalance inflation risks and
reduce the risk of de-anchoring medium-term
inflation expectations in the context of a
significant exchange rate depreciation.

The authorities noted that they will adjust the monetary policy stance as needed to
keep inflation in line with the target. They explained that the tightening over the past year was
aimed at rebalancing the risks to inflation and keeping inflation expectations anchored in the
context of a sharp depreciation of the peso. Staff and the authorities agreed that, going forward,
demand pressures are likely to remain subdued. The authorities noted that certain risks persist, while
staff viewed the risks to the inflation outlook as broadly balanced. On the upside, further
depreciation of the exchange rate could trigger second-round effects and food prices may increase
more than expected. Downside risks include greater-than-expected declines in some prices as a
result of the structural reforms. The authorities emphasized that the most recent hike was not the
beginning of a tightening cycle. They noted that they will continue to respond flexibly to any
changes in the determinants of inflation and inflation expectations, including the pass-through from
the exchange rate depreciation to prices, the evolution of slack in the economy, and the relative
monetary policy stance between Mexico and the United States.

There was agreement that the flexible exchange rate should continue to play the role
of a key shock absorber should tail risks materialize. A flexible adjustment of the exchange rate
will be indispensable to restore equilibrium in response to a permanent shock arising from increased
protectionism and rising barriers to trade. The authorities have a wide range of tools to prevent
disorderly market conditions, including discretionary foreign exchange interventions, targeted
liquidity provision, and debt duration management. The FCL arrangement, which the authorities
continue to treat as precautionary, remains an important complement to reserve buffers, providing
protection against tail risks.

C. Financial Stability
29.
Balance sheet analysis suggests that the financial system is broadly resilient to shocks.
The materialization of some of the downside risks discussed earlier could lead to heightened
volatility, pressures on asset prices, deteriorating liquidity conditions, and funding cost increases.
Negative feedback loops between tighter financial conditions and weak growth could strain
corporate and bank balance sheets. Nonetheless, the recent Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP) found that the balance sheets of financial institutions and non-financial corporations would
be resilient to severe shocks given high initial capital levels (Boxes 5 and 6). Specifically, a sensitivity
analysis of the largest 50 corporations found that only for a handful of companies the interest
coverage ratio would fall below one in a scenario of significant further currency depreciation,
increase in funding rates, and a decline in earnings. Household indebtedness remains low, although
the recent rapid pace of credit growth could create pockets of vulnerabilities if income growth
decelerates sharply and unemployment increases. The banking sector stress tests confirmed that
banks have adequate capital and reserves buffers to absorb an increase in credit risks from corporate
and household lending in a stress scenario. Banks are also resilient to market and liquidity risks. The
authorities continue to closely monitor corporate leverage and advise firms to strengthen their balance
sheets when needed.

Box 5. Household and Corporate Sector Balance Sheets: A Health Check
Households have low debt and significant positive net assets. The ratio of household debt to income is
only 22 percent, and households hold large financial and non-financial assets. Lending to households’
accounts for 37 percent of total bank loans (of which 60 percent are personal loans and credit cards and the
rest are housing loans). Consumer loan provisioning is high at 200 percent of NPLs. Household borrowing is
denominated entirely in local currency. House prices have increased broadly in line with income growth on
average over the last five years, and there is no evidence of an overvaluation.
Corporate debt is also relatively low, although about half of it is denominated in foreign currency.
Total corporate debt (including that of public corporations) is 35 percent of GDP, lower than in most other

emerging economies (Figure 7). While FX debt is high, comprising half of total debt, most large corporations
reduce their exchange rate risks through a combination of natural hedges (sales in foreign currency) and
financial derivatives. Financial derivatives provide mostly a temporary protection against exchange rate
movements, but stress tests suggest that balance sheets would be relatively resilient even in the absence of
financial hedges.
Although corporate profitability has weakened in line with the slowing economy, debt servicing
capacity remains strong. For the median firm, the interest coverage ratio (earnings/interest expense) is
around four.1 Corporate bonds have long maturities and only 15 percent of total bonds are maturing in
2016-18. In addition, on average, cash buffers increased and the ratio of net debt to earnings declined in
2015. Commercial banks’ provisions are high at 140 percent of NPLs. Banks’ exposure to the commodities
sector is small (6 percent of total loans, most of which to PEMEX) and provisions are above 1000 percent of
sectoral NPLs.

Only one medium-sized company (Empresas ICA) and a small oil services provider (Oro Negro) missed debt
interest payments last year. The ICRs for other large companies have not declined notably over the last year.

Box 5. Household and Corporate Sector Balance Sheets: A Health Check (continued)
A sensitivity analysis shows that large publicly-traded Mexican corporates and the banking sector
would be resilient to further negative shocks to corporate earnings, the exchange rate, and interest
rates (see charts below).2


Of the 50 largest companies, only three (taking into account natural and financial hedges)3 to five (with
natural hedge only) firms would have difficulty servicing debt (defined as Interest Coverage Ratio below
1). Their debts account for 2.9 to 3.4 percent of total corporate sector debt, and for only 0.02 to 0.22
percent of total bank loans. The 50 largest companies also have large cash holdings, which would
provide an additional buffer in case of an adverse shock (the medium firm has a cash buffer of 255
percent of short term debt).



In the worst case of no exchange rate hedges, six companies will have ICR below 1 in a stress scenario.
Their debts account for 6.6 percent of total corporate sector debt (1.12 percent of total bank loans).



In the case of debt default, the banks’ gross corporate NPL ratio could increase by 0.02 to 1.12
percentage points. With high loss-absorbing buffer (15.8 percent of risk-weighted assets), banks would
be able to absorb these losses and remain solvent even in the worst case scenario.

exercise analyzes the top 50 largest publicly-listed corporations (comprising around 30 percent of total
corporate debt), using a combination of balance sheet data and supervisory information. The specific shocks
considered are one standard deviation shock to earnings, 30-percent exchange rate depreciation, and 30-percent
increase in interest costs. Data limitations prohibit the extension of such analysis to smaller firms, however they
have limited access to foreign currency debt and therefore should be less exposed to exchange rate fluctuations.

3 The natural hedges are proxied by the ratio of foreign currency revenues to total revenues for each firm, based
on information from the Bank of Mexico. This ratio is 31 percent on average. Financial hedges for exchange rate
risk are assumed to cover 50 percent of FX interest expenses (according to supervisory information the current
ratio is higher than that for most firms).

Box 5. Household and Corporate Sector Balance Sheets: A Health Check (concluded)
Inter-sectoral balance sheet linkages show that contagion risks remain contained. The main potential
vulnerability is the significant net liability position of the public and the nonfinancial private sectors (close to
¼ of GDP each). A sudden reduction in preferences for Mexican assets could therefore be a key channel of
transmission of global shocks to Mexico. About ¾ of public liabilities are denominated in pesos, however,
reducing exchange rate risks, while most nonfinancial private corporate liabilities consist of equity.
Moreover, the central bank holds significant reserves (15 percent of GDP at end-2015), and Mexico has a
US$88 billion credit line with the IMF, which should help guard against a tail event. Table 8 contains more
detailed balance sheet information.

The 2016 FSAP recommended a number of enhancements to Mexico’s prudential and
crisis-management frameworks. The 2012 FSAP concluded that banking supervision in Mexico
was effective. This year’s assessment found that since significant progress has been achieved in
strengthening financial sector prudential oversight but some important gaps remain, especially in
the governance of the supervisory framework.20 In particular:


It is critical at the current juncture of Mexico’s financial sector development to strengthen the
governance of the supervisory agencies and the IPAB, which continue to lack operational
independence, budget autonomy, and legal protection, and have multiple mandates, including
financial development. The FSAP recommended that budgetary independence needs to be
granted to allow the supervisors to allocate resources according to their established priorities
and to ensure the adequacy and quality of its staff. Ensuring the financial soundness of the
supervised institutions should be the primary mandate for the supervisors; other mandates
should remain secondary and narrowly defined. Governance boards need to be composed of
independent members with clear rules and process for the appointment and dismissal of senior
personnel.



The FSAP suggested consolidating the supervisory agencies (responsible for banks, securities,
insurance, other financial institutions and pension funds) under a single prudential authority.

20

For further details, refer to the 2016 Mexico Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA).

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MEXICO

There is also a need to strengthen, inter alia, consolidated supervision and improve regulatory
reporting for related-party lending.


Strengthening the role of the Financial System Stability Council (CESF) in the assessment of
financial stability risks, including clear assignment of responsibility for the identification and
mitigation of potential systemic risks, would help enhance the macroprudential policy
framework.
Box 6. Results from Stress Tests of the Financial System from the 2016 FSAP
The recent financial system stability assessment found that the financial system is resilient to a wide range of
shocks.
Commercial banks. The results of solvency and liquidity
stress tests suggest that the commercial banking system
can withstand severe shocks, despite large capital losses
in some cases (see the 2016 FSSA report).1 Liquidity
buffers are large and all banks meet the minimum LCR
requirements. Returns on equity averaged 17 percent over
the last three years, and the spread between lending and
deposit rates was high at about 10 percentage points. The
gross NPL ratio has declined steadily from 3.2 percent in
2013 to 2.6 percent in 2015, and provision coverage is
high at 140 percent. Commercial banks’ external debt
liabilities amount to only around 3 percent of total
liabilities, reducing their exposure to external financial
shocks.

Development banks. Solvency stress tests conducted on the three largest development banks show that
capital adequacy ratios would remain above the regulatory minimum under various shocks. Asset quality is
high, although profitability and capitalization have declined slightly (capital adequacy is still very high at 14.1
percent). The gross NPL ratio has remained below 2 percent since 2010, and provision covers 262 percent of
NPLs.
Insurance sector. The insurance companies are well capitalized, profitable, and liquid. Return of equity
averaged 14 percent in 2015, and the ratios of minimum capital guarantee coverage and liquid assets to
current liabilities were 1.9 and 3.5 respectively.2 Insurance investment portfolios are well diversified and
solvency ratios would remain above regulatory requirement under a combination of interest rate, exchange
rate, and equity markets shocks.
Mutual funds and pension funds are exposed to market risk, but have various tools available to manage
liquidity risks. In periods of stress, mutual fund managers can limit or suspend redemptions, apply discount
to the unit price, and split funds into liquid and illiquid components. Pension funds’ regulatory VaR limits are
automatically adjusted based on changes in market volatility.
Interconnectedness risks among sectors are limited. Stress tests showed that only several very small
banks and brokerage houses would not be able to meet the minimum regulatory requirement in times of
stress. The low interconnectedness risk is partly explained by banks’ reduced exposure to foreign financial
institutions as a result of stricter regulatory limits on net open positions in foreign currency.

credit losses in the stress test are relatively large, banks have high levels of capital and can absorb them.



The crisis preparedness framework should include comprehensive coordinated contingency
plans and simulation exercises to deal with a systemic crisis.



The deposit insurance system should be strengthened by transferring legacy debt from the
deposit insurance institute (IPAB) to the federal government balance sheet, and building up the
ex-ante resolution fund.



The incentive structure of development banks should be modified to reduce the risk of direct
competition with commercial banks and focus their activities exclusively on developmental
objectives. Quantitative credit targets for development banks should be eliminated. Performance
assessments could be based in part on indicators of financial inclusion and private sector
crowding in.

31.
The authorities broadly agreed with the FSAP recommendations, except for those
related to the reform of institutional governance arrangements.


In particular, they plan to develop formal system-wide contingency plans and perform
coordinated crisis simulation exercises. The authorities also intend to phase out the practice of
setting quantitative targets for development banks’ credit growth, and replace them with
broader indicators, including indicators for financial inclusion. Interest rate caps currently in
place for some development bank programs will be phased out by 2018.



The authorities do not see a need to combine the supervisory agencies under one prudential
authority, as each agency has a clear mandate and issues of common interest are discussed
under the umbrella of the CESF. They agree with the need to explore certain flexibility in
budgetary issues, but intend to keep the current institutional and governance arrangements,
citing a need to maintain a strong involvement of the Ministry of Finance in financial sector
oversight. They also prefer to maintain the CESF as a coordinating body in the assessment and
communication of financial stability issues without executive powers of its own, in order to avoid
conflicts with the mandates, powers, and objectives of the central bank and the technical
independence of the supervisory agencies, with the understanding that these agencies follow a
comply or explain approach to CESF’s recommendations.

D. Raising Potential Output and Fostering Inclusive Growth
32.
Mexico’s economy has grown at a moderate pace over the past two decades, but the
income gap with the United States has continued to widen. Average real per capita income
growth in Mexico was 1.6 percent over 1995–2015, below that of its main trading partner. The
structural reforms enacted over the past few years aimed to reduce important bottlenecks that
constrained growth. Staff projects that potential growth will increase to about 2¾ percent over the
medium term as investment and productivity increase as a result of the reforms. This is at the lower
end of earlier estimates as domestic oil production is expected to remain subdued and potential
growth in the United States is now considered to be lower than previously estimated. Staff noted

24

that increasing Mexico’s potential growth further requires improving the investment climate by
strengthening the rule of law and raising female labor force participation.

33.
Further efforts to improve security and strengthen the rule of law would help boost
potential growth. Improving the efficiency and quality of judicial institutions, including the court
system, will be critical in this regard. Steadfast implementation of the new anti-corruption
legislation, including prosecution of officials who have violated the law, should help improve
economic efficiency and increase productivity by reducing misallocation of resources and rentseeking behavior. The use of the anti-money laundering (AML) framework provides further tools that
help anti-corruption efforts.

example through increasing available

research suggests that better enforcement of anti-discrimination laws can also help increase
participation. It would be worth exploring whether transferring responsibility for the resolution of
anti-discrimination cases from the executive to the judicial branch of government would make the
process more efficient. There was agreement that it would be useful to conduct regular surveys to
better understand the barriers women face in entering and staying in the labor market, and to
assess the impact of any government initiatives in this area.

Box 7. Female Labor Force Participation
Mexico has low female labor force participation (FLFP) compared to regional peers and OECD
countries. Only 45 percent of Mexican women work outside the home—one woman for every two men—
compared to an average of slightly over 50 percent in Latin America and in the OECD. Improvements in FLFP
in Mexico over the past two decades have been noteworthy: female labor force participation increased by 6
percentage points in the last 15 years, and more than 10 percentage points since 1990. Nonetheless, there is
significant room to boost to potential growth by increasing FLFP further.
Several factors appear to play a role in explaining the low FLFP in Mexico. Cultural attitudes, limited
availability of affordable child care, low educational attainment, and poor enforcement of anti-discrimination
laws all have been identified as important determinants of the low FLFP rate in the literature.


Limited availability of affordable, high-quality child-care services appears to be a major obstacle to
participation in the labor market. There are two main child care programs: Estancias Infantiles (EI)
and Guarderias. EI is a social means-tested program, providing child care for mothers outside the
formal sector. Empirical evidence suggests that the program has been successful in increasing a
woman’s probability of working, getting more stable jobs, and increasing their income (Calderon,
2014). Guarderias is a child-care program for mothers and single fathers employed in the formal
sector. Both programs currently have spaces for only a small fraction of the eligible population.



A national survey done in 2010 (Encuesta Nacional sobre Discriminación en México) found that
close to 40 percent of men believed that women should work only in traditional gender-appropriate
jobs, and 25 percent thought that it is acceptable for female job applicants to be administered
pregnancy tests. Discriminatory practices in hiring and employment have been outlawed in the 2013
labor reform, but enforcement appears to be challenging. Labor legislation disputes are adjudicated
by arbitration boards associated with the Ministry of Labor. Arbitration often takes a long time, and
workers who have won a dispute have been unable to collect their payment in 56 percent of the
cases (Kaplan and Sadka 2008).



Labor force participation rates are lower for women than men at every level of education, but the
difference narrows significantly at higher levels of education (the gap is only about 15 percentage
points for those with college education or higher). Since the younger generations have higher
education levels, the participation gap should narrow down gradually over time.

35.
Mexico has made some progress in fostering inclusive growth, but significant
challenges remain. Extreme poverty has declined since the mid-1990s, while education levels and
access to health care have increased substantially. Access to basic services such as drinking water
and electricity has also increased significantly. Programs such as Prospera (a successor of
Oportunidades) and Seguro Popular have been credited with reducing poverty. Prospera is a
conditional cash transfer program, which encourages school attendance, preventive health checkups, and labor force participation. Seguro Popular has ensured nearly universal low-cost health-care
coverage. Poverty among the elderly is being addressed through a means-tested social pension, the
qualifying minimum age for which was reduced from 70 to 65 years in 2013. Despite these efforts,
significant challenges remain. While the rates of poverty and income inequality have declined since
the mid-1990s, they remain at very high levels (poverty rates have increased after the 2008 financial
crisis). In the near term, policies should focus on improving the efficiency of social spending so that
a larger share of the population could be served with the same resources. For example, the equity
and efficiency of education spending could be strengthened by refocusing it on early education and

26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MEXICO

improving the quality of teaching. Access to quality health care could be improved through better
coordination across health institutions to reduce redundancies, and promoting exchange of services
between health-care networks. In the longer term, new initiatives aimed at increasing the labor force
participation of women, better targeted labor training programs, and greater financial inclusion are
needed to help foster inclusive growth.
36.
The new National Strategy for Financial Inclusion paves the way to greater access to
financial services by low-income households. The authorities have already taken a number of
measures to promote financial inclusion. In particular, mobile transfers and payments have been
made widely available. Increased access to ATM infrastructure has been ensured through sharing
agreements. Basic banking services are being provided in rural areas through a network of
authorized agents, including stores and cooperative saving societies. The National Financial
Inclusion strategy, launched in June 2016, proposes a number of additional actions, including
mandatory financial literacy education in schools, increasing the network of agents in underserved
areas, designing incentives for retailers to increase the use of electronic payments, expanding the
services provided by development banks in areas with no private financial institutions, and further
strengthening of consumer protection.
37.
The authorities noted that they will continue to devote significant efforts to reducing
poverty and inequality and strengthening the position of women in society. They argued that
the existing social programs have been effective in reducing extreme poverty; however, an
important remaining challenge is to ensure that the beneficiaries of these programs eventually
graduate and become part of the formal economy. The authorities agreed with the need to
strengthen further the rule of law and noted that new anti-corruption legislation will help in that
effort.

SAFEGUARDS ASSESSMENT
38.
Staff has completed the safeguards procedures for Mexico’s 2016 FCL arrangement.
The authorities provided the necessary authorization for Fund staff to communicate directly with
Banco de Mexico’s external auditor, Mancera, S.C. (EY México). EY México issued an unqualified
audit opinion on the Bank de Mexico’s 2015 financial statements. Staff reviewed the 2015 audit
results and discussed these with EY México. Staff noted improvements in the quality and
transparency of the annual financial statements, including commencement of their publication on
the bank’s website. While no significant issues emerged from the conduct of the safeguards
procedures, the authorities are taking steps to enhance the independence of the Audit Committee.

STAFF APPRAISAL
39.
Mexico’s policies and policy frameworks remain very strong. The authorities are
committed to a further gradual reduction in the fiscal deficit. The flexible exchange rate is helping
facilitate the adjustment of the economy to external shocks, and monetary policy is focused on

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

27

MEXICO

maintaining price stability. The resilience of the financial system to shocks is supported by strong
financial regulation and supervision. Mexico’s external position is broadly in line with
macroeconomic fundamentals and desirable policy settings.
40.
Moderate economic growth continues, accompanied by low and stable inflation. Real
GDP growth is projected to grow by 2.1 percent in 2016 and 2¼ percent in 2017. Year-on-year
headline and core inflation are at the 3-percent target and medium-term inflation expectations
remain anchored. Continued implementation of structural reforms should lift potential growth in the
medium term to about 2¾ percent.
41.
However, Mexico’s economy is vulnerable to external shocks. The main risks include a
rise in protectionism in key trading partners, weaker-than-expected growth in the U.S., renewed
episodes of global financial market volatility, and lower oil production and prices. The flexible
exchange rate and Mexico’s strong fundamentals provide resilience against adverse shocks.
Targeted liquidity provision, debt duration management strategies, and temporary foreign exchange
intervention can be used to prevent disorderly market conditions. The Flexible Credit Line remains
an important complement to reserve buffers, providing insurance against tail risks.
42.
Reducing the ratio of public debt to GDP is critical to maintain investor confidence.
Public debt has increased steadily in recent years, reaching 54 percent of GDP in 2015. The
authorities have committed to reduce the PSBR from 4.1 percent of GDP in 2015 to 2½ percent of
GDP in 2018, which would put the public debt-to-GDP ratio on a downward trajectory in the
medium term. The projected reduction of the fiscal deficit to 2.9 percent in 2017 is consistent with
this commitment. Any future profit transfers from the Bank of Mexico and other positive revenue
surprises should be used in full to bring the PSBR below the target and reduce net public debt.
Further revenue measures could be considered in the medium term to avoid constraining capital
spending excessively.
43.
Increasing the profitability and efficiency of PEMEX is an important element of the
fiscal consolidation plan. The company should take advantage of the increased autonomy and
flexibility provided by the energy reform to focus on profitable core business activities. The intention
to leverage its investment and increase efficiency through joint ventures with the private sector is
welcome.
44.
The current low energy prices provide an opportunity to eliminate non-targeted
electricity subsidies. Low-income households could be compensated through the existing welltargeted cash transfer programs. The proposed early liberalization of gasoline prices in 2017 is
welcome. The authorities could consider expanding the oil-price hedging program to reduce the
volatility of revenue from domestic sales of oil.
45.
Further enhancements to the fiscal framework could strengthen fiscal discipline.
Establishing a non-partisan fiscal council would improve accountability and help inform the public
debate on fiscal policy. It is desirable to have a tighter link between the desired level of public debt
and medium-term PSBR targets. The exceptional circumstance clause should be used only in cases

28

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MEXICO

of large output or oil price shocks and, once invoked, the return of the PSBR to the medium-term
target should be explicitly defined in the law.
46.
There is a need to address the challenges related to long-term demographic changes.
Reducing public debt levels more aggressively in the medium term will provide space to
accommodate higher spending pressures as the old-age dependency ratio rises in the longer term.
Moreover, it is necessary to raise pension contributions to boost replacement rates under the
defined-contribution system and reduce pressures on public social spending in the future.
47.
Future monetary policy decisions will remain data-driven. In the absence of new shocks,
there is a case for a pause in monetary policy tightening in the near term. Economic activity is
expected to remain slightly below potential, wage pressures are subdued, and medium-term
inflation expectations remain close to the inflation target. A temporary move of inflation above the
target to accommodate relative price adjustments would not warrant a policy response, unless there
is evidence of second round effects. Clear communication by the central bank will remain important
in guiding market expectations.
48.
The 2016 Financial Sector Assessment Program found that the balance sheets of
financial institutions and non-financial corporations remain broadly resilient. Commercial
banks are well capitalized and resilient to market, liquidity, and credit risks due to high capital
buffers. Corporations would be able to weather further large shocks to the exchange rate or interest
rates. While prudential oversight has improved since the 2012 FSAP, the latest assessment
recommended strengthening consolidated supervision and enhancing some elements of the crisispreparedness and deposits insurance frameworks. In addition, it would be critical to strengthen the
governance of the financial supervisory agencies.
49.
Further progress on improving security and the rule of law is critical to boost potential
growth. In particular, it is important to enhance the efficiency and quality of judicial institutions,
including the court system. Steadfast implementation and strong enforcement of the new anticorruption legislation, as well as the AML framework, will be critical to improve governance.
50.
Despite significant efforts to enhance social and economic inclusion, important
challenges remain. Poverty and inequality remain high, female labor force participation is low by
international comparison, and access to financial services is limited. In the near term, improving the
efficiency of social spending would help ensure that a larger share of the population is reached with
the same resources. Increased access to child-care services and better enforcement of antidiscrimination laws can help reduce gender imbalances and raise female labor force participation.
The implementation of the new national strategy for financial inclusion would improve access to
financial services for low-income households and small enterprises.
51.
It is proposed that the next Article IV Consultation with Mexico take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

2/ Includes revenues from the oil-price hedge for 0.6 percent of GDP in 2015 and 0.3 percent of GDP in 2016; and Bank of Mexico's operating surplus transferred to the federal government for 0.2
percent of GDP in 2015 and 1.2 percent of GDP in 2016.
3/ Includes social assistance benefits.
4/ Due to lack of disaggregated data this item includes both financing and capital transfers.
5/ The 2014 amendment to the FRL introduced a cap on the real growth rate of structural current spending set at 2.0 percent for 2015 and 2016, and equal to potential growth thereafter. Structural
current spending is defined as total budgetary expenditure, excluding: (i) interest payments; (ii) non-programable spending; (iii) cost of fuels for electricity generation; (iv) direct physical and financial
investment of the federal government; and expenditure by state productive enterprises and their subsidiaries.
6/ Adjusting revenues for the economic and oil-price cycles and excluding one-off items (e.g. oil hedge income and Bank of Mexico transfers).

1/ Data exclude state and local governments and include state-owned enterprises and public development banks.
2/ Includes revenues from the oil-price hedge for 0.6 percent of GDP in 2015 and 0.3 percent of GDP in 2016, treated as revenues from an insurance claim. It includes also Bank of Mexico's operating
surplus transferred to the federal government for 0.2 percent of GDP in 2015 and 1.2 percent of GDP in 2016.
3/ Interest payments differ from official data due to adjustments to account for changes in valuation and interest rates.
4/ Includes transfers to state and local governments under revenue-sharing agreements with the federal government.
5/ Includes pensions and social assistance benefits.
6/ Includes Adefas and other expenses, as well as the adjustments to the "traditional" balance not classified elsewhere.
7/ This category differs from official data on physical capital spending due to adjustments to account for Pidiregas amortizations included in budget figures.
8/ Adjusting revenues for the economic and oil-price cycles and excluding one-off items (e.g. oil hedge income and Bank of Mexico transfers).
9/ Corresponds to the gross stock of PSBR, calculated as the net stock of PSBR as published by the authorities plus public sector financial assets.
10/ Corresponds to the net stock of PSBR (i.e., gross stock net of public sector financial assets) as published by the authorities.
11/ The 2014 amendment to the FRL introduced a cap on the real growth rate of structural current spending set at 2.0 percent for 2015 and 2016, and equal to potential growth thereafter. Structural
current spending is defined as total budgetary expenditure, excluding: (i) interest payments; (ii) non-programable spending; (iii) cost of fuels for electricity generation; (iv) direct physical and financial
investment of the federal government; and expenditure by state productive enterprises and their subsidiaries.

Annex I. Risk Assessment Matrix 1/
Potential Deviations from Baseline
Source of Risk
Sharp rise in risk premiums with flight
to safety. Investors reassess underlying
economic and financial risks in large
economies, or respond to unanticipated
Fed tightening, and increases in U.S.
term premiums, with poor market
liquidity amplifying volatility. Safe haven
currencies’ surge—especially the US
dollar—strains balance sheets for FX
debtors.
Rise in populism and nationalism in
large economies—especially those with
near-term elections—could slow down
or even reverse policy coordination and
collaboration, international trade
liberalization, financial and labor flows,
and lead to unsustainable policies,
weighing on global growth and
exacerbating financial market volatility.
Structurally weak growth in key
advanced and emerging economies.

Persistently lower energy prices,
triggered by supply factors reversing
more gradually than expected.
Further declines in oil production at
PEMEX.

Slower-than-anticipated fiscal
consolidation in the context of the
forthcoming electoral cycle, leading to
further steady increase in public debt
and an increase in country risk
premiums.

1/ The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to
materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline
(“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a
probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the
time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly. “Short term” and “medium
term” are meant to indicate that the risk could materialize within 1 year and 3 years, respectively.

Background. Mexico’s NIIP was -36 percent of GDP in 2015 (gross foreign assets and
liabilities were 48 percent and 84 percent of GDP, respectively). Portfolio liabilities were
40 percent of GDP, of which around one third are holdings of local-currency government
bonds. The ratio of NIIP to GDP is projected to rise slightly and then stabilize over the
medium term.
Assessment. While the NIIP is sustainable, the large gross foreign portfolio liabilities holdings
could be a source of vulnerability to global financial volatility.
Background. In 2016, the current account deficit is projected at 2.9 percent of GDP, similar to
the previous year, with stronger services and income balances making up for a weaker oil and
nonoil goods balance. The cyclically-adjusted current account deficit is estimated at 2.4
percent of GDP. Over the medium term, private investment related to the structural reforms is
expected to rise, matched by greater private sector savings as consumption growth
moderates.
Assessment. Mexico’s CA deficit is broadly in line with the level consistent with medium term
fundamentals and desirable policy settings. The EBA model estimates a cyclically-adjusted
current account norm of -1.6 percent in 2016, implying a CA gap of -0.8 percent of GDP in
2016. The staff assessment is similar, with a gap between -1 and 0 percent of GDP.
Background. The average REER in 2016 through September was 12 percent weaker than the
2015 average. The depreciation reflects a reduction in oil production and net oil exports,
further deterioration in the terms of trade, weaker medium-term growth prospects, and
uncertainties in the global economy, including risks of rising protectionism. The free-floating
exchange rate has been a key shock absorber in an unsettled global environment.
Assessment. The EBA level REER regression estimates an undervaluation of 11.5 percent in
2016. The index approach yields higher undervaluation (29 percent). Staff puts less weight on
the index approach as it has shown the peso to be persistently undervalued for the last 8
years. Considering all estimates and the uncertainties around them, staff assesses Mexico’s
real effective exchange rate to be broadly in line with fundamentals (with a gap of 0-10
percent, reflecting mild undervaluation which is likely to be reversed as risks of rising
protectionism recede).
Background. During 2010-14, a large share of capital inflows has gone into purchases of
locally-issued government paper and other portfolio investments. In 2015-16 gross portfolio
inflows slowed markedly, and there have been net outflows from local currency government
paper in the first half of 2016. Going forward, the structural reforms are expected to lead to
higher FDI, while portfolio inflows are unlikely to return to the previous high growth rates.
Assessment. The long duration of sovereign debt and the high share of local currency
financing reduce the exposure of government finances to depreciation risks. However, the
strong presence of foreign investors leaves Mexico exposed to a reversal of capital flows and
an increase in risk premiums. The authorities have refrained from capital flow management
measures, in line with their view that an open capital account reduces policy uncertainty and
supports long-term growth. Capital flow risks are also mitigated by prudent macroeconomic
policies.
Background. The central bank remains committed to a free-floating exchange rate, using
discretionary intervention only to prevent disorderly market conditions.1/ The central bank
usually builds up reserves through purchases of the net foreign currency proceeds of the
state oil company, but at current oil prices this is minimal. Occasionally the central bank also
used auctions to build up reserves as needed. In 2015, FX reserves declined to US$178 billion
(15.5 percent of GDP), mostly due to FX intervention totaling US$24.5 billion to address
disorderly market conditions.
Assessment. At 112 percent of the ARA metric and 191 percent of short-term debt (at
remaining maturity), the current level of foreign reserves remains adequate for normal times.
The FCL arrangement has been an effective complement to international reserves, providing
protection against global tail risks.
Mexico (concluded)

Technical
Background
Notes

1/ Rules-based intervention mechanisms were in place between December 8, 2014 and
February 17, 2016. During this time, pre-announced amounts were automatically offered for
auction when the exchange rate depreciated by more than a threshold (1 or 1.5 percent) on a
given day. Regular auctions with no minimum price were also used. Since February 17, 2016,
the authorities moved to discretionary intervention and have used it only once through midSeptember. Data on intervention amounts are published weekly.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Overall Assessment
Overall Assessment:
In 2015, Mexico’s external sector position was
broadly consistent with medium-term
fundamentals and desirable policy settings.
The depreciation of the peso so far this year
has reflected reduction in oil production and
exports, further deterioration in the terms of
trade, weaker medium-term growth prospects,
and uncertainties in the global economy,
including risks of rising protectionism. Overall,
the REER appears to be broadly in line with
fundamentals (with a gap of 0-10 percent). The
positive effects of the weaker exchange rate on
the current account is likely to materialize with
a lag.
Potential policy responses:
The external sector position is broadly
consistent with medium-term fundamentals
and desirable policy settings Therefore, there is
no reason to alter the planned policy settings.
The authorities have committed to reducing
the public sector borrowing requirement from
4.6 percent of GDP in 2014 to 2.5 percent of
GDP in 2018. They have met the corresponding
2015 target and are expected to meet the 2016
target too.
The central bank sets monetary policy to
ensure that the inflation remains close to the 3percent target. The authorities have a freefloating exchange rate policy, and use foreign
exchange intervention occasionally to prevent
disorderly market conditions.
The FCL provides an added buffer against
global tail risks.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
Mexico has had a longstanding partnership with the World Bank Group. The Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) FY14–19—which was jointly prepared with the Government of Mexico—focuses on
the World Bank Group’s twin goals (ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity) and
is fully aligned with the Mexico's National Development Plan (NDP) for 2013–18. The four key areas
of engagement supported by the CPS are: (i) Unleashing Productivity; (ii) Increasing Social
Prosperity; (iii) Strengthening Public Finances and Government Efficiency; and (iv) Promoting Green
and Inclusive Growth. It describes the Bank’s engagement with Mexico as a partnership to achieve
development results through selective and tailored packages of financial, knowledge, and convening
services. IBRD lending has remained an important part of this engagement throughout the years.
The Performance and Learning Report (PLR) of the CPS is currently under preparation. No major
adjustments to the strategy are expected.
As a member of the OECD and the G20, Mexico has maintained economic stability through times of
recent crisis, and increased economic and social well-being over the last two decades. As of August
2016, the IBRD’s exposure was US$15.0 billion which has positioned Mexico as the World Bank’s
third largest IBRD borrower in terms of debt outstanding. The increase of the Single Borrower Limit
up to US$19.0 billion provides the IBRD with further financial space to support Mexico's efforts in
achieving its development agenda, albeit at additional cost.
The active portfolio consists of 14 IBRD projects (including 4 full GEF operations) for a net
commitment of US$2.2 billion and an undisbursed balance of US$1.4 billion. The Bank has an active
trust fund portfolio comprising 43 trust funds for a total net commitment of US$271 million. This
includes a large Clean Technology Fund implemented in conjunction with the national Urban
Transport Program project and a Forest Investment Program (FIP) fund.
In FY15-16, the Mexico Public Expenditure Review (PER) enhanced the Government’s capacity to
manage medium-term fiscal challenges at national and subnational levels and was a valued input to
the Government’s budget discussion and deepened the policy dialogue in many areas such as
subnational borrowing regulations, and improvements in the targeting of social protection
programs. The Government has requested the WBG to explore the possibility of providing more
technical assistance in this area, specifically on fiscal consolidation policies for highly indebted states
and a better use of federal transfers to state level.
In response to the Government’s intention to better link its social protection system to productive
programs, the Bank has provided support to the re-design of Mexico’s CCT program—now known
as PROSPERA—in further improving investments in human capital for the poor. The Bank has
specifically contributed to linking the poor to a broader set of income generating programs and to
better targeting the supply of social programs to areas and beneficiaries with the greatest needs.

At the request of Government, the Bank is supporting the development of the new Special Economic
Zones regime through a series of high-profile workshops and TA on the SEZ law, drawing on the
WBG’s global experience with SEZs. After more than a year of collaboration, the Government looks
at the WBG as the partner of choice on SEZs.
Other areas of support to Mexico’s productivity and inclusive growth agenda include projects to
improve the country’s agricultural storage and information systems to enhance food security and
competitiveness as well as to strengthen the efforts of the Government to improve solid waste
management and launch an Inner-City affordable housing program.
The IFC investment portfolio reached US$1.3 billion at the end of FY16, representing the second
largest portfolio in the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region and the 7th largest portfolio at IFC.
The portfolio represents investments across 54 companies, mostly in the chemicals sector
(22 percent), followed by ports (20 percent), financial markets (9.5 percent), cement (9.3 percent),
construction and real estate (8.8 percent), agribusiness and forestry (5.2 percent), oil & gas
(4.6 percent) and others (21 percent).
To support the structural reform agenda, the Government of Mexico has chosen IFC’s Asset
Management Company (AMC) to manage the newly established China-Mexico Fund (CMF). The
purpose of the CMF is to attract commercial risk capital to support Mexico’s reform agenda by
“crowding in” equity investors into the infrastructure, oil and gas, manufacturing, agribusiness,
services and banking sectors. The CMF was established as a US$1.2 billion fund in 2014 and is
consistent with IFC’s role in mobilizing capital to support private sector growth in middle income
countries.
MIGA remains open to explore opportunities to support private sector in the areas of infrastructure
and energy via its political risk insurance and credit enhancement products.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision is adequate for surveillance. Mexico observes the Special Data Dissemination
Standards (SDDS) and its metadata are posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
(DSBB). In a number of cases, the periodicity and timeliness of disseminated data exceed SDDS
requirements. A data ROSC update was completed on June 24, 2015 and was published as IMF
Country Report No. 15/176. There are various areas where improvements could be made, as detailed
below. The authorities are aware of this situation and are continuing work in this regard.
The national accounts statistics generally follow the recommendations of the System of National
Accounts, 2008 (2008 SNA). Source data and statistical techniques are sound and most statistical
outputs sufficiently portray reality. A broad range of source data are available, with economic
censuses every five years and a vast program of monthly and annual surveys. For most surveys,
scientific sampling techniques are used. Nonetheless, most samples exclude a random sample of

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MEXICO

small enterprises. Some statistical techniques need enhancement. For example, taxes and subsidies
on products at constant prices are estimated by applying the GDP growth rate, a deviation from best
practice.
During 2014 STA conducted a reassessment of the data module of the ROSC that covered national
accounts. As compared with the 2010 ROSC, the reassessment was based on the newest (May 2012)
vintage of the Data Quality Assessment Framework (DQAF) and against those specified in the
Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). The data ROSC reassessment found that national
accounts statistics are generally of a high quality, adequate to conduct effective surveillance and
adequately meet users’ needs. Since 2010, Mexico has made significant improvements on the
methodological and dissemination aspects of data quality. Nevertheless, areas for further
improvement and refinement exist, in particular, on the resources devoted to collecting state and
local government source data and seasonally-adjusted data, explaining data revisions, and on
compiling data on changes in inventories and on the volume of taxes on products.
INEGI has published annual sectoral accounts and balance sheets following the System of National
Accounts 2008 (2008 SNA) classifications of assets and sectors for the period 2003–2012 in
November 2013. These accounts were revised recently and published on June 30, 2014. STA
conducted a mission during 2014 to assess the possibility for developing quarterly sectoral accounts
and balance sheets and agreed with the Mexican authorities on a work plan for developing these
accounts. INEGI and Banxico agreed to collaborate in the compilation of quarterly stocks and flows
of financial assets and liabilities by institutional sectors.
The concepts and definitions for both the CPI and PPI meet international standards. The PPI is only
compiled by product and not by economic activity. A ROSC mission on prices was conducted in
November 2012.
Although some items of the balance of payments statistics conform to the Fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual, a full transition has not yet been completed.1 Several measures to
improve external debt statistics have been carried out, including the compilation of data on external
liabilities of the private sector and publicly traded companies registered with the Mexican stock
exchange (external debt outstanding, annual amortization schedule for the next four years broken
down by maturity, and type of instrument). In 2014, STA conducted a technical assistance on
external sector statistics. The main purpose of the mission was to assist the balance of payment
statistics compilers in further strengthening their data collection and compilation system for external
sector statistics. In particular, the mission focused on foreign direct investment, financial derivatives,
bank accounts used in foreign exchange operations, capital account, and financial intermediation
services indirectly measured. The mission also assisted in addressing specific issues related to the

adoption of the methodology of the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments and International
Investment Position Manual (BPM6).
The authorities compile fiscal statistics following national concepts, definitions, and classifications
that make international comparison difficult. The statistics are comprehensive and timely, except for
states and municipalities. The new government accounting law mandates accounting standards that
follow international standards for all levels of government, and that take into account the
information needs of international organizations and national accounts. A full adoption of uniform
accounting standards at the sub-national level will be crucial to obtain a precise measure of public
fixed investment in national accounts, among others.
The authorities are committed to reporting government financial statistics in GFSM 2001 format, as
well as data for the GFS Yearbook.
The methodological foundations of monetary statistics are generally sound. However, the recording
of financial derivative and, to a lesser extent, repurchase agreements transactions are overstating the
aggregated other depository corporations (ODC) balance sheet and survey. Availability of data on
other financial intermediaries such as insurance companies and pension funds allow for the
construction of a financial corporation’s survey with full coverage of the Mexican financial system,
which is published on a monthly basis in International Financial Statistics.
Mexico is reporting Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs) for Deposit Takers on a monthly basis.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

Prepared By

Staff of the International Monetary Fund

Public debt1 is expected to remain sustainable over the medium term, despite a slightly
worse growth outlook. Under the baseline scenario, the public debt-to-GDP ratio is
projected to decline to 54.3 percent by 2021 from the current level of 56.3 percent. Gross
financing needs (projected at around 6 percent of GDP in 2016) are expected to remain
contained below 10 percent over the medium term. The DSA also suggests that public
debt is sustainable under various negative shocks. Only a drop in real GDP growth shifts
the debt trajectory up significantly, but even under such a scenario, gross debt remains
contained around 66 percent and begins to decline in 2021. With the exception of the
share of debt held by non-residents (49 percent of total debt), public debt profile
indicators remain below the upper early warning benchmarks. However, the risk from a
high foreign ownership of debt is mitigated by the long maturity of this debt.

1

Public debt reported in this annex excludes state and local governments, but includes central government,
social security, state-owned enterprises and public development banks. As of June 2016, the stock of
subnational debt was reported at around 530 billion pesos, or about 2.7 percent of GDP, and therefore does
not pose a systemic risk to debt sustainability.

MEXICO

PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
A. Comparison with the Previous Assessment
The baseline debt projection is somewhat higher relative to last year’s DSA (2015 Mexico
Article IV staff report). Gross public debt is 4.3 percentage points higher in 2016 relative to
previous projections (from 52 to 56.3 percent to GDP) and 3.8 percentage points higher by the end
of the projection period. The main factors explaining the higher debt path are:


Higher initial level of debt. While the previous DSA projected a debt to GDP ratio of
51.9 percent of GDP in 2015, the actual outcome was 54.1 percent of GDP. This was mainly due
to the greater-than-anticipated peso depreciation and a 0.3 percent of GDP in PEMEX’s pension
liability assumption by the federal government.



The government has assumed portions of PEMEX and CFE pension liabilities in 2016. These
operations are estimated to add about 1.6 percentage points of GDP to the total stock of debt,
in addition to the 0.3 percent of GDP assumed in 2015.



Lower growth over the medium term. The real GDP growth path is lower compared to last
year’s projection over the entire projection period.

B. Baseline and Realism of Projections


Debt levels. Under the planned fiscal consolidation, gross debt levels are projected to decline
from a peak of 56.4 percent of GDP in 2017 to 54.3 percent of GDP by 2021 (Figures 3 and 4).
Gross financing needs over the medium-term are projected to average around 8 percent of GDP.



Fiscal adjustment. The structural primary balance (adjusted by the cycle and oil prices)
improves between 2016 and 2021 in the baseline projection. On the revenue side, the decline in
one-offs observed in 2016 from the Bank of Mexico transfer and the hedging income would lead
to lower revenues in 2017, which would then stabilize at a similar level over the medium term.
On the spending side, projections assume compliance with the consolidation plan spelled out in
the 2017 budget documents, which envisaged reducing the public sector borrowing
requirement (PSBR) from 3 percent of GDP in 2016 to 2.5 percent of GDP in 2018. To this end,
the plan encompasses compression of capital and current spending. Compared to the
distribution of fiscal adjustment episodes provided in the DSA template (Figure 2), the projected
3-year adjustment of the cyclically-adjusted primary balance of around 1.5 percent of GDP
seems feasible.



Growth. Past projections of growth outcomes suggest moderate forecast errors, with the
median forecast error in line with other emerging markets. Hence, even though Mexico’s debt
dynamics continue to be highly sensitive to surprises in GDP growth, there seems to be no
evidence of a systematic projection bias in the baseline assumption for growth that could
undermine the DSA assessment. The current output growth projection of 2.2 percent for 2017 is

2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MEXICO

within the authorities’ projected growth rate range of 2-3 percent for 2017. Medium-term
growth is expected to pick up gradually as the effects from structural reforms take hold,
stabilizing at 2.7 percent of GDP in the second half of the projection horizon. The boom-bust
analysis is triggered (Figure 2) because the three-year cumulative change in the credit-to-GDP
ratio exceeds 15 percent in Mexico. This is due to the strong growth in private sector credit,
which is driven by financial reform measures and broadly consistent with trend financial
deepening.


Sovereign yields. Despite the volatility observed in most emerging markets in recent months,
Mexico’s sovereign yields remain low, with the 10-year local-currency bond yield remaining
stable and reaching 6.1 percent as of mid-October. The spread with U.S. government bonds
yields of the same maturity has remained on average at 436 basis points for the last three
months, while spreads on foreign-currency denominated bonds have averaged 287 basis points
over the same period. Taking into account the upward projections for the medium-term U.S.
Libor rates, the effective nominal interest rate on Mexico’s sovereign debt is projected to rise
from 6 percent in 2015 to 7.1 percent by 2021.

C. Debt profile


Rollover and exchange rate risks. Under the current debt structure2, the immediate effect of
interest rate changes on the budget is very low. The long maturity structure also reduces rollover
risks, including for public debt held by non-residents that is relatively high for Mexico. As
illustrated in Figure 5, the real interest rate and real exchange rate shocks would have a relatively
small impact on the debt stock, given the low direct interest pass-through to the budget and the
large share of debt denominated in local currency (some 75 percent).

D. Stochastic Simulations


Fan charts. The fan charts illustrate the possible evolution of the debt ratio over the medium
term and are based on both the symmetric and asymmetric distributions of risk (Figure 1). Under
the symmetric distribution of risk, there is a 75 percent probability that debt will be below 60
percent of GDP over the medium term. If restrictions are imposed on the primary balance (i.e.,
the asymmetric scenario, where it is assumed that there are no positive shocks to the primary
balance), there is still 50 percent chance that the debt path will remain below 60 percent of GDP
over the projection horizon.

E. Stress Tests


Real GDP growth shock. The debt ratio would remain below 60 percent of GDP under all
scenarios except the growth shock where it peaks at 62.6 percent of GDP in 2018 before

2
Average maturity is about 8 years, more than 80 percent of government securities have been issued at fixed interest
rates, and around 25 percent of debt is denominated in foreign currency.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MEXICO

reaching 60.9 percent by the end of the projection period. This scenario also results in a drastic
increase in public gross financing needs in the period 2017-2019, in excess of 10 percent.


Real exchange rate shock.3 A permanent real exchange rate depreciation of 15 percent
increases debt by around 2 percentage points of GDP. As a result, gross financing needs
increase by an average 0.2 percentage points of GDP.



Combined shock. A combined shock incorporates the largest effect of individual shocks on all
relevant variables (real GDP growth, inflation, primary balance, exchange rate and interest rate).
Under this scenario, debt would stabilize at around 66 percent of GDP, without showing an
explosive trajectory. Gross financing needs would peak at around 12 percent of GDP in 2019,
before stabilizing at around 11 percent by the end of the period.

F. Authorities’ Views


The authorities recognize the risks posed by the rising debt burden and are committed to
putting public debt on a declining trajectory over the medium term. They agreed that it is
critical to adhere to the fiscal consolidation plan, maintain strong debt management practices,
and to continue undertaking structural reforms to boost growth.

3

This shock uses a pass-through elasticity of 7 percent (staff estimate) rather than the default value of 25 percent.

1/ Public sector is defined as the central government, state-owned enterprises, public sector development banks, and social security funds.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock at the end of previous year.
4/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
5/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 4 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
6/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
7/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
8/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

MEXICO

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Mexico’s external-debt-to GDP ratio continues to be low and sustainable (expected at
42 percent projected for end-2016), and is expected to remain stable over the medium term.
Most shock scenarios would increase external debt by just a few percentage points. The largest
increase would occur under a depreciation scenario. However, even in the unlikely event of a further
30 percent real exchange rate depreciation, the debt-to-GDP ratio would increase to 58 percent,
which would still be manageable. The reason for this contained increase is that 42 percent of
Mexico’s public external debt is denominated in pesos (this is less than before the recent
depreciation, though, when the ratio stood at around half). Debt dynamics also benefit from the low
interest rates and long maturities of the existing debt.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on
November 16, 2016

1.

This supplement provides an update on economic and market developments since the
issuance of the staff report on November 4, 2016. It does not change the thrust of the staff
appraisal.
2.

There have been some movements in Mexico’s financial markets in recent days.
The Mexican peso depreciated by about 14 percent between November 8 and November 11,
following the U.S. election. Over the same period, the 10-year local currency sovereign bond
yield increased by about 100 basis points, compared to a 30 basis point increase in the U.S.
10-year bond yield, and the stock market declined 7.5 percent in local currency terms. On
November 9, the authorities held a press conference emphasizing that Mexico’s fundamentals
remained strong, underpinned by the structural reforms underway, sound fiscal management,
and the credible inflation targeting framework, supported by exchange rate flexibility. They
added that net international reserves remained adequate and in addition the country was
eligible to draw up to US$86 billion under the Flexible Credit Line. No policy actions were
required, although they would continue to monitor the situation closely.
3.

The state-owned oil company PEMEX released a five-year business plan in early
November. The plan envisages the company will return to a primary surplus in 2017 and will
have a balanced budget by 2020. In the short term, the focus will be on improving efficiency
and profitability by focusing investment on high-return activities. In the medium term,
PEMEX will rely increasingly on partnerships with the private sector to increase investment
and production, and improve the efficiency of operations in certain business areas. The
company has already announced three auctions for joint oil exploration and production, to be
completed by April 2017. PEMEX has also pursued an active debt management strategy in
recent months, extending its average debt maturity.
