STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
April 15, 2015

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The recovery is addressing flow imbalances from past current account and fiscal
deficits, but stock vulnerabilities from public, private, and external debt remain high.
The unemployment rate has retreated from its crisis peak, growth has resumed, and the
current account is posting surpluses for the first time in decades. At the same time, a durable
rebalancing of the economy has not taken place and the nontradable sector is still
dominant. The strength of the economic recovery remains modest, the labor market slack
large, and there are still material vulnerabilities, notably, high leverage in the public and
corporate sectors, and high external debt.
Portugal is benefiting from favorable cyclical tailwinds, but growth is projected to
moderate in the medium term. The initiation of ECB’s expanded asset purchase program
pushed sovereign yields to record lows and effectively eliminated any remaining financing
concerns. It should also help to raise inflation over the forecast horizon. A sharply weaker
euro and lower oil prices have improved the short-term outlook. In the medium term,
growth is projected to moderate, as several remaining challenges, notably low investment,
high leverage, and structural bottlenecks still need to be decisively addressed.
The authorities should use this opportunity to strengthen the economy’s resilience and
raise its growth potential. Fiscal adjustment should continue, with an emphasis on
expenditure rationalization by way of a comprehensive reform of public sector wages and
pensions. To maintain financial stability and allow for an efficient allocation of resources in
the economy, the authorities should adopt a more proactive approach led by banks to the
deleveraging process. Finally, in the context of rigid labor markets and limited domestic
competition, the authorities must implement additional structural reforms to absorb the
large labor slack and spur economic growth.

CONTEXT—POST-CRISIS STABILIZATION
1.
Following a decade of running large current account deficits, Portugal attained a
balanced current account position over the course of the 2011–14 EFF, but at the cost of large
internal slack. In the run-up to and since euro adoption, easy access to external financing enabled
Portugal to finance imports, largely for consumption and investment in the non-tradable sector.
With the accompanying erosion of competitiveness, productivity growth continued its inexorable
decline while economic growth stagnated—real GDP barely grew between the early 2000s and
today—and a large external imbalance arose.1 The “sudden stop” in 2011 forced an adjustment that
corrected the flow imbalance, and Portugal’s external position stabilized. The accompanying
collapse in domestic demand contributed to a large internal imbalance, with unemployment peaking
at 17.5 percent in 2013 before beginning to decline; labor market slack, a broader measure of labor
under-utilization, is still around 20 percent.2

Portugal’s rebound has been characterized by a U-shaped recovery. The economy has
expanded at close to 1 percent per year on average since early 2013, with growth driven largely by
consumption. Following the front-loaded fiscal adjustment under the program, the 2014 fiscal deficit
narrowed to 3.5 percent of GDP (excluding one-off operations), resulting in a second successive year
of 1 percent structural primary adjustment. The better fiscal outturn relative to earlier projections
partly reflected cyclical factors, as rising consumption and employment contributed to good revenue

This analysis uses the Swan diagram, a macroeconomic model of a small open economy. An economy attains
internal balance (IB) when it has full employment and stable prices. External balance (EB) requires equilibrium
in the balance of payments. For a discussion of the Swan diagram see Reinert, K. (ed.) 2009. The Princeton
encyclopedia of the world economy, pp. 1049–1052.

The main recommendations of the 2012 Article IV Consultation were incorporated into
the EFF (see Annex I). Despite significant progress made on many fronts in the period since then,
increasing competitiveness remains an important challenge, as elaborated in the current report.
4.
The banking system is recovering gradually, but the return to profitability remains
elusive. Banks’ capital declined in 2014, with the average CT1 ratio falling by 0.5 percentage point to
11.4 percent. The loan-to-deposit ratio has been declining steadily, allowing banks to reduce their
reliance on Eurosystem refinancing operations. The stock of non-performing loans continued to rise,
a reflection of the slow progress toward repairing corporate balance sheets. Income from financial
operations and trading has not been sufficient to offset losses due to provisions and impairments,
and high operating costs. The sale of Novo Banco is proceeding as scheduled, and other mergers
and acquisitions of large banks are under consideration. 3

Novo Banco is the bridge bank created at the time of the resolution of Banco Espírito Santo (BES), to which
critical functions and viable operations of BES were transferred. For further discussion, see Box 4 in IMF Country
Report 15/21.

The trend of downward inflation
pressures, boosted more recently by falling
energy prices, appears to have been arrested.
Core inflation has stabilized in recent months,
but remains low at 0.3 percent due to the
sizeable output gap. Portugal’s overall inflation
now exceeds that of the euro area for the first
time in two years.
6.
The authorities have begun early
repurchases of outstanding Fund credit. In
March, the authorities repurchased €6.6 billion—
almost one quarter of the total owed to the
Fund—coinciding with the initiation of the
European Central Bank’s expanded asset purchase
program (QE), and benefitting from favorable
market conditions. Early repurchases are overall
expected to result in interest cost savings
exceeding €500 million, but offset to some
degree by recent valuation losses from the euro’s
depreciation against the SDR basket, as the initial
IMF purchases were not fully hedged.

Staff’s views
7.
The near-term outlook is benefiting from the trifecta of record-low interest rates, a
weakening euro, and low oil prices. The initiation of QE proved to be a sea change. With a total
envelope for Portugal of to up to €1 billion a month, sovereign bond purchases could amount to the
equivalent of about 60 percent of planned debt issuance in 2015, alleviating remaining concerns on
Portugal meeting its financing needs in 2015–16. A sharply weaker euro—also likely associated at
least in part with QE—and lower oil prices have improved the outlook further. Staff’s growth
projections for 2015 and 2016 have accordingly been revised up. The outlook for inflation has also
improved over the forecast horizon.

As the additional bounce from short-term factors fades, growth is projected to
moderate over the medium term.


To absorb the large labor market slack by creating jobs, the economy needs to raise investment,
while enhancing external competitiveness to avoid generating an external imbalance. For a
currency union member with limited fiscal space, this can only be achieved through structural
reforms, which have so far not fully delivered the desired outcomes. Many of the structural
reforms initiated since 2011 still need to be

During the program, staff was of the view that
sustained implementation of structural
reforms would reverse the decline in
productivity growth observed over the last
half-century, resulting in medium-term growth
of 1¾ percent. With more limited progress on
structural reforms, however, staff projects
growth of only around 1¼ percent in the
medium term, ¼ percentage points below the

Portugal’s external position remains slightly weaker than implied by medium-term
fundamentals and desirable policy settings. The EBA estimates are mixed, with the REER gap
estimates—ranging from -5 to 9 percent—broadly reflecting the achievement of short-term external
balance. As internal demand conditions normalize, competitiveness will suffer, barring further reform
effort (see Swan Diagram). Furthermore, the EBA estimates do not fully capture the burden of the
large negative NIIP and the need to ambitiously reduce labor slack. Alleviating this burden will
require sustained current account surpluses at or above the projected 2015 level over the medium
term (see Annex III).

The risks to the outlook are mostly on the upside. Global liquidity and risk aversion are
favorable but could unwind rapidly due to potentially disruptive tail events—most notably, any
volatility associated with turmoil at the euro-area level (see Risk Assessment Matrix). Public and
private balance sheets are highly exposed to these risks. In addition, Portugal’s trade with and

Authorities’ views
11.
Authorities emphasized the role of largely permanent factors in spread compression. A
comprehensive European crisis backstop has successfully been put in place, and market participants
now view the new arrangements as credible, though most expect a slightly larger spread
differentiation than before the crisis. This favorable environment will raise growth in 2015 and 2016
above what had been expected only a few months ago. The authorities, however, expressed concern
that low yields and compressed spreads could possibly lead to the accumulation of external
imbalances in the future.
12.
The medium-term outlook is positive. Portugal’s external competitiveness has improved
and the re-balancing between tradable and nontradable sector is well underway, as signified by
both stronger employment and credit growth in the tradable sector, and the robust growth of
exports. As a result, the economy will grow faster in the medium term, fueled by investment, the
rising stock of human capital, and the continued strength of external demand. Even though the
banking system still faces important challenges, the economic recovery (in tandem with a supportive
monetary policy stance) should create supportive conditions for corporate and bank balance sheet
repair.

FOCUS—RESILIENCE AND GROWTH
A. Fiscal Path
Fiscal adjustment, with an emphasis on expenditure rationalization, should continue.
Background
13.
In 2014, fiscal adjustment continued, but the stock of public debt increased. The fiscal
deficit narrowed to 4.5 percent of GDP in 2014, below the authorities’ target of 4.8 percent, primarily
reflecting an under-execution of investment spending. Excluding several large one-off transactions
related to SOE and banking support operations the deficit fell to 3.5 percent of GDP, amounting to a
structural fiscal adjustment of 1 percent of GDP. The debt-to-GDP ratio, at 130.2 percent, was
slightly higher than originally projected—despite the better-than-expected outturn—due to the
adverse valuation effects of euro depreciation, additional debt issuance to maintain the
government’s cash buffer, and a downward revision to nominal GDP.
14.
The authorities have not yet defined a structural primary adjustment path beyond
2015. The 2014 Fiscal Strategy Document envisages a minimum structural adjustment effort of
½ percent of GDP per year, in line with the European Treaty on Stability, Coordination, and
Governance framework.4 The authorities, however, have not yet specified concrete measures to
support their medium-term fiscal strategy; a new Stability Program is expected to be issued at the
end of April.
15.
Arrears remain a challenge, although significant progress has been made. In 2014,
arrears were reduced by €367 million (20 percent), mainly through the implementation of the
government clearance strategy. In particular, the strategy provided additional funding to public
hospitals (€151 million), leading to the

Staff’s views
16.
Fiscal policy should be guided foremost by sustainability considerations. Despite the
notable consolidation achieved to date, Portugal remains vulnerable to shifts in market sentiment
due to its high stock of public debt (the third-highest in the euro area following Greece and Italy),
large refinancing needs, small size of the economy, and weak growth prospects. Even though the
debt-to-GDP ratio is to see decline in 2015, the projected decline over the medium term is modest,
reaching 121 percent in 2020. As noted in Annex IV, debt dynamics remain highly vulnerable to
adverse yet plausible macro-fiscal and contingent liabilities shocks. A more pronounced decline in
the debt ratio, consistent with a return to debt sustainability, would hinge on greater fiscal
adjustment than under the baseline in addition to structural reforms to boost growth.
17.
There will be a slight relaxation of the fiscal stance in 2015. Staff projects a fiscal deficit
of 3.2 percent of GDP for 2015—marginally above the excessive deficit procedure target of
3 percent of GDP—and higher than the budgeted 2.7 percent of GDP. The difference relative to the
budget target primarily reflects more pessimistic revenue assumptions, as the budget incorporates
large revenue gains from a range of measures to improve tax compliance and recover outstanding
tax debt. As a result, the structural primary balance is projected to deteriorate.
18.
Going forward, fiscal policy should be anchored around an annual structural primary
adjustment of 0.5 percent of GDP (Box 3). The current level of public debt and large borrowing
needs allow little space for counter-cyclical fiscal policy, and leaves Portugal vulnerable to a
significant worsening of debt dynamics should downside risks materialize. A primary adjustment
target would ensure that savings from the current low sovereign yields do not dilute the adjustment
effort and that the windfall gains from lower yields are fully devoted to reducing public debt and
restoring appropriate fiscal buffers. The adjustment should be achieved mainly through expenditure
rationalization in the context of introducing expenditure targets for each level of government. Under
this adjustment scenario, debt would decline to around 110 percent of GDP by 2020.

19.
The authorities should introduce multi-year expenditure targets to underpin a fiscal
adjustment based on spending rationalization. These targets would be consistent with the
structural primary balance targets discussed above, and in line with the expenditure benchmark of
the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP). This would help ensure that future adjustment focuses on
spending reform rather than on further revenue measures, given Portugal’s already-high tax burden.
To ensure effectiveness, such expenditure objectives should cover all general government
expenditure, and be sufficiently binding to anchor fiscal policy at all levels of government. This
would require enhancing the medium-term fiscal strategy and the central government mediumterm budget framework. Aggregate spending targets should also be set for local governments and
social security funds, with the recently created intergovernmental coordination council being
responsible for monitoring outturns and identifying in-year corrective measures.
20.
Specific policy measures to contain spending should be identified to enforce the
expenditure targets, with a focus on public sector wages and pensions, which together account
for nearly 25 percent of GDP and more than half of non-interest government spending. Under the
program, public wages were contained through temporary measures, while increases in pensions
have moderated. Still, the public wage cuts will be cancelled by 2016, and pension spending is
expected to rise, particularly in the public sector scheme (CGA). Additional offsetting measures are
therefore needed to alleviate spending pressures in these areas:


Measures on the wage bill have yielded smaller savings than expected due to successive CC
rulings and insufficiently robust reform design, and have not sufficiently addressed structural
weaknesses. While public employment was significantly reduced under the program (by almost
10 percent), cuts in public sector wages have failed to reduce the public-private sector
compensation gap. Schemes to increase efficiency and reduce costs in the public service—
special requalification pool and voluntary separations—have underperformed. In addition, the
modalities and phasing of the new single wage and supplement scales should be carefully
designed to avoid additional cost and excessive back-loading. Going forward, the CC has ruled
out additional nominal cuts in public wages, and required reforms be of a structural nature
rather than across-the-board cuts. Hence, priority should be given to further reducing the
number of employees through higher natural attrition and targeted cuts in overstaffed areas.
Mechanisms for departure should also be enhanced.5 Structural measures should aim at limiting
automatic wage increases and career progression in order to generate permanent savings of
about 0.1 percent of GDP per year.



The recent CC rulings cancelling the targeted pension measures call for a more comprehensive
approach to pension reform. The authorities should make progress in adopting a new indexation
rule based on economic factors that would automatically adjust benefits to ensure sustainability
of the pension system. In addition, the suspension of early retirements that was introduced in
2012, and lifted in 2015, should be reinstated, to contain the increase in the number of retirees

Savings from a reduction of the workforce by additional 10 percent are estimated at around 0.5 percent of
GDP. See “Rethinking the State – Selected Expenditure Reform Options,” IMF Country Report 13/6.

over the coming years. In the short and medium term, public sector employees’ contribution to
CGA could increase to improve its financial sustainability.
21.
Further structural fiscal reforms are needed to reduce fiscal risks enforce fiscal
adjustment, and support growth. While reforms of tax administration and health care have
already yielded tangible pay-offs, fiscal risks persist in the following areas:


SOEs and hospitals. The financial situation of SOEs and hospitals has generally improved with the
additional financing provided by the government in 2014, but restructuring should proceed
resolutely to address structural challenges and reduce high levels of debt.



PPPs. While annual gross payments related to PPPs are expected to be reduced by about 2025 percent following successful contract renegotiations, they will remain a drag on the budget,
stabilizing at about €1.5 billion (0.8 percent of 2015 GDP) until 2022, before slowly declining to
about €0.6 billion in 2030. Re-negotiations of concessions and PPPs should therefore be
pursued forcefully.



Budgeting and public administration. Priority should be given to the finalization and adoption of
a new Budget Framework Law. Envisaged reforms are in line with staff advice, with a more
strategic and medium-term perspective to budgeting, a consolidation of all government
revenues in the Treasury single account, and a gradual move to accrual accounting. In addition,
staff recommends that more responsibility be devolved to line ministries for managing their
budget, with their financial accountability should be strengthened accordingly. The authorities
should also reduce public administration fragmentation, particularly at the central government
level, to limit duplication and to better monitor fiscal risks.



Within the sustainability constraint, fiscal
policy should promote growth and alleviate
bottlenecks to employment. Spending
reforms should create space for targeted tax
measures to support private sector
deleveraging through the introduction of a
deduction for corporate equity, and increase
labor force participation through social
security cuts to address localized labor
market malfunctions. Scaling up public
investment to support growth may not be
needed, given the high level and quality of
public capital stock compared to other euro
area countries.

Authorities’ views
22.
The authorities’ 2015 deficit target of 2.7 percent of GDP is well within reach. The
authorities were encouraged by the initial results from their efforts to improve tax compliance. They
believe that the revenue from their efforts to (i) reduce fraudulent VAT refund claims, (ii) curb tax
evasion related to income from rental properties, and (iii) recover outstanding tax debt will exceed
staff’s expectations. In addition, the authorities were confident that any spending pressures could be
accommodated within their budgeted contingency reserve. The cash revenue outturn for JanuaryFebruary was in line with the authorities’ projections.
23.
Further fiscal adjustment—properly measured—is needed. The authorities agreed in
principle that further fiscal adjustment is needed to safeguard debt sustainability, with a mediumterm focus on expenditure rationalization. However, they noted complications in defining the
adjustment in structural terms in order to provide a useful operational target. In particular, they
cited significant uncertainly about calculations of potential output in Portugal, and the related
difficulties in differentiating between structural and cyclical developments in assessing fiscal
performance.

B. Deleveraging
Successful deleveraging is a precondition for strong growth.
Background
24.
The authorities’ deleveraging framework has stopped short of a systemic solution, and
the level of corporate debt—albeit declining—remains high. The deleveraging framework has
been largely put in place. It includes significant changes to the institutional and legal framework for
corporate debt restructuring (such as lowering the

Staff’s views
25.
Eliminating the corporate debt overhang is essential for Portugal’s recovery (Box 4).
With the banking system still facing high operating costs, overcapacity, and weakening asset quality,
waiting for economic growth to improve bank profitability would likely be disappointing. Therefore,
credit misallocation would persist, as bank assets remain to a large extent tied up in less productive
sectors and investment would remain constrained, further weakening the economic recovery.6
Successful deleveraging would reverse this dynamic by allowing banks to reallocate resources
toward viable firms that will in turn increase their investment, supporting economic growth.
26.
Banks should take advantage of the current supportive economic and financial
environment to tackle the corporate debt overhang more ambitiously. They should raise more
capital, increase provisioning and accelerate the pace of write-offs. This would open up space for
new growth-enhancing lending and lower the risks to financial stability.
27.
Corporations, with the authorities’ help, should do their part as well. The authorities
must encourage corporate governance reform to encourage firm owners to retain more earnings
and inject new equity into their companies. To reduce the tax debt bias, the authorities could
complement their on-going efforts to reduce the deductibility of debt interest by introducing a
deduction of equity for corporate income tax.
Authorities’ views
28.
The deleveraging strategy in place appears to be working. The recent decline in
corporate debt—across all sectors and firms’ sizes—has been facilitated in part by equity injections
from foreign investors and by the equity-favoring tax incentives. The authorities felt that a gradual
pace of deleveraging would better safeguard financial stability and that banks may not be able to
raise sufficient capital should the process be accelerated.

C. Structural Reforms
With fiscal adjustment set to remain a drag on domestic demand and corporate deleveraging taking
time, structural reforms offer the main tool to increase external competitiveness and potential growth.
Background
29.
Even though the number of newly implemented structural measures has fallen with
the expiration of the program, there were several notable developments.


The number of new collective bargaining contracts in 2014 approached levels last seen in 2011,
and more contracts were reached at the firm level.



GPEARI—the planning unit of the Ministry of Finance—has been given a formal mandate by the
Council of Ministers to coordinate the process of evaluating structural reforms



There is now a proposal to impose a one-time levy on GALP, the largest natural gas provider. If
the levy becomes effective, it would be applied to reduce gas prices by 3 to 5 percent for end
users for each of the next three years.



Renegotiation of one port concession contract has been completed, with the remaining four
expected to follow suit soon.



New bylaws for 18 services and regulated professions were approved by the Council of Ministers
and are currently under discussion in Parliament.



The judicial reforms are starting to pay off. For instance, the simplified, centralized, and
electronic system of garnishments of bank accounts under the new Code of Civil Procedure
enabled the seizure and recovery of €0.3 billion in enforced claims in a little over a year.

Staff’s views
30.
The recovery projected in the baseline is too mild to return the economy to full
employment over the medium term. Portugal faces adverse capital and labor trends, i.e. negative
net investment in the short term, and a falling working-age population in the short- and medium
term. Therefore, the baseline rate of growth is insufficient to absorb the slack in the labor market
through job creation, and job prospects for the lower-skilled in particular would remain dire (Box 5).
31.
To raise growth and absorb the large internal slack, further structural reforms should
zero in on alleviating impediments to external competitiveness (Box 6) and potential growth.
The adjustment program already initiated and implemented a large number of structural reforms,
sometimes against the opposition of well-entrenched lobbies and interests. The challenge for
policymakers will be to build on this achievement. And this should involve revisiting those reforms
that have not yielded the hoped-for-results, fully implementing already initiated reforms, and
addressing remaining bottlenecks through fresh reforms.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

PORTUGAL

32.
Upgrading the quality of public services and policies remains critical for the
competitiveness of firms and the well-being of citizens. Staff’s firm survey suggests that some of
the public sector reforms are in urgent need of being revisited or stepped up, with firms that export
particularly concerned about the lack of reform pay-offs so far (Box 1). In this context, reform areas
that deserve special attention include raising the effectiveness of public administrations at the
central and local levels, reviewing the functioning of the courts, and increasing the payment
discipline of public sector entities. Only a deep-rooted reform of the state may be able to yield
tangible results in these reform areas.
33.
Improving the functioning of product markets requires fully implementing initiated
reforms. Measures aimed at reducing the cost of energy, the use of transport infrastructure, and the
costs of professional and other services still need to be implemented and then evaluated whether
they achieved their objectives. The competition authority needs to have the resources and political
support to move more aggressively against anti-competitive practices in sheltered sectors.
Moreover, more market integration at the European level would benefit Portugal. While the legacy
costs of past policy mistakes are now difficult to fully undo in areas such as energy or road transport
infrastructure, it will be important to avoid sliding back to previous policy habits in these areas.
34.
Fresh reform ideas and initiatives are especially needed in the labor market area, while
avoiding policies that undermine job creation. A significant effort has already been made to use
active labor market policies to improve skills and labor market attachment of workers. But the
productivity of workers, especially of the low skilled, also depends critically on the skills of managers,
where Portugal ranks relatively low in cross-country comparisons. The effectiveness and scope of
programs to promote managerial skills in Portugal should therefore be reviewed. Keeping workers
without jobs attached to the labor market will require a more inclusive unemployment support
system, for example by reducing the minimum contribution period for eligibility and reducing
inactivity traps, especially for older workers. With an increasing share of workers paid at the
minimum wage, further premature increases would lower the chances of lower-skilled workers to
make the transition from inactive or unemployed status to jobs. While minimum wages can be
useful to prevent worker abuse and provide a floor for income, excessive increases can hurt the very
people they are intended to help. Experiences in other countries suggest there are more effective
tools available to fight poverty than the minimum wage.

35.
Structural reforms are never easy, but the current environment is the most conducive
for undertaking them from an economic and financial stability point of view. (Box 7). Natural
inertia and substantial vested interests will work to neutralize challenges to the status quo. The
current post-crisis recovery, however, is a good time to push for institutional change, as the pitfalls
of the existing system have just been vividly demonstrated. The nascent recovery and the benign
financing conditions—helped by the cyclical tailwinds—can mitigate the costs of transition. For the
long term, the key would be to create a natural domestic constituency for such a change. In this
context, social partners have a special responsibility to promote job creation by supporting policies
that increase the country’s competitiveness. A more inclusive and transparent social partner
dialogue would facilitate reaching cooperative solutions that benefit all stakeholders.
Authorities’ views
36.
The wide range of structural reforms implemented under the program is already
paying off. While the authorities agree that more needs to be done, they stress that (i) the yetunseen benefits of many reforms, such as the corporate deleveraging strategy, will become more
visible in the near future and (ii) the already-observed improvements, such as gains in external
competitiveness, can be easily sustained in the medium term. The authorities also argued that
implementation of product market reforms remains on track, as illustrated by recent steps in the
areas of energy and transport infrastructure. On labor market, the authorities noted the challenges
inherent in further reducing employment protection and argued that lowering duration of
unemployment benefits for older workers while widening the coverage would go against their
contributive nature.

POINT—COUNTERPOINT
The key elements of the staff’s views are challenged below, in order to provide the reader a better
sense of the arguments and counterarguments.
37.

Following the large fiscal effort under the program, further adjustment is not needed.

Argument: With yields at record lows and substantial fiscal adjustment already implemented,
further fiscal effort will only depress domestic demand and jeopardize the nascent recovery.
Counterargument: Under the baseline scenario, the high level of public debt is projected to
decline, but only gradually. Should the current favorable financing conditions be reversed or the
recovery stall, debt sustainability concerns could quickly re-emerge, especially since the borrowing
needs remain large. In that case, another pro-cyclical fiscal adjustment would become unavoidable.
Consequently, the authorities must take advantage of the favorable external environment to reduce
debt and begin rebuilding fiscal buffers.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

PORTUGAL

38.

Portugal has substantially completed critical structural reforms under the program.

Argument: Structural reforms take time and should be allowed to bear fruit. Introducing additional
reforms now will exacerbate uncertainty (which is detrimental to growth), while any potential
benefits will only accrue in the distant future, if at all.
Counterargument: It must be acknowledged that much has been done and these reforms take time
to bear fruit. Nevertheless, doing nothing more is a risky strategy. As described in the report,
Portugal is still lagging behind its peers in key structural indicators. Modest economic growth,
persistent slack in the labor market, and the remaining vulnerabilities all point to the need to push
forward the reform agenda in key areas.
39.
The focus on corporate deleveraging is misplaced, as improved growth prospects will
alleviate any remaining debt overhang.
Argument: Large-scale corporate deleveraging will only exacerbate the banks’ losses and eventually
necessitate public intervention at the taxpayers’ expense. It is much better to let the economy grow
and the problem will take care of itself.
Counterargument: The gradual approach used so far has been less than fully successful. The banks
have incentives to keep unviable companies afloat, and the stock of non-performing loans has
continued to rise while profitability has been difficult to achieve, increasing the risks to financial
stability. More broadly, delaying the deleveraging process perpetuates the misallocation of
resources and undermines the prospects for economic recovery.
40.
The burden of adjustment was not shared fairly across stakeholders over the past few
years.
Argument: The adjustment may have been necessary, but its burden was borne excessively by the
ordinary citizens. In particular, labor market reforms undermined collective bargaining at a great
cost to workers, while the financial institutions (and their wealthy owners) were bailed out.
Counterargument: Job creation in Portugal required easing constraints on exports, through greater
labor market flexibility, and restoring credit to viable firms, by strengthening financial stability. Labor
market reforms have introduced much-needed flexibility into the labor market by allowing contracts
to be negotiated at the firm level. Financial sector reforms, aimed at shoring up bank capital and
restoring profitability, averted widespread financial system instability, which would have imposed
even higher costs on taxpayers. In addition, even though the number of new collective bargaining
contracts did decline during the crisis period, it was likely due to the challenging economic
environment. As the recovery took hold in 2014, the number of new contracts increased.

STAFF APPRAISAL
41.
In the wake of the crisis, Portugal has successfully attained a balanced current account
position, but unavoidably at the cost of generating large internal slack. The rising flow
imbalances from excessive current account and fiscal deficits in the pre-crisis years were reversed, as
the current account turned to surplus for the first time in decades and fiscal deficits declined. That,
however, came at the cost of weak domestic demand leading to output contraction and high
unemployment. The subsequent recovery, already two years old, has not been strong enough to
bring output and employment back to pre-crisis levels, and labor market slack remains high.
Restoring internal balance without undermining the external position thus remains the most
important policy priority.
42.
A confluence of factors has boosted the near-term outlook significantly, but raising
medium-term growth prospects remains a challenge. The ECB’s expanded asset purchase
program brought about historically low sovereign yields and contributed to the weak euro, and
Portugal—a net oil importer—is benefitting further from a dramatic fall in oil prices. Taking
advantage of this favorable environment, the authorities have begun early repurchases of the Fund
credit outstanding, which are welcome. At the same time, the economic recovery is being driven
largely by consumption, and Portugal still lags behind its peers in key structural reform indicators,
resulting in weaker medium-term growth prospects.
43.
The authorities should use the unique opportunity afforded by the strong cyclical
tailwinds wisely. Despite the notable flow improvements, Portugal’s position is still precarious due
to the remaining large stocks of public, private, and external debt. To minimize risks and improve
the country’s growth prospects, the authorities should focus on rationalizing public expenditure,
encouraging the corporate deleveraging process, and improving competitiveness by way of
structural reforms.
44.
The authorities should target an annual structural primary adjustment of 0.5 percent
of GDP based on expenditure rationalization. Given Portugal’s already-high tax burden, the
authorities should introduce multi-year expenditure targets to ensure that adjustment focuses on
expenditure reform. Particular attention should be paid to the comprehensive reform of wages and
pensions, which together account for more than a half of all non-interest government spending.
45.
A systemic solution to the problem of excessive leverage is needed. Not only do the
banks that keep too much bad credit on their books endanger financial stability, they are also
unable to finance the economic recovery. With the authorities’ involvement and encouragement,
banks should raise more capital and accelerate the pace of debt write-offs, while corporates must
end their excessive reliance on debt at the expense of equity.

46.
The authorities should implement further structural reforms to improve growth
prospects and reduce labor market slack. The efforts should focus on alleviating bottlenecks by
enhancing local competition (notably in the energy sector) and labor market flexibility. Particular
attention should be paid to the problem of low-skilled workers, who suffered disproportionally
during the crisis. Investing in vocational training, improving managerial skills, reducing disincentives
to work, and making the social dialogue more inclusive are all important steps in that direction.
47.
Staff recommends the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

Box 1. How Effective Were Structural Reforms? A Firm-Level Perspective
This box summarizes the results of a survey of Portuguese firms about the effectiveness of structural
reforms. The survey questions covered 35 structural reform areas implemented under the adjustment program
and asked for firms’ views on the impact of the reforms on their competitiveness and growth prospects as well
as firms’ perceptions of the urgency of further structural reform efforts in a given area. The survey sample
included a group of large firms and a group of small- and medium-sized (SMEs) firms. The results reported in
Box 1 Table 1 are broken down by firms classified as exporters and non-exporters. More details on survey
design and results are reported in the Selected Issues Paper.
Starting with the perceived impact of reforms (first two columns in Box 1 Table 1), the survey results
suggest that most reforms had some positive impact. Exporting firms generally perceived that reforms had
more positive impacts than non-exporting firms. Labor market reforms were seen as the reform field with the
highest positive impact, while product market reforms were singled out as the reform field with least impact.
However, very few reforms were perceived as having had significant impacts. Exporting firms considered that
reforms in the areas of increasing work time flexibility and reducing the cost of paying taxes had significant
positive impacts. Non-exporting firms shared this view as regards reducing the cost of paying taxes.
There seemed to be strong consensus across firms that many of the structural reforms in the public and
financial sectors are in need of being re-visited or stepped up (last two columns in Box 1 Table 1).
Exporting firms in particular see an urgent need for additional reforms to increase the effectiveness of public
administration, both at the central and local levels. They also see an urgent need to upgrade the effectiveness
of the various courts of the justice system, to improve the payments discipline of public sector entities,
particularly of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and to further ameliorate the workings of the insolvency and
corporate debt restructuring frameworks.
The perceived urgency of additional reforms was generally much lower with respect to labor and
product market reforms. However, exporters tended to perceive close-to-urgent needs to step up reforms in
the areas of energy, road pricing, costs of using railways, enforcement of competition, and hiring and firing
costs.
Firm surveys may not always capture the actual outcomes of structural reforms. Respondents may not be
aware of the actual reform outcomes but nevertheless have opinions. To mitigate this bias, the survey provided
the option to decline answering a question if the respondent felt she lacked the information to assess the
impact of or need for more reforms. At the same time, perceptions, whether they are rooted in actual reform
outcomes or not, may matter greatly for firms’ decisions regarding job creation or investments.
Some of the structural reforms may also need more time to be perceived as having had an impact. This
may in particular be the case for some of the public and financial sector reforms whose effectiveness depends
on changing deep-rooted behaviors on the sides of public administration, the justice system, regulators, or
banks. In these cases, if firms perceive an urgent need for more reforms, this could also be consistent with
reforms just not having paid off visibly so far.
Given these caveats, the survey should be repeated at regular time intervals. For example, a similar firm
survey could be conducted again in a year’s time or so to check whether perceptions of the effectiveness of
structural reforms have evolved in the right direction.

Box 2. Portugal's Regained Market Access: Opportunities and Risks

Despite improved fundamentals, other factors
seem to have been principally responsible for the
decline in spreads. Plotting the average ratings of
the three major agencies against 10 year bond
spreads indicates a dramatic shift downward in
spreads across the board. While average country
ratings have improved modestly over this time
period, Portugal would have required a significantly
higher rating to have earned its current spread in the
summer of 2012. Other indicators of economic
fundamentals for Portugal such as the
unemployment rate, GDP growth, public debt, and
the current account balance support the same
conclusion.

Box 3. Growth-Friendly Fiscal Adjustment
Recent fiscal adjustment has relied on revenue measures,
with considerable scope to improve spending efficiency.
Weak expenditure control played a key role in the build-up of
fiscal imbalances prior to the crisis, as real primary spending
growth outpaced real GDP growth for all levels of government,
and particularly in the social security sector (Table 1). Since
then, fiscal adjustment has been heavily revenue-based, with
an increase in government revenue of 4.0 percent of GDP from
2010-2014. Going forward, the authorities should focus fiscal
adjustment on rationalizing public expenditure, by
implementing expenditure targets for all levels of government.

part through temporary measures that will prove insufficient to
ensure fiscal sustainability (Figure 1). Spending on pensions has increased at a slower pace under the adjustment
program, and reforms have partially addressed long term sustainability issues. But spending is expected to increase in
the short and medium term, particularly to finance the public sector pension scheme (CGA), due to the excessive back
loading of pension savings. Structural high quality policy measures are therefore needed to alleviate spending pressures
in these areas.

Tax wedge (percent of labor costs)

Fiscal targeted measures can support efforts to reduce
corporate leveraging and unemployment. Tax policy could
further contribute to reducing tax debt bias, by introducing a
deduction for corporate equity under the CIT. Revenue cost
(estimated to about 0.5 percent of GDP) could be mitigated by
applying the deduction only to new investment. Fiscal policy can
also help address labor market inefficiencies. In Portugal, the
working-age population is significantly lower than in other
countries with comparable tax wedge rates (Figure 2). Given fiscal
constraints, targeted cuts in employers’ social security
contribution could address the high level of unemployment of
low-skilled and youth workers, by lowering the labor costs of
these specific populations, while limiting revenue costs.

Box 4. Corporate and Bank Balance Sheet Repair: Recent Progress and Remaining Challenges
The corporate sector experienced rapid debt accumulation prior to the crisis. Following the adoption of
the euro, large capital inflows and low funding costs fuelled the build-up of debt imbalances in the corporate
sector, especially in the non tradable sector. Recently, the pace of corporate deleveraging picked up, but the
stock of corporate debt remains among the highest in the EU.
Excessive corporate leverage continues to constrain
business investment. A declining interest coverage
ratio (from 3.9 in 2010 to 2.9 in 2014 for micro and SMEs
and from 10.4 in 2010 to 4.3 in 2014 for large firms) and
the high share of firms with overdue loans (31 percent as
of January 2015), are indicative of the impact of the debt
overhang on the corporate side, which in the short run
impairs firms’ ability to invest and in the long run
renders firms unviable. On the bank side, the continued
rise of non-performing loans impacts profitability and
constrains new lending to viable firms.

Corporates and banks face disincentives to speed up
the deleveraging process. The corporate sector is dominated by SMEs where, due to weak corporate
governance, firm owners typically distribute (rather than retain) earnings, shifting the risk from firms to banks.
On the bank side, the reliance on lending that is collateralized, including by underlying assets for which there is
no obvious valuation, creates an incentive for banks to postpone provisions and debt write-offs until the
economic recovery takes hold, despite eroding profitability.
The authorities have taken steps to facilitate corporate debt restructuring. The institutional and legal
framework was enhanced, including (i) introducing a less favorable tax treatment of debt financing, (ii)
lowering the threshold for creditor approval in restructuring plans, (iii) streamlining and strengthening in and
out-of-court workouts (PER, SIREVE), and (iv) developing an early warning system. However, these steps are not
enough to significantly reduce the debt overhang, resulting in constrained credit amid rising NPLs.
The current economic and financial environment affords an opportunity to tackle the corporate debt
overhang more ambitiously. A systemic approach, led by a body with sufficient resources and sway over
banks, could move the restructuring process forward. A standardized bank-led, time-bound framework that
calls on banks to raise more capital, increase provisioning, and accelerate the pace of write-offs to deal with
debt restructuring would pave the way for restoring the flow of private credit to viable firms, and supporting
economic growth. This would also help lower risks to financial stability by improving the overall asset quality of
the banking system.

Box 5. Creating Jobs for Lower-Skilled Workers
Absorbing labor slack over the medium term by creating jobs poses two challenges. First, Portugal’s postcrisis labor slack is very high. Second, much of the slack is concentrated in the lower-skilled segment of the
labor market (Box figure). The first challenge can be met by faster output growth based on a more exportoriented economy. To meet the second challenge, labor market and other policies will need to address the
special labor market integration needs of lower-skilled workers to achieve more inclusive growth.
A small, tractable model of the labor market is used to explore these issues. Labor demand is assumed to
be based on a production function that nests a first-stage CES function aggregating skilled and lower-skilled
labor into human capital within a Cobb-Douglas function that includes two types of capital goods. Labor
supply is set exogenously based on projections of the working-age population and on extrapolating past
trends in relative supplies of skilled and low-skilled workers. This model allows labor demand for skilled and
lower-skilled labor to reflect both skill-capital complementarities as well as skill-biased technological progress.
Assumptions for baseline scenario: In the baseline scenario, staff’s medium-term outlook for output and
investment is taken as given, the skill premium, defined as wages of skilled to low-skilled workers, is assumed
to decline in line with longer-term trends, and the production function is used to determine the demand for
skilled and low-skilled workers. On the labor supply side, to the extent that slack is not absorbed over the
medium term, the assumption is that discouraged workers included in the slack measure will lose labor market
attachment and involuntary part-time workers will be resigned to work shorter hours than they wish.
Assumptions for alternative absorption scenario: In the alternative scenario, medium-term targets are set
for the absorption of skilled and low-skilled labor, roughly bringing the overall employment rate back to the
pre-crisis (2008) levels. Migration flows are assumed to be unaffected by the higher rates of job creation, which
may be unrealistic as some migrants would likely return to Portugal if more jobs become available. In this
alternative scenario, the production function is used to determine the output and skill premium paths
consistent with the labor absorption targets.
The scenarios illustrate that absorbing lower-skilled workers by job creation requires faster growth and
more policy support. Given the assumption on labor demand and supply under the two scenarios, overall
labor slack will roughly fall to similar levels over the medium term. Therefore, comparing employment rates
under the two scenarios is more insightful than comparing slack rates. In the baseline scenario, job creation
would clearly be insufficient to bring employment rates back to pre-crisis levels, especially for low-skilled
workers (Box figure). Under the alternative scenario, the overall employment rate target is already pre-set, and
the simulation suggests that absorbing labor slack through job creation would not require unrealistically fast
output growth since absorbing low-skilled labor is not as growth-intensive as absorbing skilled labor. Labor
productivity growth is relatively low under the absorption scenario since employing more lower-skilled labor
than in the baseline depresses average productivity levels. This result also suggests that if lower-skilled labor
would be mainly absorbed through creating jobs in exporting firms, this would have to occur through
increasing exports that are relatively low on the value-added ladder.

Box 6. Structural Reforms to Boost External Competitiveness
Portugal achieved impressive external adjustments in the past few years. Gross exports as share of GDP rose
from just slightly above 30 percent in 2010 to over 40 percent in 2013. Such increase in gross exports led the
country to the largest current account improvement during this period among all EU countries, from a deficit of
10½ percent of GDP to a half-percent-of-GDP surplus.
The improved external performance needs to be maintained on a sustainable basis in the future. This, over
time, will help Portugal to reduce its still high external stock vulnerabilities, as indicated by both the large
negative net IIP (close to 120 percent of GDP at end-2013) and huge amount of gross external debt (around
215 percent of GDP at end-2014).
The sustainability of the improved external performance, however, cannot be taken for granted. When the
economy recovers, absent continued strengthening of external competitiveness, the picking up of domestic
consumption and higher investment—needed to help re-absorb the labor slack through job creation—will create
pressures that may lead to reopening of the external imbalances. Adding to the concern is the uncertainty on
competitiveness gains associated with the observed gross exports increase. Growth of gross exports often reflects
increases in both domestic-value added and imported intermediate inputs. In the latter case, the increase of
growth exports is not necessarily a reflection of competitiveness gains.
Domestic-value added (DVA) exports, as percent share of GDP, are a better measure of competitiveness
than gross exports and are closely linked to a small set of structural factors. With imported intermediated
inputs excluded, DVA exports reflect the true external demand for domestic products. While estimates of DVA
exports often come with significant time lags, historical information shows strong linkages between the levels of
DVA exports and some structural indicators. In particular, countries with (i) more flexible labor markets; (ii) more
developed manufacturing industries, relative to services sectors; (iii) more intense local competitions; and (iv)
higher integration with the global value-chain, tend to export more domestic value-added.

Cyprus, Malta and Luxeumberg are excluded from the sample. Croatia is not in the regressions because of missing DVA information. The sample

covers the period 2003-11. The indicator of local competition intensity became available only in 2005. Information on employment protection is
missing for Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania.

Going forward, Portugal should continue structural reforms in these key areas to boost external
competitiveness. Cross-country comparisons based on the latest information suggest that, while Portugal might
have come a long way in structural reforms, it still lags behind many of its peers, with rigid labor markets, high
(relative to income) energy prices, a low degree of domestic competition, and bias of FDI towards the
nontradable sectors.

Box 7. Further Structural Reforms and Institutional Transition
Portugal faces an acute growth challenge. Earlier boom episodes have largely been due to factor
accumulation, while the productivity growth has been declining over the past half-century. Looking forward,
Portugal’s working-age population is projected to fall, and the country’s capital stock is contracting because of
underinvestment.
An institutional transition that minimizes rent-seeking is key for raising productivity, attracting
investment, and jump-starting growth. While the nontradable sector is less productive than the tradable
sector, it offers opportunities for rent-seeking. This results in higher mark-ups, which makes the nontradable
sector an attractive investment destination and leads to misallocation of resources.

Portugal is in an advantageous starting position. A cross-country study finds that institutional transitions
are associated with trade openness, press freedom, “good” neighbors, and higher levels of education; aid, in
contrast, makes institutional transitions less likely (IMF, “Building institutions.” World Economic Outlook,
September 2005, 125–160).
In the Portuguese context—with abundant press freedom, “good” EU neighbors, and little emphasis on aid—
the focus should be on minimizing rent-seeking, developing the tradable sector, and further investment
in education. Steps to minimize rent-seeking would ensure that the country’s scarce resources are channeled
to productive activities and strengthen the clout of the pro-reform tradable sector companies. Better
education, with particular emphasis on vocational training, would allow the tradable sector companies to
compete more successfully in the global economy.

1/ The banking system data present a break in time series in 2014Q3 due to the resolution measure applied to Banco Espírito Santo (BES). The break in time series stems, in particular, from
the fact that the assets/liabilities not transferred to the balance sheet of Novo Banco (NB) are not considered in the aggregate of the banking system from August 2014 onwards. In the
absence of accounting information for BES on a consolidated basis for the period from 30 June 2014 to the day of implementation of the resolution measure (closing balance sheet and
statement of profit or loss), the reporting of BES on an individual basis, with reference to 31 July 2014, was considered when determining the aggregate results of the banking system for
2014Q3. However, the adjustments stemming from the resolution measure applied to BES were also not considered.
2/ On accounting basis; consolidated.
3/ New NPL ratio in line with international practices. On a consolidated basis.
4/ Three-month residual maturity.
5/ Loans to customers (net of impairments) and securitized non-derecognized credit to customers divided by resources from customers and other loans.
6/ Includes foreign currency deposits and deposit-like instruments of resident nonmonetary sector and claims of nonresident vis-à-vis resident monetary financial institutions (excluding
Bank of Portugal).

and Authorities’ Response
Fund policy recommendations
1.

Policy actions

Address accumulated financial imbalances

1.1 Fiscal (public sector imbalance)
(a) Rebalance the mix of revenue and expenditure adjustments
and bring it closer to one third revenue and two thirds
expenditure.

Consolidation continued to rely heavily on revenue measures (accounting for half of the
adjustment effort from 2011–2014), as Constitutional Court rulings cancelled spending cuts,
and required offsetting revenue measures.
Adjustment efforts were geared toward the wage bill and pension spending. However, some
of these measures were later reversed, especially nominal cuts in wages and pension
benefits.

(a.2) Spending cuts could be implemented while increasing
efficiency and equity, given the relatively high public
employment, high wage premium in comparison to
the private sector, and more generous pensions than
in peer countries alongside limited old-age poverty
alleviation.

Public employment was reduced by about 10 percent from 2011–2014. However, the public
wage premium proved difficult to reduce, with the wage cuts adopted in 2011 to be fully
reversed by 2016. Public pensions were aligned with private pension in 2014, and the
suspension of pensions’ indexation excluded minimum pensions, helping to improve
efficiency and equity.

(a.3) Implement a growth-oriented tax reform, which should
reduce distortions through streamlining and targeting
tax expenditures.

A comprehensive reform of the corporate income tax (CIT) was adopted in 2013 to gradually
reduce the statutory CIT rate, and improve tax provisions to retain multinational companies.
In 2014, a PIT reform improved incentives to work, and a green tax reform was introduced.
The cost of tax expenditures has been sharply reduced, particularly under the CIT.

(a.4) Strengthen tax compliance, including through greater
use of the anti-money laundering framework.

The authorities have implemented an ambitious tax compliance and anti-fraud strategy, and
adopted a new strategy for 2015–2017. Key measures included an automatic VAT invoice
system. Progress on improving compliance has been uneven for high wealth individuals and
self-employed professionals.

(b) Anchor fiscal discipline over the medium and long term.

The medium-term budget framework has been partially improved, with the formulation of a
no-policy change baseline. A draft Budget Framework Law (BFL) is being finalized to expand
the MTBF coverage to all central government spending.

(b.1) Reduce budget fragmentation.

The draft BFL is expected to reduce the number of budget appropriations, and reintegrate
some autonomous entities into line ministries.

(b.2) Improve the medium-term fiscal framework, including
by making it consistent with the EU fiscal compact.

The BFL is expected to revise the MTBF, and include all EU fiscal compact provisions in
Portuguese legal framework.

45

PORTUGAL

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

(a.1) The core of spending reforms should focus on social
transfers and public wages, which account for about
two thirds of the total spending.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

(b.3) Move towards accrual accounting.

Full accrual-based financial statements, including the general government balance sheet,
would be produced by 2019-2020, in line with FAD recommendations.

(b.4) Continue to build up a stronger implementation
capacity at the Ministry of Finance.

While key reforms improved fiscal reporting, capacity constraints in the Ministry of Finance
continue to impede their ability to manage and implement fiscal reforms.

1.2 Corporate deleveraging (private sector imbalance)
(c) Mitigate risks associated with corporate deleveraging.

The authorities took several steps to mitigate the risks associated with corporate
deleveraging, including strengthening supervision and regulation, and legal and institutional
frameworks.

(c.1) Apply regular supervisory inspections and stress test
exercises to ensure banks have adequate capital under
the baseline and are able to withstand adverse shocks.

Quarterly stress-testing, conducted during the EFF, allowed supervisors to assess the
resilience of Portuguese banks on a forward-looking basis. In addition, three systemic banks
took part in the ECB Comprehensive Assessment concluded in October 2014.

(c.2) Implement the new corporate and household debt
restructuring frameworks.

Institutional and legal frameworks for debt restructuring were strengthened under the EFF.
The authorities introduced, and subsequently refined, regimes for in-court (PER) and out-ofcourt (SIREVE) workouts. However, particularly in the case of PER, the new regime has had
limited effect. A TA mission on corporate debt restructuring visited Lisbon in January 2014,
and recommended a systemic approach to debt restructuring (especially for SMEs), which
has not been implemented.

(c.3) Use supervision and regulatory frameworks to limit
ever-greening and ensure that credit flows to the most
dynamic enterprises.

Under the EFF, the Bank of Portugal strengthened the regulatory framework for nonperforming loans and restructured credits. Recurrent impairment reviews have also
contributed to bolstering loss recognition by banks. However, NPLs are high and still rising,
reflecting the need for bank balance sheet repair.

(d) Counteract a renewed buildup of excessive leverage of bank
balance sheets.
(d.1) Use macro-prudential policy tools, such as net stable
funding and leverage ratios (consistent with Basel III
requirements).

Given the credit crunch experienced under the crisis, consideration of macro-prudential
policy tools was largely deferred until 2014.
In December 2014, the Bank of Portugal issued its first description of the objectives and
instruments that would comprise its macro-prudential toolkit (in line with ESRB
recommendations). Two instruments (systemic risk buffer and sectoral capital requirements)
are already available but have not yet been applied, and two others (countercyclical policy
buffer and the buffer for systemically important institutions) will be available from January 1,
2016 onwards.

A positive REER gap indicates overvaluation.
Source: IMF staff estimates.

While the EBA estimates (based on data through 2014) broadly reflect external

balance, large debt overhand and ongoing structural challenges lead staff to assess the
external position as slightly weaker than implied by medium term fundamentals and desirable
policy settings. The current account and external sustainability approaches suggests that the
exchange rate is undervalued, while the REER approaches suggest it is overvalued by as much as
eight percent (table 1). Given Portugal’s sizeable net foreign liabilities (110 percent of GDP in 2014),
the ES and the REER approaches—which give more weight to external indebtedness—are more
appropriate.


Under the CA approach the exchange rate is slightly undervalued. The CA surplus was
0.6 percent of GDP in 2014, corresponding to an estimated cyclically adjusted surplus of around
-0.1 percent of GDP. A model-based analysis indicates a norm of -2.0 percent of GDP for the
cyclically adjusted CA balance which would suggest a 5 percent undervaluation. The empirical
model contains a large regression residual which is not explained by policy gaps. Indeed, part of
the residual also likely reflects structural determinants not fully captured by the EBA model.
Reflecting these factors, staff assesses the norm at about -0.5 percent of GDP. Thus, the cyclically
adjusted CA would be around 0.4 percent of GDP stronger than that implied by fundamentals
and desirable policies.



Under the ES approach, the current account surplus needed to stabilize NFA at just above 60 percent of GDP is estimated at 0.2 percent of GDP. Staff now projects a medium-term

50

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PORTUGAL

current account surplus of 0.1 percent (compared with 1.7 used in EBA calculations), implying
broad exchange rate alignment by this metric. Yet, reaching the target NFA level at the debtstabilizing surplus would take many years. A more rapid increase in NFA is needed to mitigate
Portugal’s vulnerability to external shocks. A current account surplus of 1 percent would bring
NIIP down to 80 percent of GDP by 2020 reducing outstanding risks.


The REER approaches indicate an overvaluation of between 2.9 and 8.5 percent. The REER level
approach reflects an updated methodology which is independent of the year of normalization
for the REER and likely more accurately reflects underlying fundamentals.

Taken together, including updated staff forecasts, the estimates suggest a slight overvaluation
relative to medium term fundamentals. Recent euro depreciation against major currencies,
associated with QE, has caused a real effective depreciation of 3 percent since end-2014. This will
likely delay the effects of the overvaluation in the short term. Nevertheless policy action to improve
fundamentals will be needed to ensure competitiveness when the forces behind Euro-area-wide
depreciation unwind and to reduce risks from a high debt burden.
3.

Portfolio inflows have returned and risks of a sudden reversal are limited, but external

debt remains vulnerable to shocks. Portfolio inflowsprimarily public, but also privatehave
resumed and accelerated in 2014 on the back of regained sovereign market access, increasing from
close to zero in 2013 to 7 percent of GDP in 2014. Regarding public external debt, a more diversified
investor base, in terms of geography and investor class, and the issuance of debt securities at
maturities of up to 30 years mitigate the risks of a sudden reversal of these flows. The recovery of
portfolio inflows mirrors a reduction in other investment inflows, in part reflecting the end of
program financing. FDI inflows picked up slightly from 2013 to 4.8 percent of GDP in 2014, including
some large-scale inflows mostly related to investments in the auto industry but are down
significantly from their 2012 peak of 11 percent of GDP. Notwithstanding restored access to
international capital markets at sustainable rates and the reduction in external financing needs, the
small external surplus and sizeable external debt render Portugal vulnerable to shocks, as confirmed
by the external DSA (Figure 5).

Export performance and market share. While Portugal’s exports held up during the crisis,

benefitting from diversification away from the euro area to the rapidly growing emerging markets
(notably Angola, Brazil, and China), export growth slowed down in 2014. Goods exports declined in
part as a result of production stoppages at an oil refinery in early 2014, while services exports
maintained consistent growth. As a result, with

Annex IV. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)
Staff’s analysis, applying the Public DSA framework for Market-Access Countries, suggests that
Portugal’s gross debt trajectory is subject to significant risks, in the context of a sizable debt burden
and gross financing needs. Debt dynamics continue to hinge on additional growth-supporting
structural effort over the medium term and remain highly vulnerable to adverse yet plausible macrofiscal and contingent liabilities shocks. Moreover, while staff’s baseline projections reflect the
authorities’ current fiscal policies, additional fiscal consolidation in 2015 and the outer years remains
critical to anchor debt safely on a downward-sloping path, boosting policy credibility and
strengthening the country’s resilience to reversals in market sentiment.

A.

Baseline Scenario

1.

Public debt continued to increase in 2014 despite further progress on fiscal

adjustment. (Figure 3 and 4). This primarily reflected several large one-off transactions related to
SOE support, but was also higher relative to previous projections as a result of the adverse valuation
effects of euro depreciation1, and a downward revision to nominal GDP. As a result, the debt ratio
did not peak in 2013 as previously envisaged, but rather increased from 129.7 to 130.2 percent of
GDP in 2014. Debt is projected to decline steadily beginning in 2015, as the headline fiscal deficit
continues to fall -- with Portugal benefitting from a sizable reduction in interest costs as yields have
declined -- but would still remain at nearly 121 percent of GDP at the end of 2020, in the absence of
further consolidation efforts. Staff’s estimate of potential growth has been lowered relative to earlier
projections, with growth expecting to slow as cyclical momentum fades after 2016 – but the baseline
debt projections still hinge on sustained structural reform efforts over the medium term, as well as
further drawdown of cash deposits in 2015-17 and the ongoing reallocation of the Social Security
portfolio from foreign assets to government securities. Portugal’s debt net of government deposits
amounted to 120 percent of GDP at end–2014, reflecting the accumulation of sizable cash reserves
in recent years.

B.

Risk Assessment

2.

Portugal’s sizable debt burden and gross financing needs continue to pose significant

risks to debt sustainability and leave debt dynamics very sensitive to macro shocks. As shown
in Figure 1, Portugal’s debt ratio already exceeds the debt burden benchmark for advanced
1

The majority of Portugal’s foreign-currency denominated debt is hedged through currency swaps; unhedged
foreign-currency denominated debt is around 3 percent of GDP. The chart in Figure 4 shows total foreigncurrency debt, not accounting for hedging operations.

PORTUGAL

economies of 85 percent of GDP under the baseline scenario. The same applies to Portugal’s public
financing needs which are above the relevant benchmark of 20 percent of GDP. However, the debt
profile is subject to medium to low risks in terms of market perception, projected change in shortterm debt, and the share of public debt held by nonresidents.2 Moreover, in the case of Portugal,
since bank vulnerabilities are below the relevant thresholds identified by the MAC DSA template, the
standardized contingent liabilities shock does not apply. Nevertheless, this is replaced by a
customized shock given the risks posed by the materialization of contingent liabilities from SOEs
and PPPs (please refer to the stress test customized scenario).

C.

Realism of Baseline Assumptions and Alternative Scenarios

3.

Realizing the potential growth rate assumed in the current projection has important

implications for the debt adjustment path. Portugal’s growth forecast track record shows a
relatively large median error compared with other countries with Fund-supported programs,
especially during the pre-crisis period (Figure 2). The achievement of a growth rate of 1¼ percent
over the medium term, as per staff’s updated projection, is consistent with moderate growth
convergence, but remains subject to sustained structural effort and a successful rebalancing of the
economy from the nontradable to the tradable sectors. If growth were to turn out lower than
currently projected—for instance as a result of stalling or reversal of the reform effort—the rate of
debt decline would significantly slow down, as also shown in Figure 4 and AI.5. Similarly, risks from a
protracted period of negative inflation in Portugal could further impede the repair of already-weak
private and public balance sheets, as highlighted by the customized deflation scenario in Figure 5.
4.

Given Portugal’s sizable debt burden and financing needs, the primary balance is

expected to exceed its debt-stabilizing threshold over the projection period. Under staff’s
baseline scenario,3 the fiscal primary balance is expected to reach nearly 2 percent of GDP over the
medium term. As estimated in Figure 2, the 3-year change in the cyclically-adjusted primary balance
identified for Portugal is in the top third of the fiscal adjustments observed in other countries with
debt greater than 60 percent of GDP. However, due to the 3-year rolling nature of the estimate, this
largely reflects the country’s fiscal efforts already achieved over 2011–14. Nevertheless, Portugal’s
debt profile remains highly vulnerable to a primary balance shock (Figure 4 and 5), as also
highlighted by the asymmetric fan chart analysis in Figure 1, which shows the risks to the debt

2

The total (public and private) external financing requirements exceed significantly the relevant benchmark
under the baseline. However, in the case of Portugal, the figure includes, among others, non-residents bank
deposits, accounting for about 45 percent of GDP.
3

measures are not incorporated by the team under the baseline scenario.

outlook if only negative shocks to the primary balance were to materialize. Moreover, the
authorities’ medium-term fiscal strategy is expected to target a more ambitious adjustment path
than staff’s current-policies baseline, consistent with the European Treaty on Stability, Coordination,
and Governance framework which establishes a minimum structural adjustment effort of ½ percent
of GDP per year, until the medium term objective is achieved.

Stress Tests

5.

The baseline remains highly sensitive to macro-fiscal and contingent liabilities shocks

(Figure 5):


Under a growth shock that lowers output by nearly 4.5 percentage points in 2016–17 (and in turn
inflation by a cumulative 1 percentage point), debt would peak at about 134 percent of GDP
in 2017, over 10 percentage points higher compared with the 2016 baseline. However, debt
dynamics would be severely compromised under a deflation scenario where a sharper growth
shock (that lowers output by 5½ percentage points in 2016–17) is associated with deflationary
pressures (with inflation lower by cumulative 4 percentage points), in the context of a widening
output gap and high unemployment. Under this scenario, debt would rise to 142 percent of GDP
by 2017and remain at this level over the medium-term.



A sustained interest rate shock of 200 bps throughout the projection period is not expected to
have a large immediate effect, but it would slow down the rate of debt decline in the medium
term, so that by 2020 the debt-to-GDP ratio is about 3 points higher compared with the
baseline.



Further materialization of contingent liabilities would also have implications for Portugal’s debt
dynamics. While the recent debt management operation for SOEs has significantly addressed
fiscal risks from the transport and infrastructure sectors, staff’s assessment suggests that, under
a severe scenario, further contingent liabilities could potentially materialize for about 5 percent
of GDP, due to SOEs, PPPs, and State guarantees.4 A contingent liabilities shock of this
magnitude would push the 2015 debt ratio to about 131 percent of GDP.

4

Staff’s assumptions for the adverse contingent liabilities scenario include (i) staff’s estimate of potential
contingent liabilities from PPPs based on financial rebalancing requests by concessionaires; (ii) the hypothetical
settlement of the outstanding stock of arrears; (iii) staff’s estimate of potential contingent liabilities from other
non-bank debt directly guaranteed by the State and/or classified outside the general government perimeter.



A severe combined shock that incorporates the macro-fiscal and contingent liabilities adverse
scenarios mentioned above would significantly affect the country’s debt dynamics, with debt
rising to 135 percent of GDP in 2017 and then continuing to rise gradually over the medium
term.

6.

The authorities took note of the risks highlighted by staff, but also stressed their

divergence from staff’s baseline scenario. The authorities were more optimistic about the growth
outlook, and foresee a larger improvement in medium-term debt dynamics than projected by staff.
In addition, the authorities emphasized the significant progress on fiscal adjustment in recent years
and the resulting improvement in investor confidence, which has allowed a return to market
borrowing on favorable terms and facilitated the prepayment of nearly one-fourth of their
outstanding borrowing from the Fund in March 2015. They also noted that recent increases in gross
debt have been largely due to the sustained build-up of central government cash balances and that
the SOE debt management operation in 2014 aimed at restoring the financial viability of these
companies, thus significantly reducing fiscal risks and future borrowing needs. Finally, they stressed
their confidence that the 2015 fiscal deficit target will be achieved, resulting in a larger reduction of
the debt-to-GDP ratio by the end of the year, and putting debt dynamics on a trajectory to improve
at a faster pace than envisaged under staff’s baseline scenario. As foreseen in the EU framework, the
authorities will present revised macroeconomic and fiscal projections for the medium-term in their
Stability Program by end-April.

1/ The cell is highlighted in green if debt burden benchmark of 85% is not exceeded under the specific shock or baseline, yellow if exceeded under specific shock but not baseline,
red if benchmark is exceeded under baseline, white if stress test is not relevant. In the case of Portugal, the benchmark is already exceeded under the baseline (implying that any
specific shock, regardless of its size, is reported as red). Moreover, the standardized contingent liabilities shock of the MAC DSA template (based on bank vulnerabilities and below
the relevant threshold for Portugal) is replaced by a customized shock based on contingent liabilities risks from SOEs and PPPs.
2/ The cell is highlighted in green if gross financing needs benchmark of 20% is not exceeded under the specific shock or baseline, yellow if exceeded under specific shock but not
baseline, red if benchmark is exceeded under baseline, white if stress test is not relevant.
3/ The cell is highlighted in green if country value is less than the lower risk-assessment benchmark, red if country value exceeds the upper risk-assessment benchmark, yellow if
country value is between the lower and upper risk-assessment benchmarks. If data are unavailable or indicator is not relevant, cell is white.
Lower and upper risk-assessment benchmarks are:
400 and 600 basis points for bond spreads; 17 and 25 percent of GDP for external financing requirement; 1 and 1.5 percent for change in the share of short-term debt; 30 and 45
percent for the public debt held by non-residents. In the case of Portugal, the external financing requirements figure includes bank deposits by non-residents (accounting for about
45 percent of GDP).

STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of April 7, 2015
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General. Data provision to the Fund is adequate for surveillance purposes.
Real sector. Since 2000, and until August 2014, INE published a full set of national accounts
based on the ESA 1995 methodology, including quarterly GDP estimates. Since September 2014,
all information regarding National Accounts follows the ESA 2010.
Fiscal sector. Data have undergone a number of revisions during the transition to the ESA 2010,
sizably altering revenue and expenditure and hampering comparisons across years. From 2001
onward, budgets have been presented in a manner consistent with recent changes in national and
fiscal accounting methodology. Quarterly general government statistics on an accrual basis are
available as derived from the national accounts statistics.
Trade and balance of payments. Data are provided according to the IMF’s sixth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual. The external trade data meet the timeliness standards. The portfolio
investment collection system has a simplified threshold of €500 million, which is relatively high in
comparison with many EU countries. The authorities estimate however, that only about 1.5
percent of transactions are not captured on a monthly basis by this threshold, and that this
reporting simplification does not significantly hamper the quality of the monthly balance of
payments. Moreover, they indicate that all transactions below this threshold are included in the
first release of the annual balance of payments data, and the monthly numbers are revised
accordingly.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Portugal is subject to the statistical requirements
and timeliness and reporting standards of Eurostat
and the European Central Bank (ECB). Portugal
subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination
Standard Plus (SDDS+), and the relevant metadata
have been posted on the Dissemination Standards
Bulletin Board.

IMF Executive Board Concludes the Article IV Consultation with Portugal1

On May 6, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV Consultation with Portugal.
Portugal’s significant flow imbalances have largely been corrected in the wake of the sovereign
debt crisis, with employment increasing, output expanding, and the current account balance
posting surpluses for the first time in decades. Nevertheless, the stock vulnerabilities that had
accumulated over time—most notably public and nonfinancial corporate debt, and a large
negative international investment position—remain pronounced.
The economy has expanded at close to 1 percent per year on average since early 2013, with
growth driven largely by consumption. The 2014 fiscal deficit objective of 4.0 percent of GDP
(excluding one-off operations) has been achieved, implying a structural primary adjustment of
1 percent. The trend of downward inflation pressures, exacerbated more recently by falling
energy prices, appears to have been arrested. The banking system is reducing its reliance on
Eurosystem financing, although it remains unprofitable and saddled with a rising stock of nonperforming loans.
The near-term outlook is benefiting from the trifecta of record-low interest rates, a weakening
euro, and low oil prices. Output is expected to increase by 1.6 percent in 2015 and
by 1.5 percent in 2016, with outlook for inflation improving as well. As the boost from short1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually

every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

term factors fades, however, growth is projected to moderate over the medium term, as Portugal
continues to lag behind its peers in key structural indicators. The risks to the outlook are mostly
on the upside, as the impact of ECB’s expanded asset purchase program may turn out to be
stronger than anticipated. At the same time, there are low-probability but potentially disruptive
downside possibilities, most notably any volatility associated with turmoil at the euro-area level.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the Portuguese authorities for their achievements over the past
few years in improving the fiscal and current account balances, safeguarding financial stability,
and regaining market access. Directors also welcomed the authorities’ decision to begin early
repayment of outstanding Fund credit. Directors observed, however, that the ongoing recovery is
still too modest to bring output and employment back to pre-crisis levels in the period ahead.
Restoring internal balance without undermining Portugal’s external position thus remains the
most important policy priority.
Directors agreed that, while the near-term economic outlook has improved significantly,
medium-term prospects are still clouded by legacy problems—weak investment, large stocks of
public and private debt, excessive leverage in the corporate sector, and labor market slack.
Noting that Portugal is benefitting from low sovereign yields, a depreciated euro exchange rate,
and low oil prices, Directors encouraged the authorities to tackle the remaining vulnerabilities,
rebuild fiscal buffers, and accelerate key structural reforms to enhance potential growth.
Directors welcomed the progress on fiscal consolidation and the authorities’ commitment to exit
the EU’s Excessive Deficit Procedure this year. They encouraged further efforts to reduce the
debt-to-GDP ratio to more sustainable levels. Directors generally noted the benefits of setting
multi-year expenditure targets to anchor the fiscal structural adjustment, given Portugal’s
elevated tax burden. In this regard, it will also be important to further rationalize public
spending through a comprehensive reform of wages and pensions, and broader fiscal reforms to
improve public administration and mitigate risks from state-owned entities.
Directors considered that Portugal’s economic recovery depends crucially on progress in
addressing nonperforming loans and the corporate debt overhang in a timely and systematic
manner. Actions are needed to ensure that banks maintain adequate capital and provisioning,

and speed up debt write-offs. Directors recommended further efforts to improve the efficiency
of the insolvency framework and promote equity-based financing for corporations.
Directors stressed the need to continue structural reforms to enhance external competitiveness
and labor market flexibility, building on recent achievements. They saw as priorities reforms to
support job creation, enhance local competition, and upgrade public services. Directors also
recommended measures to improve vocational training, upgrade managerial skills, reduce
disincentives to work, and make the social dialogue more inclusive.

I.

Overview

We welcome the IMF staff report on the 2015 Article IV Consultation, as it provides an
updated assessment of the recovering Portuguese economy and draws attention to the
challenges that remain to be addressed. However, we also feel that a staff report for an
Art. IV consultation – there has not been one since over two years ago – could have
focused more on the remarkable progress Portugal achieved in terms of fiscal
consolidation, external adjustment, market access, financial stability and implementation
of structural reforms. The staff report pays relatively limited attention to these results,
focusing primarily on the remaining stock imbalances. Additionally, the policy proposals
put forward by staff would have benefited from a more in-depth discussion of the reforms
undertaken in 2013-2014 as well as of the challenges faced in their implementation.
The authorities feel that strong compliance with the Economic and Financial Adjustment
Program and the continued implementation of sound policies following its completion
have been decisive in stabilizing the economy and gradually building stronger
foundations for growth in the medium and long term. The authorities also acknowledge
that, given the magnitude of the stock imbalances accumulated since the mid-1990’s –
namely in terms of indebtedness – the adjustment process will have to continue,
underpinned by the consolidation of recent results and renewed commitment for further
reforms.
By their own nature, reducing stock imbalances will require time, something that the
Fund has clearly recognized.1 Steady adjustment and reform, at a pace that takes into
account also the need to sustain the ongoing recovery of economic activity and
employment, is critical to successfully reduce remaining imbalances. But the gradual
reduction of stock imbalances, in the presence of a faster adjustment of flow imbalances,
should not be taken as an example of absence of adjustment. Thus, we were somewhat
surprised to see that according to the Table in paragraph 8 of the staff report, progress in
achieving fiscal sustainability is assessed solely by looking at the public debt to GDP
ratio. The remarkable improvements in terms of budget balance, structural balance or
primary balance are not considered at all.
1

For example, in the chapter devoted to dealing with public debt overhang of October 2012 World
Economic Outlook, it was concluded that “reducing public debt takes time, especially in the context of a
weak external environment”.

2
The Government’s commitment to this strategy was reaffirmed in late April, with the
formal submission to the European Commission of two key strategy documents: the
National Reform Program and the Stability Program.2 In particular, these documents
outline Portugal’s strategy for the next four years, in terms of policy intentions for
ensuring sustainable growth and on the design of the medium-term fiscal strategy.
II.

Economic Activity

The economy continues to recover steadily. Portuguese GDP grew by 0.9 percent
in 2014, confirming a turnaround after three years of negative growth. Domestic demand
was underpinned by the recovery of private consumption (which grew by 2.1 percent,
against -1.5 percent in 2013 and -5.5 percent in 2012) and also investment (as Gross
Fixed Capital Formation increased by 2.5 percent, following -6.7 percent in 2013 and 16.6 percent in 2012). This led to an acceleration of import growth (+6.4 percent), which
surpassed the sustained increase in exports (+3.4 percent).
While the strong pick-up in private consumption and imports led to a shift in growth
composition in 2014, the updated macroeconomic scenario of the Stability Program
projects this effect to be temporary and triggered by a relevant improvement in
confidence following the most difficult period of the adjustment process. According to
the Government’s projections, GDP growth is expected to accelerate in 2015-2019,
underpinned by positive contributions both from domestic demand and net exports,
continued investment growth and a sustained improvement in the labor market.
The Government’s macroeconomic scenario does not significantly diverge from the one
in the staff report for 2015 (as staff’s growth projections have been revised up since the
previous PPM staff report), but prospects from 2016 onwards are more optimistic.
In 2015, GDP is expected to grow by 1.6 percent. Growth should then accelerate to 2.0
percent in 2016 and 2.4 percent in 2017, maintaining a similar pace in 2018 and 2019.
The unemployment rate is expected to reach 13.2 percent in 2015, down from 13.9
percent in 2014 and 16.2 percent in 2013. As this declining trend continues in outer years
and employment growth is expected to remain steady, the Stability Program forecasts an
unemployment rate of 11.1 percent in 2019.
The external adjustment is also expected to continue in tandem with economic recovery,
with the net lending position of the Portuguese economy expected to reach 2.7 percent of
GDP in 2019. In addition, the current account balance is forecast to remain in surplus,
improving from 0.5 percent of GDP in 2015 to 1.4 percent of GDP in 2019.

This submission occurs under the European Semester – a set of procedures aimed at enhancing policy
coordination at EU levels, which is mandatory for all EU Member States which are not under an adjustment
program.

3
III.

Fiscal Policy

While taking note of staff’s assessment, the Government reaffirms its firm commitment
to respect the 2015 deadline for Portugal to exit the EU’s Excessive Deficit Procedure
(EDP). The 2.7 percent of GDP deficit target for this year is also maintained, and
reinforced by the statistical authorities’ assessment that the 2014 deficit was lower than
forecast in the State Budget.
According to the figures released on April 17, the 2014 General Government deficit stood
at 4.5 percent of GDP (EUR 7.717 billion), falling below the 2013 deficit of 4.8 percent
of GDP (EUR 8.181 billion). This result was achieved in spite of one-off items, net of
which the deficit falls to 3.3 percent of GDP (against 5.1 percent of GDP recorded
in 2013). In 2014, Portugal recorded a primary surplus for the second consecutive year,
amounting to 0.5 percent of GDP. This result places the total correction in the primary
balance between 2010 and 2014 at 8.7 percentage points of GDP.
The fiscal strategy outlined in the Stability Program demonstrates that the Government is
committed to pursuing sound policies in the medium-term, so as to ensure the
sustainability of public finances and compliance with the EU fiscal framework. The
medium-term objective – set for Portugal as a structural deficit of 0.5 percent – is
expected to be achieved in 2016, one year earlier than foreseen in the 2014 Fiscal
Strategy Document. The General Government balance is targeted to improve from a
deficit of 2.7 percent of GDP in 2015 – thus complying with the 3 percent EDP limit – to
a surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP in 2019.
Following a near-stabilization in 2014, General Government Gross Debt is set to decline
by 6 percentage points in 2015 – reaching 124.2 percent of GDP by end-December – and
to continue this trend in the following years, falling to 107.6 percent in 2019. Excluding
Central Administration deposits, public debt is expected to decrease from 116.5 percent
of GDP in 2015 to 103.8 percent of GDP in 2019.
The improvement in the fiscal accounts recorded over the last few years critically
contributed to the recovery of market access and the decline in spreads. The latter reflects
a mix of several factors, including the improvements in the fiscal balance and the current
account, whose relevance is somewhat underplayed in the staff report, notably in Box 2.
IV.

Financial Sector Policies

While important measures have been taken during the Program, the strengthening and
stabilization of the financial sector continues to be one of the main objectives of Banco
de Portugal. The liquidity position of the Portuguese banks improved quite significantly.
The solvency position has also improved, and significant efforts continue to be made by
the Portuguese banks in this area.

4
In line with other sectors of the economy, the banking sector continued to deleverage
during 2014, with the loan-to-deposit ratio falling to 107 per cent in December 2014 from
117 percent at end 2013. Deposits remained resilient throughout the year and Central
Banks’ financing, mostly comprised of Eurosystem monetary policy operations,
continued to decrease - reaching, at end 2014, minimum levels since the beginning of the
Program. Credit granted by banks continued to decrease in the residential mortgage
segment and in sectors most dependent on domestic demand (notably construction and
real estate), while exporting firms continue to benefit from increasing positive (net) flows
of credit. There is also evidence pointing to a strong competition across banks with
respect to firms with a good risk profile - in 2014, the Portuguese banks have more
clearly differentiated credit conditions (notably the interest rate charged) according to the
risk profile of the firms. This also applies to loan volumes: the growth rate of loans
granted to the firms with the lowest levels of risk increased during 2014, whereas the
growth rate of loans underlying the riskiest firms continued to register significant
negative values. Finally, the level of deposits and loans was not affected by the resolution
measure applied to BES, thus confirming the improved resilience of the system.
In terms of solvency, the Common Equity Tier 1 reached 11.3 percent at end 2014, for
the banking system as a whole – in line with average European levels. The decrease
observed in the last quarter of 2014 reflected not only low profitability levels but also the
revision of the actuarial assumptions followed by some banks’ pension funds, as a
consequence of the general decrease in interest rates. In fact, the main challenge faced by
the banking sector at the current juncture is to regain profitability. Despite the recent
improvement of both return on asset and return on equity ratios, profitability remains at
low for most banks. The favorable dynamics in net interest income, the increase in profits
underlying financial operations and the ongoing decline in operational costs, have had a
positive impact during 2014. However, the still high level of impairments, to a large
extent linked with the exposure of banks to non-financial firms, continue to weigh
negatively on profits.
Nonetheless, banks’ profitability recovery should not involve excessive risk-taking, nor
excessive concentration levels in certain activities or markets. It will be important for
institutions to adjust their business models to a macroeconomic context that may involve
relatively moderate potential growth and low interest rates.
Also, the stock of NPLs is still high, especially in the non-financial corporate sector, a
sector that despite the aforementioned adjustment is still characterized by high levels of
indebtedness. Consequently, the stock of impairments as a percentage of gross loans is
one of the highest in Europe (7.7 percent). Several horizontal inspections carried out by
Banco de Portugal during the Program, as well as the ECB Comprehensive Assessment,
led banks to recognize a significant amount of NPLs and to reinforce the level of

5
impairments, contributing to safeguarding the correct assessment and accounting of credit
risk.
Reconciling the need to further deleverage in a controlled way – given the still high level
of debt in the economy – and the goal of promoting economic growth will be challenging.
Banks will continue to have a key role in this scenario by continuing to promote the
reallocation of resources towards the most productive sectors of the economy. Banco de
Portugal is following this adjustment process very closely and has contributed to a
strategic plan set up by the Portuguese authorities to address the still high levels of
indebtedness in the non-financial corporate sector (for further details, please refer to the
report of the First Post-Program Monitoring). Further measures to accelerate the
deleveraging process in this sector, whose debt decreased quite significantly in 2014, and
the cleaning up of banks’ balance sheets, that was reinforced from 2011 onwards, need to
be assessed against (i) the impact they will have on debt; (ii) the impact they will have on
banks’ profitability and, consequently, on banks’ capital ratios; and, ultimately, (iii) the
impact they will have in terms of financial stability and economic growth, taking also
into account the credit demand constraints still faced. In this context, one should bear in
mind that, at the end of 2014, about 50 percent of non-performing loans granted to firms
on banks’ balance sheet were under litigation, thus showing that the swiftness of the
judicial system will be key to accelerate the cleaning up of banks’ balance sheet.
V.

Structural Reforms

Structural reforms are crucial for ensuring sustainable growth, as they play a central role
in increasing external competitiveness and potential growth. The commitment to
implementing structural reforms was visible during the Program, with several initiatives
being launched in a wide range of sectors, and remained firm after the Program’s
completion, as reforms continued to be implemented and new milestones were achieved
regularly, as highlighted in the staff report and thoroughly described in the National
Reform Program. This medium-term strategy document includes the updated state of play
of most ongoing reforms and also describes the Government’s plans going forward.
Regarding product markets, a number of reforms is ongoing and expected to be
completed in a near future. In the energy sector, only two measures from the Third
Energy Package remain to be fully completed. In the transport infrastructure sector,
concessions for urban transportation are proceeding at a good pace: in Porto, the
concession was awarded to an international company; while in Lisbon the international
tender procedure should be completed by July. The privatizations of CP Carga and EMEF
were approved and the process for TAP was relaunched. The merger of Estradas de
Portugal and REFER was also formalized, naming the new company Infraestruturas de
Portugal. In Public Administration, reforms also continue to occur at a significant pace,
namely in the areas of administrative reorganization, courts’ efficiency and payment
discipline. Regarding the labor market, the Government remains fully committed to

6
implementing reforms in order to promote job creation and skills’ upgrading, while
reinforcing social cohesion.
While the payoff of many of these reforms is already evident and effective, the benefits
from other reforms – and new reforms – take longer to materialize. This should not be
considered as a failure nor insufficiency of reform, but as a reflection of the expected
time lag in full effectiveness.
