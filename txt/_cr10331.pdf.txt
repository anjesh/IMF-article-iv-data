Australia: Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation1
Prepared by Staff Representatives for the 2010 Consultation with Australia
Approved by Mahmood Pradhan and Tamim Bayoumi

October 12, 2010
Key Issues and Recommendations:


Context: Australia avoided a recession in 2009 and is recovering on the back of a substantial
policy stimulus and strong demand for its mining exports, especially from China.



Growth prospects: Real GDP growth is projected to recover to 3–3½ percent in 2010 and 2011,
led by commodity exports and investment in mining. Risks are tilted largely to the downside, as
the global recovery could stall or renewed financial turmoil could raise the cost of capital. An
upside risk is that the mining boom has a larger-than-expected impact on output and inflation.



Focus: The discussions centered on the appropriate pace of exit from macro stimulus, managing
the mining boom, and addressing vulnerabilities related to household and external debt.



Exit from stimulus: Given that a recovery is underway, the mission supported the increase in
policy interest rates since late 2009 and planned return to a budget surplus by 2012/13. Ample
scope exists to slow the pace of exit or loosen policies in response to a downside scenario.



Managing the mining boom: The growing dependence of the economy on mining may amplify
the business cycle, which implies that the automatic fiscal stabilizers should be allowed to
operate fully. Larger budget surpluses should be run than in the past to help avoid potential
overheating and build a buffer against a sharp fall in commodity prices.



Financial sector vulnerabilities: The authorities should encourage banks to improve their stress
tests and lengthen the maturity of their offshore funding.



The de facto exchange rate arrangement is free floating (see accompanying Informational
Annex).

This report is based on discussions during July 9–19, 2010, with RBA Governor Glenn Stevens, Treasury
Secretary Ken Henry, other senior officials, and representatives from labor unions, financial, and business
sectors. The team also held a teleconference call with Treasurer Wayne Swan in September to discuss fiscal
policy after the August 21 election. The team comprised Mr. Brooks (head), Mr. Hunt, and Ms. Tumbarello (all
APD), and Mr. Bologna (MCM). Mr. Legg (OED) participated in the discussions.

I. WHAT EXPLAINS THE RESILIENCE OF THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY TO THE GLOBAL CRISIS
1.
Australia was one of the few
advanced economies to escape recession in
2009 (text figure). This reflected growing links
with Asia, including strong demand for
commodities from China and India, a prompt
and significant macro policy response to the
global crisis, a healthy banking sector, and a
flexible exchange rate (Table 1, Figure 1).

2.
Australia was in a strong position at
the onset of the global recession. Sound
macroeconomic policies and structural reform
secured 17 years of continuous growth.
Unemployment was at historical lows and
inflation expectations were well-anchored.
3.
Exchange rate flexibility provided a
buffer. The Australian dollar depreciated
sharply at the onset of the crisis as
commodity prices fell and risk aversion
jumped. Subsequently, the currency
appreciated in real effective terms by
35 percent between March 2009 and
September 2010, as commodity prices
recovered and interest rate differentials
widened (Figure 2). Australian financial
markets have also largely recovered from the
global crisis.

5.
Fiscal policy also supported activity.
The Commonwealth government ran budget
surpluses of around 1–1¾ percent of GDP in

the six years before the crisis that eliminated its
net debt. With considerable fiscal space, the
government reacted quickly to the global crisis
by providing a fiscal stimulus of 4⅓ percent of
GDP in the two years to June 2010, above the
G-20 average (text figure). The operation of the
automatic stabilizers, in particular the decline in
revenue, together with the stimulus, shifted the
budget into an underlying cash deficit of about
4 percent of GDP in 2009/10 (Table 2).

4.
Monetary policy reacted promptly. In
response to the global crisis, the Reserve
Bank of Australia (RBA) cut its policy rate from
7¼ percent to 3 percent over the seven
months to April 2009. The transmission of
monetary policy was very effective, in
contrast with some other advanced
economies, as the cuts were largely reflected
in mortgage and business lending rates.

6.
Australian banks were resilient to the
global crisis. Banks have remained profitable
with adequate provisioning and sound asset
quality, as nonperforming loans rose to less
than 2 percent of assets (Figure 3). Capital
adequacy has improved to about 12 percent,
after banks raised private capital. The “four
pillars policy,” which does not allow the four
large banks to merge, together with sound
regulation and supervision, played a role in
limiting risky behavior before the crisis and
helped maintain stability, with the Council of

The Mining Boom and the Beginning of Exit from Stimulus

8.
A mining boom is underway, as
commodity prices have rebounded. Prices for
key exports, such as iron ore and coal, are
expected to remain high in the near term,
based on strong demand from China and
India. Private sector investment in mining in
recent years has risen, which, combined with
public investment and a pickup in household
consumption, underpinned activity in the first
half of 2010.

90

tempered the increase in the unemployment
rate, which peaked at less than 6 percent in
mid-2009. Employment and hours worked
have since rebounded.

Early signs of Inflation pressure are
starting to emerge. While core inflation fell
below 3 percent y/y in June 2010 and wage
growth moderated, spare capacity is
beginning to be used up with the
unemployment rate falling to just over
5 percent (Figure 4).
10.
Monetary accommodation has been
withdrawn. In late 2009 it was evident that
the economy was recovering and the RBA
started to withdraw monetary stimulus,
raising the policy rate to 4½ percent in six
steps, the most recent in May (Figure 5). The
increases in the policy rate have flowed
through effectively to both mortgage and
business lending rates which have returned
close to their 10-year averages. With
considerable uncertainty about the global
economic outlook, the RBA has kept policy
rates on hold in recent months.

Credit growth is showing signs of
recovery. The sharp slowing in credit growth
following the onset of the crisis was driven by
falls in business and personal credit.
Mortgage credit growth, while slowing,
remained positive, reflecting the introduction
of government incentives for first time home
buyers and the quick pass through of policy
rate reductions into mortgage rates. More
recently, personal credit growth picked up,
although business credit continues to
contract.
12.
Strong commodity demand helped
reduce the current account deficit (Tables 3
and 4). The current account deficit fell to
3⅓ percent of GDP in the first half of 2010, as
iron ore and coal exports picked up, and
dividend and profits payments declined. Net
external liabilities have risen over the past
few years to about 60 percent of GDP by mid2010.

II. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
13.
The outlook is favorable. Real GDP
growth is projected at 3–3½ percent in 2010
and 2011, with private investment in mining
and commodity exports taking over from
public demand as the main driver of growth
(Table 5). The output gap is expected to close
in mid-2011. Despite rising mortgage rates,
household consumption will be supported by
strong income growth, buoyed by the recent
rebound in employment. The terms of trade is
expected to rise to historic highs in late 2010,
driving a mining boom that is likely to be long
lasting, given increasing ties with fast-growing
emerging Asia (Box 1). The current account
deficit is projected to narrow in the near-term
to less than 2½ percent of GDP, due to the
jump in the terms of trade. However, the
deficit is forecast to widen to about 6 percent

of GDP over the medium term, mostly
reflecting higher investment in the resource
sector, including on LNG projects.1
14.
The main risks relate to the global
outlook and, in the near term, are tilted
largely to the downside. If the global
recovery stalls and Chinese demand for

plant to liquefy natural gas—the Gorgon project—
that involves capital expenditure of $43 billion

Box 1. Australia: Increasing Ties with Emerging Asia and Australia’s Growth Potential1
The destination of Australia’s exports has
shifted dramatically from advanced
economies to fast-growing emerging Asia.
Over the past two decades, exports to China
and India grew by almost 20 percent per
annum in U.S. dollar terms while exports to
the U.S. and Germany grew by just 3–
4 percent annually. As a result, China
overtook Japan as Australia’s top export
destination in 2009. If this trend continues,
almost half of Australia’s exports will head
to China and India by 2015.2

commodities declines, Australia’s terms of
trade could fall sharply. In addition, concerns
about fiscal sustainability in Europe could
disrupt global financial markets and push up
the cost of capital for Australian borrowers
(Box 2). On the domestic front, a fall in house
prices and deleveraging by highly indebted
households could negatively impact private
consumption and slow the recovery. An
upside risk is that the mining boom may have
a larger-than-expected impact on output and
inflation.

Authorities’ Views
15.
The authorities agreed with staff’s
economic outlook, although they viewed the
risks as more balanced. They noted the
downside risks from market concerns about
the fiscal outlook for some European
economies. They also pointed to the risk that
the pickup in private demand in Australia may
not occur as quickly as expected and drive the
recovery when public investment is
contracting. The authorities, however, expect
strong demand for mineral exports to
continue to support the recovery, given
urbanization and industrialization in emerging
Asia.

III. WHAT IS THE RIGHT PACE OF EXIT FROM THE POLICY STIMULUS?
A.

Monetary Policy

16.
Staff supported the removal of
monetary stimulus since late 2009, given the
improvement in the economic outlook. Staff
also noted that keeping policy rates on hold
since May 2010 was appropriate, in light of
increased uncertainty about prospects for the
recovery. With lending rates in Australia close
to ten-year averages and economic activity
responding quickly to cash rate adjustments,
the RBA has scope to wait for the outlook to
become clearer.
17.
Should the recovery proceed as
expected and downside risks dissipate, staff
advised that monetary policy will need to be
tightened further to contain inflation
pressures generated by the impact of the
mining boom on the wider economy. In

determining the magnitude of the additional
tightening, the RBA will need to consider two
key factors. First, given the high level of
household indebtedness, domestic demand is
likely to be more responsive to interest rates
than in the past. Second, with inflation
projected to remain close to the top of the 2–
3 percent target band, the RBA needs to
guard against inflation expectations becoming
anchored at too high a level.
18.
If world growth falters or global
markets come under severe stress because
of concerns over European sovereign debt,
the RBA is well positioned to respond. It has
ample scope to cut the policy rate and
provide liquidity support for banks, which
proved effective in the recent crisis.

13

Box 2. The Potential Impact on Australia of the European Sovereign Debt Turbulence
The IMF’s Global Projection Model (GPM) has been
used to estimate the potential impact that
Europe’s sovereign debt crisis could have on the
global economy’s major regions. Two scenarios are
considered. The first is that the direct impact is
largely concentrated in Europe with slower activity
reflecting the fiscal consolidations required to
stabilize financial markets, a mild increase in the
Euro area risk premium, and a moderate increase
in financial stress. Spillovers outside Europe are
limited to trade effects. The second scenario
entertains the possibility that global financial
markets could become severely disrupted because
European fiscal consolidation plans are viewed to
be either not credible or not sufficient. The impact
on the major world regions under these two
scenarios are presented in the table.
These scenarios are used in a small open economy
model of Australia to estimate the potential impact
that Europe’s sovereign debt crisis could have on
Australia’s macro outlook.1 The impact on Australia
is mild due to the space for policy to respond and
the importance of emerging Asia, which is less
affected than other regions.2 However, the output
effect is longer lived in Australia because of the
impact of commodity prices, which remain below
baseline for an extended period due to the
persistence in the shock to the level of world
demand.

Authorities’ Views
19.
The RBA agreed that if the downside
risks to the outlook diminished and further
inflation pressures emerged, the policy rate
would need to be raised. They will continue
to monitor domestic and external
developments closely and set monetary policy
to achieve an average rate of inflation of
between 2 and 3 percent over the cycle. The

B.
20.
The government’s strategy to exit
fiscal stimulus is projected to return the
budget to a surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP by
2012/13. With above trend growth forecast,
the government intends to achieve this goal
by:




allowing tax receipts to increase
through fiscal drag as the economy
recovers, while keeping the tax-toGDP ratio below the 2007/08 level of
23.6 percent on average;
holding real growth in government
spending to 2 percent or less per year
until the budget returns to surplus.
Once the budget is back in surplus,
the government will retain a
2 percent real cap on spending
growth, on average, until the budget
surplus is at least 1 percent of GDP,
currently projected for 2015–16.

21.
Staff supported the pace of
withdrawal of fiscal stimulus, if the economic
recovery proceeds as expected. The exit from
the stimulus, which began in 2010, sees
Commonwealth government net debt peaking
at 6 percent of GDP in 2011–12 (Figure 6). The

authorities were concerned that global
market disruptions could arise with some
frequency over the next few years. They
noted that such disruptions may pose some
challenges for monetary policy in Australia,
but the flexible exchange rate and removal of
earlier monetary policy stimulus has put them
in a strong position to respond to a downside
scenario.

Fiscal Policy
fiscal adjustment is faster than past
consolidations in Australia and exit plans in
most other advanced economies (Figure 7). In
the event of a downside scenario, staff noted
that Australia’s fiscal position provides ample
scope to allow the automatic stabilizers to
operate, and, if needed temporary
discretionary measures to be introduced.
22.
Although public debt is projected to
remain very low by advanced country
standards, returning quickly to budget
surpluses as the authorities intend would
put Australia in a stronger position to deal
with future shocks. The increased supply of
sovereign debt worldwide could eventually
put significant upward pressure on funding
costs. Maintaining low Commonwealth net
debt levels will help contain debt-servicing
costs associated with the private sector’s
external debt and increased public saving
could help contain the current account deficit.
Authorities’ Views and Plans
23.
The authorities emphasized that
their projected return to surplus by 2012/13
reflects a strong commitment to spending
restraint. They noted that their cap on annual

IV. HOW SHOULD THE MINING BOOM BE MANAGED?
24.
The mining boom is expected to be
long lived, but brings with it vulnerabilities
to which policy will need to respond. Staff
analysis suggests a significant dividend for
Australia from continued growth in emerging
Asia, even with a rebalancing of the drivers of
Asian growth toward the non-tradable
sector.2 Sound management of the boom in
Australia could permanently raise household
incomes, but facilitating a shift of resources to
the mining sector without giving rise to
inflationary pressures presents a key
challenge. Moreover, the growing
dependence on mining may amplify the
business cycle as the economy will be more
vulnerable to swings in commodity demand
and make government revenue more volatile.
25.
The framework laid out in the
Charter of Budget Honesty requires fiscal
policy to contribute to moderating cyclical
fluctuations in economic activity and
maintain Commonwealth Government debt
at prudent levels. The current government’s
strategy is to achieve budget surpluses on
average over the medium-term, to help
2

Analysis in the forthcoming working paper by B.
Hunt “Emerging Asia’s Impact on Australian
Growth: Some insights from GEM” suggests that
over the next ten years, a 50 percent increase in
emerging Asia’s real GDP driven by tradable sector
productivity growth (which roughly matches
emerging Asia’s growth gap relative to the rest of
the world over the last ten years) would raise
Australian GDP by 18 percent. However, should
emerging Asia’s growth continue to outperform,
but become more balanced with productivity
growth in both the tradable and nontradable
sectors contributing equally, the growth dividend
is roughly cut in half.

moderate the pro-cyclical impact from the
terms of trade. However, during the upswing
in commodity prices from 2004–2008, budget
surpluses were limited to only 1¾ percent of
GDP, with cuts in personal taxes and increases
in spending providing a fiscal stimulus during
this period.
26.
Staff advised allowing the automatic
fiscal stabilizers to operate fully. Faster than
expected Asian growth can quickly place
significant capacity pressures on the
Australian economy. Although the exchange
rate would adjust and monetary policy react,
allowing the automatic stabilizers to operate
fully would help avoid potential overheating.
To this end, staff recommended saving
revenue windfalls. In addition, this would
build a buffer against a sharp fall in
commodity prices and permit the automatic
stabilizers to operate fully during downturns.
27.
Because of the growing importance
of commodity prices for the budget, staff
suggested preparing downside scenarios
where the terms of trade return quickly to
the long-run average. The budget projects
the terms of trade to fall gradually by about
20 percent over the next 15 years as supply
comes on stream and settle about 30 percent
above the average of the past 20 years.
Analyzing the impact of a sharper fall in
commodity prices than currently assumed in
the budget would illustrate the importance of
running larger surpluses during the good

18
times to strengthen the fiscal position.3 A
stronger sovereign balance sheet would
provide more fiscal space to cushion the
impact should the terms of trade deteriorate
sharply. Moreover, it would put the budget in
a better position to deal with some of the
long-term pressures from aging and rising
health care costs (Box 3).
28.
Tax reform can also play a key role in
allowing Australia to take full advantage of
the mining boom. Staff welcomed the recent
review of the tax system, as it provides a
comprehensive blueprint for tax reform issues
(Box 4). The planned introduction of the
mineral resource rent tax (MRRT) in 2012 is a
step in the right direction and is to be
accompanied by a cut in the company tax rate
from 30 to 29 percent, to encourage
investment. While the MRRT strengthens the
automatic stabilizers in the budget, staff
noted that it is less effective in that regard
than the original proposal of a super profit
tax. Consideration should be given to
broadening the coverage of the MRRT to
other mineral resources beyond iron ore and
coal. Another objective of tax reform should
be to facilitate the reallocation of resources
so that Australia can fully benefit from
improved terms of trade. Staff advised more
3

The budget presents sensitivity analysis to a
1 percent fall in nominal GDP because of a
permanent decline in the terms of trade. Staff
initial estimates suggest that a permanent fall in
the terms of trade of 20 percent over the next
year could reduce nominal GDP by 4 percent
relative to baseline, assuming the exchange rate
depreciates by 10 percent, and worsen the budget
balance in 2011/12 by 1–1½ percent of GDP
relative to baseline. These estimates, however, are
subject to considerable uncertainty and do not
take account of a possible policy response.

reliance on consumption-based taxes. This
would allow for the elimination of inefficient
taxes that impede labor mobility (including
stamp duties at the state level) and make
room for reductions in federal personal
income taxes that would encourage increases
in labor supply and saving.
29.
Other structural reforms will be
needed to improve the supply response and
address infrastructure bottlenecks in the
face of the boom. Reforms underway aim to
reduce inconsistent and unnecessary
regulation and restrictions on competition
across Commonwealth, State and Territory
governments. In addition, the Commonwealth
government is investing in education and
promoting effective regulation and more
efficient use of existing infrastructure, and
more transparent frameworks for new
infrastructure investment decisions.
Authorities’ Views
30.
The authorities agreed that the mining
boom will test the economy’s capacity and
note that adjustments have been made so that
fiscal policy is playing a key role in managing
the boom. They saw merit in staff’s advice to
save stronger-than-anticipated revenue in the
upswing. They noted that this advice is broadly
consistent with the government’s strategy of
achieving budget surpluses, on average, over
the medium term and improving the
government’s net financial worth. The
government’s other objective of keeping
Commonwealth tax revenues as a share of GDP,
on average, below the 2007/08 level
(23.6 percent of GDP) may constrain the
increase in revenue. However, given that this
objective is defined as an average over the
medium term it would not present a substantial
constraint in the near-term. In strengthening
the government’s fiscal strategy from balance

19
to surpluses over the cycle, they also pointed to
the political challenges of running larger
surpluses than in the past, given pressure to cut
taxes when revenue growth is strong. They
agreed that analyzing downside scenarios from
a sharp fall in the terms of trade may help build
political support for larger surpluses to
strengthen the government’s balance sheet. But

they raised concerns about how to manage
public assets once Commonwealth net debt is
reduced to zero. On tax reform, the authorities
noted that increasing consumption taxes would
be difficult, as they are perceived as regressive.
Further, the government has a clear policy that
the GST rate will not be increased or the base
broadened.

Box 3: Fiscal Pressures from Aging and Rising Health Care Costs
The “Intergenerational Report 2010” published by the Australian Treasury notes that an ageing
population presents significant long-term risks for the economy and the sustainability of
government finances. The report projects that government spending on health, age-related
pensions and aged care could rise by 5.3 percent of GDP by 2049–50 from the projected low point
in 2015–16. Rising health care costs are the largest contributor to this increase, accounting for
around two-thirds of the overall increase.
Health: The very high growth rates projected for health spending underscore the need for health
reform. The Intergenerational Report emphasizes the need to adjust spending to obtain better
value for money rather than simply cutting the budget. In April 2010, the Council of Australian
governments, with the exception of Western Australia, reached an agreement on significant
reforms to the health system—the establishment of a National Health and Hospitals Network—
with a view to improving the delivery and the sustainability of the health system.
Pensions: The government will progressively increase the retirement age from 65 to 67 years
beginning in 2017 and revise the means test arrangement to better target the pension to those
that are most in need. The government also boosted pension payments, with savings made in
other areas of spending. The combination of savings measures means the pension reforms will be
fully offset by 2020–21. Nonetheless, government spending on age-related pensions is projected to
increase from around 3 percent of GDP in 2009/10 to around 4 percent of GDP in 2050.
While pension and health care reform already undertaken are important steps, further policy
action will be needed to contain the public share of costs in these areas. In addition, measures to
raise labor force participation and productivity, such as those discussed in the tax review, would
help address pressures on the budget.

20

Box 4. Australia’s Tax Policy Reform
Australia’s tax review report was released on May 2. The review is designed to provide a framework
for policy debate over the next few decades.
The five principles or core criteria underlying the tax reform proposals include:


Equity: the system should be progressive and reduce differences in compliance costs across tax
payers;



Efficiency: the tax system should minimize efficiency costs by reducing the number of inefficient
taxes—many of which are levied by the States; and maximize its capacity to generate revenues;



Simplicity: the system should be more transparent and be easier to comply with;



Sustainability: on the tax side, the system must be able to meet the revenue needs of the
government without recurring to inefficient taxes. On the transfer side, the cost of the system
needs to be predictable and affordable in the light of demographic pressures Australia faces.
Both must be flexible enough to respond to changing policy challenges and consistent with
environmental sustainability; and



Policy consistency: tax and transfer policy should be consistent among the States, and across
levels of government, as well as consistent with governments’ broad policy objectives.

The overarching objective of tax reform is to promote stronger long-term growth by increasing
workforce participation—through appropriate design of tax incentives and transfers—and
productivity––through higher business investment, especially in infrastructure.
The main recommendations of the tax review included:


introducing a rent tax on nonrenewable resources;



cutting the company tax rate from 30 percent to 25 percent over the medium term to increase
business investment, including FDI;



reducing the complexity of personal income tax, including by introducing a high tax-free
threshold with a constant marginal rate for most people; removing stamp duties that are by
nature inefficient taxes on land that discourage residence mobility and replacing them with a
broad-base land tax;



enhancing taxes on consumption (excluding the GST) and broadening the consumption tax base.
A broad-based cash flow tax could be used to finance the abolition of other taxes, including the
payroll tax and inefficient State consumption taxes, such as insurance taxes;



promoting higher workforce participation through improving support for quality child care, and
building clear work incentives into the levels of income support payments.

The government has endorsed some of the recommendations, including introducing a mineral
resource rent tax on iron ore and coal and cutting the company tax rate from 30 to 29 percent in
2012.

V. HOW TO MAINTAIN FINANCIAL STABILITY AND ADDRESS BANKS’ DOMESTIC
VULNERABILITIES?
31.
Given the relatively good
performance of banks in the face of the
crisis, staff expressed concern that they may
be emboldened to take on riskier strategies.
The global crisis highlighted the need for
banks to hold strong capital and liquidity
buffers and for supervisors to encourage
banks to carefully manage their risks.

of household debt (Text Figure). Third, the
Australian Prudential Regulation Authority’s
(APRA) intensive supervision and prudential
rules guide banks toward a conservative
assessment of risk, including by setting a floor
of 20 percent for losses given default on
residential mortgages (Text Figure).
Indebted Households, 2006

32.
A key risk is banks’ exposure to
household debt of more than 150 percent of
households’ disposable income. As in many
other countries, household debt has risen over
the past decade leading to an increase in debt
servicing costs. Household net wealth has also
risen, but this was mainly because of a large
increase in house prices, which staff analysis
suggests are mildly overvalued (Figure 8).4
33.
A number of factors, however, limit
potential losses from banks’ exposure to
households.5 First, exposure to high-risk
mortgages is small, as less than 10 percent of
owner-occupiers had mortgages with loan-tovalue ratios higher than 80 percent and debtservice ratios greater than 30 percent. Second,
debt is mainly held by higher income
households, with households in the top two
income quintiles holding almost three quarters

Forthcoming working paper by P. Bologna,
“Australian Banking System Resilience: What
Should be Expected Looking Forward? An
International Perspective.”

34.
APRA’s recent stress tests also
suggest that banks are resilient to large but
plausible shocks. APRA regularly conducts
stress tests, most recently in 2009/10 in
cooperation with the Reserve Bank of New
Zealand and the New Zealand subsidiaries of
Australian banks. A three year macroeconomic
scenario was used for the tests, assuming a
global economic downturn that results in a
3 percent contraction of real GDP in Australia

22
in the first year, followed by a V-shaped
recovery. The scenario also assumed a rise in
the unemployment rate to 11 percent, a fall in
house prices of 25 percent, and a fall in
commercial property prices of 45 percent. The
results suggest that none of the banks would
have breached the 4 percent minimum Tier 1
capital requirement of the Basel II framework.
The weighted average reduction in Tier 1
capital ratios from the beginning to the end of
the three-year stress scenario was
3.1 percentage points.
35.
Despite the good results from the
stress tests, staff advised the authorities to
remain vigilant to emerging risks. Staff
recommended explicitly including funding risk
in future scenarios, given banks’ sizable shortterm external debt. Staff welcomed the
authorities' efforts to improve banks’ own
stress testing capabilities, and suggested that
APRA review assumptions regarding
probability of default and loss given default in
light of recent experience in Australia and
elsewhere. Potential risks in the mortgage
sector should be examined carefully, especially
given high household debt, house price
overvaluation, and potential volatility from the
mining boom. Staff supported APRA’s proactive approach to supervision, including its
intention to extend stress testing beyond the

banking system to other financial institutions
such as insurance companies.
36.
Staff welcomed progress in
contingency planning for liquidity and
solvency problems. APRA now closely
monitors banks’ liquidity and funding plans
and the planned Trans-Tasman crisis
management exercise with New Zealand is an
important step to identify possible challenges
in a banking crisis.
Authorities’ Views
37.
The authorities agreed on the need
for continued vigilance. On the stress tests,
aggregate results have been published, but
the authorities see no need to publish
individual results given the high level of
confidence in banks. The authorities are
committed to adopting international
enhancements to the quality and quantity of
capital held by financial institutions, which is
currently being developed by the Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision. They
noted that Australian banks are unlikely to
require significant increases in capital to meet
the enhanced requirements as they are
already well capitalized, with common equity
comprising a significant proportion of tier-one
capital.

VI. ADDRESSING EXTERNAL VULNERABILITY
38.
Australia’s main external
vulnerabilities arise from its relatively high
net external liabilities, sizable short-term
external debt, and projected widening of the
current account deficit. Staff projects net
external liabilities to increase to about
64 percent of GDP in 2015, as the current
account deficit widens to 6 percent of GDP.
39.
Disruptions in global capital markets
could put significant pressure on Australian
banks because of their short-term offshore
funding. Short-term external debt for the
whole economy remains sizable at 46 percent
of GDP in mid-2010, and has not changed
significantly since the onset of the global crisis
(text table). The short-term external debt
comprises almost half of gross external debt
and is largely held by financial institutions.6 A
disruption to external funding, such as a
pullback by European banks, could raise the
cost of capital for Australian banks.7

A number of factors mitigate the
vulnerabilities. While net external liabilities
are relatively large, gross assets and liabilities
are relatively small (text figure). In particular,
both gross external debt (99 percent of GDP
in mid-2010) and short-term debt are smaller
than in many other advanced economies

with the debt is limited given that more than
40 percent is in Australian dollars and the
bulk of the remainder is hedged. In addition,
Australia’s current account deficits largely
reflect high investment rather than low saving
and should be sustainable as long as
investment leads to growth in export
capacity.
41.
The flexible exchange rate also
provides an important buffer. A disruption to
global funding markets would likely lead to a

depreciation of the Australian dollar, as
occurred after the Lehman collapse in 2008.
Such a depreciation would reduce the U.S.
dollar and Euro funding required to meet
banks’ desired Australian dollar funding. Also,
the relatively small holdings of foreign
currency denominated assets by Australian
banks would limit banks need for foreign
currency funding.
42.
To reduce rollover risk further, staff
advised that APRA encourage banks to rely
more on medium and long-term funding.
APRA has already taken steps in that
direction, including by issuing a discussion
paper on liquidity risk in September 2009. The
paper emphasizes stress testing and defined a
three-month “market disruption” scenario
that mainly targets banks resilience to a
disruption in access to wholesale funding.
APRA put these proposals on hold following
the issuance of the Basel Committee liquidity
proposals, including a net stable funding ratio,
in December 2009.
43.
While the value of the currency is
market-determined, staff estimates suggest
that the currency is mildly overvalued (5–
15 percent) from a medium-term
perspective, although these estimates are
subject to considerable uncertainty (Box 5).
The overvaluation is likely to be temporary
and may dissipate with eventual
normalization of interest rates in the United
States and other advanced economies.

Authorities’ Views
44.
The authorities acknowledged that
current account deficits arising from the
excess of domestic investment over saving
expose Australia to risks from shifts in
sentiment among offshore investors. They
noted that foreign investors’ willingness to
continue funding the current account deficit
owes substantially to Australia’s strong track
record in macroeconomic management,
especially its strong fiscal position, structural
reform, and sound financial regulation and
supervision. Boosting national saving to meet
more of the investment needs would help
reduce the current account financing risks.
Plans to raise the compulsory superannuation
contribution from 9 to 12 percent of
employee earnings over time and to achieve
budget surpluses, on average, over the
medium term should help increase national
saving.
45.
The authorities agreed on the need
for careful assessment of liquidity risks and
are committed to the development and
adoption of international liquidity standards.
They noted, however, that there would not
be sufficient government securities on offer
for Australian banks to comply with the
proposed Liquidity Coverage ratios using such
assets alone. In addition, the Net Stable
Funding ratio of the form originally proposed
may be challenging for many banking
systems, including Australia’s and is currently
being reworked by the Basel Committee.

VII. STAFF APPRAISAL
46.
The impact of the global crisis was
milder than in other advanced economies
thanks to strong demand from emerging Asia
and decisive policy responses. A mining
boom is driving a strong recovery and growing

integration with emerging Asia underpins
favorable medium-term growth prospects.
But the near-term outlook is clouded by
downside risks mainly related to the global
economy.

27

Box 5. Australia’s Equilibrium Real Effective Exchange Rate
Staff estimates suggest an overvaluation of the Australian dollar of 5–15 percent, but the
estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty, as shown by the wide range of the confidence
intervals. The estimates are based on the macroeconomic balance (MB) approach, the equilibrium
real exchange rate (ERER) approach, and the external sustainability (ES) approach).
The MB approach estimates the
current account deficit norm at
almost 5 percent of GDP. The
norm estimate is based on a
fixed effect of -2.8 percent, with
the relatively high population
growth contributing
-3.0 percent and the relative
fiscal balance contributing
0.4 percent. The projected
current account deficit is just
above this norm, implying an
overvaluation of about 7½ percent.

The ERER estimates suggest an overvaluation broadly in line with the MB approach. The model
explains the REER on the basis of the terms of trade, relative productivity, and relative government
consumption. Using June 2010 as the benchmark, the equation suggests an overvaluation of
6 percent, assuming that terms of trade will remain flat over the medium term.
The ES approach implies an overvaluation of about 13½ percent, assuming that net foreign
liabilities (NFL) stabilize at the mid-2010 level of 60 percent of GDP. However, to stabilize NFL to
55 percent of GDP—about the average of the past 10 years—the REER would need to depreciate by
about 15 percent.

47.
The RBA has appropriately unwound
earlier monetary policy stimulus. If the
recovery remains on track and downside risks
dissipate, monetary policy will need to tighten
further to contain inflation pressures
generated by the mining boom. However, if
the global recovery stalls or international
capital markets come under severe stress, the
RBA has ample scope to cut the policy rate
and provide liquidity support for banks.
48.
The pace of exit from fiscal stimulus
is appropriate, assuming the recovery
proceeds as expected. The authorities’ plan
for a return to surplus by 2012/13 should put
Australia in a strong position to deal with
future shocks. Ample scope exists to slow the
pace of exit or loosen fiscal policy in response
to a downside scenario.
49.
The automatic fiscal stabilizers
should be allowed to operate fully, given
that the growing dependence on mining may
amplify the business cycle. This implies saving
revenue windfalls and running larger budget
surpluses during upswings than in the past to
help avoid potential overheating and building
a buffer against a sharp fall in commodity
prices. Preparing a downside scenario for the
budget in which commodity prices fall sharply
may help build political support for running
larger surpluses during the good times.
50.
The recent review of the tax system
is welcome, including the introduction of the
MRRT. However, consideration should be
given to broadening the coverage of the
MRRT beyond iron ore and coal. Tax reform
should also facilitate the reallocation of
capital and labor to the mining sector. More
reliance on consumption-based taxes would

allow for the elimination of inefficient state
taxes and make room for reductions in
personal income taxes that would encourage
increases in labor supply and saving.
51.
Banks remain sound but the
authorities should remain vigilant as banks
could adopt riskier strategies. APRA’s regular
stress testing is commendable as it has
provided a careful assessment of the
vulnerabilities banks face. The authorities'
efforts to improve banks’ own stress testing
capabilities is welcome and continued close
monitoring by APRA of banks' risk assessment
is needed.
52.
The projected increase in the current
account deficit to about 6 percent of GDP
over the medium term, together with sizable
net external liabilities and short-term
external debt, present some risks. The
deficits, however, should be sustainable if
they continue to be driven by high investment
that builds export capacity. But efforts to
raise national saving, including through a
return to budget surpluses, would help
contain current account deficits. Rollover risks
associated with short-term external debt
could be reduced further by encouraging
banks to extend the maturity of their offshore
funding.
53.
From a medium-term perspective,
the exchange rate is mildly overvalued.
However, the extent of overvaluation is
uncertain and is likely to dissipate as interest
rates in the United States and other advanced
economies eventually normalize.
54.
Staff recommends that the next
Article IV consultation be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Appendix I. Australia: Unwinding Crisis-Related Monetary Policy Measures
Measures Taken

Status of Unwinding

Monetary Policy
Rate

The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut its policy
rate from 7¼ percent to 3 percent over the seven
months to April 2009.

The RBA has increased the policy
rate by 150 basis points to
4½ percent in six moves starting
in October 2009, the most
recent increase was in May.

Liquidity Support
and Foreign
Exchange Swap
Arrangement

The RBA extended the list of securities used as
collateral in repo operations to include residential
mortgage-backed securities, commercial paper,
and asset-backed commercial paper.
Furthermore, the RBA undertook a larger share of
repos of up to one-year maturity.
The RBA established a US$30 billion swap line
with the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank in September
2008, initially through April 2009 and later
extended to February 2010.

The swap line was used up to
early 2009, and expired on
February 1, 2010.

The government announced that it would
purchase up to $A 16 billion of residential
mortgage-backed securities.
Funding Guarantees

Sources: IMF staff.

The Australian Government Guarantee Scheme
for Large Deposits and Wholesale Funding (the
Guarantee Scheme) was announced by the
government on October 12, 2008 and formally
commenced on November 28, 2008. The Scheme
guaranteed deposit balances up to and including
$A 1 million per customer held in an eligible
authorized deposit taking institution (Australianowned and subsidiaries of foreign-owned banks,
but not branches) and existing or new large
deposits (over $A 1 million) and wholesale
funding (for a fee of 70 to 150 basis points
depending on the credit rating of the institution).
Branches of foreign-owned banks were also
included after the Scheme commenced for a fee.

The wholesale funding
guarantee was phased out for
new liabilities from March 31,
2010, remaining in effect only
for the liabilities previously
guaranteed for the relevant
term.
Separate arrangements will
continue to apply for deposit
balances totaling up to and
including $A 1 million per
customer per institution until
October 2011, when the level of
coverage will be revised. Such
deposits are guaranteed without
charge.

36
Appendix II. Australia: Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP):
Key Recommendations of the 2006 FSAP and Update on the Progress of Implementation1
Issue

Key Recommendations

Progress of Implementation

Banking

Continue to ensure
strong risk management
practices, including
through regular stress
testing.

The Basel II framework has been implemented since January 2008, with the five
major banks approved to adopt internal models for credit and operational risk.
Stress testing is regularly carried out by banks as part of their Internal Capital
Adequacy Assessment Process. As part of its supervisory action, APRA thoroughly
assesses banks’ risk management practices promptly driving enhancements if
deemed necessary.

Failure
Resolution
and Crisis
Management

Continue to develop a
formal process to
manage the failure of
individual institutions
and more widespread
crises.

The government introduced in October 2008 a Financial Claims Scheme (FCS),
establishing depositors protection with a limit of $A 1 million in case of a bank’s
failure (the guarantee applies also to claims of policyholders of a failed general
insurer). The Council of Financial Regulators is reviewing the parameters of the FCS,
in particular its monetary cap. The Council held a crisis management simulation
exercise in 2009. In 2010, legislation was passed to enhance APRA’s crisis
management powers in relation to distressed banks and general insurers.

Supervisory
Capacity

Ensure that the
supervisory agencies
have adequate
resources and flexibility.

In the 2007/08 Budget, APRA received additional funding over a four-year period to
improve its staff capabilities. In October 2008, to manage issues associated with the
global financial crisis, the government provided additional funding to APRA of
$A 45.5 million over four years. The government has also enhanced APRA’s
flexibility by removing the requirement to obtain ministerial consent before taking
administrative actions. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission
(ASIC) also received substantial funding increases over recent years. APRA has
released a discussion paper that proposes a new supervisory framework for crossindustry financial conglomerates (level 3 groups). The proposed framework seeks
to increase APRA’s ability to assess and manage the complex risks that may arise in
these groups to improve the supervision of prudential entities in these groups.

Cooperation
with New
Zealand
Regulators

Build on the progress
made within the TransTasman Council on
Banking Supervision to
improve coordination in
crisis management.

Legislative changes formalizing a requirement on regulators in the two countries to
be alert to each other’s interests in times of stress came into force in both countries
in December 2006. The work of the Trans-Tasman Banking Council now focuses
more on the practical aspects of coordination in crisis management with a protocol
being agreed with the aim of establishing procedures to jointly deal with a regional
banking crisis. A joint crisis management exercise is expected to be carried out in
the second half of 2011.

Insurance

Push ahead with Stage
II reforms (e.g., capital
management,
reinsurance
documentation,
corporate government
standards, disclosure
requirements).

APRA is harmonizing prudential requirements, including capital adequacy, between
life insurance, general insurance, and banking sectors. From July 1, 2008, all Direct
Offshore Foreign Insurers operating in Australia must be authorized by APRA and
subject to Australia’s prudential regime. Discretionary Mutual Funds are now
subject to rigorous and compulsory information collection.

AML/CFT

Give high priority to
make the appropriate
legislative and
operational
arrangements in the
AML/CFT area.

The AML/CFT Act was adopted in December 2006. The first tranche of reforms
covered the activities of financial service providers, gambling services and bullion
dealers. Implementation is now complete. The second tranche of legislative and
regulatory reforms, intended to capture designated non-financial businesses and
professionals is planned is under consideration by the Government. Legislation has
been implemented facilitating information exchange between the Australian
Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) and APRA.

Appendix III. Australia: Main Recommendations of the 2009 Article IV Consultation
(Consultation Discussions Ended on August, 5, 2009)
Fund Recommendations

Policy Actions

Fiscal policy: Staff noted that there was scope for
further fiscal stimulus should the outlook for growth
weakened further, although monetary policy should be
the first line of defense. If growth were slower than
expected in the near-term, staff advised to let the
automatic stabilizers fully operate.

With the economy recovering at a faster pace than
expected, the fiscal stimulus has started to be
withdrawn as originally planned and revenue
windfalls have been largely saved.

Staff welcomed the authorities’ fiscal strategy and
intention to return to surpluses in 2015-16, but noted
that further fiscal adjustment may be needed. Growth
of real spending would need to be constrained below
the 2 percent annual real rate envisaged in the budget.
And if revenues were higher than currently expected,
the authorities should strive for an earlier return to
surplus.

The current fiscal strategy envisages returning to a
budget surplus by 2012/13, three years earlier than
envisaged. Once the budget is back in surplus, the
government will retain a 2 percent real cap on
spending growth, on average, until the budget
surplus reaches 1 percent of GDP.

Monetary policy: Staff suggested that the RBA
exercise caution in tightening in view of the fragile
state of the global economy. Staff suggested that if the
outlook for growth and inflation weakens, the RBA had
scope for further cuts in the policy rate. Staff
suggested that the authorities consider
unconventional easing monetary policy measures, in
the unlikely event that such measures are needed.

As the recovery was stronger than expected
the RBA started to withdraw monetary stimulus,
raising the policy rate to 4½ percent in six steps, the
most recent in May.

Financial sector policy: Staff recommended that in the
future stress tests should be based on more extreme
scenarios than used in the past. The test should be
undertaken jointly with their subsidiaries.
Staff recommended that banks continue to manage
carefully their short- term offshore debt and the
planned introduction of new liquidity guidelines
should encourage less reliance on short-term
wholesale funding.

APRA conducted stress tests, most recently in
2009/10 in cooperation with the Reserve Bank of
New Zealand and the New Zealand subsidiaries of
Australian banks.

When a member has overdue financial obligations outstanding for more than three
months, the amount of such arrears will be shown in this section.

VII. Exchange Rate Arrangement. Australia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement, and maintains an exchange system that is
free from restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions, except for exchange restrictions that are maintained solely for the preservation
of national or international security and which have been notified to the Fund pursuant to
Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51). The exchange rate is free floating, but the
Reserve Bank of Australia retains discretionary power to intervene. There are no taxes or
subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange.
VIII. Restrictions on Capital Transactions. Australia maintains a capital transactions
regime that is virtually free of restrictions. Two main restrictions on foreigners require:
authorization for significant ownership of Australian corporations; and approval for
acquisition of real estate.

ANNEX II. AUSTRALIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision is adequate for surveillance. Australia subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS) and its metadata are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
(DSBB). In recent years, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has taken several initiatives to
further improve the quality of the data, such as including the prices of financial services in the CPI
and developing new measures of labor underutilization.
In September 2006, STA met with officials from the ABS, the Australian Prudential Regulation
Authority, and the Reserve Bank of Australia to encourage the reporting of monetary data using the
standardized report forms (SRFs) introduced in October 2004. The SRFs provide for accounting data
to be broken down by instrument, sector, and currency. In March 2010, a STA mission took place in
Sydney and Canberra to prepare the Data Module of the Report on the Observance of Standards and
Codes (ROSC) assessment.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
Australia
On October 27, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Australia. 1
Background
Despite growth slowing due to the global financial crisis, Australia was one of the few advanced
economies to escape recession in 2009. This reflected growing links with Asia, including strong
demand for commodities from China and India, a prompt and significant macro policy response
to the global crisis, a healthy banking sector, and a flexible exchange rate. The labor market
also proved to be flexible in the face of the shock.
With the recovery well on track and dissipating spare capacity, policy stimulus is appropriately
being withdrawn. The RBA has raised the policy rate to 4½ percent in six steps, the most
recent in May. The increases in the policy rate have flowed through effectively to both mortgage
and business lending rates which have returned close to their 10-year averages. As originally
planned, the fiscal stimulus is being reduced starting in 2010.
A mining boom is underway, as commodity prices have rebounded and the outlook remains
favorable. Real GDP growth is projected at 3–3½ percent in 2010 and 2011, with private
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

investment in mining and commodity exports taking over from public demand as the main driver
of growth. The terms of trade is expected to rise to historic highs in late 2010, driving a mining
boom that is likely to be long lasting, given increasing ties with fast-growing emerging Asia.
The main risks relate to the global outlook and, in the near term, are tilted largely to the
downside. If the global recovery stalls and Chinese demand for commodities declines,
Australia’s terms of trade could fall sharply. In addition, concerns about fiscal sustainability in
Europe could disrupt global financial markets and push up the cost of capital for Australian
borrowers. On the domestic front, a fall in house prices, which Fund staff assesses could be
mildly overvalued, and deleveraging by highly indebted households could negatively impact
private consumption and slow the recovery. An upside risk is that the mining boom may have a
larger-than-expected impact on output and inflation.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They commended the
authorities’ decisive policy response on the back of sound fundamentals which, together with
strong demand from emerging Asia, cushioned the impact of the global crisis. Australia’s
economic prospects are favorable, driven by a mining boom and increasing integration with
emerging Asia, although the near-term outlook is somewhat clouded by the uncertain global
environment.
Directors welcomed the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) timely unwinding of monetary
stimulus. They noted that if the recovery and economic growth remain on track and downside
risks dissipate, monetary policy might need to tighten further to contain inflation pressures.
Should the global recovery stall, the RBA has scope to cut the policy rate.
Directors agreed that the pace of exit from fiscal stimulus was appropriate. They commended
the authorities’ plan to return to surplus by 2012/13 and noted that there is enough fiscal space
to slow the pace of exit or loosen fiscal policy in response to a downside scenario. Directors
also noted that the automatic fiscal stabilizers should be allowed to operate fully, given that the
growing dependence on mining may amplify the business cycle. This implies running larger
budget surpluses during upswings to help avoid potential overheating and build a buffer against
a sharp fall in commodity prices.
Directors welcomed the recent review of the tax system, including the introduction of the mineral
resource rent tax (MRRT). They stressed the importance of broadening the coverage of the
MRRT beyond iron ore and coal. Directors noted that more reliance on consumption-based
taxes would allow for the elimination of inefficient state taxes and make room for reductions in
personal income taxes, and encouraged the authorities to build consensus toward this end.
Directors welcomed the fact that the Australian banks are sound. They commended the
Australian Prudential Regulation Authority’s (APRA) regular stress testing and the authorities’
efforts to improve banks’ own stress testing capabilities and to extend stress testing beyond the

3
banking sector. Directors encouraged continued vigilance to risks in the mortgage sector and
close monitoring by APRA of banks’ risk assessments and strategies.
Directors noted the vulnerabilities arising from the projected widening of the current account
deficit and sizable short-term external debt. Efforts to raise national saving, including through a
return to budget surpluses, would help contain current account deficits. Directors considered
that rollover risks associated with short-term external debt could be reduced further by
encouraging banks to extend the maturity of their offshore funding.
Directors recognized that the floating exchange rate has served Australia well and provides an
important buffer against external vulnerabilities. They noted staff’s assessment that the
Australian dollar may be mildly overvalued from a medium-term perspective, while recognizing
that the extent of overvaluation is uncertain.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
