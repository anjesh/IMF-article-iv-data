EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The January 12, 2010 earthquake was a major setback for Haiti, after several years of progress
in maintaining macroeconomic stability and implementing essential reforms. Performance under
the PRGF/ECF-supported program (November 2006-May 2010) remained satisfactory, despite a series
of shocks, political instability, and social unrest. The sixth and last ECF review was completed on
January 27, 2010, together with an augmentation of access equivalent to 80 percent of quota.
There are signs that the economy is now rebounding, despite a relatively slow start of
reconstruction activities. Damages and losses from the earthquake are estimated at 120 percent of
2009 GDP. Agriculture, construction, and textile manufacturing are leading the recovery. However, the
humanitarian situation remains dire, with about 1.3 million people still in temporary shelters.
Successful implementation of the authorities’ medium-term reconstruction plan hinges crucially
on the timely disbursement of aid commitments. Donors will need to accelerate disbursements of
the amounts pledged in order for the reconstruction to proceed and to ensure a rapid improvement in
living conditions. The reconstruction plan aims at sustainably raising medium-term growth and
reducing poverty by creating decentralized economic growth poles, reducing vulnerability to natural
disasters, enhancing access to basic social services, and strengthening state institutions. To support
reconstruction, donors pledged US$9.9 billion, of which US$5.3 billion are to be disbursed over the
next 18 months. Donors are also committed to cancelling Haiti’s debt.
The proposed three-year program, supported by a new ECF arrangement in an amount
equivalent to 50 percent of quota, aims at buttressing macroeconomic policies and boosting
economic growth. In the context of large and volatile aid inflows, Fund financing would help mitigate
excessive exchange rate and reserves movements. These inflows (projected to triple to about
15 percent of GDP a year on average in 2010-14) will likely place upward pressure on the currency,
which will have to be mitigated by efforts to expand supply capacity and remove structural obstacles to
competitiveness. Program risks remain high, but the earthquake has highlighted the urgency of moving
forward with the unfinished reform agenda and further strengthening institutions and economic
governance.
Relations with the Fund. Haiti has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and
its exchange rate system is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current transactions. The
de jure exchange regime remains a managed float with no pre-determined path for the exchange rate.

I. POST-EARTHQUAKE CHALLENGES 1
1.
The massive January 12, 2010 earthquake struck Haiti at a time when its
economic outlook was improving. The earthquake caused unprecedented destruction of
human and physical capital, with damages and losses estimated at 120 percent of 2009 GDP.
Over 225,000 persons were killed and 300,000 injured. Most ministries, hospitals, and
schools were destroyed. Prior to the earthquake, the political and security situations were
gradually improving and foreign investors’ interest in the tourism, energy, and textile
manufacturing sectors had begun to materialize. In 2009, economic growth reached close to
3 percent. The authorities’ success at maintaining macroeconomic stability and implementing
essential structural reforms despite of numerous shocks allowed the cancellation of
US$1.2 billion of debt under the HIPC/MDRI Initiative in mid-2009.
2.
Although the international emergency response has been generous, the
humanitarian situation is only slowly improving, increasing risks of widespread social
unrest. At a high-level UN conference in March, the government presented its reconstruction
plan, aiming at building a better Haiti. The international community committed
US$9.9 billion in support of this plan, of which US$5.3 billion are to be disbursed over the
next 18 months (Text Table 1). In

of the rising discontent of the
population.
3.
Timely disbursement of the amounts pledged, effective coordination of
reconstruction efforts, and strengthening of the government’s implementation capacity
are essential. The Interim Haiti Reconstruction Commission (IHCR) is expected to set
strategic reconstruction priorities and coordinate government and donor activities (including
NGOs). A Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF, or Haiti Reconstruction Fund ─ HRF) operated
by the World Bank will help channel resources for the reconstruction. Disbursement of aid
through the government budget or the Multi-Donor Trust Fund would enhance coordination
and local capacity building.

1

Discussions were held in Port-au-Prince during May 24-28, 2010. The staff team, which comprised
Ms. Deléchat (head), Ms. Martin and Ms. Touré (all WHD), Ms. Riad (SPR), Mr. Gray (MCM), and
Mr. Bouhga-Hagbe (Resident Representative), was joined by Mr. Perez (OED) for some of the policy
discussions. The team met with Prime Minister Bellerive, Finance Minister Baudin, Central Bank Governor
Castel, and other government and private sector representatives.

Boosting investment will be key to sustainably raising medium-term growth and
reducing poverty beyond the reconstruction period. The authorities’ objectives to sustain
an annual rate of growth of 5-6 percent over the medium-term and reduce the poverty rate
from 54 percent to 40 percent by 2015 are

5.
In this context, the new ECF arrangement supports macroeconomic policies
aimed at facilitating the absorption of aid inflows and raising medium-term growth, in
line with the authorities’ objectives. Fund resources would play an important role in
allowing the authorities to smooth out exchange rate and reserves fluctuations that may be
caused by large and volatile aid resources. Aid inflows are expected to triple from an annual
average of 5–6 percent of GDP during FY 2005-09 to almost 15 percent of GDP during FY
2011–14. Close coordination and enhanced effectiveness of fiscal, monetary, and exchange
rate policies will be needed to ensure effective spending and absorption of these inflows. The
program design complements and builds upon the large financial and technical support
provided by IFIs and bilateral donors for Haiti’s reconstruction (Box 1).
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS: AN INCIPIENT RECOVERY
6.
Economic activity has rebounded rapidly since the earthquake. Agricultural
production, construction (including debris removal), and textile manufacturing are leading
the recovery. Remittances, which grew by 12 percent in January-May (year-on-year), are
supporting consumption and imports. The trade deficit is widening, although exports are
recovering. Twelve-month inflation reached 6.4 percent in May, in line with staff’s
projections for the end of this fiscal year (8.5 percent at end-September). The Gourde has
remained broadly stable against the U.S. dollar since end-January, as the central bank
(Banque de la République d’Haiti─BRH) has stepped up its net foreign exchange purchases.
NIR grew to US$646 million at end-May (from US$402 million at end-December), while the
12-month rate of base money growth rose to 28 percent (Figure 1, Tables 1, 3-4, MEFP ¶5).
7.
A recovery in revenue collection and weak spending have helped compensate for
slow budget support disbursements. Revenue has been trending upward since January, and
tax collections during February-May represented about 80 percent of budgeted amounts. The
good performance of taxes based on sales of goods and services is likely to continue, as
economic activity strengthens. However, sustaining the favorable revenue collection from
income taxes, based on FY 2009 activity, will require a strengthening in controls and audits.
Capital spending has remained subdued due to capacity constraints and uncertain financing,
but has started to pick up in May. As of end-June, budget support disbursements amounted to
only 30 percent of total commitments for the fiscal year ending in September (Table 2).

5
Box 1. The Fund’s Response to the Earthquake and Donor Coordination
The Fund’s prompt response to the January 2010 earthquake was closely coordinated with
those of other major multilateral and bilateral donors. Emergency interventions in the
immediate aftermath of the earthquake are being replaced by support for the authorities’
reconstruction plan over the medium-term.
The Fund responded promptly to the emergency by providing liquidity support and
technical assistance to restore basic state functions. The US$102 million ECF augmentation
disbursed at end-January helped to keep cash flowing in the economy and finance emergency
imports. Fund technical assistance missions helped restore basic treasury and revenue
administration functions and provided advice on maintaining financial sector stability. These
efforts were closely coordinated with other donors’ interventions, which focused on providing
temporary office space and equipment to key government agencies (World Bank, Sweden,
USAID); reestablishing the payments system as well as the government payroll and basic IT
functions (World Bank, IDB and U.S. Treasury); and assessing the impact of the earthquake on
the insurance sector (World Bank).
The long-term reconstruction effort is supported by large-scale financial and technical
assistance from the international community. Substantial resources for reconstruction
projects, most of which are in the form of grants, have been committed by donors. Additional
budget support commitments amount to US$171 million for this fiscal year and next. Most of
Haiti’s creditors have also indicated that they would cancel Haiti’s remaining debt. In this
context, the proposed three-year ECF-supported arrangement aims at providing a coherent
macroeconomic framework that would help anchor support from other donors.
The new ECF program is supported by a comprehensive medium-term technical
assistance strategy focused on strengthening state institutions within the Fund’s core
areas of expertise. The Haitian authorities have expressed a clear commitment to use the
earthquake as an opportunity to accelerate reforms in certain areas, in particular revenue
administration. In the fiscal area, Fund TA will focus on tax policy and revenue administration,
budget preparation and planning, fiscal reporting, and Treasury management. The Fund is also
assisting in financial sector issues with the establishment of a Partial Credit Guarantee scheme
(PCG Fund) in collaboration with the World Bank, the IDB and the U.S. Treasury; the
development of a domestic Treasury bill market; central bank recapitalization; and the design
of a framework for insurance regulation. Haiti’s development partners are building capacity in
complementary fields, such as payroll management, internal and external audits and
procurement, anti-corruption and governance (World Bank), debt management (Canada, IDB),
energy sector (World Bank, Canada), and restoration of IT systems (USAID). The European
Union supports overall economic governance and public financial management reforms.

8.
Banking sector capitalization has been negatively affected by the earthquake. At
end-2009, the Haitian banking system was well capitalized and highly liquid. Credit and
deposits were growing, liquidity had improved, all banks posted positive earnings, and
non-performing loan ratios had declined. However, financial intermediation margins
remained wide, loan concentration high, and related lending pervasive. Bank capital has been
negatively affected by the earthquake, and non-performing loans rose from 8.6 percent of

6
total loans in December to 12.1 percent in March. 2 The authorities estimate that a third of
bank loans may have been impaired as a result of the earthquake. Private sector credit
declined by 12 percent between December and May (Figure 2, Table 5, MEFP ¶5). 3
9.
The earthquake also exposed the underlying vulnerabilities of the non-bank
financial sector. Both micro-finance institutions and insurance companies were poorly
regulated. Micro-finance institutions, which were undercapitalized and, for the most part,
uninsured, were hard-hit by the earthquake. For most borrowers to be able to repay existing
loans, maturities will need to be extended and some new credit provided. The insurance
sector is also affected, with gross costs estimated at around US$200 million. However,
reinsurance coverage for catastrophic events appears to have been appropriate, covering most
of the reinsured claims and about 75 percent of the total cost.
10.
The political and security situations are increasingly volatile. Parliamentary
elections, originally scheduled for February 2010, have been postponed to November 2010.
They will be held simultaneously with the presidential and municipal elections. A
controversy has emerged about the feasibility of this calendar, compounded by an 18-month
extension of the state of emergency during which the Executive can govern by decree. The
security situation in Port-au-Prince has also deteriorated since the earthquake, as criminals
and gang leaders escaped from prison, and kidnappings have increased, including of
foreigners.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS: BUILDING A BETTER HAITI
11.
The Government has prepared an ambitious reconstruction plan, which aims at
raising long-term growth and reducing poverty. This plan focuses on creating
decentralized poles of economic growth and strengthening state institutions (Box 2). It also
aims at reducing vulnerability to natural disasters and enhancing access to basic social
services. The priority areas identified in the plan are consistent with the PRSP, although the
plan gives more prominence to addressing housing and territorial development issues, which
have been heightened by the earthquake. The authorities intend to prepare a PRSP update in
2011 but, in the meantime, staff and the authorities agreed that the reconstruction plan
presents revised poverty reduction and growth objectives.

2

Excluding BNC, a large bank which absorbed the failed SOCABANK in 2008, the NPL ratio rose from
3.8 percent to 6.5 percent over the same period.

3

This decline was due in part to the fact that borrowers used their insurance payments to pay down lines of
credit until they are in a position to re-start their businesses.

7

Box 2: Haiti’s National Action Plan for Recovery and Development
On March 31, 2010 at a high-level UN donors’ conference, the authorities presented their
ten-year action plan for building a better Haiti, raising long-run growth and reducing
poverty. The first 18-month period aims at starting the economic recovery and reconstruction
process, while continuing to provide emergency support to the affected population. Priority is
given to humanitarian and rehabilitation needs ahead of the hurricane season. Schools and
universities are reopening. Measures to stabilize the financial system and restore SMEs access
to credit will help restart economic activity and create jobs.
The longer-term development and growth strategy is structured around four pillars:
• Territorial rebuilding. Economic activity is to be decentralized from the capital to the
rest of the country through the development of regional economic centers. This will also
require improving the transport and communication infrastructure, and implementing a
land settlement strategy with a reliable land registry.
• Economic rebuilding. Agriculture and private sector development are considered the
main growth engines. Agricultural yields will be improved through the distribution of
agricultural inputs and the development of irrigation and rural road networks. Private
sector development is to be promoted through: (i) strengthening the legal and regulatory
framework for doing business; (ii) facilitating the establishment of manufacturing
industries, tax-free zones, industrial areas, and tourism development; (iii) attracting
private investment, including by eliminating red tape; (iv) boosting credit to the private
sector, particularly to SMEs; and (v) seeking public-private partnerships (PPPs) for
large infrastructure projects.
• Social rebuilding. The plan aims at reducing poverty rates from 54 percent in 2009 to
40 percent by 2015 (share of the population living under 1 U.S. dollar per day).
Protecting the most vulnerable will be addressed by promoting employment and social
inclusion. Basic public services and social safety nets will be enhanced.
• Institutional rebuilding. Improving political, economic, and social governance will be
critical to the success of the plan. The plan highlights the needs to support democratic
institutions and seek political consensus.
Institutions dedicated to manage the reconstruction process started to operate in June.
The Interim Haiti Reconstruction Commission (IHRC) is co-chaired by Prime Minister
Bellerive and the UN Secretary General’s Special Envoy Bill Clinton. Its mandate over the
next 18 months will be to oversee reconstruction activity, including coordination among all
partners. The Commission is composed by an equal number of Haitian and donor
representatives. The IHRC will be replaced after 18 months by the Haiti Reconstruction
Agency (HRA). A Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) or Haiti Reconstruction Fund (HRF)
managed by the World Bank will support the reconstruction plan. All projects financed by the
HRF will have to be approved by the IHRC.

13.
Staff and the authorities agreed that this disappointing growth performance is to
a large extent attributable to the persistence of long-standing structural and
institutional barriers, which continue to deter private investment and credit. Haiti’s
extreme poverty, environmental degradation and concentration of the population in a few
areas have heightened vulnerability to natural disasters and other external shocks. Although
progress in maintaining macroeconomic stability, strengthening governance, and improving
political stability and security are notable, these achievements do not seem to have yet
reached the “critical mass” needed to boost private sector investment:
• Progress made in strengthening governance and democratic processes, as well as
improvements in the security situation, must be consolidated. Organizing a fair and
free general election 10 months after the earthquake is a challenge, but will be critical
to maintaining the government’s credibility and boosting donor and investor
confidence. MINUSTAH’s presence should help reverse the post-earthquake
deterioration in the security situation. The authorities’ strong commitment to continue
strengthening governance is also welcome (see Box 3).
• The population’s access to basic social services, in particular health and education,
will need to be further enhanced. Living standards have deteriorated since the
earthquake and tangible improvements must be made to reduce the risks of civil unrest
and enhance human capital and labor productivity.

9
• Infrastructure, in particular energy and transportation, needs to be upgraded. Energy
supply is inadequate, expensive and unreliable. Roads, ports, airports, irrigation
systems need to be repaired or built from scratch.
• Property rights are difficult to enforce, impeding private investment and credit. The
civil and land registries are unreliable and incomplete. The judiciary system is weak
and 80 percent of this system in Port-au-Prince has been adversely affected by the
earthquake.
• Doing business is expensive and difficult. Administrative procedures for setting up
new businesses are lengthy, costly, and cumbersome (according to the 2010 World
Bank’s Doing Business indicators, it currently takes 180 days to start a business). The
Center for Facilitation of Investments (CFI) will need to be transformed into an
efficient one-stop shop for foreign investors.
14.
The authorities are confident that implementation of their Action Plan will help
address these issues and boost GDP growth to about 6 percent a year by 2015 while
significantly reducing poverty. Staff agreed that the reconstruction plan provides a sound
basis for sustainably raising growth, and noted that the substantial resources pledged by
donors represented a unique opportunity to tackle Haiti’s development challenges in a
comprehensive manner. Given vast needs, staff recommended that the authorities set clear
priorities, further articulate their growth strategy, and focus their interventions where they
could be the most effective. Donor-funded projects should be prioritized and coordinated by
the Reconstruction Commission to reflect the authorities’ priorities.
15.
Staff noted that successful economic decentralization was the cornerstone of the
authorities’ Action Plan. Decentralization of economic activity, including across sectors
(agriculture, tourism, textile manufacturing), would help expand and diversify the sources of
growth, boost competitiveness, and enhance resilience to shocks. Creating new economic
growth poles would imply developing infrastructure, housing, and business-related services
in the provinces. To this aim, staff supported the authorities’ strategy to engage in PPPs for
the development of ports and airports, to help attract private capital while minimizing costs
to the budget. However, staff emphasized the importance of strong legal and regulatory
frameworks in this area, and noted that Fund technical assistance in that area would be
available. Staff also stressed the importance of creating a level playing field for investment,
and urged the authorities not to use tax exemptions or other discriminatory incentives to
favor investment in the provinces.
16.
Staff highlighted the importance of rapidly adopting concrete measures to
jumpstart decentralization and growth. The introduction and enforcement of a new
building code are critical to increasing foreign direct investment in the textile and tourism
sectors, and to developing new free trade and industrial zones. Strengthening the cadastre and
property rights is also fundamental for the population to rebuild and for activity to settle
outside of the capital. Small businesses have been hard hit by the earthquake, and a lack of
adequate credit to the private sector in need of capital to restart activities could delay the
recovery. The launching of major public and infrastructure works would create jobs and
generate a reconstruction momentum. Delays in implementing these measures would
undermine confidence in the government’s ability to implement its plan and risk weighing
permanently on medium-term growth prospects.

10
17.
Over the medium-term, the authorities concurred that reforms to enhance
non-price competitiveness would be critical in preserving export competitiveness, while
allowing the absorption of large aid inflows (MEFP ¶22-24). The authorities agreed that
better infrastructure, including roads and energy supply, and improvements in the business
climate would go a long way toward boosting private investment. The government is
determined to cut red-tape, simplify business regulations, and improve the delivery of
judicial services. The authorities have started to revise the legal and financial regulation
framework with a view to meeting international FDI standards. Among other advantages, this
would enable Haiti’s textile export sector to fully benefit from the Haiti Economic Lift
Program (HELP) Act. 4 On December 11, 2009, Haiti also concluded the Economic
Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the European Union, joining the fourteen Caribbean
states that signed the EPA in October 2008. The EPA is expected to strengthen Haiti’s ties
both with the European Union and with the region, and allow it to benefit from a stable
trading environment for goods and services as well as greater opportunities for foreign
investment.
18.
Against this backdrop, discussions focused on macroeconomic policies that
would help support growth and the authorities’ plan. More efficient and transparent
spending and renewed efforts to increase revenue would enhance the credibility of the state
and the availability of domestic resources for reconstruction. Measures to boost absorptive
capacity, modernize monetary and exchange rate operations, and enhance credit growth will
be essential to eliciting the needed supply response.
B.

Macroeconomic Outlook

19.
Staff and the authorities agreed that the macroeconomic outlook for FY 2010–13
was highly uncertain and would depend heavily on the path of aid disbursements.
Official grants are projected to average about US$1.5 billion a year (over 20 percent of GDP)
until 2013, which will require careful coordination of macroeconomic policies.
• In the near-term, growth should rebound strongly, to about 9 percent on average over
the next two years, driven mostly by reconstruction. Staff and the authorities agreed
that the projected growth path was realistic, based on detailed estimates of sectoral
damages and losses, recovery potential in each sector, and given the projected path of
aid inflows (Appendix I). Annual inflation would remain high, at 8.6 percent in
FY 2011, due to supply and transport bottlenecks, and strong demand. Inflation would
gradually decline thereafter to 7 percent by end-FY 2013.
• Medium-term projections assume that aid inflows are effectively spent and absorbed,
with the widening of the fiscal and current account deficits associated with
reconstruction spending and imports to be sustainably covered by grants. NIR
coverage would remain at about 3 months of imports throughout the period. By 2013,
both the fiscal deficit and the current account (excluding grants) would converge to

The HELP Act, which was passed by the U.S. Congress on May 6, 2010 would extend Haiti’s trade
preferences provided under the HOPE II initiative until 2020 and expand duty-free access to the U.S. market for
additional Haitian textile and apparel exports. The initiative is designed to create jobs for Haitian factories.

levels consistent with fiscal and external sustainability, as indicated in the debt
sustainability analysis and staff’s exchange rate assessment (Text Table 4, Table 6,
MEFP ¶6). 5 Remittances to Haiti tend to be more countercyclical and resilient than in
other countries of the region and are projected to continue to grow, albeit at a slower
pace than in recent months (Figure 3). However, external vulnerabilities remain high,
and weaker-than-anticipated remittances and exports could derail growth (Table 7),
while natural disasters will continue to pose risks over the medium term.

C. Fiscal Policy
20.
Fiscal policy discussions focused on short- and medium-term challenges
associated with the reconstruction. The earthquake destroyed the tax administration
building and information systems, killed many directors, and damaged tax records. Staff and
the authorities agreed that an immediate priority was to find adequate office space and restore
basic functions. The earthquake has also further weakened spending execution capacity, at a
time where needs are both massive and urgent. Over the medium term, the authorities noted
that their main objectives were to: (i) raise domestic revenue through a reform of the tax
system and the building of modern and efficient tax and customs administrations; (ii) align
the budget and its financing to reconstruction priorities within a programmatic framework;
and (iii) continue strengthening public financial management to enhance the quality and
transparency of spending.
Tax administration and policy
21.
Staff and the authorities agreed that a comprehensive tax reform and a stronger
revenue administration would help raise domestic revenue collection above 13 percent
of GDP by FY 2013. At about 11 percent of GDP in FY 2009, Haiti’s fiscal pressure was
below that of similar countries, and it has been set back further by the earthquake. The
5

See EBS/10/139, supplement 1, and Appendix II.

12
authorities intend to increase revenue collection by broadening the tax base, combating fraud,
and reducing exemptions. Staff also welcomed the authorities’ efforts in leading an ambitious
reform of the revenue administration, which would help reach medium-term revenue
objectives.
22.
The authorities are designing a strategy for rebuilding a modern and efficient
tax administration. Tax and customs administration will be refocused on performance and
fiscal missions, verification and controls will be stepped up, and quarterly performance
reports will be published (MEFP ¶11). Design and implementation of the strategy will be
supported by technical assistance from the Fund and other partners.
23.
Tax policy reforms will focus on a review of the tax system, including
exemptions. The authorities welcomed Fund technical assistance in reforming the VAT,
excises, and income taxation, and for the preparation of a new tax code. As a first step, they
plan to establish, by end-September 2010, a working group tasked with preparing and
submitting revised tax laws to Parliament during FY 2011. These new laws would be
consolidated in a tax code in FY 2012. In the short-run, the authorities agreed to introduce
(by end-September) a tax on incoming international calls and car registration fees, which had
been delayed by the earthquake. These measures are expected to increase annual revenue by
about 0.4 percent of GDP. The authorities also indicated that they would continue reviewing
exemptions to reduce their number, and would publish quarterly reports identifying all fiscal
expenditures by beneficiary sector, starting in September 2010 (MEFP ¶11, Table 2).
Fiscal spending
24.
Staff and the authorities agreed that stronger and more transparent fiscal
institutions could help attract additional budget support resources. In May, Haiti’s main
budget support donors and the authorities agreed on a revised set of priority measures to
pursue ongoing reforms to enhance economic governance (Box 3). These measures would
form the basis for future budget support disbursements, thereby strengthening donor
coordination and increasing the predictability of external financing. Staff and the authorities
agreed to base program conditionality in the fiscal area on this common matrix, which
includes measures to strengthen budget preparation and execution, revenue mobilization,
payroll and treasury management, controls and audits and corruption prevention, as well as
measures to increase and track poverty-reduction spending. In the short-term, fiscal
transparency will be enhanced through the publication of data on: (i) quarterly spending on
poverty-reducing expenditures; (ii) monthly transfers to investment project accounts,
including PetroCaribe projects; and (iii) monthly subsidies and cash transfers by beneficiary
entity (MEFP ¶13–14).
25.
Strengthening public financial management will be essential to support the
implementation of the reconstruction plan. The authorities envisage progressively shifting
to a programmatic budget approach, starting with key line ministries in FY 2012. As a first
step, rolling multi-year public investment programs will be prepared, informed by better
recording and tracking of investment spending. CARTAC and FAD technical assistance is
supporting the establishment of a macro-fiscal unit at the Ministry of Finance that would help
strengthen planning and better reflect spending priorities in the budget. Budget planning will
be supported by the preparation of monthly reconciled Treasury balances and of quarterly

13
plans for liquidity management. The progressive move to a Single Treasury Account will
complement these reforms. (MEFP ¶14).

Box 3. Haiti: Recent Improvements in Governance
Since 2004, the Haitian government has implemented reforms aiming at improving
transparency and strengthening governance. The government is strongly committed to
continue with these reforms in order to improve the business environment, boost private
investment, and create jobs. Although Haiti continues to rank low in world governance indicators,
progress has been made in recent years in several areas:
•

Public financial management. Achievements include: (i) approval of budgets before the
start of the fiscal year and publication in the official journal; (ii) monthly publication of
information on budget execution; (iii) improvements in budget execution (the share of
spending executed without prior authorization fell from 62 percent of non-wage current
spending in FY2004 to 3 percent in FY 2009); (iv) reinforcement of expenditure
management and control through the extension of the current spending management system
(SYSDEP) to various branches of the government, the deployment of public accountants and
financial comptrollers in line ministries, ; (v) the establishment of civil service employment
verification systems based on attendance lists; (vi) auditing public accounts, submitting them
to Parliament, and publishing audit results; and (vii) the passing of a new Procurement law
in June 2009.

•

Public enterprises. Financial audits of the national port authority (APN), the
telecommunications company (TELECO), and the national electricity company (EDH), were
completed by international auditing firms in 2005. TELECO was privatized in May 2010,
completing the central bank’s disengagement from commercial activities.

•

Anticorruption efforts. The government created an Anticorruption Unit (ULCC) in 2004 to
fight corruption in the public administration. The unit key achievements’ include the
adoption and implementation of an asset declaration law for civil servants in 2008 and the
adoption of a national anticorruption strategy in March 2009.

While Haiti has been strengthening governance, efforts in that area need to be pursued.
Most decrees implementing the Procurement law have yet to be adopted, and compliance with the
asset declaration law among members of the legislative and judicial branch should improve. The
tracking and quality of public investment spending, and overall fiscal transparency, need to be
further enhanced. The authorities have committed to implementing specific measures in these
areas, as part of the common conditionality framework for budget support agreed with key
donors.

26.
To reach their objective of reducing the poverty rate to 40 percent by 2015, the
authorities aim at increasing priority social spending by 30 percent by September 2011
(MEFP ¶13). The earthquake has aggravated the poverty situation and led to a deterioration
in food security, highlighting the urgency of improving access to social services and reducing
vulnerability to natural disasters. The authorities noted that public investments under the
reconstruction plan would focus on improving the delivery of public services including
education and health, establishing basic social safety nets, and developing transport and
communication infrastructure.

14
Budget financing
27.
The authorities expressed a strong preference for channeling aid through
existing coordination mechanisms, either the budget or the MDTF. Staff agreed, noting
that this would help strengthen transparency, better monitor fiscal developments, and
improve coordination in an environment of limited capacity. Staff and the authorities agreed
to include all donor-financed government projects, as well as previously off-budget resources
such as PetroCaribe financing, in the revised FY 2010 and subsequent budgets and budget
execution reports. The Interim Haiti Reconstruction Commission (IHRC) is expected to play
the leading role in coordinating reconstruction activities with reconstruction institutions and
donors (including NGOs). It will also track aid disbursements to ensure transparency,
coordination, and exchange of information between all actors involved (MEFP ¶9).
28.
Despite the large donor pledges, the slow start of aid disbursements and
difficulties in securing adequate budget financing for the next 12-18 months has been a
concern. The immediate

that have lost their revenue base) and investment spending, which could be well-above
originally budgeted amounts to meet post-earthquake needs. They have also allocated a
portion of accumulated PetroCaribe resources (up to US$163 million) to emergency
relocation and infrastructure projects (MEFP ¶12). So far however, only 30 percent of all
scheduled budget support financing for this fiscal year has been disbursed, and ensuring that
the remainder will be disbursed before end-September 2010 is a challenge. The program
envisages that a financing shortfall of up to US$25 million could be compensated by an ad
hoc issuance of T-bills (MEFP ¶19). Based on projected quarterly budget support
disbursements, the first year of the program is fully financed (i.e. through end-June 2011).
However, a financing gap of about US$50 million remains for the last quarter of the fiscal
year ending in September 2011 (Text Table 5).

15
D. Financial Sector Policies
29.
Staff and the authorities agreed that restarting private sector credit while
preserving financial stability will be critical to the reconstruction efforts. Full
implementation of the financial sector reforms identified by the 2008 FSAP, including
measures to lower the cost of collateral and ease the recovery of non-performing loans,
would be the most effective way to support existing enterprises and boost credit. Staff
welcomed the BRH’s decision to restructure bank loans affected by the earthquake, provided
that they were performing before the earthquake. Staff also encouraged the BRH to relax
provisioning against NPLs, when the delays in payments were related to the earthquake. Staff
and the authorities agreed that it would be important to introduce a regulatory and
supervisory framework for the insurance sector, following on the establishment of a similar
framework for credit unions in FY 2009 (MEFP ¶15).
30.
The authorities highlighted the urgency of proceeding rapidly with their plans to
establish a Partial Credit Guarantee (PCG) scheme to restart private credit growth.
The scheme is composed of two pillars: (a) Pillar 1 aims at restructuring viable bank loans
impacted by the earthquake and financing business recovery; and (b) Pillar 2 supports new
lending to small and medium-sized enterprises. The PCG scheme can be accessed by banks
and cooperatives which are compliant with prudential standards and have strong lending
procedures. An upfront commission is payable, and after a deductible amount related to
bank-specific historic NPLs, the scheme would guarantee up to 50 percent of the unpaid
balance of loans under Pillar 1 and up to 80 percent of the loan under Pillar 2. Access terms
will be the same for state-owned and private banks, although the BRH acknowledges that
donors may require a heavier burden of proof for state-owned banks.
31.
Funding for the PCG still needs to be fully secured. About US$100 million in
capital is required for Pillar 1 and US$30 million for Pillar 2. Donor funding so far only
amounts to US$25-30 million, and is insufficient in regard to the total amount estimated to be
needed to capitalize the scheme (around US$130 million). Given the urgency of the situation,
staff agreed that the central bank should launch the scheme promptly, setting aside on a
temporary basis some of its foreign exchange reserves (US$70 million) as initial guarantee.
No payouts are expected during the first half year of operations of the scheme, as loans
covered must be non-performing for at least six months before claims can be made. Over
time, the authorities will need to secure additional resources to cover potential future losses
and replace the temporary BRH guarantee. Such financing could be secured in the form of
commitments from donors including through the MDTF.
32.
Staff noted that complementary financial reforms as identified in the 2008 FSAP
would be essential to deepen financial intermediation. The authorities had made good
progress prior to the earthquake in setting up a credit bureau that would help lower the cost
of lending. Although the building was destroyed in the earthquake, they are now rekindling
their efforts in that area. The authorities also plan to press ahead with the establishment of a
centralized registry for movable collateral and a strengthened civil registry and cadastre (for
which donors have offered funding and technical assistance). Reducing the spreads between
lending and borrowing rates, and improvements in risk assessment capacity are also expected
to help boost credit. (MEFP ¶17). Staff recommended reforming insolvency legislation.

16
E. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
33.
In real effective terms, Haiti’s currency has appreciated by almost 90 percent
between 2003 and December 2009. Despite this appreciation, export indicators have
improved since 2003, with Haiti’s export share of U.S. apparel imports up sharply in recent
years, and increases in market shares compared to regional textile export competitors (Figure
4). Staff and the authorities agreed that the pre-earthquake real appreciation did represent an
equilibrium response to the sustained increase in aid and remittance inflows, with the modest
overvaluation uncovered by econometric analysis well within the model’s error margins
(Appendix II).
34.
The authorities concurred that the appreciation trend is likely to continue in the
context of aid inflows, which could pose important challenges to monetary and
exchange rate management. In addition, lags between large and lumpy aid inflows and
related import demand can lead to exchange rate volatility. Staff agreed that the central
bank’s net purchases of foreign exchanges since the earthquake had helped smooth excessive
exchange rate volatility and rebuild reserves, but noted that this had also contributed to rapid
monetary growth. With inflation rising, staff recommended that, going forward, such
purchases be at least partly sterilized. The authorities indicated that they would continue to
aim at containing base money growth, while noting that large reconstruction expenditures
could contribute to an increase in money demand. They reiterated their commitment to
tighten monetary policy if needed (MEFP ¶18).
35.
The authorities’ plans include steps to improve the monetary operations
framework. High dollarization, underdeveloped money markets, and excess liquidity have
limited the effectiveness of monetary policy. Staff and the authorities agreed on the
importance of allowing for greater exchange rate flexibility and of deepening financial
markets over the medium term. This would help support the development of interest-rate
transmission mechanisms and enhance the effectiveness of open market operations. The
authorities also plan to develop regular foreign exchange auctions (instead of sales where
both price and quantity are fixed) as part of a strategy to facilitate the absorption of aid
inflows while managing exchange rate fluctuations (MEFP ¶19).
36.
The central bank welcomed the prospect of replacing BRH bonds with T-bills,
and the associated move to open-market operations as one of the main instruments of
monetary policy. The authorities envisage launching the domestic T-bill market with the
publication of a regular auction calendar. Staff noted that, in order to be successful, the
development of a T-bill market needed to be underpinned by improvements in liquidity and
Treasury management, inflation forecasting, and debt management. Staff noted that T-bills
would also be used to gradually securitize the outstanding government debt to the central
bank and thus contribute to BRH recapitalization (MEFP ¶19).
37.
Staff and the authorities agreed that central bank independence should be
enhanced to strengthen the ability of the central bank to conduct monetary operations.
Implementation of the central bank recapitalization plan would need to be complemented by
the adoption of a modern central bank law. The new law (to be submitted to Parliament by
FY 2011) will anchor the principle of central bank independence and provide for the gradual
elimination of direct government financing. It will also provide for the rotation of external

17
auditors and the publication of audited BRH accounts within 6 months after the end of the
fiscal year (MEFP ¶20).
F. External Debt Sustainability
38.
Haiti remains at high risk of debt distress, as the earthquake has significantly
worsened the macroeconomic outlook. Despite the delivery of US$1.2 billion in debt relief
under the HIPC/MDRI initiative in June 2009, Haiti remained at high risk of debt distress
prior to the earthquake. By generating massive reconstruction needs, deteriorating the
macroeconomic outlook, reducing the export base, and further weakening debt management
capacity, the earthquake further worsened Haiti’s debt outlook. The updated LIC DSA shows
that Haiti’s risk of debt distress remains high, with the net present value (NPV) of debt-toexports ratio breaching the relevant policy-dependent threshold in the baseline scenario for
the medium-term.
39.
Delivery of debt relief announced by multilateral and bilateral creditors after
the earthquake, including the Fund, would substantially improve the debt sustainability
outlook. Creditors representing about 92 percent of Haiti’s end-September 2009 debt stock
(excluding the Fund) are committed to cancelling Haiti’s remaining debt. 6 Among the main
multilateral and bilateral creditors, the World Bank has already cancelled SDR 24.3 million
(about US$36 million as of May 21, 2010), and debt relief for the IDB (US$479 million) is
expected to become effective in the near future, as soon as the committed donor financing is
available. Venezuela also confirmed that it would provide debt relief on US$395 million of
outstanding PetroCaribe debt. 7 If Haiti were to be deemed eligible to full stock debt relief by
the Fund, such relief would cover about US$263 million (SDR 178.13 million) in
outstanding debt as of end-January 2010. An alternative DSA scenario including these debt
relief commitments shows that, although the debt-to-exports ratio would breach the policydependent ceiling between 2014 and 2018, external debt would then be placed on a
downward path. Nonetheless, vulnerability to shocks would remain high, highlighting the
importance of covering financing needs mostly through grants; any new borrowing should be
limited and on highly concessional terms.
40.
The authorities are committed to continue to strengthen debt management
capacity. Ongoing efforts include the operationalization of a debt unit with front, middle,
and back-office functions that would be overseeing external and domestic debt. The legal
framework is being updated and work on a public debt law is underway. Capacity building

6

Paris Club creditors have already committed to cancel all of Haiti’s outstanding debt as part of HIPC/MDRI
debt relief committed in July 2009. Bilateral agreements with Canada and the U.S. have already been signed,
and the signature of agreements with France, Italy and Spain is imminent.
Under the PetroCaribe arrangement, financing of oil imports is provided on concessional terms, namely, twoyear grace period, 25-year maturity and 1 percent interest. The size of the financed portion of oil shipments is
determined based on prevailing oil prices and varies between 30 percent of total shipments for oil prices
US$40-50 per barrel to 70 percent for oil prices US$150 and above.
7

18
efforts are focusing on the development of a medium-term debt strategy that would form the
basis for annual financing plans (MEFP ¶25).
IV. ECF ARRANGEMENT
41.
Access. The earthquake has aggravated Haiti’s already protracted and substantial
balance-of-payments needs. However, given that most of the medium-term external financing
need is expected to be covered by grants and that program risks are high, including due to
weaker implementation capacity, staff proposes that access be relatively low, at 50 percent of
quota (SDR 40.95 million or US$60.43 million). Nonetheless, Fund resources would be
instrumental in allowing the central bank to smooth out exchange rate and reserves
fluctuations caused by large and volatile aid resources. Donors have also clearly indicated
that satisfactory progress under the Fund-supported program is an essential element for their
continued engagement. Staff proposes that total access be set at 10 percent of quota each for
the first two disbursements, followed by five disbursements equivalent to 6 percent of quota
each. Program reviews would be linked to end-March and end-September test dates, in line
with Haiti’s fiscal year (Table 9).
42.
Monitoring. Performance criteria will include a zero ceiling for net central bank
credit to the central government, a ceiling on net domestic assets of the central government, a
floor on NIRs, and zero ceilings on the accumulation of external and domestic arrears, and
the contracting or guaranteeing of non-concessional debt. Indicative targets will help monitor
net domestic financing of the government, and base money growth. An indicative floor on
poverty-reducing spending was set in close consultation with the World Bank (MEFP Table
1). Structural reforms objectives for FY 2010-11 will focus on improving revenue collection,
enhancing the efficiency and tracking of government spending, and developing a T-bill
market. The program will also promote transparent and regular reporting of poverty-reducing
expenditures (MEFP Table 2).
43.
External financing and capacity to repay the Fund. The program assumes
continuing budget support in the order of about US$100 million a year starting in FY 2012. It
includes a US$50 million external financing adjustor to offset delayed disbursement of
already-identified budget support. The associated domestic financing would be expected to
unwind when the budget support is received and at the latest, to be fully repaid within one
year (TMU ¶36). Reserve coverage would average 3.2 months of imports throughout the
program period. Debt service to the Fund is projected to peak in 2016 at 4 percent of exports
of goods and services and 3 percent of domestic revenues. Debt service capacity is expected
to remain manageable throughout the program period, but would be significantly improved
once the committed debt relief materializes (Table 10). If the Fund provides debt relief on the
outstanding debt stock as of end-January 2010, debt service to the Fund would be
significantly lower, at 0.7 percent of exports of goods and services and 0.5 of domestic
revenues in 2019.
44.
Safeguards. A safeguards assessment should be completed at the time of the first
review. The last safeguards assessment was completed in September 2008. The updated
assessment would be based on the progress of the external audit of the BRH’s financial
statements for the fiscal year ending September 20, 2009, and the documents provided by the
BRH for review. The authorities have made some progress in implementing the key

19
recommendations of the 2008 safeguards assessment update. Revised reserve investment
guidelines have been adopted and an investment committee has been appointed. The external
audit of BRH accounts for FY 2008 has been published, and NIR data for FY 2009 have been
verified by the external auditors. The authorities committed to publishing the BRH audited
financial statements for FY 2009 by the time of the first program review (MEFP Table 2).
45.
Risks. Key program risks include: (i) widespread social unrest, triggered by delays in
the start of reconstruction activities, and/or the elections; (ii) pervasive capacity constraints,
amplified by the earthquake; and (iii) high vulnerability to external shocks, in particular
natural disasters. The international community has an important role to play, by delivering on
the commitments made at the New-York conference, and by assisting with the organization
of peaceful elections. Visible improvements in fiscal transparency and governance as
supported under the program would also help mitigate political and social risks. Finally, the
comprehensive TA strategy implemented by the Fund and other development partners aims
at building capacity and strengthening institutions.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
46.
The January earthquake represents a major setback for Haiti, after years of
progress in maintaining macroeconomic stability. The earthquake caused damages and
losses estimated at 120 percent of GDP, and affected one-third of Haiti’s population, making
it one of the largest natural disasters in recent history. The destruction of human and physical
capital created a massive and immediate need for recovery and reconstruction resources and
radically altered the macroeconomic outlook, jeopardizing recent hard-won gains.
47.
The authorities’ determination to build on the reform momentum and to use the
earthquake as an opportunity to build a better Haiti is commendable. Staff believes that
the National Action Plan for Recovery and Development provides an appropriate anchor for
rebuilding the economic structure and institutions of the country, and promote more
transparent and effective policies. Implementation of the Action Plan in a context of severe
capacity constraints will require close coordination and tracking of interventions of all
development partners by the IHRC. Channeling external assistance through the government’s
budget or the MDTF would effectively support coordination and local capacity building.
48.
Disbursement of the amounts pledged in New-York should start and
reconstruction should begin promptly. The expectations created by the large aid pledges
and the limited progress so far are increasing risks of widespread social unrest. On their part,
the authorities should continue their efforts to facilitate the relocation of families, adopt a
new building code with anti-seismic norms, and launch large public works programs to
generate a reconstruction momentum.
49.
The authorities’ medium-term growth objectives are ambitious but can be
reached provided measures to boost private credit and investment are implemented.
The rapid implementation of the PCG scheme is essential to restart private sector activity.
The reform momentum generated by the earthquake also provides an opportunity to
implement structural reforms to improve the business environment. Development of
infrastructure, in particular transport and energy, in partnership with the private sector would

20
boost investment. Improvements in the civil and land registries and a simplification of
administrative procedures will be essential.
50.
Securing adequate support to finance the budget is critical. The government needs
to be able to address the urgent needs of the population, including relocation of displaced
families, hurricane prevention, and preparations for the planting season and school year
starting in September. The absence of such support would seriously undermine the
government’s credibility and ongoing reconstruction efforts.
51.
Steps taken to strengthen revenue administration and improve the coverage,
quality, tracking, and reporting of public spending are welcome, and could help attract
further budget support. Investments to restore the delivery of public services, generate
private-sector-led growth and employment, and improve the security and humanitarian
situation are particularly urgent. Ongoing PFM reforms, supported by technical assistance,
are essential to enhance the transparency of spending, and sustain the aid inflows. At the
same time, efforts to increase domestic revenue collection will enhance both the credibility of
the state and its capacity to mobilize domestic resources for reconstruction.
52.
Further improvements in the monetary framework will be critical to ensuring
the absorption of aid inflows while avoiding excessive inflationary pressures. The
widening of the external trade deficit associated with the large reconstruction needs appears
sustainable, as it is financed by aid and remittance inflows. In recent months, the central bank
has appropriately stepped up foreign exchange purchases to mitigate excessive exchange rate
volatility and rebuild its reserves level. However, balance sheet considerations have
prevented the central bank from sterilizing the purchases. Accelerating the reform of foreign
exchange auctions, introducing Treasury bills, and recapitalizing the central bank are
essential measures to enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy. The competitiveness
impact of the real appreciation associated with the foreign inflows should be mainly
addressed through structural policies aiming at reducing supply-side bottlenecks, expanding
the export base and improving the business environment.
53.
The delivery of committed debt relief should substantially reduce the risk of debt
distress, but vulnerabilities will remain. Haiti’s risk of debt distress remains high after the
earthquake, due to the worsened macroeconomic outlook, weakened capacity and even lower
export base. Delivery of debt relief committed by most of Haiti’s creditors after the
earthquake would substantially improve the outlook, though external debt would remain
vulnerable to a number of shocks, highlighting the importance of covering financing needs
mostly through grants.
54.
Staff supports the authorities’ request for a new three-year arrangement under
the Extended Credit Facility. Although risks are high, the program provides a necessary
anchor to the authorities’ economic policies and donor support for the reconstruction process.
While limited due to Haiti’s low debt-carrying capacity and the large post-earthquake
external grant commitments, Fund resources will allow the authorities to smooth
macroeconomic volatility associated with large and lumpy aid disbursements.
55.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Haiti be held in accordance
with the July 15, 2002 decision on consultation cycles.

ATTACHMENT I: HAITI: LETTER OF INTENT
Port-au-Prince
July 6, 2010
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20431
Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
1.
The earthquake that struck Port-au-Prince and surrounding areas on January 12, 2010
is a major setback for Haiti. Overall performance under the previous ECF-supported
arrangement has been satisfactory, and the sixth and last review was successfully concluded
on January 27, 2010. Under successive Fund-supported programs since 2004, Haiti has
implemented macroeconomic and financial policies that have helped stabilize the economy
and restore growth despite successive shocks, including the global slowdown. Progress with
essential structural reforms including critical improvements in governance allowed for the
delivery of HIPC/MDRI debt relief in 2009.
2.
The earthquake destroyed key economic and government infrastructure, threatening
these hard-won gains and weakening institutions. Total damages and losses amount to 120
percent of GDP. About 225,000 people were killed, and most ministries, hospitals and
schools were destroyed. The international community’s response was swift and generous, but
the humanitarian situation is only slowly improving. About 1.3 million people are still living
in temporary shelters and the hurricane season is starting.
3.
The significant resources pledged represent a unique opportunity to build a better
Haiti. Our National Action Plan for the Reconstruction and Development of Haiti aims at
raising long-term growth and reducing poverty by: (i) creating decentralized poles of
economic growth; (ii) reducing vulnerability to natural disasters; (iii) enhancing access to
basic social services; and (iv) strengthening state institutions. An Interim Commission for
Haiti’s Reconstruction has been established to oversee the implementation of the plan for the
first 18 months. We are fully committed to the utmost transparency in the use of donor and
internal resources for reconstruction, and are in the process of implementing reforms in our
fiscal governance framework, with technical support from our development partners.
4.
As part of the international effort to support Haiti’s recovery and reconstruction, we
hereby request Fund support under a new three-year ECF arrangement in the amount of SDR
40.95 million, or 50 percent of quota. The new Fund-supported program (July 2010June/July 2013) will provide a coherent macroeconomic framework that will support the

37
implementation of our Action Plan and ensure the efficient spending and absorption of aid
inflows. At the same time, technical assistance will help rebuild key economic institutions
and strengthen administrative capacity. The attached Memorandum of Economic and
Financial Policies (MEFP) outlines the medium-term and first year objectives of Haiti’s
proposed program to be supported under the ECF. Our economic program focuses on
improving the quality and efficiency of public spending and increasing revenue through tax
policy and administration reforms. Measures to boost absorptive capacity and enhance credit
growth while maintaining financial sector stability will be essential to eliciting the needed
supply response. Improvements in the business environment and concrete steps to encourage
private credit and investment will be critical to support growth.
5.
Approval of this request would result in a first disbursement of SDR 8.19 million,
followed by six semi-annual disbursements. These resources will help us smooth excessive
exchange rate and/or reserves movements caused by large and volatile aid inflows. Because
the financing already committed by donors will be disbursed with a lag, we also request that
access under the new arrangement be frontloaded, with the first two disbursements of 10
percent of quota each in the first year, followed by 5 disbursements equivalent to 6 percent of
quota each in the following years.
6.
The Government believes that the policies set forth in the attached MEFP are
adequate to achieve the objectives of our program, but will take any further measures that
may become appropriate for this purpose. Haiti will keep consulting with the Fund on the
adoption of these measures and in advance of any revision to policies contained in the MEFP,
in accordance with the Fund’s policies on such consultation.
7.
In line with our commitment to transparency in government operations, we agree to
the publication of all ECF-related documents circulated to the IMF Executive Board.
Sincerely yours,

/s/
Ronald Baudin
Minister of Economy and Finance
Republic of Haiti

ATTACHMENT II: HAITI: MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES
I. Introduction
1.
After several years of significant progress toward macroeconomic stability and
growth, the January earthquake has been a major setback. Anchored by prudent fiscal
policies to limit central bank financing, our policies in recent years have helped stabilize the
gourde and significantly reduce inflation. The reserve coverage was raised and, despite the
global slowdown, growth reached close to 3 percent in FY 2009, one of the highest rates in
the region. Structural reforms also advanced, qualifying Haiti for US$1.2 billion in
HIPC/MDRI debt relief in June 2009. Public financial management (PFM) and tax
administration have been enhanced. Governance was improved, with the adoption of laws on
asset declaration for public officials and public procurement, and the establishment of an
anti-corruption unit. Measures to strengthen central bank independence and promote the
development of the financial sector have been implemented. Reforms in the social area have
improved access to basic health and education services.
2.
We are determined to continue to build on the advances made in recent years
and to press on with our reform agenda. Immediately after the earthquake, we have moved
quickly to restore basic government and payment systems functions. However, the
constraints posed by the destruction of buildings and material and the loss of key personnel
still largely need to be addressed, with the support of the international community. In the
short term, we are giving priority to rebuilding and strengthening our institutions, and are
focusing on immediate improvements in transparency and economic governance.
3.
Our Action Plan for National Recovery and Development aims at building a
better Haiti by addressing vulnerabilities and tackling the structural causes of poverty
and underdevelopment. Specifically, our plan aims at: (i) decentralizing economic activity
to regional economic centers; (ii) developing agriculture and encouraging private sector
credit and investment; (iii) reducing the poverty rate from 54 percent in 2009 to 40 percent
by 2015 while improving our population’s access to basic public services and developing
social safety nets; and (iv) improving governance and enhancing the efficiency and
transparency of public spending.
4.
The successful implementation of our Action Plan depends crucially on the
timeliness and management of the aid inflows. A total of US$9.9 billion was pledged for
Haiti’s reconstruction at the high level donor conference at the UN at the end of March. Of
this total, US$5.3 billion were committed to be disbursed during this fiscal year and next,
representing a tripling of aid flows as a percent of GDP from recent years. Timely
disbursement of the promised aid will be essential to the transition from recovery to
reconstruction. The Interim Haiti Reconstruction Commission (IHRC) will ensure that
resources are allocated to priority projects consistent with our action plan. Our economic
program, anchored by a new three-year arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility, will
ensure that the aid is spent transparently. Structural measures to promote investment and
expand the export base are designed to help boost competitiveness.

39
II. Recent Developments
5.
Economic activity has rebounded since the earthquake. Agricultural production is
anticipated to be higher than last year on account of clement weather, increases in the size of
irrigated areas, and distribution of seeds and fertilizers after the earthquake. Construction
(including debris removal) has picked up. Textile exports to the United States recovered to
pre-earthquake levels by March 2010.
•

Revenue collection is gradually recovering. Revenue has been trending upward since
January, and collections during January-May represent about 83 percent of budgeted
amounts. Spending has remained low due to capacity constraints, weak revenue, and
low budget support disbursements. Wages and operational expense payments thus
had to be covered in part through central bank financing (US$35.3 million during
January and February, which was fully repaid by end-May). As of end-May, only 30
percent of budget support committed for the year had been disbursed.

•

The trade balance has worsened but remittances have picked up. The trade deficit
rose to more than 8 percent of GDP in January-March, compared to 5 percent of GDP
last year. Exports were 25 percent lower compared to the same period last year, while
imports grew by more than 35 percent, reflecting increased food and emergencyrelated imports. Remittance inflows surged immediately after the earthquake, and
were up by 11.7 percent during January-May (year-on-year). At end-May, NIR rose
to US$646 million at end-May, from US$402 million at end-December. The gourde
had appreciated by 5.3 percent against the U.S. dollar from end-2009. Twelve-month
base money growth rose to 28 percent, from 11 percent in December, reflecting in
part an increased preference for cash.

•

In May, inflation stabilized to 6.4 percent, although rent, transport, and utilities
prices remain high. Monthly food prices decreased by 0.1 percent but high oil prices
and supply-side bottlenecks remain a concern (annual inflation reached 18 percent for
rent and utilities and 7.5 percent for transportation).

•

The banking sector remains fairly liquid, but bank capital has been negatively
affected by the earthquake, and non-performing loans are rising. Deposits
increased by 10 percent between December and May. Over the same period, credit to
the private sector declined by 6.6 percent. Bank profitability decreased, as the average
return on assets dropped to 0.1 percent during January-March compared with a
positive return rate of 1.4 percent in the same period of last year. About a third of
bank loans is estimated to have been impaired, and NPLs rose from 8.5 percent of
total loans in December to 12.3 percent in March. Provisioning for NPLs dropped
from 66.7 percent of total NPLs in December to 59.8 percent in March.
III. M EDIUM -T ERM M ACROECONOMIC F RAMEWORK

6.
Our objective is to implement a set of macroeconomic policies aimed at
managing large aid inflows and at supporting the successful implementation of our
Action Plan. We expect the flow of donor resources to peak over the next 2-3 years, which
will require careful coordination of fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policies.

40
• After a decline of 8.5 percent in FY 2010, annual GDP growth is expected to peak at
about 9 percent in FY 2011–12, driven mostly by reconstruction. Private sector credit
and investment should support the reconstruction and raise medium-term growth. The
establishment of a Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme and the implementation of
measures to enhance the business environment will be critical steps in the
reconstruction effort. Higher activity in the assembly, tourism, and agriculture sectors
would sustain medium-term growth at about 6 percent.
• Annual inflation is projected to rise to 8.5 percent in FY 2010 and to decline to about
7 percent by FY 2013. Pressures from supply and transport bottlenecks would only
ease gradually, while domestic demand would remain strong in the context of the
reconstruction.
• The external current account deficit (excluding grants) is projected to widen to about
29 percent of GDP in FY 2010 and to decline to about 17 percent by FY 2013. Exports
would recover to their pre-earthquake value by FY 2011, and grow at an average of 11
percent through FY 2013. Growth in textile exports will benefit from the Haiti
Economic Lift Program (HELP) Act. 1
• Reconstruction-related imports would grow strongly through FY 2013, financed by aid
inflows. The current account deficit including grants should average about 3.2 percent
during the program period.
• The fiscal deficit (excluding grants and foreign-financed projects) is projected to rise
to close to 7 percent of GDP in FY 2010 (from 4.4 percent in FY 2009) due to the
revenue shortfall and higher spending needs following the earthquake. A
comprehensive tax policy and administration reform would help narrow the fiscal
deficit to about 3 percent of GDP by FY 2013.
• The timely disbursement of aid and an increase in resources available for
reconstruction are essential to the achievement of our macroeconomic objectives.
Official grants are projected to average about US$1.5 billion a year (over 20 percent of
GDP) until 2013. Improved efficiency in spending, higher revenue, and external debt
relief are also expected to free up resources for the reconstruction. Non-recourse to
central bank financing over the course of the program (except on a temporary basis)
will continue to anchor our fiscal program. The planned introduction of T-bills by
March 2011 will provide an alternative source of domestic financing. To maintain
medium-term debt sustainability, the path of domestic public debt will be established
based on an updated debt sustainability analysis.

1

The HELP Act, approved by the U.S. Senate on May 6, would extend Haiti’s trade preferences provided under
the HOPE II initiative until 2020 and expand duty-free access to the U.S. market for additional Haitian textile
and apparel exports. This initiative is designed to create jobs for Haitian factories.

41
IV. P OLICY AND STRUCTURAL R EFORM AGENDA
7.
The overarching objective of our Action Plan for National Recovery and
Development is to set Haiti on a higher economic growth path and reduce poverty. Our
plan focuses on creating decentralized economic growth poles, reducing the vulnerability to
natural disasters, enhancing access to basic social services, and strengthening state
institutions. These priorities are in line with our Poverty Reduction Strategy, with added
emphasis on housing and territorial development. Measures to encourage private sector credit
and investment are an essential component of our strategy to raise medium-term growth.
A. Fiscal Strategy
8.
Our fiscal objectives are to enhance the quality and effectiveness of
reconstruction spending, while rebuilding a modern and efficient tax administration to
raise domestic resources. We plan to gradually implement a multi-year fiscal framework
anchored on debt sustainability that is consistent with our medium-term growth targets, the
strategic objectives of our reconstruction program, and related sectoral priorities. A
combination of higher revenue collection, more efficient spending and the introduction of a
domestic T-bill market will increase the resource envelope available for reconstruction, while
allowing us to smooth out volatile aid inflows disbursements.
9.
To monitor developments better, we plan to expand the coverage of the budget
to include resources and spending channeled through the Multi-Donor Trust Fund
(MDTF). The MTDF, which is managed by the World Bank, started operating in June. With
large-scale donor disbursements not expected to materialize for a few more months,
immediate budget support will be essential to support the recovery and the transition to the
reconstruction phase. In addition to setting strategic reconstruction objectives, the IHRC will
play a key role in coordinating reconstruction activity and tracking aid disbursements. A
database managed by the IHRC will support reporting and transparency.
Revenue measures and tax administration
10.
The earthquake has severely damaged the resources of the Tax Administration
Agency. Prior to the earthquake, revenue collection remained well below potential, reflecting
weaknesses in administration and a complex tax system with many exemptions. In the
aftermath of the earthquake, the lack of adequate building facilities together with the
destruction of the information systems and tax records are impeding the operations of the tax
and customs administrations. An immediate priority is to find adequate office space for all
staff and ensure that basic administrative functions are restored. With donor support, we
expect to transition away from the current emergency phase in the coming months. Revenue
collection has already been recovering, driven by customs and large taxpayer contributions,
and is expected to reach 10 percent of GDP in FY2010, equivalent to about 75 percent of
budgeted amounts.
11. Implementation of our medium-term strategy will help boost revenue collections to
13 percent of GDP by FY 2013. The increase in revenue is to be generated through a

42
comprehensive reform of the tax system, with a view to broadening the base,
rationalizing exemptions and combating fraud, and through the building of modern and
efficient tax and customs administrations. The current low productivity of the VAT͟—at
about 32 percent compared with an average of 70 percent in the region —indicates that
seriously tackling tax evasion while broadening the tax base could more than double
VAT revenue. 2
• On tax policy, our main objective is to improve the equity of the tax system by
rationalizing exemptions and broadening the tax base. By end-September 2010, we
will start publishing tax expenditure reports by beneficiary sectors to raise awareness
on the inefficiency and cost of exemptions (structural benchmark). We will also set up
a working group in charge of preparing a new tax code aimed at simplifying the tax
system, increasing transparency, and broadening the base. This working group will
establish a work program with specific milestones by September 2010 (structural
benchmark), and request technical assistance from the IMF. The objective is to submit
a proposal to reform the VAT, excise taxation and the income tax to Parliament, by
end-FY 2011. These measures will also be reflected in the new tax code, which would
be finalized during FY 2012. Meanwhile, we will continue to keep the regime of
exemptions for non-governmental organizations under review, with a view to
narrowing eligibility to a small and well-defined group of organizations by
end-December 2010. The introduction of a telecommunication tax and car registration
fees has been delayed because of the earthquake, but we now plan to introduce these
measures by September 2010, which are expected to yield about 0.4 percent of GDP
per year over the program period.
• We are developing a strategy to overhaul the tax and customs administration. This
strategy will include a reorganization of the revenue administration focusing on:
(a) fiscal missions; (b) segmentation of taxpayers; (c) computerization and
rationalization of local and regional networks; (d) tighter controls; and (e) greater
monitoring and accountability through the design and publication of performance
indicators. To combat fraud, we will intensify our tax verification program. In an
effort to raise awareness and guide revenue mobilization efforts, reports on the
performance of the tax system, including revenue collections and the cost of
exemptions, will be published on the Ministry of Economy and Finance website
starting in September 2010 (structural benchmark).
Expenditure policy and poverty-reduction objectives
12.
Following the earthquake, we have re-prioritized spending to focus on providing
humanitarian assistance to the population and restarting basic government functions.
During January-April, spending remained low due to capacity constraints, the shortfall in
2

43
revenue, and slow budget support disbursements. For the remainder of this year however, we
plan to accelerate priority expenditures on housing, hurricane prevention, and education. As a
result of the emergency, we have also decided to allocate an amount of US$163 million
(2.5 percent of GDP) of available PetroCaribe resources to large infrastructure projects in the
provinces, in order to create jobs for the population displaced by the earthquake. We are in
the process of preparing a revised budget for FY 2010 that will incorporate the updated
spending allocations and our emergency fund resources. 3 We will also strive to include
projects to be financed under the MDTF in our revised budget for this year and in future
budgets.
13.
The earthquake has highlighted the urgency to improve access to basic social
services and strengthen the resilience against natural disasters. The earthquake has led to
a sharp deterioration in food security and poverty levels. Hospitals and schools have been
destroyed. We are determined to reduce poverty by focusing public investments on
improving the delivery of public services, social safety nets, educational and health care
systems, as well as transportation and communication infrastructure. We are preparing a
PRSP update for no later than September 2011. We will resume the publication of reports on
the execution of social expenditures (health, education and agriculture) by end-June 2010
(prior action). Our goal is to raise priority social expenditures by at least 30 percent by
September 2011.
Public financial management (PFM) and economic governance
14.
Further improvements in public financial management and economic
governance are an essential component of our strategy. Remaining weaknesses in budget
preparation, execution and controls, as well as in cash management, will be addressed taking
into account recent IMF technical assistance recommendations. Together with our main
development partners, we have identified key measures to further strengthen public financial
management and economic governance. They have been summarized in the common
conditionality matrix which presents the set of reforms that we will implement in the short
term and our objectives. To that effect, we will strengthen:
• The framework of annual budget preparation. To strengthen our ability to prepare
medium-term macroeconomic and expenditure frameworks, we have started to
establish a macro-fiscal unit at the Ministry of Economy and Finance, with the
assistance of an external consultant. We intend to gradually move toward a
programmatic budget approach, starting with key line Ministries in FY 2012.
3

Until the date the new private bi-national company that will be in charge of managing the PetroCaribe
program is legally established, all accumulated PetroCaribe resources will be: (i) treated as external financing
as defined in paragraph 19 of the TMU; (ii) recorded as central government debt; and (iii) integrally transferred
to the budget. Until PetroCaribe funds are fully accounted for under the budget, the new program will continue
to include adjustors for the use of PetroCaribe resources and for the accumulation of new inflows in government
deposits with the banking system (TMU ¶34).

44
•

•

Budget execution and reporting. More accurate and transparent reporting of budget
execution will help inform budget preparation and improve Treasury management,
while enhancing overall accountability and governance. As first step, we will focus
on the monitoring and reporting of investment spending and current transfers and
subsidies.


Beginning on June 30, 2010, we will publish central government transfers to
project accounts, project by project, including PetroCaribe projects (prior
action). Given that a large share of the reconstruction projects will be
implemented outside of the budget framework, the Treasury’s contribution to
investment projects will have to be well-coordinated with reconstruction plans
prepared by the IHRC.



Beginning on June 30, 2010, we will publish central government current
transfers and subsidies by beneficiary sector to raise accountability (prior
action).



Starting in March 2011, we will publish investment execution from the
computerized management system SYSGEP with particular attention to the
education, health, agriculture, and road sectors (structural benchmark).

Treasury management. Cash management is hampered by the multiplicity of
Treasury accounts in the banking system, some of them with idle balances in periods
when the Treasury is borrowing. Moving to a Treasury Single Account (TSA) will
generate significant savings and strengthen accounting. In order to initiate the
transition to a TSA, we will prepare comprehensive monthly Treasury balances by
end-September 2010 (structural benchmark), and make an inventory of all
government and donor accounts at the BRH and commercial banks (structural
benchmark). By March 2011, we will publish quarterly cash plans including
PetroCaribe spending and financing needs. This will help better align donor support
to the country’s needs, and enhance transparency and prioritization in spending
execution (structural benchmark).
B. Financial Sector Policies

15.
The government of Haiti and the BRH are taking steps to increase private sector
credit and preserve financial stability. The earthquake has affected banks, both directly
through the destruction of physical assets and personnel and indirectly through its impact on
the quality of loan portfolios. Banks appear reluctant to provide new credit due to uncertainty
about their clients’ true financial situation and economic prospects more widely.
Non-performing loans have inevitably risen because of disruptions to borrowers’ cash flow.
The capital position of three banks, representing 27 percent of total banking sector assets,
needs to be strengthened. The financial sector has an essential role to play in the economic
recovery and reconstruction of the country. Viable firms have lost part or all of their working
capital and some need a restructuring of existing loans and some new credit to continue to
operate. At the same time, an expansion of credit to new borrowers would support housing
and overall economic activity.

45

16.
In close coordination with donors, we therefore plan to establish a Partial Credit
Guarantee (PCG) scheme, to support renewed credit growth to the private sector while
maintaining the stability of the banking system. A technical proposal, prepared with
support from the staffs of the IMF and the World Bank, has been finalized. The PCG scheme
will require between US$200 and 250 millions, and will comprise two pillars: (a) Pillar 1,
with a finite life, will aim at restructuring bank and microcredit loans impacted by the
earthquake and financing business recovery; and (b) Pillar 2 will support new lending. In
order to start with the program, we estimate that about US$100 million in capital is required
for Pillar 1 and US$30 million for Pillar 2. Given that identified donor funding remains
insufficient, we plan to set aside up to US$70 million in central bank reserves to fund the
initial guarantee including US$50 million for Pillar 1 and US$20 million for Pillar 2. This
will enable us to launch the scheme rapidly by mid-July 2010, while continuing to seek
additional grant resources from donors, possibly through the Multi-Donor Trust Fund. Under
the scheme, no payouts would occur during the first six months, as loans must be
non-performing for six months before claims can be made to the PCG. Unless losses were to
be significantly higher than expected at present, we anticipate that the fund should be able to
repay a substantial amount of capital when it is wound up. We are liaising closely with the
banking sector and other economic agents to ensure that the scheme is widely understood and
operates effectively.
17.
Complementary financial sector reforms will support the expansion of private
credit and growth, while strengthening financial sector supervision. The earthquake has
made even more urgent the adoption of measures to address (i) structural obstacles to credit
growth recommended by the 2008 FSAP, due to the close link between private sector credit
and territorial development; and (ii) regulation and supervision of the insurance sector. We
intend to take the following measures to address these issues:
• A set of initiatives to lower the cost of taking collateral, and reduce the time and
improve the ease of recovery of non-performing loans. Key measures include the
establishment of a credit bureau and a centralized registry of security collateral and a
cadastre. At the same time, we will introduce comprehensive insolvency legislation in
Parliament.
• Introduction of a regulatory and supervisory framework for nonbank financial
institutions. Some progress had been made under the previous ECF arrangement for
credit unions, with the introduction of a credit union law. For insurance companies, a
regulatory and supervisory framework will be set up in FY 2011.
C. Monetary Policy
18.
The expected surge in reconstruction-related aid inflows poses important
challenges for monetary and exchange rate management. The increase in aid inflows,
together with higher remittances, could lead to further real exchange rate appreciation. In
addition, lags between large and lumpy aid inflows and actual imports could cause excessive
volatility in the exchange rate. The BRH plans to continue with its policy of recent months to

46
take advantage of foreign exchange inflows to buy foreign exchange with a view to
continuing to strengthen its foreign exchange position. This policy will help ensure that
foreign exchange is available later for reconstruction-related import demand, while
mitigating the nominal appreciation of the currency. We will also enhance the BRH’s
intervention strategy, strive to liaise with major donors and NGOs and improve
communication on BRH operations while encouraging the development of the interbank
foreign exchange market. The central bank will continue to smooth out excessive exchange
rate volatility but still allow some flexibility in the exchange rate. The BRH stands ready to
drain excess reserves, and to tighten monetary conditions if domestic demand appears to be
exceeding the absorptive capacity of the economy; we will continue to aim at containing base
money growth as our intermediary monetary policy target.
19.
Improvements in the monetary and exchange rate operations framework will
allow for the effective absorption of aid inflows. So far, monetary policy effectiveness has
been hampered in part by the limited availability of financial instruments, overly liquid
banks, and a history of fiscal dominance. We intend to continue to improve liquidity
management and inflation forecasting. The gradual development of a market for government
securities will help improve the effectiveness of monetary policy and serve as a catalyst for
the development over time of domestic financial markets. A predetermined public auction
calendar for T-bills will be established by end-March 2011 (structural benchmark) with the
objective of successfully organizing a first T-bill issuance by end-March 2011. Should,
however, a small fiscal financing gap remain for this fiscal year, a first issue of T-bills
limited to US$25 million of net new borrowing could already take place before
end-September 2010. These reforms will support our policy to allow exchange rate
movements to reflect further changes in underlying fundamentals, while continuing to
smooth disruptive exchange rate volatility.
20.
During FY 2010–11, we will take further steps to enhance BRH independence.
The recapitalization plan of the BRH will be updated by end-March 2011, as part of the
T-bill implementation project (structural benchmark). This update will include the
preparation of a calendar for the securitization of BRH claims on the government over a
period of several years, with the first tranche of the securitization scheduled for end-March
2011 (structural benchmark). A new central bank law will be prepared and submitted to
Parliament by end-September 2011. The central bank law would also enshrine central bank
independence and further strengthen external audit and reserves management.
21.
Implementation of the pending recommendations from the 2008 safeguards
assessment update will be accelerated in the context of the new ECF-supported
program. An investment committee has been established, and reserve investment guidelines
adopted (prior action). The investment committee will oversee the implementation of an
overall investment strategy. The central bank has made efforts to enhance competition and
rotation in the hiring of external auditors. This has caused delays in producing audited
financial statements for FY 2008 and FY 2009, which were exacerbated by the earthquake.
Nonetheless, we will strive to publish annual audited financial statements within a period of
six months after the end of each fiscal year. The FY 2008 audited accounts have been

47
published by end-June 2010 (prior action), and the FY 2009 accounts will be published by
end-September 2010 (structural benchmark). 4
D. Promoting Private Sector Activity and Investment
22. The success of our Action Plan depends critically on private sector participation. We
are implementing reforms to strengthen competitiveness by reducing high transaction
costs, improving the business environment, facilitating access to credit, and simplifying
the establishment of new businesses. Production costs are driven up by the lack of
adequate infrastructure, including energy supply bottlenecks, low and costly access to
credit and a weak legal and judicial environment. In addition, macroeconomic policies
should allow for the absorption of large and persistent aid inflows, while preserving
competitiveness.
23.
Our decentralization strategy envisages large projects to improve the
transportation and energy infrastructure and create jobs in the provinces. We are
working to establish a robust legal framework for Public-Private Partnerships to help
promote investment in these sectors with the assistance of the IMF. This will support the
development of export industries, including textiles, agribusiness, and tourism. We are
preparing new construction guidelines for residential buildings based on international best
practices, and are in the process of establishing and enforcing a new building code for
commercial buildings. This will be critical for increasing foreign direct investment in the
textile and tourism sectors and in developing new industrial zones.
24.
We are actively strengthening the framework for business and investment. Our
reform program seeks a tangible improvement in Haiti’s image as a country open for
business and foreign investment. We will improve governance and the legal framework for
investment, which are essential for financial market deepening and increased private
investment. An improved investment climate will also be important to enable Haiti’s textile
sector to fully benefit from the HELP Act and expanded access to the U.S. market.

4

•

With donor support, we are simplifying the legal and regulatory framework for
investments in export-processing zones, and we intend to revamp the investment
promotion office as an effective one-stop shop for potential investors.

•

As part of its efforts to promote financial sector development and encourage
investment, the government attaches high priority to the development of a cadastre,
initially focused on development zones, together with a timetable for the surveying
and establishment of specialized cadastres to encourage investment in these zones.

The FY 2009 NIR data have been verified by end-June 2010 (prior action).

48
E. Debt Management
25.
Prior to the earthquake, we made significant progress in strengthening debt
management capacity in the context of the ECF-supported program and as part of the
HIPC/MDRI debt relief process. Information on public external and domestic currency
debt was centralized in a single database. The SYGADE software was installed and regular
debt reports were being produced. However, the earthquake was a major setback and, to
rebuild our debt management capacity, we intend to:
•

Prepare a progress report on the steps taken towards setting up a legal and
institutional framework for public debt management by end-September 2010.

•

Operationalize the debt unit at Ministry of Economy and Finance by March 2011.
Middle and back office functions will be fully operational, including clear
assignments of functional responsibilities and the drafting of memoranda of
understanding between the MEF and other ministries and the BRH to clearly establish
responsibilities and avoid overlapping (structural benchmark).

•

Submit a public debt law to the Council of Ministers by end-September 2011 that
establishes a sound legal and institutional framework for public debt management
(structural benchmark).

•

Prepare a medium-term debt management strategy, based on a comprehensive
analysis of the sustainability of total public debt in FY 2012. This will help make
informed choices on how to meet the government’s financing requirements and better
manage contingent liabilities, while taking due account of constraints and potential
risks.
V. P ROGRAM M ONITORING

26.
The first year of the ECF-supported program will cover July 2010–June 2011.
The program will be monitored using quarterly quantitative benchmarks and semi-annual
quantitative performance criteria and structural benchmarks, with test dates set at
end-September and end-March. Quantitative targets are set on net international reserves, net
domestic assets of the central bank, net central bank credit to the central government and to
the entire nonfinancial public sector, public sector external arrears accumulation, and
non-concessional external loans contracted or guaranteed by the public sector (all
performance criteria); base money, net domestic financing by the central government,
domestic arrears accumulation of the central government, and a floor on poverty-reducing
spending (indicative targets) (Table 1). The definitions of these quantitative targets and
program adjustors are provided in the attached Technical Memorandum of Understanding
(TMU). Structural benchmarks are set for end-March and end-September and listed in Table
2, including prior actions. They are further defined in the TMU. A monitoring committee
composed of high-level officials from the MEF and will be created by end-June 2010 to
monitor program implementation. We expect the first review of the program to be completed
by February 2011 and the second review to be completed by July 2011.

49
27. In accordance with the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, we will refrain from imposing
restrictions on payments and transfers for international transactions, introduce new or
intensify trade restrictions for balance of payments purposes, resort to multiple currency
practices, or enter into bilateral payments agreements incorporating restrictive practices with
other IMF members.

ATTACHMENT III: HAITI: TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
1.
Haiti’s performance under the program supported by the Extended Credit
Facility (ECF) arrangement will be assessed on the basis of the observance of
quantitative performance criteria as well as compliance with structural benchmarks.
This Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) defines the quantitative
performance criteria, specification of certain structural benchmarks, and indicative
targets for the period July 1st, 2010-June 30, 2011, specified in Tables 1 and 2 of the
Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP). It also lays down the
monitoring and reporting requirements. The quantitative performance criteria under
the program are set for end-September 2010 and end-March 2011. The target for
end-December 2010 is indicative.
INSTITUTIONAL DEFINITIONS

I.

2.
Central government. The central government comprises the presidency,
prime minister’s office, parliament, national courts, treasury, line ministries and
“organismes déconcentrés”. It includes expenditures financed directly by foreign
donors through ministerial accounts (comptes-courants).
3.
Non-financial public sector. The non-financial public sector includes the
central government plus non-budgetary autonomous organizations, local governments
and public sector enterprises (enterprises and agencies in which the government holds
a controlling stake of more than 50 percent of the shares).

Total public sector. The total public sector comprises the non-financial
public sector and the central bank (BRH).
II.
A.

QUANTITATIVE TARGETS

Net BRH Credit to the Non-Financial Public Sector

5.
Net BRH credit to the non-financial public sector equals net central bank
credit to the central government plus net central bank credit to the rest of the
non-financial public sector.
6.
The change in net BRH credit to the central government is defined as, and will
be measured using:
a.

Change in net domestic credit to the central government from the BRH
according to Table 10R of the BRH.

b.

Change in the stock of project accounts (“Comptes de projets”) included in
Table 10R of the BRH will be excluded from change in net domestic credit to
the central government as defined above.

54
c.

Change in the stock of Special Accounts (“Comptes Speciaux”) and seized
values (“Valeurs Saisies UCREF”) included in Table 10R of the BRH will be
excluded from the change in net domestic credit to the central government as
defined above.1

7.
The change in net central bank credit to the rest of the non-financial public
sector, is defined as, and will be measured using:
d.

Change in “créances nettes sur le secteur public” (i.e, net credit to the nonfinancial public sector) minus the change in “ créances nettes sur l'état” (i.e.
net credit to the central government), according to table 10R of the BRH.

e.

The changes will be measured on a cumulative basis from the stock at
end-September 2009.
B.

Net Domestic Financing to the Central Government

8.
Net domestic financing to the central government will comprise the change in
net banking sector credit to the central government (defined below) plus the change in
nonbank financing which includes amortization, counterpart funds,2 and the net
issuance of Treasury bills and other government securities by the central government
to non-banks. Net domestic banking sector credit to the central governent is defined
as, and will be measured, using:
a.

The change in the stock of net domestic credit to the central government from
the BRH according to Table 10R of the BRH, plus, the change in the stock of
net domestic credit of the central government from domestic banks according
to Table 20R of the BRH, which will include the net issuance of treasury bills
and other government securities by the central government for government
financing purposes. Securities issued for the recapitalization of the BRH are
excluded from this defintion.

b.

The change in the stock of project accounts (“Comptes de projets”), as defined
in 6.b above, will be excluded from the change in net domestic banking sector
to the Central Government.

c.

The change in the total stock of Special Accounts (“Comptes Speciaux”) and
seized values (“Valeurs Saisies UCREF”), as defined in 6.c above, will be
excluded from the change in net domestic banking sector to the Central
Government.

1

Special Accounts (“Comptes Speciaux”) refer to U.S. dollar-denominated central government sight deposits at
the BRH. The balance of these accounts increase with the proceeds of the sales of in-kind aid (in the form of
wheat, maize, rice, etc.) received by the Haitian government; these proceeds are earmarked to finance specific
projects and cannot be used by the Central Government without the explicit authorization of respective donors.

2

Counterpart funds are proceeds from sales of grants received in kind.

9.
The changes will be measured on a cumulative basis from the stock at endSeptember 2009.
C.

Net International Reserves

10.

The change in net international reserves will be measured using:

a.

Change in net foreign assets (“Réserves de change nettes” of the BRH
Table 10R);3

b.

Minus the change in foreign currency deposits of commercial banks at the
BRH (“Dépôts à vue en dollars U.S. et en Euros des BCM à la BRH”, and the
“CAM transfer” of the BRH Table 10R).

c.

Minus the change in the stock of project accounts (“Comptes de projets”) as
defined in 6.b above.

d.

Minus the change in the stock of Special Accounts (“Comptes Speciaux”) in
dollars and euros (and excluding gourdes), and seized values (“Valeurs Saisies
UCREF”), the latter as defined in 6.c above.

e.

Plus the change in the stock of the Special Drawing Rights (SDR) allocation
(“Allocations DTS”) from the BRH Table 10R.

11.
Data will be expressed in U.S. dollar terms and valued at the corresponding
end-period market exchange rate from the BRH Table 10R.
12.
For definition purposes, net international reserves are the difference between
the BRH’s gross foreign assets (comprising monetary gold, all claims on
nonresidents, SDR holdings, and BRH claims in foreign currency on domestic
financial institutions) and reserve liabilities (including liabilities to nonresidents of
one-year maturity or less, use of Fund credit, and excluding the full SDR allocation,
and trust funds).4 Swaps in foreign currency with domestic financial institutions and
pledged or otherwise encumbered reserve assets are excluded from net international
reserves.
13.
The changes will be measured on a cumulative basis from the stock at endSeptember 2009.
D.

Net Domestic Assets of the BRH

14.
The change in net domestic assets of the BRH is defined as, and will be
measured using:
a.

The change in base money (program definition according to Section I. below);

3

Letters of credit and guarantee (“Lettres de crédit” and “Lettres de garantie”) are reported in Table 10R as
part of BRH foreign liabilities (“Engagements exterieurs”), and therefore are already netted out of NIR.

4

Program NIR does not net out the full SDR allocation on the liability side since it is a long-term liability to the
SDR Department (and not the Fund).

56
b.

Minus the change in the U.S. dollar amount of net international reserves
(program definition according to section C above), converted into gourdes at
the program exchange rate.

15.
The program definition of net domestic assets of the BRH will use a program
exchange rate of G 40.0 per U.S. dollar for the period June 2010- March 2011.
16.
The changes will be measured on a cumulative basis from the stock at endSeptember 2009.
E.

PetroCaribe-Related Funds

17.
As of June 15, 2010, the outstanding balance of PetroCaribe funds totaled
US$152.7 million, with US$2.0 million held in U.S. dollar-denominated sight
deposits of the central government at the BRH, and the remaining US$150.7 million
in U.S. dollar denominated deposits of the central government at domestic
commercial banks.
18.
The authorities indicated that they were exploring options to channel
new Petrocaribe/ALBA-related inflows through a binational Venezuela-Haiti
corporation.5 Until new institutional arrangements are finalized and the statutes of the
new societe mixte are published in the “Journal Officiel” (Le Moniteur), PetroCariberelated inflows will continue to constitute direct external debt of the central
government. These resources are under the direct control of the central government,
and, for program purposes, will be fully reflected in program fiscal tables. They will
be treated as budget support loans, whose proceeds are partly or entirely deposited in
government accounts in the banking system (Petrocaribe deposits). Spending from
PetroCaribe resources (up to US$163 million in FY 2010), financed with a drawdown
of PetroCaribe deposits in the banking system, will also be fully reflected in program
tables.
19.
Following ratification of the societe mixte, the annual budgets of the company
will be published on the MEF website before the beginning of the fiscal year. Audited
annual financial statements will be published within six months of the end of each
financial year.
F.

Nonconcessional Public Sector External and Foreign-Currency
Denominated Debt

20.
The definition of debt comprises all forms of debt, including loans, suppliers’
credits, and leases, that constitute current, i.e. not contingent, liabilities, which are
created under a contractual arrangement through the provision of value in the form of
5

ALBA refers to “Alternativa Boliviarana de las Americas”.

57
assets (including currency) or services, and which require the obligor to make one or
more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at some point in
the future, as set forth in Executive Board Decision No. 12274, Point 9, and revised
on August 31, 2009.
21.
A ceiling applies to the contracting and guaranteeing by the public sector of
new nonconcessional debt with nonresidents with original maturities of one year of
more. The ceiling applies to debt and commitments contracted or guaranteed for
which value has not yet been received. This applies to private debt for which official
guarantees have been extended and which, therefore, constitute a contingent liability
of the public sector.
22.
For program purposes, the guarantee of a debt arises from any explicit legal
obligation of the public sector to service a debt in the event of nonpayment by the
debtor (involving payments in cash or in kind), or from any implicit legal or
contractual obligation of the public sector to finance partially or in full any shortfall
incurred by the debtor.
23.
For program purposes, a debt is concessional if it includes a grant element of
at least 35 percent, calculated as follows: the grant element of a debt is the difference
between the present value (PV) of debt and its nominal value, expressed as a
percentage of the nominal value of the debt.6 The PV of debt at the time of its
contracting is calculated by discounting the future stream of payments of debt service
due on this debt, based on the currency specific commercial interest reference rates
(CIRRs) as laid out by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD).7 For a debt with a maturity of at least 15 years, the ten-year-average CIRR
will be used to calculate the PV of debt and hence, its grant element. For debt with
maturity of less than 15 years, the six-month average CIRR will be used. To both the
ten-year and six-month averages, the same margin for differing repayment periods as
those used by the OECD need to be added (0.75 percent for repayment periods of less
than 15 years, 1 percent for 15 to 19 years, 1.15 percent for 20 to 29 years, and 1.25
percent for 30 years or more).
24.
Excluded from the ceiling are short-term import-related credits, rescheduling
arrangements, borrowing from the Fund, non-resident purchases of treasury bills, and
guarantees for the electricity sector in the form of letters of credit.
25.
The ceilings for contracting and guaranteeing of nonconcessional debt by the
total public sector (as defined in para.4) will be set at zero continuously throughout
the program period.
6
7

The grant element calculator can be found at http://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/conc/calculator/default.aspx.

The grant element calculations will take into account all aspects of the loan agreement, including maturity,
grace period, payment schedule, upfront commissions, and management fees.

58
G.

Arrears of the Central Government

26.
External payment arrears are defined as overdue payments (principal and
interest) to non-residents on debt contracted and guaranteed by the central
government, and will be defined according to the terms of indebtedness of each
creditor. The criterion of zero accumulation of external arrears will be monitored on a
continuous basis.
27.
Domestic arrears of the central government are defined to include: (i) any bill
that has been received by a spending ministry from a supplier for goods and services
delivered (and verified) and for which payment has not been made within 90 days
after the due date of payment; (ii) wage, salary, and other payment to government
employees, including direct and indirect allowances, that were due to be paid in a
given month but remained unpaid on the 30th of the following month; and
(iii) interest or principal obligations which remain unpaid 30 days after the due date
of payment. This definition excludes changes in the stock of arrears on account of
interest, penalties and valuation changes.
H.

Base Money

28.

The change in base money is defined as, and will be measured using:

a.

The change in the stock of currency in circulation from Table 10R of the
BRH.

b.

The change in the stock of reserve deposits of commercial banks at the BRH,
from Table 10R, using gourde sight deposits of commercial banks (Dépôts a
vue en gourdes des BCM a la BRH) and cash-in-vault of commercial banks
(Encaisses des BCM).

29.

The changes will be measured on a cumulative basis from the stock at endSeptember 2009.
I.

Poverty-Reducing Expenditures

30.
The growth in poverty reducing expenditure will be measured as the sum of
domestically-financed spending for the Ministries in charge of agriculture, health, and
education. This will be a flow measured on a cumulative basis from end-September
2009.
III.

QUARTERLY ADJUSTMENTS

31.
The quarterly performance criteria and indicative targets will be adjusted for
the following amounts:
A.

Adjustment for Domestic Arrears Accumulation

32.
The ceilings for net BRH credit to the central government and the net
domestic banking sector credit to the central government will be adjusted downwards
for the amount of outstanding domestic arrears accumulation.

59
B.

Adjustment for PetroCaribe-related Inflows in FY 2010

33.
Until the binational company charged to administer PetroCaribe-related funds
is legally established, any drawdown of PetroCaribe-related deposits will be
considered as central government spending for program purposes.
34.
The ceiling for net domestic credit to the central government will include
movements in PetroCaribe accounts in the banking system and will be adjusted for
the difference between the actual stock of PetroCaribe deposits in the banking system
and programmed stock of these deposits in the banking system. The ceilings for net
BRH credit to the central government, on BRH net domestic assets, and the floor for
NIR will also include movements in PetroCaribe accounts at the BRH. They will be
will be adjusted for the difference between the actual stock of PetroCaribe deposits at
the BRH and the programmed stock of these deposits at the BRH. The adjustor will
be calculated on a cumulative basis from October 1, 2009.

Adjustment for Net Program External Financing in FY 2010

35.
The program ceilings on BRH net credit to the central government, net
domestic financing to the government, and on BRH net domestic assets, and the floor
on NIR reflect an assumed flow of net external financing, defined as disbursements of
cash budgetary assistance, exceptional financing (including rescheduled principal and
interest) and debt relief minus debt service. These amounts exclude all PetroCaribe
flows.

36.
If actual net external financing is lower than programmed, the ceilings on net
BRH credit to the central government, net domestic financing to the government, and
on net BRH domestic assets will be adjusted upward, and the floor on NIR will be
adjusted downward, by the amount of the difference between actual and programmed
net external financing, converted into gourdes at the program exchange rate. The
amount of this adjustment will be limited to US$50 million to smooth volatility in
external financing, and would only offset temporary delays in disbursements of
already-identified budget support. The adjuster will be calculated on a cumulative
basis from October 1, 2009. Any amount of net BRH financing under this adjuster
would be expected to unwind when the budget support is received, or, at the latest to
be fully repaid within one year.

IV.

CLARIFICATION OF STRUCTURAL CONDITIONALITY
A.

Fiscal Sector

37.
The structural benchmark on initiating efforts to introduce a new tax code
will involve setting up a working group in the MEF, and publishing a work program
with specific deadlines on the MEF website by end-September 2010.
38.
The benchmark on preparing monthly consolidated Treasury balances will
involve publishing on the MEF website a table consolidating balances in all accounts
in the ledger of government accounts maintained by the Treasury, not later than three
months after the end of each month, starting from end-September 2010 with end-June
2010 data.
39.
The structural benchmark on making an inventory of all government and
donor accounts at the BRH and BNC will involve preparing and submitting to the
IMF a list of all government and donor accounts at the BRH and BNC and updating it
as needed. It will be set for end-September 2010.
40.
The structural benchmark on publishing quarterly reports with monthly data
(for AGD and DGI) on revenue performance on the MEF website, involves for AGD,
publishing reports that include the following: the number of importers in SYDONIA;
the number of importers in SYDONIA that have imported during the month; the
number of importers in SYDONIA that have imported during the month in provinces;
the total number of customs posts; the number of customs posts in provinces; the
value of imports by broad categories, including imports of fuel products and imports
exempted from or zero-rated under various duties and taxes; collections by type of
duty and tax; and collections from provinces. For DGI, the benchmark involves
publishing reports that include the number of taxpayers in DGI files, including
exempted taxpayers, government employees, and public enterprises; the number of
taxpayers in DGI files that have fulfilled their tax obligations, including exempted
taxpayers, government employees, and public enterprises; the aggregate turnover or
revenue, aggregate profits, labor, and non-labor costs for taxpayers that have fulfilled
their tax obligations, including exempted taxpayers, government employees, and
public enterprises; and collections by type of tax or duty, including in provinces. The
benchmark will be assessed quarterly with the initial test date set at end-September
2010.
B.

Monetary Policy and Financial Sector

41.
The benchmark regarding the signature of a memorandum of understanding
between the MEF and the BRH will (i) establish the amount of government debt
owed to the BRH, (ii) update the BRH recapitalization plan and (iii) set a calendar of
T-bill issuance with amounts to be issued for financing and for BRH recapitalization.
This will be set for end-September 2010.

62

APPENDIX I: HAITI–METHODOLOGICAL NOTE FOR POST-EARTHQUAKE GDP ESTIMATES1
This note describes the methodology used to generate Haiti’s post-disaster GDP and
presents preliminary staff estimates of the earthquake impact on medium-term growth, based
on the results of the post disaster needs assessment (PDNA). This approach could be of use
in similar post-disaster situations.
1.
The earthquake caused unprecedented damages and losses, estimated by PDNA
at US$7.8 billion, or 120 percent of GDP. Estimates point to damages of US$4.2 billion
(65 percent of GDP) and losses of US$ 3.6 billion (55 percent of GDP).2 The PDNA gauged
recovery and reconstruction needs at US$3.9 billion for the next 18 months and at US$8.9 up
to US$ 11.5 billion for the next three years (Table 1).3

2.
Post-disaster GDP projections were generated from estimated flows from the
PDNA exercise and using the 2009 GDP as a basis. Annual flows related to losses,
recovery, and reconstruction needs were combined and scaled with sectoral production
coefficients to generate proxies for changes in value-added (Table 2).4 We projected constant
price GDP using 2009 as a base year and estimated annual change in value-added. Given
existing shortcomings in national accounts statistics and the unavailability of information
about intermediate consumption, this approach was used to estimate national output and
generate constant annual GDP estimates.

Prepared by Aminata Touré (WHD).
Damages are stock of lost assets that should be recorded in financial accounts. However losses are flows of
foregone revenues.

Recovery and reconstruction needs are flow of resources essential to rebuild post disaster.

Damages are excluded from our GDP impact analysis. However other flows, related to GDP, such as losses
and amounts needed for recovery and reconstruction are taken into account.

reconstruction needs are added. Then, flow s are scaled w ith sectoral production coefficients to generate proxies for the changes
in value added.

3.
The methodology used first isolated flows affecting domestic product on the
income side. While we fully factored the flows of losses, for the recovery and reconstruction
we removed flows associated with activities not likely to generate income, or affect output
and capital formation (Table 3). Specifically, we excluded activities related to the distribution
of food assistance and cash for work programs. We also excluded imported household goods,
education equipment, furniture and vehicles for the reconstruction. Overall, we are

incorporating US$2.6 billion in recovery funds (out of US$2.9 billion) and US$5.2 billion in

Despite the recovery in activity of recent months, in FY 2010 economic activity is
estimated to contract by 8.5 percent on account of the significant upfront losses. The
earthquake hit Haiti at the beginning of the second quarter of its fiscal year, disrupting
economic activity for the remaining quarters for public infrastructure services, manufacturing
industries, and commerce. The bulk of the earthquake losses (67 percent) affected all sectors,
hindering growth despite a 100 percent expansion of the construction sector (Table 5).

Growth in FY 2011 could reach 9.8 percent and average 7 percent over
FY 2012–15 on account of recovery and construction activities. The economy would
continue to endure losses until FY 2013, while growth is fueled by strong construction and
recovery activities in addition to a gradual pick-up in services, manufacturing and mining.

APPENDIX II: HAITI—ASSESSING EXTERNAL STABILITY1
The structural break in Haiti’s economic data caused by the January 2010 earthquake
complicates a comprehensive exchange rate assessment. Nonetheless, an analysis of
medium-term current account projections and of non-price competitiveness indicators can
help inform a forward-looking assessment of exchange rate dynamics in Haiti.
1.
Haiti’s real effective exchange rate (REER) appreciated by almost 90 percent
during 2003–2008, in large part driven by large remittances and external aid inflows. In
2009 the currency depreciated by about

both a modest nominal depreciation and the

2.
Haiti’s de jure exchange
arrangement is floating, but since
January 2010, is de facto classified as a
managed exchange rate regime (“other
managed”). Following the earthquake, the
central bank has been purchasing foreign
exchange to build reserves ahead of large future
import demand related to the reconstruction.
This has helped mitigate exchange rate volatility
associated with large remittance inflows and an
increased supply of foreign exchange associated
with NGO activity in the country.

An analysis of current account flows
up to December 2009 suggested that the real
appreciation reflected mostly an equilibrium response to movements in fundamentals,
with little evidence of loss of competitiveness. Haiti’s growing trade deficit appears to be
sustainably financed by increasing transfers (official and private). Export indicators have also
improved since 2003. Following a retooling of the textile industry in 2008, Haiti’s export
share of U.S apparel imports increased sharply in 2009, also compared to regional textile
export competitors. Econometric analysis conducted on pre-earthquake data using the
equilibrium real effective exchange rate approach pointed to some modest overvaluation,
which nonetheless remained within the model’s margins of error.

Remittance inflows have increased in the aftermath of the earthquake. Inflows of
remittances hit a record high of US$111 million in February 2010 (a 32 percent increase
year-on-year), and are projected to grow by about 11 percent in FY 2010. The persistence in
the surge in remittance inflows, however, is subject to some uncertainty. On the one hand,
the introduction of the temporary protected status (TPS) for Haitian immigrants in the U.S.
could underlie the observed surge in

The outlook for exports could surprise on the upside. With textile exports
accounting for about 95 percent of Haiti’s exports, almost entirely to the United States, the
Haiti Economic Lift Program (HELP) Act recently introduced by the U.S. could provide an
important avenue for expanding Haiti’s textile industry. Among other provisions, the Act
would increase current tariff preference levels for certain knit and woven apparel products,
and raise the volume of those products eligible to tariff preferences. Textile production
capacity and distribution networks were temporarily disrupted following the earthquake, but
recent data show some recovery and the apparel industry is operating at close to capacity.
2

Shortly after the earthquake the United States announced it would grant temporary protected status (TPS) for
18 months to Haitians already in the U.S. The TPS would grant legal status to over 200,000 Haitians currently
residing illegally in the U.S., allowing them to transfer money home through formal channels.

70
Therefore, in order for Haiti to benefit
from the HELP Act, new industrial zones
must be established and FDI secured to
expand production capacity and move up
the value chain. Provided the government
moves expeditiously on its objectives to
set up new industrial zones and
implements measures to improve the
business climate, exports could grow at an
even faster pace than currently projected.

Structural indicators indicate
that non-price competitiveness continues to be limited in Haiti. Haiti consistently fares
very low on infrastructure indicators by regional standards. Its total network of roads stood at
about 4,000 km in 2000. Haiti’s electricity production and consumption is also the lowest in
the region, with consumption per capita at only 2 percent the level in its neighbor, the
Dominican Republic. FDI inflows to Haiti as a share of GDP continue to be among the
lowest in the region. According to the World Bank Doing Business Indicators, Haiti still
ranks last in the Latin America and Caribbean region in terms of ease of starting a business,
and in the lowest quintile among low income countries. Finally, Haiti has seen virtually no
improvement on measures of economic and political risk, as rated by the International
Country Risk Guide.

Even if an important portion of the aid and remittance inflows were to be
absorbed via higher imports, the sheer magnitude of such scaled-up aid is expected to
exert significant real appreciation pressures. Excess capacity resulting from the massive
destruction of physical capital may temporarily mitigate the impact of the real appreciation
on inflation. Strengthened coordination between fiscal and monetary and exchange rate
policies will be critical to appropriately manage the surge in aid and external inflows and
avoid excessive exchange rate volatility. In the short-term, the central bank could lean
against excessive exchange rate volatility by building up reserves, but over time real
appreciation will be unavoidable. Structural reforms to reduce supply-side bottlenecks,
expand the export base and improve the business environment would be essential in
mitigating the impact of exchange rate appreciation on external sector competitiveness.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

HAITI
Joint Bank-Fund Staff Debt Sustainability Analysis 2010
Prepared by the Staffs of the International Monetary Fund
and the International Development Association
Approved by Gilbert Terrier and Dominique Desruelle (IMF)
and Auguste Kouame and Sudarshan Gooptu (IDA)
July 8, 2010
The updated DSA was prepared jointly by the Fund and Bank staffs in accordance with the
revised Joint Fund-Bank Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF) for low-income countries
(LICs). Under the baseline scenario that does not include any debt relief provided or
committed by official creditors following the January 2010 catastrophic earthquake, the
updated DSA shows that Haiti’s risk of debt distress remains high due to the deterioration of
the macroeconomic outlook and new borrowing. Although HIPC and MDRI relief have
substantially reduced Haiti’s debt burden since June 2009, the updated DSA findings
indicate that the net present value (NPV) of the debt-to-exports ratio would breach the
relevant policy-dependent threshold in the baseline scenario for the medium term. 1 Haiti’s
weaker near-term macroeconomic outlook following the January 2010 earthquake, a narrow
export base, together with new and projected borrowing, are key factors in the risk of debt
distress. 2 An alternative scenario shows that delivery of announced debt relief by multilateral
and bilateral creditors would improve the debt sustainability outlook. That scenario also
stresses the need for new borrowing to remain limited and on highly concessional terms.
Staff will continue to closely monitor the evolution of external debt and the government’s
ability to secure highly concessional financing and mobilize domestic resources.
I. BACKGROUND
1.
Haiti reached the completion point in June 2009 and qualified for US$1.2 billion
in debt relief under the HIPC Initiative and MDRI. Debt service savings amounted to
US$265 million under the HIPC Initiative and US$972.7 million under MDRI. The debt
1

Haiti is classified as a weak performer based on its three-year average score of 2.86 on the World Bank’s
Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA). For a weak performer (defined as those with three-year
average CPIA ratings below 3.25), the indicative thresholds for external debt sustainability are PV of debt-toGDP ratio of 30 percent, PV of debt-to-exports ratio of 100 percent, PV of debt-to-revenue ratio of 200 percent,
debt service-to-exports ratio of 15 percent, and debt service-to-revenue ratio of 25 percent. Haiti is currently
classified as in high risk of debt distress.

stock in NPV terms was reduced from US$1,320 million at end-September 2008 to
US$641 million at end-September 2009. 3 While most relief has been provided, conclusion of
bilateral agreements with some Paris Club creditors is still pending. 4 As a result of the debt
relief initiatives, Haiti’s nominal external public and publicly guaranteed debt stock reached
US$1.24 billion at end-September 2009 (about 19 percent of GDP), down from US$1.88
billion at end-September 2008 (Text Table 1). Assuming full delivery of Paris Club debt
relief, debt stock at end-September 2009 would stand at US$1.06 billion (16.6 percent of
GDP).
2.
Haiti’s public debt as of end-September 2009 was estimated at about
24.8 percent of GDP. Most of the public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt is owed to
external creditors (about 67 percent), and the rest is domestic debt (equivalent to about
8.2 percent of GDP). The domestic debt corresponds to credit to the government from the
central bank (BRH).

3.
The level of external PPG debt at end-September 2009 rose by more than
previously projected at the time of the Completion Point in June 2009. 5 In nominal
terms, Haiti’s debt was expected to reach 13.2 percent of GDP in 2009 under the Completion
Point DSA—3 ½ percentage points lower than actual debt stock. The larger-than-expected
increase reflects higher bilateral debt between 2008 and 2009 due to new borrowing (on
concessional terms) from Venezuela under the PetroCaribe agreement, on which no relief
was provided under the HIPC initiative. 6 Haiti’s external debt rose to US$1.48 billion at endMarch 2010, reflecting the IMF emergency augmentation of January 2010, new IDB
borrowing, and further PetroCaribe financing.
4.
Haiti’s debt situation is being reassessed in light of the catastrophic damage to
the economy. Damages and losses from the earthquake are estimated at more than
120 percent of 2009 GDP. A multi-year reconstruction and growth strategy has been
developed by the Haitian authorities in conjunction with the international community, for
which a total of US$9.9 billion have been pledged at the New York Donors’ Conference in
March 2010. Several creditors have announced their intentions to provide debt relief on
Haiti’s outstanding debt stocks, as part of a broader initiative to alleviate debt service
constraints. These include:
•

The World Bank provided debt relief on Haiti’s outstanding debt of SDR 24.3
million (about US$36 million as of May 21, 2010). Debt relief became effective in
May 2010 when the 14 donors to the Debt Relief Trust Fund agreed to allocate the
resources needed to cover the debt cancellation.

•

The IDB would provide US$479 million to cancel Haiti’s outstanding debt as of
end-December 2009 and convert the undisbursed loans in the existing project
portfolio into grants. Debt relief, which was approved in March 2010 by the Board of
Governors, will become effective in the near future, as soon as the committed donor
financing is available.

•

IFAD announced in April that it would cancel about US$50.7 million in outstanding
debt (in NPV terms) to be delivered in the form of grants against debt service due, on
a pay-as-you-go basis.

The Completion Point DSA prepared in June 2009 is deemed a more reliable comparator in terms of
macroeconomic assumptions (Country Report No. 09/288), given that the January DSA Update was based on
very uncertain data immediately following the earthquake (Country Report No. 10/35). The January 2010 DSA
Update also found Haiti’s risk of debt distress to have increased markedly, reflecting both a worsened near-term
outlook and new higher borrowing. The updated DSA also reflects a lower discount rate, which increases the
PV of debt.
6

In the Completion Point DSA, resources accumulated under the PetroCaribe agreement (US$104 million)
were treated as private debt on the understanding that the binational company (Société Mixte) would be set up
in early 2009, in which case financing from PetroCaribe flows would become the debt of the binational
company and not of the government. The binational company is yet to be established, and total PetroCaribe
flows, including new flows accumulated as of end-FY2009, in the amount of US$295 are now considered part
of government debt.

4
•

Venezuela officially confirmed it would provide debt relief on Haiti’s outstanding
debt as of January 25, 2010 in the amount of US$395 million. Modalities for debt
relief have yet to be clarified. 7

•

Taiwan, Province of China, has offered to pay about US$12 million in interest and
to provide a five-year moratorium on principal payments on Haiti’s outstanding debt.

5.
In June 2010, the IMF Executive Board approved the establishment of the PostCatastrophe Debt Relief (PCDR) Trust. The PCDR is a dedicated instrument to assist
countries affected by catastrophic natural disasters like Haiti. Such a mechanism would
enable the Fund to provide debt relief to Haiti and would also be available to other lowincome countries that are hit by similar catastrophic disasters in the future. Debt relief from
the Fund would complement a concerted international effort to cancel Haiti’s remaining debt.
Official creditors accounting for about 92 percent of Haiti’s outstanding debt as of endMarch 2010 (excluding the Fund) have already delivered or are firmly committed to
providing debt relief on outstanding debt stocks (Text Table 1). If Haiti’s eligibility for
assistance under the PCDR is approved, debt stock relief could be provided on Haiti’s
outstanding obligations to the Fund in the amount of SDR 178.13 million.
6.
The current DSA framework includes new borrowing accumulated since the
Completion Point in June 2009, as well as projected new borrowing through FY 2015.
In particular, accumulated concessional trade financing from Venezuela under the
PetroCaribe agreement of US$295 million is now included. The treatment of this portion of
debt follows the same approach as in the January 2010 DSA Update. 8 The framework also
incorporates the new airport loan (US$33 million) contracted in December 2009 with the
Development Bank of Venezuela (BANDES). 9 In terms of new flows, the framework
includes projected ECF disbursements through FY 2013, together with accumulated
PetroCaribe flows of US$160 million in FY 2010 and projected future PetroCaribe
borrowing in the range of US$230-250 million a year through FY 2015.
II. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY OUTLOOK, 2010-2030
Baseline Scenario
7.
The baseline macroeconomic framework for the long-term debt sustainability
analysis has been revised to take into account recent developments as well as the
macroeconomic impact of the 2010 earthquake. Key macroeconomic assumptions are
7

The DSA scenario with debt relief assumes cancellation of US$295 million outstanding as of end-September
2009, plus US$100 million in subsequent (future) flows in 2010.
8

In the January 2010 DSA Update, resources accumulated under the PetroCaribe agreement were considered
part of government debt.

9

The terms of the airport loan from BANDES did not meet the minimum concessionality criteria required under
the ECF arrangement and therefore a waiver on the performance criterion on contracting of external nonconcessional debt was requested at the time of the Sixth Review under the ECF (Country Report No. 10/14).

5
summarized in Box 1 and Text Table 2. Long-term assumptions are somewhat more
optimistic compared to those used in the completion point DSA. Specifically, long-run
growth is now assumed to be slightly higher, reflecting the massive reconstruction effort
projected to take place over the medium-term. Government revenues (excluding grants) are
also projected to increase, in line with the new ECF’s objectives. Exports of goods and
services would grow by 10–12 percent a year, but decline in percent of GDP until FY 2013.
They would subsequently recover gradually to their pre-earthquake levels and rise to more
than 17 percent of GDP by 2030. Imports would surge by more than 60 percent in FY 2011,
in line with the reconstruction plan. Imports are expected to remain somewhat elevated in the
medium-term and revert to about 35 percent of GDP in 2030.
8.
Given a weaker near-term macroeconomic outlook compared to the Completion
Point DSA and higher borrowing, Haiti remains at high risk of debt distress after the
earthquake (Figure 1). Haiti’s present value (PV) of external debt relative to exports
breaches the indicative threshold until 2022, reaching a peak of 187 percent in 2013 before
declining gradually to less than 100 percent in 2022. Despite higher average GDP growth
between FY 2011 and FY 2013 compared to the Completion Point, exports (in percent of
GDP) are projected to be lower and imports and government expenditure much higher. The
PV of the debt-to-revenue ratio is slightly below the relevant policy threshold in 2010 (at
23.5 percent) but declines steadily over the projection period.
9.
Higher borrowing in 2009, and projected continued borrowing under the
PetroCaribe arrangement through 2015, substantially raises risks to debt sustainability.
Haiti’s debt sustainability outlook has worsened since reaching the HIPC Completion Point
in June 2009, mainly due to new bilateral borrowing. Based on the January 2010 DSA
Update, accumulated PetroCaribe debt of US$295 million alone raised the PV of external
debt by more than 45 percentage points of exports
in FY 2010. Although the terms of PetroCaribe
financing are highly concessional, the continued
accumulation of PetroCaribe borrowing, which is
expected to increase by about US$230–250
million a year based on current projections of oil
imports, poses a risk to medium-term debt
servicing capacity. 10 However, the terms of future
PetroCaribe borrowing have yet to be clarified.
The possibility of creating a private binational
corporation that would use accumulated inflows
to finance energy and social projects is still on the table. If and when that happens, future
PetroCaribe flows would become private liabilities and no longer add to public debt. On the
other hand, at the June 2nd donor summit in the Dominican Republic, Venezuela indicated
10

Under the PetroCaribe arrangement, financing of oil imports is provided on concessional terms, namely, twoyear grace period, 25-year maturity and 1 percent interest. The size of the portion financed is determined based
on prevailing oil prices and varies between 30 percent of total shipments for oil prices US$40-50 per barrel to
70 percent for oil prices US$150 and above.

6
that a large share of future PetroCaribe inflows over the coming years could be converted
into grants.
10.
Based on the sensitivity analysis, Haiti’s debt situation remains vulnerable to a
combination of shocks, but in particular to less favorable export performance. With the
exception of the debt service-to-revenues ratio, the alternative and shock scenarios worsen all
of Haiti’s debt stock and service indicators. Importantly, the ratios would exceed the relevant
thresholds in the case of the PV of debt-to-exports, debt-to-revenue, as well as debt-to-GDP
ratios. In the particular case of the PV of the debt-to-exports ratio, Haiti is most vulnerable to
a combined shock to growth, exports, and non-debt creating flows. Together, these shocks
could push the PV of debt-to-exports ratios up to 400 percent in FY 2012 before declining,
although it would remain above the threshold for the projection period.
11.
The prolonged nature of the breach in the baseline scenario precludes a
modification of Haiti’s risk of debt distress rating using the remittance-based
framework. The revised debt sustainability framework (DSF) for low-income countries
approved in August 2009 allows for the effect of remittances in the determination of a
country’s risk of debt distress. Under the new guidelines, however, taking into consideration
remittances can change the risk of debt distress only if breaches to the thresholds under the
baseline or stress tests (i.e. before taking into account remittances) are not very protracted. A
benchmark for the maximum permissible length of the breach of the thresholds could be 10
years starting from the current year (i.e. about half of the projection period) (SM/10/16). In
the case of Haiti, the debt-to-exports ratio is breached until 2022 in the baseline scenario, and
all indicators except for the debt service-to-revenues ratio sustain a protracted breach under
the stress tests.
Debt Relief Scenario
12.
Delivery of announced debt relief would significantly improve long run debt
sustainability (Figure 2). The debt relief scenario assumes delivery of relief on debt stocks
as of end-September 2009 as outlined in paragraph 5 by the World Bank, IDB, IFAD, and
PetroCaribe. The scenario also assumes debt relief on outstanding credit to the Fund as of
end-January 2010 (i.e. SDR 178.13 million). 11 This would translate into a debt stock relief of
about US$965 million in nominal terms as of end-2009. The debt relief scenario maintains
the assumption in the baseline regarding the projected accumulation of PetroCaribe
borrowing outlined in paragraph 6. Based on these assumptions, all debt indicators remain
below the policy relevant threshold in the baseline scenario, with the exception of the
debt-to-exports indicator which temporarily breaches the policy relevant threshold between
2014 and 2018.
13.
Debt dynamics would however remain sensitive to external shocks. Breaches
would persist under the most extreme shock scenario (the combination shock) for the three
11

This includes SDR 105 million outstanding as of end-September 2009 in addition to SDR 73.13 million
disbursed in January 2010.

7
stock indicators: (a) PV of debt-to-GDP; (b) PV of debt-to-exports; and (c) PV of debt-torevenue. The breach is particularly protracted for the debt-to-exports indicator (peaking to
297 percent in 2012 and remaining above 100 percent until 2027). This highlights Haiti’s
continued external debt vulnerability, in part stemming from its very narrow export base.
III. PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
14.
In the baseline scenario, public debt indicators remain somewhat unchanged
over the projection period (Figure 3). The PV of public debt-to-GDP remains at about
30 percent throughout the projection period. This stability reflects a decrease in the level of
external debt that is offset by an increase in domestic borrowing, which increases from
8 percent of GDP in FY 2010 to 20 percent of GDP by 2030. The PV of the debt-to-revenue
ratio rises gradually to about 160 percent by 2016 and remains at that level over the
projection period.
15.
Shock scenarios put public debt on a sharper rising trajectory over the
projection period. Public debt indicators are particularly sensitive to growth shocks and to
debt-creating flows. Moreover, a combination of a growth shock and lower primary balance
would significantly raise the PV of debt-to-GDP and debt-to-revenue ratios well above the
baseline scenario.
IV. DEBT MANAGEMENT
16.
The earthquake is thought to have severely disrupted existing debt management
systems. The Ministry of Finance building has been damaged. Based on an assessment of the
damages, further technical and financial support will be needed to recover data, set up a
working computer system, and rehabilitate physical infrastructure.
17.
The earthquake is a major setback, given recent steady progress. Debt
management capacity had improved in Haiti since the decision point was reached in
December 2006. In the area of debt recording, the BRH and the MEF had completed the
installation of the most recent version of UNCTAD DMFAS system, version 5.3, which
allows for improvements in the availability, quality and security of debt data. In part resulting
from the upgrade to the latest DMFAS system, debt reporting by the government had also
improved.
18.
Prior to the earthquake, satisfactory progress had also been made in establishing
the debt unit at the Ministry of Finance, although the finalization of the draft operations
manual, and the legal and institutional framework for debt management did depend on the
results of ongoing technical assistance by UNCTAD and CEMLA.
V. CONCLUSIONS
19.
Haiti’s risk of external debt distress remains high even after HIPC and MDRI
debt relief. The PV of debt-to-exports ratio breaches the 100 percent threshold for a
prolonged period, even though other debt indicators remain below their relevant thresholds.

8
The analysis, however, shows that implementation of debt relief commitments would
significantly improve the debt sustainability outlook and contribute to the reconstruction
effort, provided donors meet Haiti’s large and immediate financing needs through grants and
highly concessional loans.
Box 1: Macroeconomic Assumptions
Growth and inflation. After contracting by 8.5 percent in FY 2010 following the devastation of
the earthquake, growth is expected to rebound to almost 10 percent in FY 2011, averaging about
7.5 percent a year between FY2011 and FY2015 on the back of significant reconstruction related
aid inflows, before reverting to its long-run trend. Long-run growth is projected to be slightly
higher than the rate assumed in the Completion Point (CP) DSA (5 percent against 4.5 percent),
assuming effective utilization of the surge in aid-inflows and reforms to expand to absorptive
capacity of the economy. Inflation is projected to increase to about 8 percent in FY 2011 and
FY 2012 on account of increased domestic demand and short-run supply side bottlenecks
associated with large reconstruction aid inflows. Inflation is expected to revert to about 6.5 percent
starting FY 2014.
Fiscal policy. Revenue, which reached 11 percent of GDP in FY 2009, is projected at about
10 percent of GDP due to severe losses in government administrative and physical capacities.
Government revenues are expected to recover gradually, in line with the rebound in economic
activity, and to increase to 14 percent of GDP in 2015. Primary spending is projected to peak to
about 32 percent of GDP in 2011 and 2012 in line with the surge in reconstruction-based aid
inflows before falling to about 22 percent of GDP in the long run. The fiscal deficit is expected to
peak at 5 percent of GDP in 2012, and to average 3.4 percent of GDP from 2016 onwards.
Grants and financing. Grants are assumed to peak to about US$1.5 billion per year in
FY 2011-12 as reconstruction and economic activity rebound and average about US$1.1 billion
per year through FY 2015. It is assumed that Haiti would remain eligible for concessional
assistance from IDA and IDB which would cover most of Haiti’s external borrowing needs from
2018 onwards. The assumed grant element of new external borrowing is 35 percent. Following the
introduction of a Treasury-bill market during 2011, domestic financing will remain capped to
maintain medium-term public debt sustainability.
Current account. After contracting by 20 percent in FY 2010 due to damage in textile production
capacity and to distribution infrastructure, exports of goods and services are projected to rebound
and grow by an average of 12 percent in FY 2011–15 and reach their pre-earthquake value by
2016. Exports are assumed to increase to about 18 percent of GDP by 2030, slightly higher than
CP assumption. Imports of goods and services, on the other hand, are projected to surge to about
52 percent of GDP in FY 2011–12 reflecting reconstruction related imports, and to revert to about
37 percent of GDP by 2030. The current account deficit excluding grants in percent of GDP is
projected to widen significantly in FY 2010 and FY 2011 to about 29 percent and 24 percent,
respectively, before declining to about 13 percent by FY 2015. The current account deficit is
expected to be covered largely by grants and is projected to average 3.5 percent of GDP in
FY 2013–15 and 4.4 percent through 2030.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

IX. Exchange Arrangement
Haiti’s de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The de facto exchange rate
arrangement has been reclassified with the January 12, 2010 earthquake from crawl-like to
“other managed” arrangement. Prior to the earthquake, the gourde was on a depreciating
trend against the US dollar and remained within a narrow band between April 1, 2008 and
January 10, 2010. Consequently, during that period, the de facto IMF classification has been
retrospectively reclassified to a crawl-like arrangement. Since the earthquake, the exchange
rate has appreciated and remained somewhat more volatile. Therefore, effective January 11,
2010, the de facto arrangement has been reclassified to other managed from crawl-like.
The change from a fixed to managed floating regime took place in January 1990. Haiti's
exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions. Since September 1991, all transactions have taken place at the free
(interbank) market rate.

4
X. Safeguards Assessment
The update assessment of the Banque de la République d’Haiti (BRH) was concluded in
September 2008. The authorities have made progress in implementing safeguards
recommendations, but improvements are still needed in a number of areas. At the time, the
qualitative analysis of the main differences between currently used accounting principles and
IFRS did not reveal major differences and suggested that a gradual adoption of IFRS by the
BRH was feasible. The Audit Committee was set up, but its capacity needs to be
strengthened. Vulnerabilities remain in the areas of foreign reserves management, the timely
conduct of external audits, and timely production of audited financial statements.
The impact of the January 2010 earthquake on the key safeguards within the central bank is
not yet clear. A reassessment will be necessary in the future in the context of the new
program.
XI. Article IV Consultation
The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on July 9, 2007. Haiti
is on a 24-month cycle. The conclusion of the 2009 Article IV consultation has been delayed,
including by the January 12, 2010 earthquake.

Annex II. Relations with the Inter-American Development Bank
(As of June 15, 2010)
The IDB is Haiti’s largest multilateral donor with an uninterrupted presence of 50 years and a
strong commitment to the people and Government of Haiti. In the aftermath of January 12th,
2010 earthquake, the IDB has mobilized unprecedented financial and human resources to
respond to the multiple needs of Haiti. In collaboration with the government and other
donors, the Bank has extensively been engaged in humanitarian relief efforts, reconstruction,
rehabilitation activities, and delivery of basic social services.
Beyond the financing of key recovery and development investments, the Bank has assumed
additional responsibilities including assisting in the design and implementation of new
earthquake recovery institutional mechanisms such as the Interim Haiti Reconstruction
Commission (IHRC) and the Haiti Reconstruction Fund (HRF).
The Bank has also played a key role in the Government’s Action Plan for National Recovery
and Reconstruction by undertaking a comprehensive sector analysis of projects.
Key Developments for 2010
In March 2010, the Bank pledged US$400 million in new grants for 2010-11. In addition, in
April 2010, the Board of Governors approved the replenishment the Haiti Grant Facility for
US$200 million per year starting in 2011 until 2020. This amounts to US$2.2 billion over the
next eleven years, representing the Bank’s long term commitment to Haiti’s reconstruction
plan. These resources will finance crucial investments for Haiti’s post-earthquake recovery,
to tackle extreme poverty and inequality, and to establish the platform for long term
economic growth as well as institutional and social development.
In consultation with the government, to support recovery and development, the Bank can
take the lead in following five of its areas of expertise: education, transport, water and
sanitation, agriculture, and private sector development. These areas are the most critical ones,
in which the Bank has a proven track record and has established teams in both field and
headquarters.
The Bank lending portfolio in 2010 amounts to US$200 million and would be structured in 9
operations: US$30 million for temporary housing, US$50 million in budget support, US$15
million for water and sanitation in Port-au-Prince, US$20 million for the partial credit
guarantee fund, US$14 million for an electricity project in Port-au-Prince, US$3 million for
an e-government platform, US$54 million for Transport infrastructure, and US$14 million
for education. The first two operations were approved in April 2010, while the remaining
projects should be approved in the third quarter of 2010.
The IDB Board of Governors agreed to cancel Haiti’s outstanding debt with the Bank
amounting US$479 million and representing about 40 percent of the government’s external
debt. The IDB Governors also agreed to convert the undisbursed loans portion, totaling about
US$186 million into grants, thereby freeing up public resources for critical investments.
These decisions were preceded by the 2009 HIPC/MDRI debt relied initiatives, under which

7
the IDB granted about US$511 million in debt relief, clearing the way for the Government to
undertake vital public investments.
Portfolio Indicators
As of June 15, 2010, the IDB’s active portfolio consisted of 28 investment and sector
projects for a total of US$793 million out of which US$394 million or 50 percent is already
disbursed. In addition, a budget support grant of US$50 million is expected to be disbursed in
June 2010. IDB disbursements reached US$127 million in 2009, and are expected to reach
US$180 million in 2010.
The IDB has a comprehensive program in key strategic sectors: transport (US$272 million or
34 percent of the portfolio), agriculture and environment (US$140 million or 17 percent of
the portfolio) and water and sanitation (US$88 million or 11percent of the portfolio).
The Multilateral Investment Fund (MIF) has an active portfolio of US$18 million, most of
which has been approved in the aftermath of the earthquake. In addition to relief operations
in the housing sector, which totaled US$5.5 million this year, the MIF supports projects to
(i) improve the business environment and (ii) strengthen micro, small and medium
enterprises. The MIF has also supported activities to enhance the impact of remittances.
The Technical Cooperation (TC) portfolio has been an important complement to the Bank’s
operational program, as of May 2010, the program consisted of 43 operations representing
US$18 million.

The IDB administers US$175 million of other donors’ resources. This includes about US$20
million in soft loans from OFID for different projects in the education, transport, and water
and sanitation sectors; US$8 million grant from the EU for vocational training and
agricultural health initiatives; and over US$80 million from CIDA for primary road
construction projects. The Bank also administers a total of US$65 million from the Spanish
Water Fund for water and sanitation projects in urban, peri-urban and rural areas. Finally, a
US$45 million agreement has been reached with OFID, KFW, and the CDB in electricity,
education and social protection. Following the earthquake, these donors expressed interest in
providing financial and technical support to the government’s reconstruction strategy.

8
Annex III. Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of June 17, 2010)
The World Bank stepped up its engagement in Haiti since March 2004, as part of a broader
partnership between the transitional government and donors, to address Haiti’s social,
economic and institutional needs under the Interim Cooperation Framework (ICF).
On June 2, 2009, the Bank’s Board approved the FY2009-12 Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS), prepared jointly by the World Bank and the IFC to align their assistance with the
country’s National Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (the DSNCRP). The
strategy has three main pillars: (i) promoting growth and local development; (ii) investing in
human capital; and (iii) reducing vulnerability to disasters. Cutting across the CAS is an
emphasis on longer-term institution building and support for the Government in the delivery
of quick, visible results. The CAS also reflects the strategic imperatives of recovery,
reconstruction, and risk mitigation, in the aftermath of the devastating 2008 hurricane season.
The total envelope of International Development Association (IDA) resources for the new
four-year CAS period is around US$121 million. Normal IDA allocations were supplemented
by US$40 million of post-disaster assistance following the catastrophic 2008 hurricane
season. All current IDA and trust fund assistance is in grant form.
Since 2005, the Bank has approved US$283 million of IDA resources for Haiti, and more
than US$55 million from trust funds ($22 million from the Education for All Fast-Track
Initiative Catalytic Fund).
In the aftermath of the earthquake, the World Bank has pledged US$189 million in additional
funding through FY2011, of which $154 million will come from IDA (US$115 million in
new IDA grants; and US$39 million in debt relief to cancel Haiti’s remaining IDA debt.
The most recent Board approvals were: (i) an infrastructure and institutional emergency
projects (US$65 million), in March 2010; (ii) a US$12.5 million Development Policy
Operation (the Third Economic Governance Reform Operation) in December 2010; and (iii)
US$12 million of Additional Financing for the Transport and Territorial Development
project, to cover cost overruns and post-hurricane repairs in December 2010.
From FY 2010 onwards, new IDA projects are envisioned in just three areas in which the
Bank already has a strong program: CDD, education, and institutional strengthening
(including budget support). The upcoming budget support of $US30 million is being
finalized, the disbursement of which is expected by the end of the Haitian fiscal year. Most of
the 14 pre-existing IDA investment projects (commitment US$199 million) are being
redeployed and/or restructured to respond to the challenges created by the earthquake. The
Bank utilizes the capacity of existing projects, including those that focus on education and
community-driven development, to provide assistance quickly and effectively.
The Bank has participated in the Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) led by the
Government with Haiti’s partners to assess needs and losses and plan for recovery and
reconstruction. The Assessment, coordinated jointly by the World Bank, the European

9
Union, the Inter-American Development Bank, and the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP), put total reconstruction and recovery needs at $11.5 billion. The World
Bank participated in the eight priority areas, with a team of more than 30 people on the
ground. At the government’s request, the International Development Association (IDA) of
the World Bank Group will serve as the Trustee and fiscal agent for the Haiti Reconstruction
Fund, which mobilizes international support for recovery and reconstruction process.
The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has supported the government's priorities of
promoting economic growth and improving access to quality basic services, particularly for
the most vulnerable groups. IFC has expanded its activities in Haiti over the past two years
and established a full-time presence in the country, with three staff in its office, co-located in
the World Bank office. IFC activities in Haiti have focused on four key areas: the financial
sector, infrastructure, textiles, and investment climate. IFC has worked closely with IDA and
the donor community to identify targeted and concrete actions that: (i) support the
development of a sustainable private sector and resulting in income generating activities; and
(ii) help improve the business climate in infrastructure, access to finance, and SMEs.
Among the recent activities features investment to generate employment by fostering
investment in apparel and improving free zones and industrial parks for such investments.
Working with the Minister of Commerce and the CTMO-Hope, the Investment Climate
Department is working to: (i) remove legal and land bottlenecks to new investment; (ii)
improve the zone infrastructure to ensure new investors have sites within which to begin their
operations rapidly and efficiently; and (iii) generate new investment leads and provide
aftercare to existing manufacturers. The project is undertaking a demand analysis for
identification of industrial sites outside Port-au-Prince to inform the decentralization policy
of the Haitian Government. The project is funded by $1.26 million from the Netherlands
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Government of the Wallonia Region (Belgium).
IFC also approved in March 2010 a US$35 million package of loans to six private sector
clients to facilitate the resumption of their operations. These include a bottling plant, an
independent power producer, a textile company, two banks, and a micro-credit institution.
Second-stage investment opportunities (for example in telecommunications or tourism) are
being considered.

Statement by Paulo Nogueira Batista, Executive Director for Haiti, Renato Perez,
Senior Advisor to Executive Director and Eduardo Saboia, Advisor to Executive
Director
July 21, 2010
1.
On behalf of our Haitian authorities, we would like to thank the Managing Director
for his efforts in support of the recovery and reconstruction of the country. We would also
like to commend the IMF staff for their work on the establishment of the Post-Catastrophe
Debt Relief (PCDR) Trust Fund. The staff team that deals with Haiti has also worked hard to
bring to the Board the new three-year program under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) and
the request for debt stock relief. The Haitian authorities have asked us to express their
appreciation of the dialogue and cooperation with the IMF. Technical assistance in several
areas, the proposed debt cancellation, as well as the catalytic role that the institution has
played in mobilizing support for Haiti, are highly valued by the government.
2.
The earthquake struck the country when the economic performance was strong, as we
mentioned in our buff statement for the January Board meeting on Haiti. During FY 2009,
GDP growth reached 2.9 percent. Business confidence had strengthened, inflation was in line
with the program, and the authorities were moving forward with the macroreform agenda.
Even during the worst period of the international crisis, in FY 2009, exports increased by
12 percent relatively to FY 2008. International reserves had been rising considerably.
Performance for the sixth and last review of the ECF was considered by staff as broadly
satisfactory. The overall policy performance, including structural reforms and improvements
in governance, allowed for the delivery of HIPC/MDRI debt relief in 2009.
3.
Six months have passed since the earthquake that destroyed the major part of Port-auPrince in January 2010, killing and injuring more Haitians that any other natural disaster in
the country’s history. Over 3.7 million people, more than one third of the population, were
affected by the earthquake. The staff report provides a broad picture of the extent of human
suffering and the size of the economic losses. Conditions remain very difficult. For instance,
only 275,000 of 20 million cubic meters of rubble have been removed, according to a UN
report. The post-disaster needs assessment (PDNA) indicates that the recovery and
reconstruction needs may reach as much as US$11.5 billion over the next three years. In the
upcoming weeks, Haiti will face the beginning of the hurricane season, and the population of
Port-au-Prince has perhaps never been so unprotected against these risks.
International response to the earthquake
4.
The authorities welcome the generous pledges by donors announced at the high-level
UN conference in March 2010 and reaffirm their commitment to greater transparency and
accountability in the use of financial resources. However, the slow pace of disbursement of
the amounts pledged by donors—particularly those for budget support in FY 2010—remains
a major concern for the authorities, who have limited space for monetary financing and,
given the debt sustainability framework, can only receive external financing on a grant basis
or through highly concessional loans.

2
5.
A shortfall in budget support disbursements would undermine Haiti’s recovery.
Projections for GDP and other macroeconomic variables presented in the staff report will
have to be revised downwards if budget support fails to materialize. We call upon Executive
Directors to convey to their capitals the urgency of following through with the prompt
delivery of budget support assistance, particularly before the end of FY 2010.
6.
We note in passing that some countries or groups of countries, including from our
constituency (for example, Brazil, Ecuador and CARICOM), have disbursed significant
amounts, partly for budget support. The Dominican Republic has made great efforts to assist
Haiti since immediately after the earthquake. The staff report does not always do justice to
these efforts and contributions. For instance, there is no reference to the Dominican
Republic’s role. Moreover, Table 5 (p.14) does not mention the fact that Brazil has already
disbursed US$ 55 million through the Haiti Reconstruction Fund channel, including
US$15 million in budget support.
Post-Catastrophe Debt Relief (PCDR) and Extended Credit Facility (ECF)
7.
The authorities welcome the recent establishment of the PCDR Trust Fund, which as
the Board knows was modeled on the Haitian experience after the earthquake. We believe
that the PCDR will be of considerable help to Haiti. It constitutes a useful framework for
other member countries that may face similarly extreme circumstances in the future.
8.
By requesting a new ECF, the authorities reiterate their strong commitment to sound
macroeconomic management and to the National Action Plan for the Reconstruction and
Development of Haiti. This action plan is oriented to promoting growth and poverty
reduction by creating decentralized poles of economic activity, reducing vulnerability to
natural disasters, enhancing access to basic social services, and strengthening state
institutions, as explained in the Letter of Intent. It is essential for the successful
implementation of the ECF that the program be adequately financed. This means, among
other things, that disbursements by donors should match their pledges, especially during the
first 18 months.
9.
As mentioned in the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies, the Internal
Revenue Agency (DGI) was nearly destroyed by the earthquake. Important efforts will be
required to restore tax administration and the government’s capacity to mobilize a larger
amount of domestic resources. Donor support will be critical to the recovery and
modernization of the DGI and customs administration.
10.
On the expenditure side, the program includes a comprehensive reform and
redefinition of spending priorities in response to the population’s needs. The Fund’s technical
assistance has been and will continue to be instrumental to improving public financial
management and the efficiency of government spending.
11.
The authorities and the staff indicate that the resources provided by the Fund under
the ECF will be used to smooth the volatility of international reserves and of the exchange
rate associated with large and lumpy aid disbursements. This approach is consistent with the

3
limited amount of new resources envisaged under the program presented for Board
consideration.
12.
The authorities believe that strong private sector participation in Haiti’s action plan
requires removing critical infrastructure bottlenecks, improving energy supply, reducing
transaction costs, and increasing the access to credit. They welcome the IMF’s support in
establishing the legal framework for public-private partnership, which they expect will lead
to an increase of foreign direct investment in economic sectors such as tourism and textiles.
Financial sector
13.
Although the Haitian banking sector has adequate liquidity, non-performing loans
have increased and private sector credit has declined since the earthquake. The authorities
and the staff agree on the urgency of implementing the Partial Credit Guarantee (PCG)
scheme. Many debtors are not or will not be in a situation to adequately service their debts.
The authorities are convinced that the economy will not get back on its feet until banks and
microfinance institutions are in a position to expand the supply of credit, even if at a lower
level than in the pre-earthquake period.
14.
The adequate size of the PCG is estimated by the central bank (BRH) at
US$130 million, and staff has endorsed this number. However, according to information
provided to us by World Bank staff, and confirmed by the authorities, only US$35 million
have been pledged or are expected to be pledged in the near term for this purpose (by the
IDB, the World Bank, and one donor to the Haiti Reconstruction Fund). Given the urgency,
the BRH has decided to set aside US$70 million from its own international reserves. The
staff supports this decision.
A new start
15.
Looking forward, our authorities would like to stress that, despite the immense
suffering and challenges, Haiti takes responsibility for its own future. While appreciating the
help provided by the international community, the government realizes that the country’s
prospects depend fundamentally on the initiative of its own citizens in a democratic setting.
The Haitian people are resilient and proud of their rich culture and heritage. In the late 18th
century and during most of the 19th century, Haiti led the way in the struggle for
independence and the abolition of slavery. Very few countries have left such a strong mark
on world history. These strengths may be dormant, but are not dead. Paradoxically, today’s
tragedy could be transformed into an opportunity to make a new start.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
HAITI
Staff Assessment of Eligibility and Qualification for Debt Stock Relief Under
the Post-Catastrophe Debt Relief Trust Fund
Prepared by the Western Hemisphere Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Gilbert Terrier and Dominique Desruelle
July 8, 2010
The January 12, 2010 earthquake has caused extensive casualties and unprecedented
damage to Haiti, considerably worsening already difficult medium-term balance-of-payments
and debt situations. Resources freed by debt stock relief would be critical for meeting the
balance-of-payments needs exacerbated by the earthquake and subsequent recovery efforts.
Staff considers that Haiti is eligible and qualifies for debt stock relief under the PCDR Trust
Fund, and supports the authorities’ request for full debt relief on Haiti’s eligible obligations
toward the Fund. Eligible obligations include the PRGT credit that was outstanding on
January 12, 2010, and the ECF disbursement of January 29, 2010. All the necessary
conditions for disbursement by the Fund of the debt stock relief are in place.
I. Eligibility for PCDR Assistance
1.
Haiti is eligible and qualifies for debt relief under the PCDR Trust, and the
January 12, 2010 earthquake meets the PCDR Trust definition of a qualifying
Catastrophic Disaster.1 Haiti is a PRGT-eligible country with annual per capita income of
US$661 in 2009—well below the current IDA operational threshold of US$1,135. The
earthquake that struck Port-au-Prince caused unprecedented human and physical losses,
estimated at about 120 percent of 2009 GDP by the Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA)
conducted jointly by the United Nations and the World Bank. About 3.7 million people (over
a third of Haiti’s 9.7 million population,2 were directly affected by the earthquake; an
estimated 250,000 persons were killed and over 300,000 injured. According to the Haitian
government, 60 percent of government, administrative and economic infrastructure has been
destroyed.

1

To qualify for debt stock relief under the PCDR Trust Instrument, an eligible member must: (i) qualify for
debt flow relief; and (ii) meet additional qualifications for debt stock relief.

II. Qualification for Debt Stock Relief Under the PCDR Trust Fund
2.
The earthquake has exacerbated Haiti’s already difficult balance-of-payments
needs and worsened its already difficult debt situation. The earthquake has generated
massive and long-lasting reconstruction-related balance-of-payments needs, deteriorated the
macroeconomic outlook, reduced an already narrow export base, and weakened debt
management capacity.


Reconstruction costs could amount to US$11.5 billion over the next ten years.
Imports related to recovery and reconstruction have already grown at about
35 percent year-on-year since the earthquake and are expected to remain high over
the medium term. Notwithstanding the large aid commitments announced so far, aid
disbursements have been slow to materialize, and substantial financing gaps to be
covered by grants and debt relief are projected to persist beyond the period that would
be covered by debt flow relief, through at least 2015. This also takes into account the
need to maintain a sufficient reserves cushion to meet private sector demand for
foreign exchange without severe market disruptions, and to mitigate vulnerability to
external shocks, including natural disasters (Table 1).



The updated Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) shows that, prior to the delivery of
any post-earthquake debt relief, Haiti’s debt-to-exports ratio would remain above 100
percent until 2022, with a peak at 187 percent in 2013, and thus remain at high risk of
debt distress (see EBS/10/139, Sup. 1). Thus, as part of a broader initiative by the
international community to alleviate Haiti’s debt burden, resources freed by debt
stock relief by the Fund would be critical for meeting the above-mentioned
balance-of-payments needs.
III. Eligible Debt and Delivery of Assistance

3.
Haiti’s outstanding obligations to the Fund that would be eligible for stock debt
relief under the PCDR Trust amount to SDR 178.13 million. This includes the PRGT
credit of SDR 105 million that was outstanding as of January 12, 2010, and the ECF
disbursement (including an augmentation) of SDR 73.13 million made on January 29, 2010.
All of this debt would be considered for stock debt relief under the PCDR since it would still
be outstanding as of January 12, 2012. Haiti has made all scheduled debt service payments
on the debt that was outstanding as of January 12, 2010. While Haiti would be eligible for
debt flow relief on this debt under the PCDR Trust until January 12, 2012, there will be no
applicable debt service until June 2012.3
3

No principal payment is scheduled to fall due during this period, and, following the Fund’s waiver of interest
charges on all of its concessional loans through end-December 2011, the next interest payment on this debt is
scheduled for June 2012.

3
4.
Debt relief from the Fund would complement a concerted international effort to
cancel Haiti’s remaining debt. Official creditors accounting for about 92 percent of Haiti’s
outstanding debt as of end-March 2010 (excluding the Fund) have already delivered or are
firmly committed to providing debt relief on outstanding debt stocks (Text Table 1). Paris
Club creditors have already committed to cancel Haiti’s debt as part of the HIPC/MDRI
initiative as of July 2009. While some creditors have already signed bilateral debt
cancellation agreements with Haiti, signature of agreements with France, Italy and Spain is
still pending, though the process is in its final stages. In May 2010, the World Bank approved
debt stock relief in the amount of SDR 24.3 million (about US$36 million), financed by
individual donors’ contributions. Debt relief by the IDB on US$479 million in outstanding
stock and undisbursed loan amounts, which was approved in March 2010 by the Board of
Governors, will become effective in the near future, as soon as the committed donor
financing is available. IFAD announced in April it would cancel about US$50.7 million in
outstanding debt (in NPV terms), to be delivered in the form of grants against debt service
due, on a pay-as-you-go basis. Venezuela also confirmed that it would provide US$395
million in debt relief on outstanding PetroCaribe obligations as of January 25, 2010.4

5.
Policy implementation over the six months since the earthquake has remained
satisfactory, and the authorities are determined to use the earthquake as an
opportunity to build a better Haiti. As indicated in the staff report for the 2010 Article IV
consultation and request for a new ECF arrangement (EBS/10/139), the authorities have
continued to implement prudent macroeconomic policies since the earthquake. Their
National Action Plan for Reconstruction and Development aims at sustainably raising
medium-term growth and reducing poverty by creating decentralized economic growth poles,
reducing vulnerability to natural disasters, enhancing access to basic social services, and
strengthening state institutions. Donors pledged a total of US$9.9 billion to support the
reconstruction plan, of which US$5.3 billion are to be disbursed over the next 18 months.
6.
Under the new ECF-supported program, the authorities are committed to
implementing policies consistent with maintaining macroeconomic stability, addressing
the large reconstruction needs, and promoting sustained growth. The authorities’
economic strategy focuses on: (i) raising revenue collection and increasing the efficiency and
transparency of spending; (ii) upgrading monetary operations to facilitate the absorption of
aid inflows and effectively manage related pressures; (iii) restarting credit while maintaining
financial sector stability through the creation of a partial credit guarantee scheme; and
(iv) attracting investment and expanding the export base, through improvements in
infrastructure and the business environment. The new ECF-supported program is
underpinned by a comprehensive medium-term technical assistance strategy, coordinated
with Haiti’s development partners, with technical assistance from the Fund focusing on
financial sector issues, revenue administration, budget preparation and planning and Treasury
management.
IV. Staff Appraisal
7.
Staff supports the authorities’ request for debt-stock relief under the PCDR
Trust, and recommends disbursement of such relief. As indicated in the attached letter,
the earthquake caused destruction amounting to about 120 percent of 2009 GDP, affected
more than a third of Haiti’s population, and generated substantial and long-lasting
balance-of-payments needs. The resources freed by the debt relief are critical to meeting
these needs and to placing Haiti’s debt on a sustainable path. In the six-month period
following the earthquake, with limited financial resources and capacity, the authorities have
moved promptly to restore basic administrative functions and payment systems. They have
maintained macroeconomic stability and launched a coordinated reconstruction effort. Going
forward, macroeconomic policies are to be supported by a new three-year ECF arrangement
and, in that context, staff is confident that close coordination will continue with the
authorities in the design and implementation of these policies. The authorities’ reconstruction
efforts are supported by the international community, with official creditors accounting for
92 percent of Haiti’s outstanding debt as of end-March 2010 (excluding the Fund) having
already delivered or having made firm commitments to providing debt stock relief.

Attachment I: Letter Requesting Debt Relief under the PCDR Trust
Port-au-Prince
July 6, 2010
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20431
Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
1.
As you know, the January 12, 2010 earthquake caused damages and losses estimated
at 120 percent of GDP, and reconstruction costs amount to US$11.5 billion over the next 10
years. About 3.7 million Haitians (over a third of our population) living in Port-au-Prince and
neighboring cities have been directly affected by the disaster. By generating massive
reconstruction needs, deteriorating the macroeconomic outlook, and reducing the export
base, the earthquake has further worsened Haiti’s balance-of-payments and debt outlook.
2.
Debt relief from the Fund and other creditors would be a critical contribution to the
reconstruction effort and substantially improve Haiti’s debt outlook. Considering the very
high debt burden and the large and persistent balance of payments needs in the coming years,
we believe that Haiti meets the eligibility and qualification criteria for debt stock relief under
the Post-Catastrophe Debt Relief (PCDR) Trust Fund, and hereby request such relief from
the Fund in the form of grant financing under the PCDR Trust.
3.
Since the earthquake, we have successfully maintained macroeconomic stability
despite the difficult conditions in which our administration is still operating. After the
disaster, we have moved swiftly to restore basic government and payments systems
functions, with donor support. The economy is recovering, and inflation remains contained.
Revenue collection and spending execution are gradually normalizing. The Gourde has been
broadly stable, and we have been building foreign exchange reserves in anticipation of large
future import demand related to the reconstruction.
4.
Going forward, our reconstruction plan aims at building a better Haiti, restoring
growth, and placing Haiti’s debt on a sustainable path. We are committed to the sustained
implementation of our plan with the support of foreign aid inflows, while maintaining
macroeconomic stability. These policies, which will be supported by a new three-year ECF
arrangement, are described in our Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies. We
believe that these policies are appropriate to address our balance-of-payments problems and
will refrain from any measures that could compound these problems.

Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 10/xx
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
[July xx, 2010]

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
Haiti
On July 21, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Haiti.1
Background
The January 12, 2010 earthquake was a major setback for Haiti. Progress since 2004 in
maintaining macroeconomic stability, resuming growth, and implementing essential
reforms allowed the cancellation of US$1.2 billion of debt under the HIPC/MDRI
Initiative in June 2009. Growth reached 2.9 percent in 2009, one of the highest rates in
the Western Hemisphere, fueled by stronger agricultural and manufacturing output.
Annual inflation was virtually zero in December due to the unwinding of the international
food and fuel price shock. Prudent fiscal policies helped contain the deficit (excluding
grants and externally financed projects) to 4.4 percent of GDP, while the external
current account deficit narrowed to 3.2 percent of GDP (from 4.8 percent of GDP in
2008), helped by strong exports, low import prices, and resilient remittances.
The earthquake caused unprecedented damages and losses, estimated at 120 percent
of 2009 GDP. Over 225,000 persons were killed and 300,000 injured. Most ministries,
hospitals, and schools in the Port-au-Prince region were destroyed. The humanitarian
situation is only slowly improving, with 1.3 million people remaining in temporary
shelters. Before the earthquake, Haiti was already the poorest country in the Western
Hemisphere, ranking in the bottom quartile of the United Nations Development Program
(UNDP) Human Development Index.
At a high level donor conference in New York in March, the government presented its
National Action Plan for Recovery and Development to build a better Haiti. The plan
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

aims at sustainably raising medium-term growth and reducing poverty by creating
decentralized economic growth poles, reducing vulnerability to natural disasters,
enhancing access to basic social services, and strengthening state institutions. Donors
generously pledged US$9.9 billion in support of Haiti’s reconstruction, of which
US$5.3 billion are to be disbursed over the next 18 months. Although actual
disbursements so far have been slow, external aid related to the reconstruction could
triple as a share of GDP over the next 3-5 years.
A recovery in economic activity, led by a rebound in agriculture, construction (including
debris removal), and textile manufacturing, is mitigating the GDP decline (projected at
8.5 percent for the fiscal year ending in September 2010). Twelve month inflation
reached 6.4 percent in May, in line with a projected increase of 8.5 percent for the year.
The gourde has remained broadly stable since end-January, as the BRH has stepped
up its net foreign exchange purchases. NIR grew to US$646 million at end-May (from
US$402 million at end-December). A recovery in revenue collection since January and
weak spending have compensated for slow budget support disbursements. However,
priority spending on relocation of families, education, energy, and transport
infrastructure should pick up in the coming months. To maintain financial sector stability
and restart credit, the central bank is launching a partial credit guarantee scheme, with
technical support from the IMF and the World Bank.

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors broadly agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They noted that
the January 2010 earthquake represented a major setback for Haiti, after several years
of improved economic performance. Directors commended the authorities for quickly
restoring basic government functions and maintaining sound policies in the very difficult
conditions following the earthquake. They welcomed the incipient economic recovery,
and stressed that swift disbursement of the resources pledged by donors for
reconstruction and steady implementation of the economic program will be crucial to
sustain growth.
Directors praised the authorities for their determination to build a better Haiti in the
aftermath of the earthquake. They welcomed the authorities’ National Action Plan for
Recovery and Development and agreed that the priorities outlined in the Plan should
guide the reconstruction process. Directors also noted that, in the context of severe
capacity constraints, the successful implementation of the Action Plan will require close
coordination by the Interim Haitian Reconstruction Commission.
Directors agreed that securing adequate budget support from donors is essential to fund
priority programs. They welcomed the authorities’ commitment to further strengthen
revenue administration and reform tax policy to enhance domestic resource generation.
Directors also welcomed the authorities’ efforts to prioritize and align spending with
reconstruction priorities, and to improve the tracking and reporting of public spending.
Directors stressed that further improvements in the monetary framework will be critical to
enhancing the effectiveness of monetary policy. They welcomed plans to accelerate
foreign exchange auctions reform, introduce Treasury bills, and recapitalize the central
bank. Directors also noted staff’s assessment that the exchange rate is broadly in line

with economic fundamentals and underscored that additional exchange rate flexibility
will help ensure the absorption of aid inflows while avoiding inflationary pressures.
Directors concurred that steadfast improvements in the business climate and in
governance are required to boost investment and private credit, reduce supply-side
bottlenecks, and expand the export base. They welcomed the implementation of the
Partial Credit Guarantee scheme as an important step to restart private sector activity
and noted that the successful decentralization of economic activity will require strong
partnerships with the private sector.
Directors agreed that the new three-year ECF-supported program provides an important
anchor to the authorities’ economic policies and donor support in the context of the
reconstruction process. The program provides a coherent set of macroeconomic policies
that will support the authorities’ reconstruction and growth objectives, including by
smoothing out the impact on the economy of large expected aid inflows. The program is
supported by a comprehensive medium-term technical assistance strategy focused on
strengthening state institutions.
Directors agreed that Haiti met the eligibility and qualification criteria for debt stock relief
under the PCDR Trust Fund. They noted that debt relief from the Fund and other
creditors would free vital resources to alleviate Haiti’s protracted balance-of-payments
needs, which have been exacerbated by the earthquake. Given Haiti’s persistent high debt
vulnerabilities, Directors emphasized that future financing needs should be covered mostly
through grants and highly concessional financing.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Haiti will be held in accordance
with the Executive Board decision on the consultation cycle for members with Fund
arrangements.

IMF Executive Board Cancels Haiti’s Debt and Approves New Three-Year Program to
Support Reconstruction and Economic Growth
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved the full
cancellation of Haiti’s outstanding liabilities to the Fund, of about SDR 178 million
(equivalent to US$268 million). The Board also approved a new three-year arrangement for
Haiti under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) requested by the authorities to support the
country’s reconstruction and growth program.
Both decisions form part of a broad strategy to support Haiti’s longer term reconstruction
plans, following the devastating earthquake of January 12, 2010. The cancellation of existing
debt was advocated by IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn in the days
following the disaster as part of a concerted international effort to launch a “Marshall Plan”
for the reconstruction of the country. The new program provides a strong and forwardlooking framework to support economic stability and reconstruction in the country, and will
also help catalyze donors’ contributions.
“Donors must start delivering on their promises to Haiti quickly,” Mr. Strauss-Kahn said, “so
reconstruction can be accelerated, living standards quickly improved, and social tensions
soothed.” At a high-level donors' conference in March, the international community pledged
US$ 9.9 billion to Haiti’s reconstruction, of which US$ 5.3 billion is to be disbursed over the
next 18 months.
Resources freed by IMF debt relief will help Haiti to meet substantial balance-of-payments
needs exacerbated by the earthquake. The debt relief is financed by the Post-Catastrophe
Debt Relief (PCDR) Trust Fund, recently established by the Fund to help very poor countries
hit by catastrophic natural disasters (see attached factsheet).
The new ECF arrangement will provide SDR 40.9 million (about US$ 60 million) over three
years to boost Haiti’s international reserves and help the central bank manage potential
swings in the value of the local currency - important to avoid raises in the prices of basic
commodities consumed by the poor - without adding to the country’s net debt. Financing
under the ECF carries a zero interest rate until end-2011 and thereafter zero to 0.5 percent,
with a maturity of 10 years and a grace period of 5½ years. The temporary interest waiver is

2

part of the package that was approved in July 2009 to support the IMF’s lending to lowincome countries, financed from the IMF’s internal resources, including the use of resources
linked to the gold sales, and through bilateral contributions (see Factsheet “Financing the
Fund’s Concessional Lending to Low-Income Countries”). The new program also includes
important policy commitments from the authorities that will help protect macroeconomic
stability, and strengthen fiscal governance.
“The new program will provide a coherent macroeconomic framework to support the
implementation of our Action Plan and ensure efficient spending and absorption of aid
inflows,” Haiti’s Minister of Economy and Finance Ronald Baudin said.
Technical Assistance
The IMF will also provide a comprehensive medium-term technical assistance program
aimed at strengthening state institutions, concentrating in the areas of tax policies, revenue
administration, budget preparation and execution, and helping the country in organizing its
first ever issuance of government securities.
“Improving the business environment and fostering private credit and investment will be
essential to support growth,” Charles Castel, Governor of the Bank of the Republic of Haiti
said. “The Fund’s technical assistance will help rebuild economic institutions and build
capacity.”
Following the Executive Board discussion on Haiti, Mr. Naoyuki Shinohara Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair, issued the following statement:
“The January 2010 earthquake was devastating for Haiti, after several years of progress in
maintaining economic stability, resuming growth, and implementing essential reforms. The
authorities are to be commended for good policy implementation in the six-month period
since the earthquake, in spite of limited financial resources and weakened capacity.
“Haiti meets the eligibility and qualification conditions for debt stock relief under the PCDR
Trust Fund. Resources freed by debt stock relief under the PCDR Trust Fund are critical to
meeting the large and protracted balance-of-payments needs exacerbated by the earthquake
and subsequent recovery efforts, and to placing Haiti's debt on a sustainable path. Debt relief
from the Fund is part of a concerted international effort to cancel Haiti's remaining debt after
the earthquake.
“The newly approved ECF-supported arrangement provides a coherent macroeconomic
framework to support the authorities' reconstruction and growth objectives. The
macroeconomic outlook, and implementation of the authorities' reconstruction plan, depends
crucially on the timely disbursement of the large donor pledges. Furthermore, improvements
in infrastructure and the business environment will be essential to raise medium-term growth,

3

by attracting private investment and expanding the export base. The establishment of a partial
credit guarantee fund will help restart private sector credit
“The Fund-supported program aims at smoothing the impact on the economy of large
expected aid flows, projected to triple to about 15 percent of GDP over in the next 3 years.
Fiscal objectives are to raise domestic revenue, align the budget and its financing with
reconstruction priorities, and continue strengthening fiscal governance. Monetary and
exchange rate policies will be upgraded to facilitate the absorption of aid inflows, while
avoiding large swings in the exchange rate and keeping inflation under control The program
is supported by a comprehensive medium term technical assistance strategy, coordinated with
Haiti's development partners.”
ANNEX
Recent Economic Developments
The earthquake of January 12, 2010 caused unprecedented destruction of human and physical
capital, with losses estimated at 120 percent of 2009 GDP. The disaster struck the country at
a time when its outlook was improving after several years of prudent macroeconomic
management. In 2009, Haiti’s growth reached almost 3 percent, the second-fastest rate in the
Western Hemisphere.
A still fragile recovery is taking place after the earthquake. Agricultural production,
construction and textile manufacturing are supporting economic activity, while remittances,
which grew by 12 percent between January and May of 2010 (over the previous year), are
supporting consumption and imports. Exports are recovering, although the trade deficit is still
widening.
Main Program Objectives
The program is focused on macroeconomic policies that can support growth and the Haitian
authorities’ reconstruction plan, as well as help manage the aid inflows. It includes
improving the efficiency and transparency of spending, increasing revenues, modernizing
monetary and exchange rate operations, and enhancing credit growth.
Growth: GDP is projected to expand by 9 percent in fiscal year 2011-12, due mostly to
reconstruction activity, and 6 percent by 2015.
Inflation: expected to reach 8.5 percent in the current fiscal year and to decline to 7 percent
by 2013.
Fiscal strategy: to boost revenue collection to 13 percent of GDP by 2013, from 10%
percent currently. The authorities’ objective is to enhance the quality and effectiveness of
reconstruction spending and rebuild a more modern and efficient tax administration.

4

Monetary policy: the program aims at building a sustainable external position while
absorbing the reconstruction-related foreign exchange flows. To enhance the effectiveness of
monetary policy, further steps will be taken to improve the Bank of the Republic of Haiti’s
independence. The authorities also aim at gradually developing a market for government
securities.
