CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
January 13, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context: Almost nine years after the end of the conflict, the Central African Republic
(C.A.R.) continues to grapple with the challenges of a fragile state with low capacity and
formidable obstacles to economic take-off. Growth remained low, barely exceeding
population growth and, with limited fiscal space for investment in social programs and
public services, poverty is pervasive and social indicators are weak.
Perspectives: The growth and inflation outlooks are favorable as risks and
uncertainties related to the domestic environment have subsided. Growth is projected
to reach 4.1 percent in 2012 and accelerate to over 5 percent by 2014 on the back of
continued strong performance of the primary sector and major investments in the
mining sector. Increased agricultural production would reduce inflationary pressures,
with consumer price inflation remaining below 3 percent. However, the ongoing global
crisis, particularly in the Euro area could dampen the growth prospects and frustrate
the authorities’ efforts at restoring fiscal sustainability.
Near- and medium-term challenges: In the near term, there is a need to regain
control of budget execution and restore fiscal discipline to allay governance concerns
following the fiscal slippages in 2010 and early 2011. Staff and the authorities agreed
on the need to consolidate the fiscal position in 2012 and align expenditures with
available resources. Going forward, the main challenge is to create fiscal space for
poverty reduction and investment in infrastructure through stronger domestic resource
mobilization and prioritization of government expenditures. With C.A.R. very
dependent on external assistance, another challenge is to improve public financial
management (PFM) and governance, and strengthen capacity and institutions to
ensure efficient use of public resources.
Longer-term challenge: A longer-term challenge is to promote sustained high growth
and ensure diversification of the economy, which will require scaling up investment in
basic infrastructures and improving competitiveness.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

INTRODUCTION
1.
The Central African Republic (C.A.R.)
continues to grapple with the challenges of
a fragile post-conflict state. Macroeconomic
performance has been broadly satisfactory
since the conflict ended in 2003, but growth
remained modest and well below the averages
for sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and other fragile
states (Text Table 1). Insufficient domestic and
external resources, deep-rooted structural
deficiencies, weak institutional capacity, and
the lack of diversification of the economy are
hampering economic take-off and poverty
reduction.
2.
Domestic resource mobilization is
low making the economy highly dependent
on external assistance. Despite sustained
efforts at strengthening revenue
administration over the past several years
under Fund-supported programs, C.A.R. has
one of the lowest domestic revenue-to-GDP
ratios in SSA. At less than 10 percent of GDP, it
barely covers current expenditures, limiting
investment in basic infrastructures
(Text Table 2). As a result, C.A.R. is dependent
donor assistance, which has been quite
volatile.
3.
Poverty is pervasive and social
indicators are weak (Box 1). C.A.R. has one of
the highest poverty rates in SSA at 63 percent,
and it is unlikely to meet any of the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. The
human development indicators, while
characteristic of a post-conflict and fragile
state, are particularly weak when compared to
other low-income SSA countries, and some
indicators have deteriorated (Figure 1).

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 1. Central African Republic and the MDGs: Falling Far Behind
Social indicators place the C.A.R. among the least
developed countries in the world. The 2011 UNDP
Human Development Report ranks the C.A.R. near
the bottom of its Human Development Index (HDI)
(179 out of 187 countries). In 2010, it scored 0.34 in
the UNDP HDI, well below the SSA average of 0.39.
C.A.R. is unlikely to achieve the MDGs by 2015.
The public provision of basic social services has been
limited and inequitable. For example, the poorest
20 percent of households benefit from only
8 percent of public expenditure on primary
education. Also, certain (implicit) subsidies, such as
for fuel and electricity, are mostly benefitting the
richest segment of the population.

While education provision has increased in
recent years, its quality is generally poor, and
more than 40 percent of teachers are untrained
community teachers, hired directly by families.
Several health indicators reflect the high poverty
in C.A.R.: Life expectancy has fallen from 50 years in
the 1990s to 45 years in 2007; maternal mortality,
estimated at 850 per 100,000 live births in 2009,
remains very high; the HIV/AIDS prevalence rate, at
6.3 percent for the 15–49 age group in 2005, is high
although considerably below the double-digit rates
found in a number of southern African countries;
and maternal and infant mortality rates have been
increasing.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
A. Recent Developments

5.
The fiscal accounts deteriorated
sharply in 2010 (Tables 2 and 3). Reversing
hard-won gains under the ECF-supported
program, fiscal discipline weakened in 2010
and early 2011 with the resulting slippages
raising serious governance concerns that
prompted donors to suspend budget support.1
Fiscal imbalances widened and payment
arrears were accumulated to domestic

A July 2011 staff mission to negotiate a successor
ECF arrangement found that large payments (about
5 percent of GDP) were made by the Treasury outside
normal expenditure procedures.

suppliers and external creditors. Domestic
revenue in 2010 benefitted from a number of
one-off effects and reached 11.6 percent of
GDP. But expenditures, spurred by electionrelated spending, soared to 19.4 percent of
GDP, resulting in a widening of the overall
deficit (Figures 2 and 4).

4.
Macroeconomic performance in
2010 and 2011 was mixed. As a result of a
rebound of agricultural production in 2010 and
contained world oil prices, real GDP growth
reached 3.3 percent—somewhat higher than
population growth—and average inflation was
held down at 1.5 percent (Table 1 and
Figure 3). For 2011, economic growth has been
weaker than anticipated as the expected
recovery in domestic demand after the
prolonged electoral period did not materialize.
Moreover, due to post-election uncertainties,
major investments in the mining sector and oil
exploration in the troubled Northeast of the
country were delayed. Thus, despite stronger
agricultural production and a recovery in
external demand for wood products and
diamonds, economic growth is estimated to
have decelerated to 3.1 percent. Average
inflation continued its downward trend since
peaking in 2008 and fell to 0.7 percent, owing
to increased local food stuff production and
depressed domestic demand.

6.
The tight liquidity situation would
lead to a somewhat better fiscal outcome in
2011. Suspension of budget support by
donors and lower domestic revenue gave rise
to a very tight fiscal situation and intensified
the liquidity constraints. This prompted the
government to curtail expenditures, which are
projected to decrease to 17.7 percent of GDP,
thus reducing the overall fiscal deficit
(excluding grants) by 1.2 percentage points to
6.5 percent of GDP. However, the domestic
primary deficit and overall deficit including
grants would increase significantly because of
higher domestically-financed investment and
lower donor support.

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

7.
Monetary aggregates expanded in
2010–11, but provided little support to
growth (Table 4 and Figure 5). After a slight
decline in 2009, credit to the economy grew
rapidly in 2010 and is projected to grow
further in 2011. Nonetheless, financial
intermediation remains very low. By end-2011
credit to the economy in C.A.R. is projected to
reach 10.9 percent of GDP compared to
averages of 14.7 and 40.5 percent for fragile
SSA countries and SSA, respectively. The
agriculture sector—one of the main driver of
growth in C.A.R.—receives little bank financing.
8.
The external position remains fragile
(Table 5 and Figure 6). Despite a volume-

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

driven strong export performance, the external
position weakened in 2010 with the current
account deficit widening to about 10 percent
of GDP, partly reflecting a surge in imports
prices, particularly oil. Gross official reserves
fell only marginally as foreign direct
investment (FDI) inflows increased significantly.
In 2011, the current account deficit is projected
to decline to 7.2 percent of GDP on account of
an improvement in the terms of trade.
However, as a result of lower foreign capital
inflows, international reserves are expected to
fall to 2.7 months of goods and services
imports.

B. Medium-term Outlook and Risks
9.
Growth prospects for 2012 are
favorable. With the elections-related
uncertainties subsiding and the security
situation improving, real GDP growth is
projected to reach 4.1 percent in 2012, mainly
reflecting sustained agricultural production
and stronger livestock and forestry activities.
Improved security in the countryside should
facilitate implementation of key projects to
further support agricultural production.
10.
Consumer prices would continue to
trend down. Inflation would be contained at
2.5 percent, partly thanks to moderating food
prices2 on account of improved agricultural
production.
11.
The fiscal position is projected to
improve on substantially strengthened
expenditure control. The 2012 budget
approved by parliament on

December 29, 2011 aims at further reducing
current primary expenditures to 10.9 percent
of GDP following similar efforts in 2011.
However, capital expenditures are budgeted at
10.6 percent of GDP, assuming project
financing by donors of 8.1 percent of GDP,
which appears unrealistic. Staff projects a more
realistic path starting with some fiscal
consolidation in 2012 and targets the overall
deficit, including grants, as anchor to allow
room for donor financing. A Donor Roundtable
would be held in February 2012 in Bangui to
mobilize financing for the Program of Priority
Actions identified in the second generation
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP II)
adopted in November 24, 2011. The PRSP II
has three inter-dependent strategic pillars:
(i) Consolidation of peace, governance and the
legally constituted state; (ii) Economic revival
and regional integration; and (iii) Development
of human capital and essential social services.

Food items represent 70 percent of the consumer
price index; prices are driven mainly by domestic
supply conditions, rather than imported food prices.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 7

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

12.
Overall credit to the economy is
expected to moderate. However, the
projected steady decline in credit to the
government should provide some room for
private sector credit, to remain strong.
13.
External accounts are expected to
improve in 2012. The external current account
deficit is projected to decrease further to
6.8 percent of GDP, in line with a resumption
of donor assistance.
14.
The medium-term macroeconomic
framework assumes acceleration of growth
in a stable price environment (Text Table 3).
Growth is expected to pick up to over
5 percent by 2014, underpinned by strong
investment and a recovery in the
manufacturing sector (cement and sugar mills).
Inflation will remain below the regional
convergence criterion of 3 percent. Reserve
coverage is projected to remain above
3 months of imports, as the external current
account deficit reverts to the historical level of
5 percent of GDP helped by the reengagement
of C.A.R.’s traditional donors and a recovery in
FDI. Public debt is expected to remain below
40 percent of GDP. The medium-term
macroeconomic framework will be updated in
light of the outcome of the February 2012
Donor Roundtable.
15.
Risks to the outlook are on the
downside. Staff concurred with the authorities
that poor weather conditions, delays in public
and planned private investments, including in
mining, and recurrence of political uncertainty
and insecurity in parts of the country would
delay the economic recovery. Also, further
accumulation of domestic payment arrears
would weigh heavily on the growth prospects.
Price developments would be affected by

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

domestic food supply conditions and
international oil prices.
16.
The ongoing crisis in Europe could
further cloud the outlook. Europe is C.A.R.’s
major trading partner. An intensification of the
current debt crisis in the Euro area could
weaken demand for its exports and further
delay the economic recovery expected in 2012.
With no room for countercyclical response, the
fiscal deficit would widen, underscoring the
need for improved PFM to secure muchneeded donor support.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

ISSUES OF DISCUSSION
The immediate challenge is to quickly restore fiscal discipline and strengthen budget
execution to address the fiscal slippages of 2010 and early 2011. Near- and mediumterm challenges are to (i) create fiscal space to meet critical needs; (ii) strengthen
institutional capacity to support the reform agenda; and (iii) accelerate structural reforms
to improve external competitiveness and support sustained growth.

A. Mobilizing Domestic Resources for Poverty Reduction
Background
17.
Revenue performance in C.A.R. has
consistently been about 2 percentage
points below the tax potential during
1990–2010 (Box 2). This is the key finding of
analytical work prepared by staff on C.A.R.’s
tax potential. It indicates the range of
improvement in revenue that could be
realistically expected going forward. Failure to
pass through world oil prices to domestic
petroleum prices in 2011 entailed significant
fiscal losses and direct subsidies (Box 3).
18.
Efforts at revenue mobilization
were not sustained. A number of measures
adopted under the ECF-supported program
yielded notable gains, but were not pursued
during the electoral period. Also,
implementation of TA recommendations on
revenue administration stalled.
Staff’s advice
19.
Domestic revenue mobilization
should be given top priority. Based on the
study of C.A.R.’s tax potential, staff urged the
authorities to effectively implement a
comprehensive tax policy and customs
administration reform aimed at improving the
efficiency of taxation while broadening the tax
net. FAD provided substantive technical

assistance and recommended, in particular, a
fundamental review of the tax system (to
simplify the personal income tax system,
streamline the corporate tax systems, and tax
more effectively small businesses) and a
reform of the customs administration (to
reduce exemptions and concentrate customs
clearance at the points of entry).
20.
Adjustment of domestic petroleum
prices would provide an immediate boost
to revenue. Given the revenue loss
experienced to date and increasing subsidies
to be borne by the government on account of
the current petroleum pricing, staff
recommended implementation, at monthly
intervals, of the automatic adjustment
mechanism of domestic petroleum prices,
based on the current pricing formula to
eliminate consumer subsidies and safeguard
the 2012 fiscal framework. Staff further
recommended targeted fiscal measures, e.g.
subsidies for urban bus transportation or
possibly direct subsidies to the most
vulnerable segments of the population,
instead of the general oil subsidies that
benefit mostly the better-off.
21.
Strengthening PFM and enhancing
transparency in the use of public funds is
also necessary. Fiscal slippages and delays in
public financial management reforms led

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 9

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

donors to withhold planned budget support.
Staff encouraged the authorities to restore
the centrality of the budget in the PFM
process and prioritize expenditures while
making public spending more effective and
transparent. In particular, there is a need to
(i) adhere strictly to the established
expenditure procedures; (ii) establish monthly
cash flow plans and commit expenditures
based on these plans; (iii) pay only
expenditure duly processed through the
computerized information system (Gesco);
and (iv) operationalize the liquidity
management committee.
Authorities’ views
22.
The authorities agreed on the need
to increase domestic revenue mobilization.
They recognized that revenue mobilization is
particularly challenging even compared to
other fragile post-conflict countries in SSA as
conflict in C.A.R. is continuing with some areas
of the country under the control of rebel
groups.3 They also indicated that resumption
of donor support would enhance capacity and
accelerate the reforms being implemented to
strengthen revenue mobilization.

The Lord Resistance Army (from Uganda) and
another rebel group (from Chad) have bases in C.A.R.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23.
The authorities committed to
adjusting domestic petroleum prices on a
regular basis. However, they indicated that
the 2008 pricing structure was outdated and
needed streamlining to lessen the steep price
adjustments that would ensue. They also
indicated that such work was well underway,
making it possible to implement that measure
in early 2012 in the context of the budget
submitted to parliament. The authorities
recognized the importance of targeted
measures to facilitate acceptability and
mitigate the social impact of the petroleum
price adjustments on the most vulnerable
groups, including civil servants whose career
advancement had been frozen since 2004.

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 2. Central African Republic: Domestic Revenue Mobilization Needs to Be Stepped Up
The C.A.R. has one of the lowest revenue-to-GDP
ratios of SSA countries. Over the last two decades,
the revenue-to-GDP ratio has averaged
9.2 percent—far below the averages for SSA
countries, SSA fragile states, and the 14 Franc zone
countries.
Analytical work on the C.A.R.’s revenue
performance indicates that traditional
determinants of revenue mobilization reported in
the literature are valid also for C.A.R., namely:
 Revenue collection increases with income,
openness, demand for public goods and
services, and a strong institutional environment
with checks and balances.
 Prevalence of the primary sector in the
economy has a negative impact on the revenueto-GDP ratio.
The study also found CAR-specific factors at play:
 Revenue performance improved under
Fund-supported programs.
 Aid inflows appear associated with lower
revenue collection.
The methodology used in the study was to assess
the tax potential of the C.A.R. given its economic
structure and to compare it with the averages for
SSA countries and other selected groupings. For
this purpose, we formed a panel dataset covering
32 SSA countries from 1990 to 2010 and estimated
the determinants of revenue-to-GDP ratios to infer
the potential revenue for C.A.R.
The main finding of the study shows that C.A.R.’s
revenue potential has consistently been low and
well below the averages for SSA countries. This
reflects weak economic fundamentals with difficultto-tax sectors (agriculture in particular). During
1990–2010, the tax potential for C.A.R. hovered at
about 11 percent of GDP, 4 percentage points below
the estimate for SSA.

Actual revenue collection averaged 9.2 percent of
GDP during the period, or just 84 percent of C.A.R.’s
potential, leaving scope for the C.A.R. to raise
revenue by about 1.8 percentage points of GDP. On
the other hand, actual revenue collection for the SSA
sample has been above the potential of 15 percent
of GDP. These findings are consistent with Sen Gupta
(2007)1 and should be interpreted with caution as
the methodology focuses on revenue effort
compared to the potential which is determined by
the fundamentals of the economy. Although above
potential, the actual revenue-to-GDP ratio of the
sample significantly lags the averages of other
developing regions.

Levying tax on goods and services, and income
and profit tax are the areas where C.A.R.
underperformed, suggesting efficiency problems
with the tax administration. Until the structural
transformation of the C.A.R. economy needed to
increase the tax potential takes place, efforts to raise
the revenue-to-GDP ratio should focus on tax
administration reforms to broaden the tax base and
improve efficiency. Based on the experience in 2009–
10, taxation of petroleum products (and passthrough of world oil prices to domestic prices)
constitutes a source to raise government revenue
(see Box 3).

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

Box 3. Central African Republic: The Case for Petroleum Price Adjustment
The automatic price adjustment formula for
petroleum product prices was a key reform
measure under the past ECF arrangement. Faced
with rising subsidies on fuel consumption, the
government implemented in June 2008, as prior
action under the second review of the ECF
arrangement (2006–10), an automatic quarterly
petroleum pricing formula that ensures full passthrough to the consumer of world oil prices and
taxes. The measure then became a continuous
structural benchmark under the program and
contributed to significant increases in domestic
revenue in 2008–09.

However, the mechanism was intermittently
applied, resulting in loss of revenue and costly
subsidies. Since the introduction of the reform,
international oil prices almost doubled, but domestic
pump prices were adjusted only three times and

automaticity was abandoned, resulting each time in
difficult political decision-making.
The measure was again made a prior action in the
context of the sixth ECF review and pump prices
were adjusted in May 2010; they have since then
remained frozen. As a result, the revenue loss in
2011 as a whole is estimated at CFAF 8.1 billion
(0.8 percent of GDP) based on the 2008 pricing
structure, and direct subsidies reached
CFAF 3.6 billion; these subsidies have to be repaid
directly to the marketers.
Full pass-through will eliminate the subsidies and
bring in additional revenue. Staff estimates that in
2012, using WEO oil prices and the 2008 pricing
structure, additional revenue of up to 1.3 percent of
GDP could be generated. This is predicated on truly
automatic adjustments on a monthly basis, thus
depoliticizing petroleum pricing and safeguarding
the revenue objective.
Well targeted social measures need to be put in
place. Staff and the authorities recognize the passthrough could potential negative impact of the on
the most vulnerable group of consumers.
Accordingly, the authorities will introduce mitigating
social measures, e.g., improving product distribution
in the countywide, subsidizing public transportation,
or considering well-targeted cash transfers.

B. Strengthening Institutional Capacity
Background
24.
Capacity constraints are prevalent.
As a fragile state, C.A.R. is confronted with
weak administrative capacity and institutions,
which constrain economic management and
resource absorption. High turnover of trained
staff also limits the effectiveness of capacity
building.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25.
The new government held a national
forum aimed at marshalling support for the
reform agenda. In response to the challenges
in getting a hold on reform strategies, improve
PFM, and restore budget transparency,
inclusive discussions were held in September
in the context of a national forum on public
finances (NFPF). The forum allowed
stocktaking of existing reform strategies and
provided new impetus for action.

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Staff’s advice

Authorities’ views

26.
Administrative capacity and
institutions in all areas of the public sector
need to be strengthened in a durable way.
Staff underscored the importance of
enhancing donor coordination and leverage
TA resources to maximize synergies, and
increase the effectiveness of TA and capacity
building. In this connection, staff welcomed
the focus of the PRSP II on forming human
capital and improving access to social services.
Staff and the authorities agreed that posting
resident advisors could help foster capacity
building.

28.
The authorities agreed on the need
to build capacity and institutions. They
pointed to their recent decisions reviving and
strengthening the committees in charge of
liquidity management and monitoring
macroeconomic developments and structural
reforms. A Technical Unit has also been set up
to assist the latter committee, which is chaired
by the Prime Minister. Additional measures are
being put in place to improve budget
execution, including preparing monthly cash
flow projections and weekly monitoring of
expenditure commitments.

27.
Efficient public debt management is
critical. Staff pointed to the unhealthy practice
of relying on expensive bank overdraft facilities
to finance current expenditures and not
involving the debt unit in loan negotiations as
evidence of weaknesses in the institutional and
legal framework for debt and liquidity
management. Staff urged the authorities to
strengthen the debt management unit, which
would ensure that all new debts are consistent
with debt sustainability. Staff indicated that the
accumulation of payment arrears to Paris Club
creditors and multilateral institutions as further
evidence of weaknesses in debt management
and called for the clearance of these arrears.

29.
The authorities reiterated their
commitment to intensify PFM reforms. They
indicated that the NFPF’s recommendations
are in line with existing donor-supported PFM
reform programs, which they intend to
accelerate. To this end, they stressed the need
for a Fund-supported program to anchor their
reform programs and catalyze donor support,
both financial and technical.
30.
The authorities acknowledged the
need to strengthen debt management. They
also set up a National Committee on Public
Debt under the chairmanship of the Minister
of Finance, who has sole authority to
financially commit the State. They also
indicated that the debt unit will be
strengthened through proper staffing and
capacity building.

C. Maintaining External Stability and Diversifying the Economy
Background
31.
Assessment of C.A.R.’s real effective
exchange rate (REER) suggests an
overvaluation above the average level of
the monetary union (Appendix I). The union’s

REER, current account and reserves have been
assessed by staff as consistent with external
stability (SM/11/163, July 6, 2011). C.A.R.
therefore needs to implement structural
reforms to foster competitiveness, particularly
non-price competitiveness. The main challenge

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 13

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

is to address the unfriendly business
environment and tax climate, inadequate
infrastructure, and persisting security problems
in the countryside.
Staff’s advice
32.
Reforms to improve the business
environment should be broadened and
accelerated. The International Finance
Corporation has made recommendations to
help attract investment in agriculture and
mining, the main sources of future growth.
Sustained implementation of these
recommendations would stimulate growth and
expand job opportunities. Private sector
activity is constrained by ill-coordinated tax
controls, which need to be addressed.
Sustained sound macroeconomic policies
would also help promote private sector
development.
33.
Fostering competitiveness in all
areas is needed. Staff noted that low
productivity, deficient transport and electricity
generation, and a difficult regional trade
environment all weigh on domestic costs and
competitiveness of the economy. While
addressing these would take time, staff
pointed to immediate measures that could
improve market efficiency and reduce costs.
These include (i) opening bidding procedures
for major procurements and investment
decisions, (ii) lessening entry costs in the
transport sector, and (iii) attempts to reduce
the size of the informal sector through a series
outreach campaign. Improving and effectively
implementing anti-money laundering and
combating the financing of terrorism
regulations in the artisanal gold and diamond
mining sectors could potentially increase
government revenue.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

34.
Project management should be
improved. Building on the findings of a recent
public expenditure review by the World Bank,
procedures need streamlining and bottlenecks
to project implementation have to be removed
to increase absorption capacity to secure
continued financing from the World Bank and
the African Development Bank (AfDB).
Authorities’ views
35.
The authorities indicated that the
currency peg to the euro has served C.A.R.
well. They reaffirmed their commitment to
implementing the structural reforms needed to
foster competitiveness and enhance C.A.R.’s
contribution to the external stability of the
union.
36.
They consider deficient road
transportation and electricity generation as
the main impediments to investment and
growth. They pointed to the potential benefits
of surfacing the main road for exports to the
Cameroonian border, which is well underway
with assistance from the European Union and
AfDB, and of improving navigation on the
Oubangi River. Completion of these projects
would bring much-needed relief in the
medium term and contribute to develop
agricultural activities in the countryside. Lack
of power generation capacity is also a key
constraint, which cannot be addressed in the
absence of donor support.
37.
The authorities were concerned by
the recent setbacks in mining investments.
In particular, they were disappointed by one
mining company suspending its investment
plans for a prolonged period and one other
apparently unable to raise sufficient financing
for their plans, thus frustrating their strategy to

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

promote growth and make an entry into the
formal mining business on the global level.
38.
Efforts to streamline corporate
taxation are ongoing. Action to better
coordinate audits of big taxpayers is underway.
Dissatisfaction was voiced by large

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

corporations over duplicate controls by
competing institutions, including a private
company, which has an exclusive mandate.
Diamond collectors’ licenses that were revoked
in 2008 for non-observance of the mining
code have been reinstated, boosting the
production prospects.

OTHER ISSUES
39.
Implementation of past Fund advice
has been uneven. In concluding the last
Article IV consultation, Executive Directors
underscored the importance of (i) further
strengthening fiscal management; (ii) avoiding
contracting nonconcessional debt, and
(iii) reducing vulnerability in the banking
system while recapitalizing a problem bank.
The authorities indicated that capacity
constraints have limited progress with respect
to some recommendations.
40.
Commercial banks have been
recapitalized. All four private banks now meet
the regional minimum capital standard of
CFAF 5 billion. This includes an ailing bank, for
which a government bond has been issued to
dilute the former majority holder’s share. An
international bid was launched to select a new
strategic investor, but the authorities declared
it unsuccessful. Staff impressed on the
authorities to intensify their efforts to find a
strategic investor and divest their majority
stake.
41.
Financial indicators of the banking
system are stable (Table 6 and Box 4).
However, the methodology used by the
regional banking supervisor—Commission
bancaire d’Afrique centrale (COBAC)—does not
take into account the accumulation of
government payment arrears, which would
have required much higher provisioning for

banks’ exposure to sovereign debt. Loan losses
are decreasing and profitability is stable.
42.
The updated debt sustainability
analysis indicates that C.A.R. continues to
face a moderate risk of debt distress
(Appendix II). Although all debt indicators
remain below the policy-dependent
thresholds, C.A.R.’s debt position is vulnerable
to export shocks. In view of persistently weak
debt management capacity, commercial
borrowing is risky, calling for largely
concessional external financing to preserve
debt sustainability.
43.
Resources to collect statistical data
are insufficient. Price indices could not be
collected in July 2011 due to lack of financial
resources. Reliable statistics are essential for
macroeconomic monitoring. The authorities, in
coordination with donors, should ensure that
sufficient resources are made available to
collect consistent data series. Delays in
properly clearing accounts at the national
branch of the regional central bank have led to
problems in harmonizing and updating
monetary data.
44.
Key stakeholders shared staff and
authorities’ views on the challenges facing
C.A.R. Staff met representatives of the private
sector, civil society and the donor community,
and parliamentarians. Stakeholders concurred

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 15

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

with the importance of mobilizing domestic
revenues, partly through fuel taxation, and
strengthening PFM and governance.
Parliamentarians considered budgetary
support essential to alleviate the liquidity

constraints facing the government and set the
stage for strong growth to reduce poverty.

Box 4. Central African Republic: A Small but Growing Domestic Financial Sector
Although progressing, the domestic financial
sector plays a limited role in financing private
sector activities. Financial intermediation remains
shallow, with a limited number of institutions and a
heavy concentration in Bangui.
 C.A.R.’s financial system is small (total assets
are 17.6 percent of GDP at end-2010) and
heavily concentrated in four commercial banks,
representing 93 percent of the financial system’s
consolidated assets. Other financial institutions
include two insurance companies (4 percent of
assets) and eleven microfinance institutions
(3 percent of assets).

 The main sectors benefitting from bank
loans are trade and commerce (20 percent),
transport and communications (16 percent),
forestry (12 percent) and other services
(28 percent). The agriculture sector benefits only
4 percent of total loans.
Financial soundness indicators of the banking
sector provide a mixed picture. Commercial banks
increased their capital to the mandatory
CFAF 5 billion, but the banking system’s liquidity is
tightening, compliance with prudential regulations
remains poor and regulations are out of line with

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

international best practices. The predominant role of
the Government also represents a risk.
 The progressive increase of the commercial
banks’ statutory capital (71 percent y-o-y
increase in August 2011) increases the buffer
against shocks and helps comply with prudential
regulations, including those related to
connected lending and loan concentration.
 The banking system’s liquidity has tightened
considerably. Liquid assets to short-term
liabilities declined from 177 percent in 2009 to
96 percent in August 2011, and two banks failed
to comply with the liquidity requirement of
100 percent. Sight deposits remain the
commercial banks’ main source of financing
(56 percent of total liabilities), while time
deposits barely represent 13 percent of total
liabilities.
 Within the CEMAC region only Chad and
C.A.R. have (net) debts vis-à-vis the banking
sector. While declining in Chad the
government’s exposure to the banking sector in
C.A.R. has tripled between September 2010 and
September 2011, and represents 1.8 percent of
GDP.
 Restructuring of an ailing bank is
proceeding. The government temporarily
recapitalized the bank through Treasury bond
(CFAF 5.5 billion), thus holding 51 percent of the
share capital. Local shareholders also increased
their capital by CFAF 500 million. The
government’s disengagement from the bank is
delayed as the authorities declared unsuccessful
the bid launched to select a strategic investor,
despite interest by an international banking
group.

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

STAFF APPRAISAL
45.
C.A.R.’s economy has been resilient
and is set to recover over the medium term.
Strong response from the agricultural sector to
measures in the aftermath of the 2008–09 food
price shock was instrumental in sustaining
economic growth in the face of the
unfavorable global environment. To sustain
the recovery going forward, efforts should be
made to avoid further delays of major public
and private investments, including in the
mining sector. The expansion in agricultural
output needs to be sustained through
appropriate policies as security returns to the
countryside. This is essential to lessen the
inflationary pressures from international food
prices. Despite C.A.R.’s limited integration into
the global economy, the authorities are
encouraged to monitor the situation to detect
emerging vulnerabilities should the global
crisis intensify.
46.
Growth take-off over a long period
is critical for making progress towards
poverty reduction. Given the pervasive
poverty and dismal social indicators, steppedup efforts are needed to tap the country’s
natural endowment for economic take-off. This
requires a comprehensive and multidisciplinary
strategy as articulated in the PRSP II. Beside
supportive macroeconomic policies, C.A.R.
needs to (i) substantially increase investment
to address infrastructural gap, (ii) improve the
business climate, and (iii) deepen financial
intermediation.
47.
The fiscal slippages in 2010 have
dealt a setback to the hard-won gains under
the ECF-supported program. With the
electoral process now over and the lull on the
political and security fronts, full attention

should be given to macroeconomic
management and the respect of the rules and
regulations pertaining to PFM. In this regard, it
is important that accountability be enforced
and steps be taken to improve governance on
a durable basis.
48.
Efforts to restore budgetary
discipline and transparency are steps in the
right direction. The authorities need to
consolidate the recent progress by taking
concrete measures to ensure that the budget
is executed in line with the priorities approved
by parliament. It is important to ensure
effective implementation of the agreed
measures by a fully staffed coordination unit
with strong mandate.
49.
Membership in the monetary union,
has helped to cushion the impact of the
global crisis on C.A.R. It is imperative to
restore non-price competitiveness through
structural reforms aimed at improving the
business climate and addressing infrastructure
gap.
50.
An orderly framework for the
authorities’ reform is critical. The authorities’
intention to seek a Fund-supported program is
welcome. They need to forge ahead with the
pending measures to strengthen budget
execution and improve governance.
Implementation of the mechanism for
automatic adjustments, on a monthly basis, of
petroleum prices early in the year, together
with measures to strengthen revenue
administration, will safeguard the 2012 fiscal
framework and partly provide much-needed
resources for critical social and infrastructure
needs.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 17

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

51.
Management of public debt needs
to be strengthened. This is all the more
necessary given C.A.R.’s weak debt
management capacity and moderate risk of
debt distress. Contracting new debt on
concessional terms is critical to preserve debt
sustainability. Arrears on nonreschedulable
external debt should be cleared to help unlock
access to concessional financing consistent
with C.A.R.’s post-HIPC status.
52.
Adequate resources should be
devoted for data collection. The importance

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

of reliable data for economic management
cannot be overemphasized. The authorities are
encouraged to commit sufficient budgetary
resources to strengthen the statistical agency
and enable it to collect reliable data necessary
for macroeconomic analysis and program
monitoring.

recommends that the next Article IV

Specific loan loss provisions are excluded from the definition of capital. General loan loss provisions are included in Tier 2 capital up to an
amount equal to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets. Regulatory capital is the sum of Tier 1 capital and the minimum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital.

2

Risk-weighted assets are estimated using the following risk weights: 0% – cash reserves in domestic and foreign currency
and claims on the central bank and the government; 20% – claims on correspondent banks in foreign currency; 100% – all other assets.
3
Loan loss provisions are excluded from the definition of capital.
4
Total loans are the sum of claims on the economy net of claims on financial institutions, credits to nonresidents, and claims on government
net of treasury bonds and related instruments (bons d'équipement).
5

The ratio of after-tax profits to the average of beginning- and end-period total assets.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

Appendix I. External Stability Assessment and Competitiveness
Staff’s assessment of Central African Republic’s (C.A.R.) external sustainability and real
effective exchange rate (REER) suggests that, under current policies, the exchange rate is
overvalued by 12–30 percent, well within the margin of errors given the nature of the
exercise. Although the REER appreciation deviates from that of the region, staff concludes
that it has remained moderate and is congruent with regional external sustainability.
However, C.A.R.’s poor export performance and weak institutions underscore the need to
improve competitiveness.
1.
C.A.R.’s external stability is assessed
in the framework of a monetary union.
C.A.R., along with Cameroon, Chad, Republic of
Congo, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon, is a
member of a currency union CEMAC—
(Communauté économique et monétaire
d’Afrique centrale—and its currency (CFA franc)
is pegged to the Euro. The sustainability of the
union closely depends on the external stability
of individual countries. The extent to which
C.A.R. deviates from the regional assessment
sheds light on the policies necessary to secure
the regional peg and advance national
competitiveness.
2.
Developments in the REER. C.A.R.’s
REER has appreciated since 1994, eroding
competitiveness gained after the devaluation
of the CFA franc. However, this appreciation
closely tracked that of the CEMAC as a whole,
though moderately higher.
3.
Model-based assessment of the
REER. The assessment of C.A.R.’s external
sustainability is based on the current account
balance (CAB) appraisal. Standard
methodologies—macroeconomic balance (MB)
and the external sustainability (ES)
approaches—are used along with the elasticity
of the CAB with respect to the REER used for
the CEMAC’s most recent exchange rate
assessment.

4.
The MB approach calculates
exchange rate under- or overvaluation. This
approach measures the adjustment needed for
the RER to close the gap between the
projected medium-term CAB at the prevailing
REER and the current account norm that is
consistent with sustainable medium-term
macroeconomic fundamentals of the country.
The current account norm for the CEMAC is
derived from the model using the CGER
(Consultative Group on Exchange Rate issues)
Hybrid Pooled estimation and estimates by
Christiansen et al. (2009).1 Comparing this
norm to the medium-term current account
deficit of C.A.R. yields an overvaluation of its
implicit effective exchange rate of between
1

The last exchange rate assessment (see CEMAC staff
report—SM/11/163) used an elasticity of the CAB with
respect to the REER of 0.37.

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

12 and 30 percent, which is well with the
margin of errors. The ES approach—based on
stabilizing the C.A.R.’s 2015 net foreign assets
position at the 2010 level—points to an
overvaluation below 25 percent, which is also
well within the margin of errors.
5.
The appreciation of C.A.R.’s REER
appears, however, significant when
compared to the most recent regional
assessment where the appreciation was
evaluated to 3–10 percent (see Table below).
Given the high degree of uncertainty
surrounding these exercises and the data
limitations, staff concludes that the C.A.R.’s
REER is moderately appreciated but remain
congruent with the regional external position
sustainability.

Structural performance and
competitiveness
6.
C.A.R.’s mixed export performance
suggests there is room for improving
competitiveness. Between 2003 and 2010,
C.A.R.’s export growth averaged only
5.2 percent, far below the SSA or CEMAC
benchmarks of about 14.5 percent and
13.5 percent, respectively. Structural factors
have constrained competitiveness. C.A.R.
ranked 182 among 183 countries in the 2010

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

and 2011 Doing Business reports of the World
Bank, lagging particularly for indicators
relevant for export performance, and topic
rankings revealed backsliding in most respects.
Improving C.A.R.’s ranking on the doing
business indicators is an urgent challenge
(see Table below).

Significant reform measures are to
be put in place to improve the conditions
for private sector development. These are
also necessary to compensate for geographic
isolation, weak infrastructure, and persisting
security risks—with a view to inducing growthenhancing domestic and external private
investments in mining and manufacturing
industries.
8.
C.A.R. shares this challenge with
other CEMAC countries. The business climate
in most CEMAC countries is quite unfavorable.
In the regional context, an improvement in
C.A.R.’s security environment and business
climate is needed to exploit the economy’s
potential and compensate for its remoteness.
Some structural measures to improve the
business climate could be easily implemented;
for example the establishment of a one-stop
center for business registration. Progress
toward more stability and security should also
increase investor attraction.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Appendix II. Updated Debt Sustainability Analysis Using the Low-Income Country
Framework
This appendix provides an annual update to the debt sustainability analysis (DSA)
prepared in May 2010.1 Debt relief under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) at the completion point
in June 2009 has alleviated C.A.R.’s debt burden and the economy continues to face a
moderate risk of debt distress.2
1.
C.A.R.’s total public debt, including
domestic arrears increased markedly,
reaching 40 percent of GDP in 2011. This is,
well-above the projected level of 27 percent in
the 2010 DSA. The debt dynamic in 2010–11 is
driven by arrears accumulation on both
domestic and external debt and a steady rise
in external borrowing from Non-Paris Club
members to finance infrastructure projects and
social programs. In 2010–11, the C.A.R.
contracted concessional loans from India and
China for US$52.3 million (2.4 percent of GDP).
Accumulation of arrears on external debt
amounted US$9.8 million (0.5 percent of
GDP)—of which US$1.4 million is due to Paris
Club creditors and US$2.6 million to the
European Investment Bank, and the balance to
other Non-Paris Club creditors that have not
yet signed bilateral agreements with C.A.R.
Domestic debt accumulation amounted to
2.7 percent of GDP.
____________________________________________________
1

Full joint Bank-Fund LIC DSAs are prepared once
every three years, with short annual updates in the
intermediate years (Staff Guidance Note on the
Application of the Joint Fund-Bank Debt Sustainability
Framework for Low-Income Countries, SM/10/16).

2

All multilateral creditors with the exception of the
Central African Development Bank have provided
debt relief. Among Paris Club creditors, agreements
have been signed with Austria, Italy, Switzerland,
U.S.A., France, Germany, and Japan. For non-Paris
Club creditors, agreements have been signed with
Saudi Arabia, France Telecom, Assistance Publique des
Hôpitaux, and GERBER Company. Negotiations are
ongoing with other creditors.

2.
The macroeconomic assumptions in
the near to medium term for the updated
analysis are broadly in line with the
previous DSA. Growth is expected to
accelerate to around 5 percent per annum on
average on the back of scaled-up
infrastructures financed by concessional
external loans and foreign direct investment
(FDI) inflows. The external current account is
projected to remain steady as imports related
to oil and infrastructure projects would offset
rising exports. The fiscal stance is expected to
improve on account of increased revenue
mobilization and strong budget execution.
From 2021 onwards, major mining projects (oil
and uranium) would come on stream, boosting
growth and government revenue.
3.
As in the full DSA, this update
suggests that C.A.R. continues to face a
“moderate risk of debt distress”. Although
somewhat higher compared to last year
exercise, all baseline debt indicators remain
below the thresholds with stable downward
trends, but the debt position could still be
vulnerable to the most extreme shock to
exports, yielding the highest ratio by 2021.
Considering the fact that C.A.R. is categorized
as having “lower debt vulnerabilities and lower
capacity” under the debt sustainability
framework, high concessionality is required to
preserve debt sustainability.

Sources: Central African Republic authorities; and IMF estimates and projections.
1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
3/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
4/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments.
For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
5/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
6/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock import levels
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms at the completion
point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in NPV terms at the decision point.
Hence, these two amounts cannot be added.
3
Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point corresponding to
interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed during the interim period.
4
The MDRI provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member countries that qualified for the assistance. Grant
assistance from the MDRI Trust and HIPC resources provide debt relief to cover the full stock of debt owed to the
Fund as of end-2004 that remains outstanding at the time the member qualifies for such debt relief.

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

Safeguards Assessments:

The Bank of the Central African States (BEAC)
is the regional central bank of the Central
African States. The most recent safeguards
assessment of the BEAC was completed on July
6, 2009. The findings of this assessment
indicated that implementation of previous
safeguards recommendations on financial
reporting, internal audit, and internal control
was limited, and that the changing risk profile
of BEAC foreign exchange holdings required
further actions to strengthen safeguards at
BEAC.
Subsequent to revelation of Paris office fraud,
a series of measures and longer term
safeguard measures were agreed between the
IMF and BEAC in order to continue with
country programs. Consequently, BEAC
adopted an action plan for 2010 with the aims
of strengthening key safeguards. In addition
BEAC has recently adopted additional
measures to address the weaknesses
highlighted by the special audit on
headquarters operations and strengthen
governance.
Currently, CEMAC-country reviews are allowed
to proceed through end December 2011 (Staff
Note on BEAC Safeguards Concerns and

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Implications for Programs with CEMAC
Member Countries; FO/DIS/11/130).
XI.

Exchange Rate Arrangement

The C.A.R. participates in a currency union with
five other members of the CEMAC and has no
separate legal tender. The de facto exchange
rate arrangement is a conventional peg; the
CFA franc is officially pegged to the euro, the
intervention currency, at a fixed rate of
CFAF 655.957 per €1. On November 30, 2011,
the rate of the CFA franc in terms of SDRs was
SDR 1 = CFAF 758.5. The exchange system
common to all members operates without
restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions.
XII.

Article IV Consultations

The C.A.R. is currently on the standard
24-month cycle for Article IV consultations for
program countries. The last Article IV
consultation was concluded on
December 4, 2009.
XIII.

Resident Representative

The Fund’s office in Bangui reopened in
October 2007 (after being closed in
September 2003). The Resident Representative,
until end-November 2011, was
Joseph Ntamatungiro. A new Resident
Representative is being appointed.

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

APPENDIX II. RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
UNDER THE JOINT BANK-FUND WORK PROGRAM
(JMAP)
1.
The Fund C.A.R. team led by Mr. Toé
(mission chief) met with the World Bank
C.A.R. team led by Mr. Binkert (Country
Director) to identify critical structural reforms
and to coordinate the two teams’ work
programs for the period November 2011–
December 2012.
2.
C.A.R. is a fragile post-conflict
country. As pointed out in the evaluation of
the first generation Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (PRSP I; 2008–10) and the PRSP II (2011–
15) approved in November 2011, the country
still faces security challenges and has deeprooted structural weaknesses and important
social and infrastructural needs, which
represent significant hurdles to accelerating
growth and making adequate progress toward
the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
3.
C.A.R.’s debt position remains
vulnerable. Despite generous debt relief
granted at the time of the completion point
under HIPC and MDRI initiatives in June 2009,
preserving debt sustainability remains a
challenge, in view of continuing difficulties in
consistently managing domestic and external
debt.
4.
The teams agreed that C.A.R.’s main
macroeconomic challenges are to create
fiscal space, strengthen public financial
management (PFM), and improve policy
and project implementation capacity.
Consequently, their policy advice should aim at
(i) promoting prudent fiscal policies,
(ii) accelerating growth through efficient and
prioritized public investment and active
participation of the private sector,

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

(iii) deepening financial sector development,
(iv) improving human capital formation, and
(v) strengthening institutions, transparency
and governance.
5.
The authorities have expressed their
intention to request a new Extended Credit
Facility (ECF) arrangement from the Fund.
Repeated delays in negotiating such a
program, due to a collapse of budgetary
discipline and serious slippages in fiscal
performance are regrettable. The Fund stands
ready to initiate program negotiations after
completion of the 2011 Article IV consultation
expected for January 2012, based on the
authorities’ progress in implementing
corrective measures.
6.
Based on their common assessment,
the teams identified six structural reform
areas as macro-critical, in view of their central
role in achieving fiscal consolidation, sustained
growth, and poverty alleviation:


Financial resource mobilization: C.A.R.
has one of the lowest revenue-to-GDP
ratios in sub-Saharan Africa, and
contributions from external donors have
been uneven and declining as poor PFM
practices weigh in on donors’ financial
assistance. Maximizing domestic revenue
mobilization by expanding the tax base
and passing-through world oil prices to
domestic petroleum product prices in line
with the established pricing formula is
essential to creating the fiscal space
required for pro-poor spending and critical
infrastructure projects. Comprehensive
reform agendas, supported by well-

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

financed and coordinated multi-donor
efforts, have been laid out and await
forceful implementation by the authorities
in the areas of tax and customs
administrations.




PFM: Progress has been made in
computerizing and integrating the
expenditure chain, but fiscal discipline has
weakened during the protracted elections
process of 2010–11, resulting in significant
slippages and accumulation of domestic
and external payment arrears. The effective
use of the standard budget execution
procedure presents a number of
challenges, and PFM still needs further
adjustments to fully integrate all budgetary
transactions. Reforms to move toward a
more active liquidity programming and
management have slowed down, and
operating a single treasury account
requires continued attention. Technical
assistance is available for strengthening
budget execution and public accounting,
controls of tax expenditures, and cash flow
management capacity. Programming,
accounting, and reporting investment
spending remain particular challenges to
ensure effective use of available financing.
C.A.R. has finalized for the first time
government accounts for FY2008 with
World Bank assistance, improving
Parliamentarian oversight over budget
execution.
Social sector spending: The PRSP II
provides a blueprint for the quest for
additional resources at a development
partners’ Roundtable held in midJune 2011. It puts strong emphasis on
promoting agricultural production
underpinned by improved security in the
countryside and the expected resumption
of the protracted DDR process.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX



Investment climate reform: C.A.R. ranks
next to last in the Bank’s “Doing Business
2012 Index”. Making good use of the new
forestry and mining codes, adopted with
World Bank assistance, and eliminating
remaining uncertainties, including on
taxation, hold potential for a major upward
shift in long-term growth prospects
stemming from new mining projects.
Progress in strengthening the banking
sector and in developing market
instruments should contribute to more
effective financial intermediation.



Infrastructure investment and
rehabilitation of State-owned
enterprises (SOEs): The lack of
infrastructure and deficient public utilities,
including electricity, water, and
telecommunications, are a major drag on
investment, growth, and development.
Enhanced financial resource availability
from domestic and external sources, on
adequately concessional terms, for scaling
up public investment and improving
financial management of SOEs is essential
to address these deficiencies in the short
and longer term.



Debt management: C.A.R. was granted
HIPC/MDRI debt relief in 2009. At a time
when the authorities appeal to donors for
additional support, and considering the
country’s fragility and weak debt
management capacity (evidenced by the
recent Debt Management Performance
Analysis (DeMPA) exercise), recourse to
non-concessional borrowing appears illadvised, for the time-being. It could be
considered, at the time of reviews of a
future Fund-supported program, for
specific, well-defined infrastructure
projects. Adherence to the established
plan for domestic payment arrears

governance agenda by taking an active
role in the platform on PFM, and
supporting implementation of key reforms
in public procurement. The Fund (FAD and
AFRITAC-Centre) is providing TA on
progress with the implementation of the
government’s reform agenda as detailed at
the National Forum on Public Finances
(NFPF) held in September 2011, which has
globally endorsed the public finance
reform program established with multidonor assistance and approved in
July 2010. In close collaboration, the Bank
and the Fund support the implementation
of this agenda, including also cash
management, by continuously providing
TA in various forms. The Bank is focusing
its TA on programming, accounting, and
oversight. The Bank will continue to
support the Court of Accounts to improve
oversight activities and the control of
budget execution by the parliament and
provides assistance in financing and
implementing computer systems and
targeted training for operators. The Bank
will try to access another Trust Fund to
continue supporting PFM reforms at the
closing of the present LICUS 3. The efforts
of our two institutions will be leveraged by
(i) the EU, which makes available
€5 million, (ii) the African Development
Bank (AfDB) with a SDR4.5 million grant,
and (iii) France’s posting of two resident
advisors.

7.
The teams agreed the following
division of labor, in line with the respective
primary responsibilities of our two institutions:


Financial resource mobilization: The
Fund leads in providing technical
assistance (TA) and recommendations for
increased mobilization of domestic
resources, including a review of personal
income taxation, simplification of tax
assessment, and reducing tax exemptions,
drawing on TA from the European Union
(EU). An assessment of the potential for
additional domestic revenue mobilization
is undertaken in the context of the 2011
Article IV consultation. Furthermore, the
Bank and the Fund will continue to support
comprehensive reforms of customs
administration, aiming at bringing customs
clearance to the point of entry, through TA
and the building of customs facilities and
supply of equipment. Increased revenue
can also result from improved regulation
of artisanal gold and diamond mining and
new exploration permits.



PFM: The Bank leads and is planning to
further support the government with
policy notes and policy dialogue in several
areas, focusing, inter alia, on (i) monitoring
socioeconomic developments, including
through implementation of the PRSPII,
conducting review and analytical works on
inclusive growth and strengthening
dialogue and (ii) action plan on the

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND



Social sector spending: The Bank leads in
monitoring the authorities’ intervention in
the social sectors and pro-poor policies. It
will update data on poverty and better
define social spending as the basis for
monitoring the relevant benchmark of the
Fund-supported ECF program. Bank and
Fund staff will jointly assess, in a Joint Staff

impact of the PRSP II, in line with the
Fund’s presentation of Board presentation
of a new ECF-supported program, to
inform the Fund-supported ECF program
framework.




Investment climate reform: The World
Bank Group, through its DPO IV and IFC, is
assisting C.A.R. with private sector
development and investment climate
issues that affect private sector growth and
access to finance. IFC’s focus will be to:
(i) strengthen the investment climate by
suggesting reforms aimed at facilitating
investment and assisting the C.A.R.
authorities in the design and
implementation of those reforms;
(ii) coordinate the work of development
partners and local stakeholders to help
improve the country’s business
environment; (iii) stimulate the private
sector and improve the country’s
investment prospects by building
institutional capacity in regulatory and
trade bodies; and (iv) provide support to
local financial intermediaries to help them
develop products that respond to the
needs of small and medium-size
enterprises (SMEs). The AfDB is also
putting emphasis on this area in its 2012–
13 budgetary support operation and
stands ready to step-up its involvement.
Infrastructure investment and
rehabilitation of SOEs: The Bank assists
the authorities in project preparation and
improving project implementation
capacity. It also leads in advising the
authorities in formulating realistic public
investment programs and budgets,
consistent with implementation
constraints, domestic financing, and
available donor assistance in line with the

PRSP II priorities. A particular focus of the
Bank’s intervention will lie on assisting the
authorities in upgrading production,
transmission, and management of public
utilities (Socatel, Enerca, Sodeca),
considering readiness and resource
availability. The Fund will monitor regular
billing and sustained payments by the
government of its current consumption of
utility services and the reduction of the
public sector’s payment arrears according
to the agreed schedule. This will be a
continued structural benchmark under a
new Fund-supported program.


Debt management: The Bank will assess,
together with the AfDB, specific, welldefined infrastructure projects that cannot
be financed on concessional, should they
come up, and propose to the Fund, at the
time of future program reviews, a possible
course of action, consistent with
safeguarding long-term debt sustainability.
The Fund will monitor repayments of
domestic payment arrears reduction. The
debt department will continue to receive
TA from the Fund, the Bank, and the AfDB.
Bank and Fund staff will jointly prepare a
full debt sustainability analysis (DSA). The
Fund and the Bank will assist in
strengthening debt management based on
the DeMPA results.

APPENDIX III. RELATIONS WITH THE AFRICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK
The African Development Bank’s (AfDB) Boards
of Directors, on July 20, 2009, approved the
Joint Country Partnership Strategy Paper
(JCPSP) for C.A.R. prepared jointly by the AfDB
Group and the World Bank Group (WBG). The
JCPSP describes the common strategy, the
proposed financing operations program, and
analytical work of both institutions for the
C.A.R. for 2009–12 to meet the pressing
priorities identified in the pillars of C.A.R.’s
Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRSP) 2008–10. It
reaffirms the commitment of the AfDB and the
WBG to deliver on the principles of the Paris
Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, and to
consolidate results achieved under their
previous Joint Interim Strategy Note (JISN)
2007–08. The objective of the JCPSP is to
promote strong economic growth and
employment through main pillars:
(i) Consolidation of Economic Governance and
Institutional Capacity; and (ii) Rehabilitation
and Development of Socio-Economic
Infrastructure.
Resources and Financing Instruments: For
2009–10, C.A.R. benefited from AfDB support
through resources allocation under ADF-11
window of: (i) approximately US$30 million
representing performance-based allocation
(PBA); (ii) US$18.5 million for Supplementary
Support - Fragile States Facility (FSF) Pillar I;
and (iii) US$4.8 million for Targeted Support
(FSF Pillar III). The financing of CPS activities
for 2011–12 is planned under ADF-12 (2011–
13). C.A.R.’s resource allocation under ADF-12
is US$178.9 million consisting of:
(i) US$25.9 million for PBA; (ii) US$41 million

for FSF; and (iii) US$111 million for the
regional operations window.
Portfolio: As of November 30, 2011, the
Bank’s portfolios in C.A.R. comprised five
national operations (projects) for total net
commitments amounting to US$43.1 million,
and one regional sector operation
(US$43 million). These projects are presented
in Table 1 (in units of accounts, UA). In
addition, C.A.R. was awarded US$4.8 million as
Targeted Support (Pillar 3 of the FSF).
Financing planned for 2012: In 2012, the
Bank intends to finance, under CSP’s Pillar I,
the Economic Reform Support, Phase III (PARE
III) for US$24.8 million (budget support). For
Pillar II, financing of three national operations
(projects) is planned aiming at restoring State
presence and authority in the country by
developing infrastructure and economic
activities, namely the Agricultural Infrastructure
and Production Rehabilitation Project
(US$14 million), the Rural Drinking Water and
Sanitation Program (US$18 million), and Rural
Financial Services Development Support
(US$8 million). Under the Regional operations
window, the Bank plans to finance the
Regional Optical Fiber Infrastructure Project
(C.A.R., Cameroon, Chad) for US$15.5 million,
and Regional Boali III and Interconnection with
DRC (US$47 million). The Bank will also be
involved, in particular under FSF Pillar 3, in
institutional and human capacity building and
studies (for example, preparation of the Bangui
master plan, recruitment of four experts, and
two studies on domestic public resources
mobilization and on the determinants of
growth).

APPENDIX IV. STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of November 30, 2011)
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision has shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Issues with
source data and compilation affect most data sets, but are particularly problematic in the real sector.
National Accounts: There is a high degree of uncertainty attached to estimates of the level and
growth rate of real GDP, as estimates for informal sector activity are still based on a 1982 survey.
Furthermore, developments in the subsistence agriculture sector, accounting for an estimated 30
percent of the economy, are not tracked well and would benefit from the development of source
data through surveys. STA is providing technical assistance in national accounts to rebase series on
an upgraded 2007 level and change the structure and sectoral contribution estimates.
Price statistics: The measurement of inflation is also subject to a high degree of uncertainty since
the CPI is based on expenditure weights that are thirty years old. The index is highly skewed toward
food items (70 percent), in particular basic foodstuff, and covers only a limited number of modern
and service items. STA is providing technical assistance to update and rebalance the index on a 2000
level and extend coverage to a number of provincial centers. Price data for July 2011 were not
collected for lack of resources at the national statistics institute.
Government finance statistics: Data provision is broadly satisfactory for surveillance purposes,
although coverage is not complete. The main shortcomings relate to (i) expenditures financed by line
ministries’ and government agencies’ own resources, which are estimated on the basis of respective
revenue estimates, (ii) foreign-financed investment expenditures reported bi-annually by the Ministry
of Planning, and (iii) domestic arrears accumulation. Budget accounting and Treasury procedures,
and domestic debt statistics, continue to suffer from serious shortcomings, delays and omissions in
reporting, which are addressed through various reforms. These are a major focus of technical
assistance programs, including from the Fund/AFRITAC. General government statistics are not
available.
Monetary statistics: Data provision is broadly satisfactory for surveillance purposes, although
subject to frequent revisions due to commercial banks’ accounting problems. Delays have occurred
in harmonizing databases among BEAC entities.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 9, 2012

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation
with the Central African Republic
On January 30, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Central African Republic (C.A.R.).1
Background
Since the conclusion of the last Article IV consultation in December 2009, the C.A.R. continued
to grapple with the challenges of a fragile post-conflict state. Macroeconomic performance over
the past few years has been broadly satisfactory but growth remained modest and well below
the averages for sub-Saharan Africa and other fragile states. Insufficient domestic and external
resources, deep-rooted structural deficiencies, weak institutional capacity, and a poor business
environment are enduring factors holding back economic take-off. The economy is highly
dependent on external assistance, poverty is pervasive, and social indicators are generally
weak.
In 2010–11, real gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 3.2 percent, thanks mainly to
rebounding agricultural production, which helped to bring down inflation to less than 1 percent
by end-2011. Growth in 2011 was slightly weaker than forecast because the expected postelection recovery of domestic demand did not materialize and uncertainties delayed major
investments in the mining sector and oil exploration. However, the prospects for 2012 are
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
favorable, predicated on continued good performance of the primary sector, particularly
agriculture and forestry activities, and the resumption of delayed investments in the mining
sector. But risks to this outlook are on the downside, as domestic and global uncertainties
continue to weigh on the C.A.R. economy.
The fiscal position deteriorated sharply in 2010 with payment arrears accumulated to domestic
and external creditors, reversing hard-won gains under the program supported by the Extended
Credit Facility (ECF). Also, lack of transparency and due process in budget execution led to
serious governance concerns and the suspension of budget support by donors. Though
domestic revenue benefitted from a number of one-off effects to reach 11.6 percent of GDP,
expenditures surged, fueled by election-related spending, sending the overall budget deficit,
excluding grants, to 7.7 percent of GDP. A tight liquidity situation in 2011, mainly resulting from
donors suspending budget support, prompted the authorities to curtail expenditures, which
resulted in a decline of the overall deficit by 1.2 percentage points of GDP. The fiscal position is
projected to improve further in 2012 on strengthened expenditure control and revenue
measures adopted together with the 2012 budget.
Following a slowdown during the period leading to the elections, the C.A.R. authorities have
recently stepped up implementation of structural measures, including strengthening budget
execution and the monitoring capacity of macroeconomic developments, and improving the
operations of state-owned enterprises and key public agencies.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the resilience of the economy of the Central African Republic
(C.A.R.) in the face of the global crisis. While the short term outlook is favorable, C.A.R. faces
significant challenges as a fragile state to enhance medium term growth prospects and reduce
poverty. Directors stressed the importance of strengthening budget execution, addressing
structural and infrastructural bottlenecks, and building capacity, along with improved security
and political stability.
Directors regretted the fiscal slippages and underlying governance issues in 2010 and early
2011. They welcomed the measures taken to restore budget discipline and enhance
transparency in the use of public funds and called for their steadfast implementation. They
encouraged the authorities to redouble their efforts to strengthen public financial management,
increase domestic resource mobilization, prioritize spending, and enhance donor coordination to
better leverage Technical Assistance resources. Directors welcomed the recent adjustment in
domestic petroleum prices. They stressed the importance of regular adjustments to ensure full
pass through of international prices and safeguard fiscal resources for priority investments,
along with measures to protect the poor.

3
Directors welcomed the second generation Poverty Reduction and Strategy Paper (PRSP). It
lays out a comprehensive reform strategy to help mobilize donor assistance to build capacity,
boost investment in physical infrastructure and social programs, and make progress towards the
Millennium Developments Goals.
Directors noted that formidable challenges remain to improve competitiveness and develop the
private sector. They encouraged the authorities to persevere in their efforts to address the
structural weaknesses confronting the economy, improve the business climate, enhance the
delivery of public services, and deepen financial intermediation. Directors welcomed the
recapitalization of commercial banks, and encouraged the authorities to step up their efforts to
divest their majority stake in the ailing bank.
Directors regretted the accumulation of external payment arrears, including to Paris Club and
multilateral creditors, and urged the authorities to settle these arrears as soon as possible. They
encouraged the authorities to strengthen public debt management and avoid contracting
nonconcessional loans, including expensive domestic bank financing, to preserve debt
sustainability. They supported the authorities’ continued efforts in seeking debt relief from all
bilateral and commercial creditors on terms consistent with the HIPC/MDRI Initiatives.
Directors stressed the importance of adequate macroeconomic data and encouraged the
authorities to strengthen the statistical agency.
Directors considered that a new Fund arrangement could help solidify macroeconomic
stabilization and support the authorities’ reform agenda. They stressed that strong ownership
and commitment, including strengthened budget execution and governance, will be key.

Statement by Kossi Assimaidou, Executive Director
for Central African Republic
January 30, 2012
On behalf of my Central African Republic (CAR) authorities, I would like to thank
management and staff for the constructive policy dialogue with the authorities during the
discussions held in Bangui, in the context of the 2011 Article IV consultations, and in
Washington D.C during the visit of the Prime Minister. There is broad agreement between
the authorities and staff on the assessment of the key challenges facing the CAR and the
policy response.
The Central African Republic is gradually recovering from the impact of the global
financial crisis, which at its height severely contracted its exports, notably of timber and
diamond. It also faced a difficult security environment, and a protracted presidential and
legislative electoral cycle which led to significant disruptions in the civil service, as well
as fiscal slippages.
The authorities endeavored to address these crises, and to secure the re-engagement of the
international community whose support is critical to the achievement of sustainable gains
in poverty reduction and growth. They also stepped up efforts to improve security, and
regional stability. They are appreciative of the support received from the international
community to that regard, both in the context of the Disarmament Demobilization and
Reinsertion process, and bilaterally.
As regards the economy, the authorities sought to mitigate the impact of the global
economic crisis, rebuild capacity, and intensify structural reforms with the view to
making inroads in poverty reduction and growth. Given the daunting challenges the
country continues to face, the authorities view as essential the resumption of program
relations with the IMF, whose advice and financial support are critical in the conception
and implementation of policies to preserve macroeconomic stability, rebuild capacity, and
in catalyzing donors’ assistance.
Recent Economic Developments
Real GDP growth benefited from a recovery in agricultural production and external
demand. However, due to the protracted uncertainty related to the elections, and the
lingering security challenges, which delayed mining and oil explorations projects, real
GDP growth has been lower than anticipated, at 3.1 percent in 2011. Inflation fell to 0.7
percent during the same period following a good harvest and contained domestic oil price
increases.
Although domestic revenue performance continued to improve, expenditures increased as
well, especially during the electoral period, which resulted in a significant increase in the
domestic primary deficit.

2
The external position weakened due to an increase in import prices, notably in petroleum
products. International reserves are projected to fall to about 2.7 months of imports.
Looking forward, the authorities expect the recovery to firm up, as security and electionrelated uncertainties are being resolved, aid flows resume, and investors regain
confidence. However, they are fully aware of the substantial downside risks to the
outlook, including global uncertainties.
Mobilizing Internal Resources for Poverty Reduction
The authorities are committed to creating the fiscal space required to support their
development agenda. In this regard, they reiterated their resolve to mobilize additional
resources, prioritize spending, and reign on fiscal slippages in line with staff’s
recommendations.
On the revenue side, they agreed with staff on the need for an automatic adjustment
mechanism for retail oil prices, to reflect the evolution of international prices. A
ministerial order has since been issued on December 30, 2011 implementing an
adjustment of petroleum prices for January 2012. The authorities are also committed to
reforms aimed at improving the efficiency of tax and customs administration, and at
broadening the tax base.
On spending, the authorities aimed at the reallocation of spending towards priority
sectors. The 2012 budget adopted by parliament provides for increased spending in
health, and education sectors. Provisions were also made to help vulnerable households
cope with increased petroleum product prices.
The authorities are also determined to improve public financial management, and
strengthen governance. They are committed to ensuring that spending follows the
expenditure chain established by the budget approved by parliament. To that effect,
instructions were given to ensure that payments were made only for expenditures
processed through GESCO, the public expenditure management computerized system.
They are taking steps to commit expenditures on a weekly basis, and to ensure that these
outlays are provisioned for in periodic cash flow plans. A technical committee tasked
more generally with monitoring budget execution has also been created.
In order to preserve debt sustainability and prevent a recurrence of debt payments arrears,
the authorities will intensify efforts to strengthen their debt management capabilities, and
seek concessional financing for their development agenda. They will also continue to
make good faith efforts to secure additional debt relief, under HIPC terms, from the
remaining creditors.
Strengthening Institutional Capacity for Economic Management
The Central African Republic continues to face severe administrative capacity
constraints. In line with recommendations of the National Forum on Public Finance held

3
in September 2011, the authorities took steps to strengthen the capacity and operations of
key economic management institutions, such as the Committees in charge of monitoring
macroeconomic developments and structural reforms, and the Liquidity Committee.
These measures are in line with recommendations already made by CAR’s development
partners, and the authorities are requesting support from the IMF in rebuilding technical
capacity.
Preserving External stability and Promoting Growth and Economic Diversification
As part of a monetary and economic union (CEMAC), the Central African Republic
shares the regional common currency, the CFA, which is pegged to the Euro. The
authorities welcome staff’s finding that the union’s real effective exchange rate is
consistent with external stability. They are of the view that the exchange rate regime has
served CAR well, including by helping anchor inflation expectations, and facilitating the
exchange of goods and services with the country’s main trading partners.
In order to preserve external stability, the authorities’ plan to implement a comprehensive
structural reforms agenda to improve the countries’ competitiveness, boost growth
prospects, and sustainably reduce poverty. In that regard, they are in the process of
finalizing their new poverty reduction strategy paper which will guide their actions going
forward.
Amongst others, the authorities’ efforts will focus on removing key infrastructure
bottlenecks--particularly in transportation and electricity provision--and at improving the
climate for business. Having reached a significant milestone in the management of their
natural resources by achieving in 2011, Compliance status with the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative, they will intensify efforts for sustained improvements in the
investment climate.
Future Relations with the IMF
The CAR authorities have expressed an interest in a new ECF arrangement with the IMF
to help anchor their macroeconomic stabilization and growth reforms agenda. Under the
previous ECF program, they attained key objectives, including by maintaining fiscal
discipline when faced with significant exogenous shocks. They also reached the
completion point under the HIPC Initiative, creating fiscal space for their development
agenda.
CAR is a post-conflict country whose recovery from the impact of the global financial
and economic crisis is still fragile. The country also continues to face daunting poverty
reduction challenges, which can only be addressed with the full support of the
international community, including the IMF. In light of the authorities’ commitment to
sound policies going forward, as evidenced by their implementation of corrective
measures agreed upon with staff to strengthen fiscal discipline, I call on Directors to
support the reengagement of the Fund in the Central African Republic.
