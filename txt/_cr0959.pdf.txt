EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Economic developments. Niger’s GDP growth is expected to accelerate in 2008 due to a
good harvest and to stay close to 5 percent over the next few years due to large investments
in mining, petroleum, and irrigation. Twelve-month inflation accelerated to 15 percent in
mid-year, but abated to 12 percent in October, and is expected to further decline by end-year.
Response to the food and fuel crisis. The authorities initially suspended taxes on critical
foodstuffs but also relied on targeted interventions for vulnerable groups, which made it
possible to end the tax suspensions in September. They also froze the retail price of
petroleum products, in effect suspending part of the tax on fuel.
Program performance. Budgetary performance was better than expected in the first part of
the year. One quantitative performance criterion (PC) for end-June related to domestic
arrears reduction was missed. A structural PC was also missed relating to the adoption of
modalities for repaying deposits frozen at the postal bank. Corrective action have been taken
for both, justifying the request for waivers.
Policy discussions. The staff discussed medium-term growth prospects and the impact of a
possible scaling up of aid Annual GDP growth could exceed 5 percent in the medium term,
which is not enough for Niger to reach the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). An
increase in foreign aid equivalent to 5 percent of GDP would boost GDP growth by slightly
more than 1 percentage point. Such a scaling up would be consistent with maintaining
macroeconomic equilibrium, though again it will not be enough to reach the MDGs. The
authorities agreed with staff’s assessment that the real exchange rate is in line with
fundamentals, but efforts are needed to improve competitiveness and reduce the cost of doing
business. Although the mining and petroleum projects increase fiscal space, staff suggested
that the annual budgetary exercise be set in the context of a medium-term fiscal framework.
Impact of the recent international financial crisis. Downside risk is that a prolonged crisis
would affect future telecommunication and mining investments, although investment projects
already underway should be secure.
The budget for 2009. The budget is using the exceptional petroleum signature bonus
received in mid-2008 to increase investment expenditures in priorrity sectors such as roads,
rural development, and electricity generation. As a result the deficit in 2009 is higher than
originally programmed. This is justified because the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP) is not fully financed.

4
I. BACKGROUND
1.
Niger’s main challenge continues to be boosting economic growth to sustainably
reduce poverty. The landlocked country, heavily dependent upon drought-prone
subsistence agriculture, ranks 174th out of 177 countries on the United Nations Human
Development Index. The population is not only among the poorest but also one of the
fastest growing in the world (3.3 percent a year). The main source of income for the
80 percent of the population who live in rural areas is subsistence agriculture, traditional
cattle raising, and fishing, which account for over 40 percent of GDP. The incidence of
poverty is estimated at 62.1 percent; it is higher in rural areas (65.7 percent) than in Niamey
(27.1 percent) and other urban centers (55.5 percent). 1
2.
Since 2000, political stability has been restored; the authorities have followed
prudent macroeconomic policies, supported by three successive PRGF arrangements;
and GDP growth (averaging 4.4 percent per year) has kept ahead of population
growth, except during two devastating droughts. During the previous PRGF arrangement
(2005–2008), which expired in May 2008, significant progress was achieved in
macroeconomic stability, revenue mobilization, expenditure management, and restoration of
creditworthiness (Country Report # 08/211). 2 Debt relief from the Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) granted in 2004–06
and prudent borrowing policies have greatly relieved the debt burden and increased fiscal
space (see Table 2). Critical factors required to achieve higher growth and reduce poverty,
in line with the Poverty Reduction Strategy for 2008–12, are (i) continued prudent
macroeconomic management; (ii) improvements in the investment climate; and
(iii) considerable external assistance on very concessional terms.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PROGRAM
3.
Macroeconomic performance was satisfactory in 2007, although growth
decelerated. It slowed to 3.3 percent in 2007 as the harvest returned to normal after two
years of exceptional growth and averaged 5.8 percent for 2005–07. Since 2000, when
political stability was restored, average GDP growth in Niger has been higher than in the
WAEMU zone as a whole, although lower than in sub-Saharan Africa (see table below).
GDP growth was supported by significant increases in the investment ratio, which rose from
an average of 13.7 percent of GDP in 2000–04 to 23.4 percent in 2005–2007.

See Accelerated Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy 2008-2012, issued in August
2007 (Country Report (CR) No. 08/167).
2

The 2005-08 PRGF arrangement expired on May 31, 2008. The final review was completed
on May 28, 2008, when the Executive Board also approved a successor three-year
arrangement effective on June 2, 2008.

5
4.
Growth accelerated in 2008, to an expected 5.9 percent, supported by major
investments in mining and petroleum and an agricultural campaign that benefited
from good rains. However, power distribution has been disrupted by shortages in Nigeria,
the source of most of the electricity used in Niger, which slowed industrial activity in early
2008; the authorities have contracted with Chinese suppliers to put in place new power
plants to alleviate the problem, at a moderate cost to the capital budget.
On average, Niger tends to grow faster than WAEMU but slower
than Sub-Saharan Africa.

The investment ratio is increasing strongly.

5.
As a result of higher world prices for food and fuel, inflation accelerated to
15 percent in the first eight months of 2008, from 4.7 percent at end-2007. However,
inflation is moderated in the last months of the year as a result of the ongoing weakening of
worldwide economic activity and the decline in commodity prices on world markets since
mid-2008, combined with the good harvests in Niger and the neighboring countries.
Inflation, on a 12-month basis, is projected to reach 8.5 percent at the end of 2008 but is
expected to decline below 3 percent by end-2009.
6.
Niger meets most of the convergence criteria of the WAEMU (see table below).
However, it does not meet the targets on the external current account deficit, and the basic
fiscal balance, although both balances are sustainable given the high volume of foreign aid.
It also does not meet the tax revenue target of 17 percent of GDP, which is very ambitious
for a country at Niger’s stage of development.

7.
Budget performance was satisfactory in 2007 and the first half of 2008. In 2007,
both tax and nontax revenue 3 performed well. Despite a strong increase in current
expenditures 4 and domestically-financed public investment, the basic budget deficit
remained moderate and below target (at 0.9 percent of GDP). The reduction of domestic
arrears, which has been ongoing since 2001, was broadly on track at 0.7 percent of GDP. 5
Public expenditures on education, health, and the rural sector amounted to 9 percent of GDP
(marginally below the level of 2006). In the first half of 2008 the basic budget deficit,
excluding an exceptional petroleum signature bonus received in June (US$300 million or
CFAF 123.4 billion, 5.3 percent of GDP, see below) was lower than programmed, as revenue
was in line with the program and domestically-financed expenditure remained well below
programmed level. Nontax revenue increased massively in June 2008, with the payment of a
signature bonus following the signing of a petroleum production sharing contract (PSC) with
China National Oil and Gas Exploration and Development Corporation (CNODC), a
subsidiary of the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC).

Nontax revenue were boosted by the sale of a telecom licence.

The stock of domestic arrears is estimated at 6.6 percent of GDP at end-2007. Most of these
arrears were accumulated before the restoration of political stability with the 1999
presidential election.

8.
In 2007, the external current account deficit excluding grants widened to
11.1 percent of GDP, despite the increase in the export price of uranium, Niger’s main
export, and a further increase in the deficit is expected in 2008, to about 12.3 percent of
GDP. 6 The large increase in imports of equipment and petroleum products, as well as the
increase in services and payment of income abroad, more than offset the higher export
revenue from uranium. In the years ahead, the structure of the balance of payments is likely
to be modified significantly as a result of two large oil and mining projects announced in
2008, which will imply a major increase in foreign direct investment and a corresponding
widening of the current account deficit. First, as mentioned earlier, in June 2008, the
government approved a PSC with CNODC for the exploration and exploitation of petroleum

commitment to develop the large Imourarem uranium mine over the next few years, with an
investment of about €1 billion (Box 1).

Credit to the economy was buoyant in 2007 and in the first eight months of
2008, reflecting loans to the mining, telecommunication, and transportation sectors.
Boosted by the disbursement late in 2007 of external budget support and the collection of
exceptional government revenue (sale of a new telecom license to a foreign operator), the net
foreign assets of the central bank attributed to Niger increased in 2007 by 43 percent, and the
net claims of the central bank on the government fell. Net foreign assets increased further in

In early 2008 the main shareholder of the two uranium operating companies reached an

2008 (following a 50 percent increase in 2007).

the first eight months of 2008. The banks’ nonperforming loans, net of provisions, reached
10.7 percent of net total credit at the end of 2007, with a gradual increase since 2004, but the
trend reversed in 2008, with preliminary end-June 2008 data indicating a decline in this ratio
to 7.2 percent. Broad money grew by 23 percent in 2007 and is expected to continue to
increase at about this rate in 2008.
Box 1: Large Investment Projects
Three very large investments are planned over the next five years: (i) the development of the
Imourarem uranium mine; (ii) the exploitation of petroleum in the Agadem field and
construction of a refinery; and (iii) the construction of the Kandadji dam and the related
irrigation and hydropower developments.
Imourarem: Although the formal negotiations have not yet reached closure, the French
mining company AREVA confirmed in early 2008 its commitment to develop the large
Imourarem uranium mine over the next few years, with an investment of about €1 billion.
This would increase uranium production by about 5,000 tons around 2015; taking into
account other, smaller, investments production would then reach 9,600 tons, more than
tripling the current level.
Agadem: A production-sharing contract with China National Oil and Gas Exploration and
Development Corporation (CNODC) was approved in June 2008. The project has three
components: the development of the Agadem oil field to extract reserves estimated at
324 million barrels, the construction of a mini-refinery in Zinder with a capacity of
20,000 barrels per day, and a 580 km pipeline linking the Agadem field to the refinery. The
estimated cost is about US$ 1.3 billion. The refinery will be organized as a corporation, with a
government capital participation of 40 percent. Production is scheduled to begin in early
2012. Since the capacity of the refinery exceeds the local consumption (7, 000 barrels per
day), much of the production will be exported. The operator will also conduct further
exploration and if sufficient new discoveries are made, exports of crude through a new
pipeline is envisaged.
Kandadji: The project, managed by an agency reporting to the Prime Minister, is part of a
program aiming at protecting the ecosystem of the entire Niger Valley and developing its
economic potential. Its main function will be to regulate water flow for the benefit of areas
downstream. It involves construction of a dam and a power generating plant, and the
development of irrigated areas. The overall investment, excluding the hydro electrical plant, is
estimated at CFAF 140 billion (about $280 million). It is financed by the government budget
and loans from a number of multilateral agencies, including the African Development Bank,
the Islamic Development Bank, the OPEC Fund, the Arab Bank for Economic Development
in Africa (BADEA), the Kuwaiti Fund, the Saudi Fund, the West African Development Bank
(BOAD), all at concessional terms. The related borrowing agreements have already been
signed or are close to finalization. The construction of the dam will begin in 2009 and be
completed in 2014. Equipping the power plant and constructing the high tension power line
are planned for 2011-2014, and are expected to be financed through a combination of public
and private resources under a public-private partnership. The development of irrigated areas
would proceed at about 1,000 ha to 2, 000 ha per year, up to a maximum of 45,000 ha.

10
10.
Despite some improvements in some key social indicators, Niger is unlikely to
reach the MDGs by 2015 (see Figure 1). Partly as a result of the allocation of more
resources to the social sectors, the primary school enrollment increased from 37 percent in
2002 to 62 percent in 2007, and child mortality fell significantly from 1998 to 2006.
11.
Except for a small slippage in the reduction of domestic arrears, the program to
June 2008 is on track. The quantitative performance criterion (PC) on domestic financing
for end-June 2008 was met, but the reduction of domestic arrears fell short of the
CFAF 7 billion target by CFAF 1.2 billion; the target was reached in July 2008. The basic
budget balance indicative target for June was met, on the basis of provisional data. The
end-September 2008 structural performance criterion on defining the modalities for the
repayment of frozen savings deposits at the former National Post Office was not met on time,
but this measure was implemented in early December.
III. MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK AND POLICY DISCUSSIONS
12.
The policy discussions for the Article IV consultations focused on the
challenges and opportunities to sustain healthy growth over the medium term, while
preserving a viable balance of payments and a sustainable debt position. The authorities’
strategy over the past two years yielded macroeconomic stability and reasonable growth.
Progress was achieved in reforms aiming at public finance management (both on revenue
mobilization and expenditure management) and strengthening the financial sector. However,
the challenge of making a significant dent in poverty is daunting. The PRSP indicates that
cutting poverty levels by half by 2015 would require a sustained annual GDP growth rate of
7 percent, which currently does not seem achievable. The discussions covered the following
themes: (i) growth prospects over the medium term in comparison to the PRSP objectives;
(ii) assessment of the real exchange rate, international competitiveness, and debt
sustainability; (iii) food security and short- and medium-term policy responses to the higher
prices of food and fuel; (iv) the public finance implications of developments in the mining
and petroleum sectors; (v) financial sector reform and the cost of doing business; and (vi) the
possible impact of the international financial crisis. Policy discussions related to the program
review focused on (i) the budget for 2009; (ii) the implementation of public finance
management and tax policy reforms; and (iii) structural reforms related to the financial sector
and the cost of doing business.
A. Medium-Term Macroeconomic Framework and Growth Prospects
13.
Staff expects GDP growth to average 5 percent for the next five years, which is
below the high growth scenario in the PRSP (7 percent). It is based on a pick up in
agricultural growth and mining, and implementation of large investment projects in mining,
petroleum, and irrigation (Box 1). The downturn in industrial countries is not expected to
affect exports and growth in the short term, because the main export, uranium, is sold on
long-term contracts, and other exports, mainly cattle and foodstuff, are sold on the regional
market. However, (Box 2), the downturn could have effects on mining exploration and
therefore on growth and government revenue in the medium term.

11
14.
As they are implemented, these large investments are expected to sustain
activity, boost the construction and transportation sectors, and increase current
account deficits. However, in the medium term, the effect on the current account would be
reversed as exports increase and import needs shrink. Meanwhile, tax and nontax revenue
would increase.
15.
The PSC signature bonus collected in 2008 will allow higher spending; the
authorities intend to spend the bonus in the remaining months of 2008 and in 2009,
mainly on investments and goods and services for priority PRSP sectors, because the
PRSP is underfinanced. Staff agreed with this accelerated use of the resources, which will be
allocated to rural development, roads, electricity generation, and government participations
in the refinery and a modern slaughterhouse. The World Bank is also in broad agreement
with these allocations. While the outlays are broadly in line with PRSP priorities, staff urged
further improvements in the coordination between the ministry of finance and the PRSP unit
in order to address effectively the needs of the social sectors and remove infrastructure
bottlenecks.
16.
In 2012 new oil revenue and increased revenue from uranium will push the
revenue-GDP ratio to about 14.3 percent of GDP, allowing a stepping up of
expenditure, while eliminating the basic fiscal deficit. Because the additional mineral
revenues are expected to be a relatively modest 3 percent of GDP annually over 20 years,
staff did not recommend that a fund for future generations be established, but instead
encouraged the authorities to formulate a medium-term expenditure plan aligned with PRSP
priorities. The authorities agreed that anchoring the budget decisions in a multi-year
framework is indeed essential. Although steps towards that goal have been taken with the
preparation of such frameworks for key sectors, they judged that further efforts are needed,
and requested Fund technical assistance to help integrate the budget preparation process with
the PRSP in a multi-year framework. Over the long run, the government overall deficit,
including grants, should remain moderate, in the range of 2 to 3 percent of GDP, which is
equivalent to the flow of concessional loans, expected to finance approximately one third of
the investment effort. This is consistent with the sustainable debt path (Supplement on Debt
Sustainability Analysis, Box 1).
17.
Staff discussed in detail the revised balance of payments projections and the
new debt sustainability analysis (DSA), which is more favorable because of new refined
petroleum exports after 2012. The current account deficit of the balance of payments is
expected to widen substantially in 2009-2011 as a result of a large increase in imports
financed by foreign direct investments in the uranium and petroleum sectors, but to decline
sharply from 2012. The new DSA, presented in the supplement to this staff report, shows an
improvement in the NPV of debt-to-exports indicator, which in the baseline scenario reaches
only 95 percent in 2028 (see text figure). Moreover, under all but two of the stress tests, the
indicators remain below the policy thresholds; the two scenarios where the thresholds are
broken are somewhat unrealistic, as foreign direct investment is cut, without curtailing the
corresponding imports. On the basis of this analysis, Niger remains rated at moderate risk of
debt distress, despite the improvement in debt indicators. The authorities remain committed

12
to maintaining a prudent debt policy, with careful attention to the terms of new borrowing
(MEFP, paragraph 27).
18.
The main risks to the growth and balance of payments scenarios are that
(i) adverse weather would undermine agriculture; (ii) adverse developments in the world
economy could push down mineral prices (Box 2); and (iii) political instability and
insurgency in the North could intensify.
19.
Staff and authorities also discussed the policy responses to rising food and fuel
prices in the first half of the year (Box 3). The comprehensive arrangements to help
vulnerable groups through targeted interventions were commendable. These arrangements
made it possible to end in September the suspension of taxes on sensitive food products
introduced earlier in the year. As for petroleum products, while the recent decline in
international prices allowed the government to stabilize retail prices without much loss in
revenue, staff noted that the authorities should be ready to adjust retail prices upward to
protect the revenue target if the recent decline of world prices should reverse.
20.
Staff discussed the prospects for scaled-up aid which the authorities are keen to
obtain to fund their ambitious PRSP. Staff presented the preliminary results of staff
simulations developed in a Selected Issues Paper, which suggest that a sustained increase of
aid of 5 percent of GDP would lead to an increase in growth of about 1-2 percent per year
after 4 years, and a reduction in the poverty level by about 25 percent by 2015, though that

Box 2. Niger and the World Financial Crisis
The impact of the world financial crisis on Niger is expected to be limited in the short term, because uranium is sold
on long-term contracts. In fact, in the short run, the country would actually benefit from a decline in oil prices.
However, if the downturn is steeper or more prolonged than expected, it could seriously affect mining exploration
and mining revenues.
The two major mining and oil projects that have started in 2008, to bring the Imourarem uranium field into
production in 2014 and the Agadem oil field in 2012, are proceeding, and there is currently no indication that they
are being slowed down. However, smaller mining exploration activity may be slowed or delayed. The export price
of uranium is negotiated annually with the parent of the Nigerien operating companies, and the downturn in the spot
price will likely lead to a stabilization of the export price next year, after sharp increases in 2007 and 2008. The
decline in the international petroleum price has a favorable impact on import costs and the budget, but, if prices
remain depressed for many years, the Agadem field might be less profitable.
The financial crisis is not expected to affect the activity of the Nigerien banking system, because the banks rely only
very modestly on resources from their parent companies abroad. As for major investments, the crisis may slow
expansion of the mobile telecom network, which relies heavily on financing from foreign parent companies; but it
should have no effect on the Kandaji dam project, which is funded by multilateral agencies, or the expansion of
electricity production and transmission, which is mostly funded from the budget and bilateral export agencies.

13
is still below the MDG target (Box 4). 7 Higher growth could be accompanied by relatively
moderate appreciation of the real exchange rate (3-5 percent), suggesting that for Niger the
risk of Dutch disease would be manageable and not a deterrent to aid scaling up. The case
for scaling up for Niger is compelling: The country, which has had a satisfactory
macroeconomic management track record since 2000, is among the poorest in the world, its
development indicators are similarly poor, and the 10 percent of GDP of aid it currently
receives is well below that of several other sub-Saharan African countries with better
development indicators.

Box 3. Niger: Policy Response to Rising Food and Fuel Prices
•

The response of the authorities to rising food and fuel prices has been two-pronged. First, they
suspended taxes on imported food and fuel, beginning in March with the VAT and import duties on
rice, and a number of excise taxes on fuel. Then in June the tax suspension measures were extended to
import duties on milk and the excise on edible oil, also the taxable basis for import taxes on sugar and
flour was reduced. The cost of the measures for food products was estimated at 0.6 percent of GDP.

•

At the same time, the authorities reinforced the wide-ranging targeted food security operations they
have carried out for a number of years, which are funded partly by donors, such as (i) nutritional
programs; (ii) programs of food for work and cash for work; (iii) food distribution to vulnerable
populations at moderate prices and free distribution in the lean season; and (iv) funding and setting up
cereal banks. Food was distributed at moderate prices in July and August, peaking during the
September Ramadan period; moderate-price distribution totaled 24,000 tons and free distribution about
16,000 tons. These distributions were carried out by the Office des Produits Vivriers du Niger
(OPVN), which has a network of cereal storage facilities throughout the country, using the national
security stock, which must now be replenished, and special imports.

•

The comprehensiveness of these targeted programs and the prospects for an excellent harvest starting
in late September convinced the authorities at the end of September to reimpose the taxes on food
products, thus saving the equivalent of 0.25 percent of GDP.

•

The amount of deferred taxes on petroleum products plunged in November, and the deferment is
expected to end in December, given the decline in international prices.

7

While the simulation has been carried out assuming that all additional aid is in the form of
grants, the impact on growth would be only marginally lower if part of the aid was in the
form of concessional loans.

14

Box 4: The Macroeconomic Impact of Scaled-up Aid in Niger

As stated at the G8 summit in Gleneagles in 2005, there is a need to scale-up aid to
low-income countries in order to reduce poverty and make significant progress toward
meeting the 2015 Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). A Special Issues Paper outlines
a simple macroeconomic framework to assess the effect of aid on growth and apply it to
Niger. In particular, it analyzes the growth impact of aid through its effect on physical and
human capital accumulation, taking into account the effect of aid on domestic demand and
the real exchange rate.
Results from the model simulation suggest that if foreign aid as a share of GDP were to be
permanently increased from a level equivalent to 10 percent of GDP in 2007 to 15 percent in
2008, annual economic growth would accelerate by more than 1 percentage point (see figures
below), without generating significant risks for macroeconomic stability. In this scenario, by
2020 Niger’s income per capita would be an estimated 12.5 percent higher than it would be
without increased foreign aid.
Such an augmentation in aid would make it possible to cut poverty reduction 25 percent by
2015, though Niger would still be well below the MDG poverty reduction objective
(MDG 1). Indeed, the model implies that Niger requires an increase of aid of almost
20 percent of GDP to reach MDG 1. However, such an increase would fuel inflation (by
about 10 percentage points in 2009–10). Foreign assistance would be more efficient in
boosting income per capita and reducing poverty if the execution capacity of the public
administration is improved to better manage the increased expenditures funded by scaled-up
aid.

macro-equilibrium, in view
of the favorable movement of Niger’s terms of trade in recent years, reflecting higher prices
for uranium. Moreover, projected increases in foreign direct investment, and the prospects
for petroleum production are likely to lead to a further appreciation of the equilibrium real
exchange rate in the next few years. For 2000-08 total exports of Niger in U.S. dollars are
projected to have risen by 214 percent, partly because the export price of uranium doubled in
2007-08. This compares with an increase in world exports of 170 percent for the same
period. The favorable prospects suggest that over the next five years Niger could continue to
increase its share of world exports.
22.
Staff also reviewed competitiveness indicators, such as productivity growth and
the ranking of Niger on the “cost of doing business” (see below) and argued that while the
exchange rate seems to be aligned with fundamentals, other indicators of competitiveness
highlight the need for Niger to improve the business climate and productivity, including
through improved training of the labor force, better access to finance, reduction in the cost of
doing business, and improved transport infrastructure.
23.
The authorities agreed with the exchange rate assessment, and also recognized
the need to improve the business climate and lowering the cost of doing business to attract
investment and diversify the economy.
C. Food Security
24.
Staff reviewed with the authorities the monitoring and emergency intervention
mechanisms in place to protect vulnerable groups and regions against food shortages.
The mechanisms are comprehensive, as described in Box 3, but need continued donor
support. The authorities are committed to disburse before end-year the related budgetary
allocations (MEFP, paragraph 6).

19

Box 5. Assessing External Competitiveness in Niger
Niger’s real exchange rate (RER) in 2007 is assessed using three CGER approaches: (i) macroeconomic balance (MB);
(ii) external sustainability; (ES), and (iii) equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER). These three methods yield estimates
ranging from a modest undervaluation (8 percent) to a very slight overvaluation (2 percent). These results indicate that the
RER does not hinder competitiveness. In addition, the staff has analyzed other indicators of competitiveness.
Macroeconomic Balance (MB) and the underlying current account (UCA). The MB approach estimates a current
account norm of –9.6 percent, compared with the underlying current account of –8.1 percent, indicating an undervaluation
of about 8 percent.
External Sustainability (ES). The ES approach estimates the current account balance-to-GDP ratio that would stabilize the
net foreign asset-to-GDP ratio at a benchmark chosen because of the sustainability of its component. Taking into account
projected FDI over the next five years, portfolio investment, external debt set at a prudent margin below the policydependent threshold, and a target level of reserves, the benchmark was set at –86 percent of GDP. Based on estimated
elasticities, the Nigerien real exchange rate would need to depreciate by just 2 percent to bring the underlying current
account deficit down to the level needed to stabilize the NFA-to-GDP ratio at this level.
Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate (ERER). Three alternative econometric methods were used to estimate the equilibrium
real exchange rate index. The significant determinants are external terms of trade, productivity relative to trading partners,
and government consumption. The ERER shows a slight undervaluation of between 0.7 and 3.7 percent in 2007.

Niger export performance since 2000 has been relatively favorable, with the average export growth in U.S.
dollars of 7.8 percent in the 1999-2004 period and 18.3 percent in 2004-2007, boosted by higher uranium
prices. While survey-based indicators show improvement in the business climate, there is still room for further
improvements and in particular to reduce the cost of doing business. These evolutions do not point towards an
overvaluation.

D. Budget for 2009, Public Finance Management, and Taxation Issues
25.
The authorities discussed with the staff the 2009 budget submitted to
Parliament, which takes into account the improved fiscal outlook resulting from the
July signature bonus and projected revenue for 2009 (MEFP, paragraphs 17 to 22).
While the staff had put forward the option of phasing the additional expenditure financed by
the bonus over the next few years, the authorities decided to allocate the additional
resources entirely to the 2009 budget to finance the development of priority sectors, as
called for in the PRSP. However, the actual rate of execution of the domestically-financed
expenditure investment will likely imply that some of the funds will be spent in 2010. As a
result, the basic budget deficit for 2009 is now targeted at 5.4 percent of GDP, compared
with 2.7 percent of GDP in the program approved in May 2008 (CR/08/211). However, over
the two-years 2008-09, the basic budget deficit as a percent of GDP is reduced from an
average of 3.7 percent in the original program to 3 percent. Parliament approved the budget
law on November 14.
26.
The original program tax revenue target of 12.3 percent of GDP in 2009 has
been revised downward to 11.5 percent, mainly due to an upwards revision of GDP as a
result of inflation; several tax components such as mining profit taxes and royalties are not
closely related to current-year GDP. 8 Tax revenue targets for 2010 and 2011 have also been
revised downwards relative to the initial program (CR/08/211), because of more prudent
projections of mining revenue. However, the efforts underway to strengthen tax
administration should reinforce the non-mining components of tax revenue.
27.
Staff encouraged the authorities to continue to improve the budget preparation
process and coordination between the budget directorate and the PRSP coordinating
unit. It also underscored the need to provide resources for the future recurrent costs implied
by the large public investment projects now underway. Other areas where progress is
needed are better information to the public on budgetary outcomes 9 and further
strengthening of control and audits, particularly at the levels of the Audit Court (Cour des
Comptes) and the Directorate General of Procurement. The authorities agreed and have
identified measures to be implemented in 2009 (MEFP, paragraph 26).

8

For the same reason, and also because of the temporary suspension of taxes on sensitive
foodstuff, the target for 2008 as a whole was revised from 11.5 percent of GDP to
11.0 percent of GDP.
9

Publication of the 2008 budget outcome by end-March 2009 has been set as a new
structural benchmark.

21
28.
The authorities are strengthening debt management through the revamping of
the Public Debt Directorate, which is now tasked to prepare periodic analysis of recent
borrowing, debt trends, and debt sustainability analyses (MEFP, paragraph 27).
29.
Authorities and staff agreed that reform of corporate taxation is an important
element of the program to improve the business climate and promote growth. The
authorities expressed their intention to implement in 2009 several reforms related to the
VAT reimbursement to exporters and the profit tax (MEFP, paragraph 23), including
reduction of the corporate profit tax rate from 35 percent to 30 percent (payable in 2010 on
2009 profits), at a cost of 0.15 percent of GDP. This will be a structural PC, which is
justified because it is key to improve the investment climate, attract foreign direct
investment, and promote economic diversification. Studies will also be conducted as a basis
for reform of the tax on investment income, the real estate tax, and tax concessions in the
investment code (MEFP, paragraphs 24 and 25). The authorities request that the original PC
for end-December 2008 concerning full reimbursement of VAT credits to all exporting
enterprises be modified 10 and shifted to end-2009, out of concerns that taxpayers would take
undue advantage of the reform if it is not well prepared. The staff concurs with this request.
Another important measure to reinforce the investment climate is the reduction of the
registration fees for new businesses at the courts registrar, which is a structural benchmark
for end-2009.
E. Public Finance and the Mining and Petroleum Sectors
30.
Staff discussed the institutional and fiscal arrangements for the large mining
projects (like the Imourarem project) and petroleum production. The broad framework
is established by the Investment Code, the Mining Law of 2006, the Petroleum Law of
2007, and a new law for large mining projects approved by the National Assembly in 2008.
Concerning the petroleum production sharing contract (PSC) signed with CNODC, the
authorities stated that the government share amounts to 20 percent of the interest in the
Agadem block. The government will also take a participation of 40 percent (US$40 million)
in the capital of the company established to operate the refinery. 11 The necessary allocation
10

The authorities explained that the principle of reimbursement of VAT credit to exporters is
already included in the tax code, but is subject to a ceiling (Article 34, section 1, title 2 of the
tax code). Therefore the PC is now formulated as an elimination of that ceiling, rather than
the taking of a new decree establishing the principle of the reimbursement of VAT credits to
all exporters.
11

The construction of the refinery would be financed by the capital and a loan from Exim
Bank of China at 3.5 percent interest. The government will not guarantee the loan, although
the service of the loan will reduce the dividends to the shareholders.

22
is included in the draft budget law for 2009. The authorities confirmed that 15 percent of the
royalties will be allocated to the budget of municipalities of the producing region, as the
Petroleum Code requires.
31.
Staff emphasized the importance of transparency in the petroleum sector. It
strongly encouraged the authorities to inform the public on the key elements of the PSC,
although the full publication is barred by a confidentiality agreement with the investor. The
authorities are committed to ensure that the sale of petroleum to the refinery and the sale of
refined products to the public be done on commercial terms, with no subsidies to the
refinery (MEFP, paragraph 28). The definition of the pricing mechanism for the refinery
output could be an area for future conditionality.
F. Financial Sector Reform and the Cost of Doing Business
32.
Financial sector reforms were assessed, in the context of the FSAP for Niger,
conducted in September 2008. While the banking system is relatively sound and
profitable, financial intermediation is still underdeveloped and the deposit-to-GDP ratio is
among the lowest in the WAEMU. Staff and authorities discussed in detail the FSAP
recommendations (Box 6). The authorities intended to promote housing and agricultural
credit (MEFP, paragraph 29). They were also envisaging the establishment of an
agricultural bank, but staff encouraged them to review all the options before deciding on the
most effective way to proceed, because experience with specialized banks in the region has
been unsatisfactory. The authorities are preparing to submit before February 2009 to the
regional Banking Commission a request for a banking license for the restructured
FINAPOSTE, which is to takeover the financial activities formerly carried out through the
national post office. The authorities have also defined in early December the terms for the
repayment of the saving deposits frozen by the former National Post Office, with a small
delay in relation to the end-September target, which is a performance criterion under the
program.

33.
Progress in reducing the cost of doing business has been achieved in recent
years on property registration, payment of taxes, and contract enforcements; however,
Niger lags behind the WAEMU average in many dimensions (see text table below). The
authorities confirmed their commitment to steadfast efforts to improve the business
environment, and in 2009 will reduce the fee for registering a new enterprise (MEFP,
paragraph 30).

Box 6. Summary of FSAP Main Recommendations

1

Recommendations
General
Formulate a financial sector development strategy. In so doing, focus the
government’s role on improvements to the business environment, supervision,
and regulation, rather than public ownership of banks and the creation of new
specialized institutions.
Government cash flow and debt management
Develop a debt management strategy which could lead to a more flexible use of
the large buffer of Treasury deposits at the central bank to avoid the accumulation
of short term payment delays.
Commercial banks
Ensure timely compliance with the new regulatory minimum capital
Should the authorities establish the new postal bank (FINAPOSTE), restrict its
operations to savings collection and prohibit lending activities;
Follow WAEMU rules regarding the offer of a regional group to inject capital and
restructure a large undercapitalized bank.
Settle the last Government arrears to commercial banks
Ensure that banks practice sound risk management and maintain the quality of
their portfolio given their expected increase in credit capacity, minimum regulatory
capital, and projected cash inflows.
Microfinance
Upgrade MFI capacities to remedy the lack of professionalism and qualified staff,
strengthen the governance and internal and external control mechanisms of MFIs,
and promote the mobilization of savings
Adopt the new microfinance law and prudential guidelines
Effective establishment of the regulatory and supervisory agency and provision of
adequate resources
For MFIs placed under provisional administration or enhanced surveillance, limit
the duration of provisional administration to no more than two years, restructure or

IV. PROGRAM MONITORING
34.
The program is monitored against quantitative performance criteria and
indicative targets listed in the original program (Appendix I, Tables 1a and 1b) and
structural performance criteria and structural benchmarks (Appendix I, Table 2). The
two structural performance criteria for 2009 (elimination of the ceiling on the
reimbursement of VAT credits to exporters and the reduction of the corporate tax rate) are
critical to meeting the program’s objective of improving the business environment to foster
growth and reduce poverty. The next review of the program is expected to be completed by
end-May 2009.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
Niger’s economic performance has been favourable so far in 2008, with an
acceleration of growth, high investment, and progress in economic diversification. The
outlook for economic growth in 2009 remains favourable despite the current downturn in
industrial countries as the significant investment underway in a number of sectors, including
mining, transportation, irrigation and telecommunication are expected to support economic
activity. While economic prospects for 2009 are still positive, if prolonged, the downturn in
the world economy could deter future mining exploration, and therefore dampen
medium-term growth. In this climate of uncertainty, continued, and possibly increased,
foreign financed investment and budgetary aid in support of priority sectors are essential for
Niger to achieve its growth objectives and secure steady improvement in social indicators.
As the scaling up simulations suggest, aid increase as envisaged in the Gleneagles scenario
would not adversely impact macroeconomic stability. But growth must also be supported by
comprehensive efforts to make the economy more competitive; improvements in the
investment climate and reductions in the cost of doing business would attract investment
and promote economic diversification. This is all the more necessary in a world
environment were private investment financing is becoming scarcer and more costly.
36.
While the international downturn is now bringing a correction of the earlier
sharp rise in food and fuel prices, the authorities are to be commended for responding
to the food crisis in the first half of 2008 by firming up already comprehensive
mechanisms of targeted interventions in favour of vulnerable groups, and for having
maintained costly tax suspensions only for a limited period. It is important that the targeted
assistance mechanisms continue to be well funded, and that the government promptly
releases its own contributions to these arrangements, supplementing those of the donor
community.
37.
The authorities program for 2009 appropriately focuses on better management
of the public finances, closely aligning the budget to PRSP priorities, streamlining
company taxation to improve the investment climate, and furthering reforms of the
financial sector. Allocation of the exceptional resources from the petroleum sector to
infrastructure and the social sectors is appropriate, and the basic budget deficit over the two

25
years 2008-2009 is lower than in the original program. The comprehensive actions taken to
strengthen public financial management are welcome. Efforts must now focus on casting the
budget preparation in a medium-term framework, with a careful integration of the recurrent
costs implied by the expansion of public investment. The reform in corporate taxation
planned for 2009 is necessary to improve the investment climate, attract FDI, and diversify
the economy.
38.
The efforts to reinforce debt management are welcome; the authorities remain
attentive that the debt contracted for ambitious infrastructure projects, including a major
dam on the Niger river, are at largely concessional terms and consistent with debt
sustainability.
39.
Deepening financial intermediation is crucial to support economic activity.
While the authorities are keen to promote credit to housing and agriculture, it is important to
avoid establishing narrowly-based institutions that could carry excessive risks.
40.
Given the strength of the program and the corrective actions taken by the
authorities, the staff recommends Board approval of the authorities’ request for a waiver
for the non observance of two PCs, modification of PCs, and completion of the first review
under the PRGF arrangement.
41.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation be held under the 24 month
consultation cycle, subject to the Board decision on consultation cycles (Decision
No. 12794-(02/7) dated July 15, 2002, as amended).

APPENDIX I—LETTER OF INTENT
Niamey, December 3, 2008

Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431

Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
1.
The government is continuing to implement the policies and reforms envisaged in
the PRGF-supported program which was approved at end-May 2008. By end-October 2008,
all the quantitative and structural performance criteria were met, with the exception of two:
the quantitative criterion on the reduction of domestic arrears by end-June 2008, for which I
request a waiver, as corrective steps have already been taken; and the structural criterion on
the adoption before end-September of the procedures for repayment of the frozen deposits of
the former National Post and Savings Office (ONPE). Those procedures were established in
early December 2008, and therefore I also request a waiver for this criterion.
2.
With regard to the structural benchmarks, the adoption of the medium-term
expenditure framework for infrastructure and transport, planned for end-November 2008,
was postponed to end-June 2009, in view of the need for technical assistance in this area.
3.
Economic activity during 2008 was favorable, and GDP growth in 2008 is expected
to be driven by an excellent harvest and by activity in the mining, telecommunications, and
construction sectors. Consumer prices continued to rise until end-July 2008, with a sharp
increase in food prices, but prices stabilized thereafter. The government has made significant
efforts to support the most vulnerable segments of the population, with free distribution of
foodstuffs, moderate-priced sales, and nutritional programs undertaken by the food security
mechanism, which receives lender support.
4.
Basic budgetary expenditure in the first nine months of 2008, excluding externally
financed investment, remained below program objectives, whereas revenue greatly exceeded
the projections, thanks also to nonrecurring revenue derived from the conclusion of an oil
agreement. As a result, the fiscal deficit and domestic financing were smaller than anticipated
in the program.

35
5.
The government of Niger requests completion of the first review of the
PRGF-supported program. The program for the last part of 2008 and for 2009 aims at
enhancing the efficiency of public expenditure, mobilizing domestic resources, and
strengthening the financial system and the business environment. This program, the main
components of which are described in the attached memorandum on economic and financial
policies, is aligned with the objectives of the Accelerated Development and Poverty
Reduction Strategy for 2008-12, which was adopted in October 2007.
6.
As in the past, the government consents to the publication by the International
Monetary Fund of this letter of intent, the memorandum on economic and financial policies,
the technical memorandum of understanding, and the IMF staff report. The government
believes that the policies set out in the attached MEFP are sufficient to ensure attainment of
the objectives of its program and will take any additional measures that may be necessary to
that end. Niger will consult the IMF on the adoption of such measures and prior to any
change in the policies set out in the MEFP, in accordance with IMF policies on such
consultations.
Sincerely yours,
/S/
Ali Mahaman Lamine Zeine
Minister of Economy and Finance

36
APPENDIX I —ATTACHMENT I
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies of the Government of Niger
for 2008-09
I. MACROECONOMIC FRAMEWORK FOR 2008 AND 2009
1.
Economic trends in the first nine months of 2008 saw an upsurge in food and fuel
prices until August, reflecting the fact that international prices had been rising sharply since
the latter months of 2007. Beginning in August 2008, however, the prices of cereals and
other food products began to decline, because the harvest has begun well, thanks to highly
favorable rainfall. In the 12 month to August 2008, inflation measured on the basis of the
consumer price index reached 15 percent, but the index fell slightly between July and
August. The prices of cereal prices on domestic markets began to decline in August and
September. To soften the impact of the price increases, in March and in June the
government adopted tax relief measures on sensitive foodstuffs. Thus in March, the VAT
and customs duties in rice were suspended; in June the suspension of customs duties was
extended to include milk, excise taxes on edible oil were also suspended, while reference
values for customs taxation purposes for sugar and wheat flour were reduced (by
17 percent). However, the impact of these measures on price levels has been disappointing.
Accordingly, in August the government decided to carry out direct imports of rice and sugar
to offer for sale at reduced prices throughout the country through the national agency OPVN
(Niger Foodstuffs Office), (3000 tons for each product). The government’s actions were
combined with the interventions made by the national food security system in using the
strategic (buffer) stock; sales were made at reduced prices in June-July (15,000 tons of
cereals), as were free targeted distributions amounting to approximately 14,000 tons. These
interventions made it possible to discontinue the suspension of import duties and taxes in
mid-September. In light of the good harvest, the price index may decline by approximately
3 percent between August and the end of the year, bringing inflation by year-end on a year
on year basis to approximately 8.5 percent. The GDP deflator is projected to increase by
8.3 percent between 2007 and 2008. For 2009, the consumption index is expected to
increase at an annual average rate of 2.5 percent and the GDP deflator by 2.2 percent.
2.
GDP growth at constant prices in 2008 is expected to reach 5.9 percent based on the
latest estimates, compared to 3.3 percent in 2007, thanks to an 11.6 percent increase in value
added in agriculture, substantial growth in construction and public works, and favorable
performance by industry and services. Conversely, mining production is expected to remain
stable. The investment GDP ratio is expected to remain at a high level, of about 26.3 percent,
reflecting sizable investments in the sectors of telecommunications, energy, and mines.
3.
In 2009, GDP growth may attain 4.5 percent; investment should be supported by a set
of key initiatives in the agriculture, mining, roads, and energy sectors. These include the
initiation of work on the Kandadji dam, the rehabilitation and development of irrigation

37
systems, the development of a new coal mine in Tahoua, and the related construction of
an electricity power station, the launching of investments for the full development of
the Imourarem uranium mine and of the Agadem oil field, further prospecting in Agadem,
and work on an oil refinery and a pipeline of approximately 580 kilometers connecting
the oil field to the refinery.
4.
The external current account deficit is projected to increase to 11 percent of GDP in
2008 (9.1 percent in 2007) in spite of a 25 percent increase in uranium exports, on account of
the upward revision of export prices, which more than compensates for a decline in volumes.
Exports of agricultural products are also rising sharply, thanks to a good harvest. Imports in
value terms are expected to increase by approximately 21 percent, because of a substantial
upturn in prices of hydrocarbons and rice during a big part of the year, as well as the
significant increase in capital goods reflecting the growth in private and public investment.
The anticipated rise in direct investment and external project financing for projects should
lead to a slight upturn in net foreign assets of the central bank.
5.
In 2009 the current account deficit is expected to increase further to 24 percent of
GDP, because of higher imports related to the execution of investments in the mining,
petroleum, telecommunications, energy, and services sectors. At the same time, export
volumes for uranium and gold are projected to pick up again. The current account will be
largely financed by private direct investment, estimated at approximately 13 percent of GDP.
6.
The national buffer stock of cereals, currently standing at 12,000 tons after the sales
in recent months, will be brought back to 50,000 tons by March 2009, through purchasing
operations financed through budget appropriations scheduled for 2007 and 2008
(CFAF 2.2 billion) but not yet disbursed, and support from donors and lenders. The national
system for the management and prevention of food crises, constituted by the OPVN, the food
crisis unit (CCA), and the early warning system (SAP), will continue to play a key role in
efforts to combat food insecurity, with support from donors and international organizations,
through the nutrition program, targeted free distributions, cash-for-work programs, and the
creation of cereal banks. To ensure that this role can be effectively discharged, the
continuous support of donors is necessary, coupled with contributions from the national
budget. The budget appropriations in the amount of CFAF 2.2 billion in favor of the national
food security system will be disbursed in December 2008.
II. PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION AND FISCAL OUTLOOK FOR THE
REMAINDER OF 2008
7.
During the first nine months of 2008, program implementation has been
satisfactory—however, two performance criteria were not observed in timely fashion
although corrective measures were rapidly adopted. Thus, at end-June 2008 the reduction in
domestic arrears amounted to CFAF 5.8 billion against a programmed amount of
CFAF 7 billion, but further reductions were made in July (CFAF 2.9 billion). The other

38
quantitative performance criteria and indicators for end-June were all met. Steps are being
taken to ensure that the target of CFAF 15 billion for the reduction of arrears at year-end is
achieved. The programming of this reduction has already been completed; inter alia, it
includes the full settlement of Treasury arrears dating from 2004 to 2006, the repayment of
arrears to private suppliers, and additional repayments of the arrears of embassies and to
international organizations. The performance criterion regarding the establishment of
procedures for repaying the frozen deposits of the former ONPE (National Postal and
Savings Office) before end-September 2008 was not complied with, but the necessary
regulations have been adopted in early December.
8.
During the first nine months of the year, revenues comfortably overshot the program
target, chiefly reflecting the collection at end-June of a signing bonus for a petroleum
production sharing contract (CFAF 123.4 billion, equivalent to 5.5 percent of GDP). The
revenue target for end-June was achieved, even without taking into account these exceptional
revenues. On the expenditure side, outlays remained below projections in the first six months
of the year.
9.
The supplementary budget approved at end-May was in line with program
projections. This supplementary budget allocates the bulk of the nonrecurring revenues to
priority expenditures. These nonrecurring revenues originate from the sale of mining assets
and of a telecom license (respectively CFAF 12 and CFAF 32 billion) and were collected at
end-2007 but not included in the initial budget for 2008; nonrecurring dividends of uranium
enterprises collected in early 2008 (CFAF 15 billion); upward revision of tax receipts on the
same enterprises; and budgetary assistance from the WAEMU and the BCEAO, for a total of
CFAF 76 billion (3.7 percent of GDP). The supplementary budget also took into account the
revenue shortfall attributable to the suspension of duties and taxes on rice and milk, the
excise tax on oils, and the reduction of the taxable base on sugar and flour, estimated at
CFAF 11.3 billion.
10.
For the whole of 2008, tax receipts are forecast at CFAF 256 billion (11.6 percent of
GDP, as in 2007) as against CFAF 260 billion in the program (including revenues for
the account of local governments and Community institutions), while nontax receipts are
projected at CFAF 25 billion, excluding the one-time signing bonus, compared to
CFAF 30 billion under the program. The shortfall in tax receipts is primarily due to the
exemptions on food products, which was extended beyond the three months initially planned.
The shortfall in nontax receipts is attributable to lower-than-anticipated dividends from
a mining company.
11.
Domestically financed expenditures are projected to remain in line with program
forecasts, with the exception of a government participation in the capital of the new refinery
company to be established before year-end (CFAF 19 billion) and a supplementary transfer
to OPVN of CFAF 11 billion (funded through the signing bonus) for interventions to
purchase cowpeas, after the good harvest, in order to take advantage of the favorable

39
developments on the international market for this product. The remainder of the bonus will
be used in 2009 in accordance with the 2009 budget’s specifications. In 2008, the basic
budget surplus, which excludes externally funded investment, is expected to record a deficit
of 0.6 percent of GDP. Externally funded investments should be slightly below initial
forecasts (CFAF 142 billion, as against CFAF 154 billion).
12.
External budgetary assistance is expected to reach CFAF 38.9 billion in 2008, as
against CFAF 80.8 billion under the initial program. The shortfall is attributable to the delays
in finalizing a new program with the AfDB, lower-than-anticipated disbursements related to
EU assistance, in addition to a delay in the disbursement of budgetary assistance for 2008
from the World Bank and France. The year will record a substantial increase in central
government deposits at the central bank, on account of the signing bonus. Discussions will be
held with the central bank to amend the two agreements of July 2006 for the consolidation of
the advances to the Treasury.
13.
With respect to strengthening fiscal management, the most significant progress in
2008 has to do with the establishment of the pilot unit (salle pilote), which is expected to
accelerate expenditure commitment procedures for all ministries; the general directorate for
the supervision of public procurement will be strengthened by raising its staffing levels;
heightened supervision will be exercised over flows of imports to ports and the collection of
port revenues will increase. The interconnection between customs border offices and regional
customs offices is in progress, thanks to substantial assistance from the EU, which should
facilitate efforts to improve imports monitoring. It is, however, necessary to strengthen the
human and physical resources of the general directorate of customs (DGD) and of the general
directorate of taxes (DGI) (recruitment, training, vehicles, office space) through adequate
budget funding. For this purpose, the 2009 budget law allocates additional resources for these
directorates.
14.
Data on budget outturn for 2008—including figures on the unified list of priority
expenditures and on the President’s Special Program—will be published by end-March 2009
on a website or in a government publication to allow for a higher degree of transparency in
expenditure management (structural benchmark). The end-year Treasury accounts
(comptes de gestion) for 2006 were examined by the Audit Office and the 2006 budget
review law (loi de règlement) has been adopted by the National Assembly.
15.
The reform of the financial system has continued with the launching of the privatized
Crédit du Niger, which is designed to provide housing credit; the commencement of
operations of the microfinance regulatory agency; and the rehabilitation of certain
microfinance networks. With reference to the postal bank Finaposte, the mobilization of
capital in the amount of CFAF 5 billion will be completed shortly, and its licensing as a
banking institution will be rapidly requested from the regional Banking Commission. The
government has defined in early December the modalities for the repayment of the frozen
deposits of the former ONPE, which amount to CFAF 4.8 billion.

40
16.
The expansion of credit to the economy maintained its momentum during the first
six months of the year (20 percent increase), thanks to the demand for credit, primarily from
the mining and telecommunication sectors; the expansion of the money supply was 3 percent.
Over the entire year, growth in credit to the economy is projected at 22 percent and growth in
the money supply is projected at 24 percent. The foreign assets of the central bank increased
substantially in the first half of the year, reflecting the receipt of the signing bonus in June;
they may increase by CFAF 100 billion over the year as a whole.
III. THE 2009 PROGRAM
A. The 2009 Budget and Fiscal Reforms
17.
The budget for 2009 is primarily designed to support the Accelerated Development
and Poverty Reduction Strategy (SDRP) for 2008-12 and to use the resources from
the signing bonus collected in 2008 to strengthen priority sectors. The preparation of
the 2009 budget was strengthened thanks to closer cooperation with the permanent secretariat
of the SDRP and the action plans for priority sectors. Taking account of the utilization of the
bonus, the basic budget deficit should amount to CFAF 134 billion (5.4 percent of GDP).
Total revenues, which are expected to attain CFAF 284 billion excluding the bonus
(12.2 percent of GDP) in 2008, are expected to rise to CFAF 305 billion (12.2 percent of
GDP) in 2009, including CFAF 288 billion in tax receipts. Tax receipts are projected to rise
from 11 percent of GDP in 2008 to 11.6 percent of GDP in 2009. The highest growth should
involve the VAT, registration taxes for government contracts, and profit taxes. Customs
receipts are also forecast to increase by approximately 5 percent.
18.
Nontax receipts are expected to reach CFAF 14.1 billion, including substantial
dividends from SOPAMIN, which should turn a profit of around CFAF 14 billion in 2008.
19.
The total amount of domestic expenditures, excluding externally funded capital
expenditure, is provisionally established at CFAF 438 billion (17.6 percent of GDP),
compared to CFAF 422 billion in 2008 (18.1 percent of GDP), with current expenditure
amounting to 12.8 percent of GDP (12.9 percent of GDP in 2008), including 0.6 percent of
GDP for the organization of elections. The increase in personnel-related outlays (8 percent of
GDP) reflects recruitments in education and health. Domestically funded capital expenditure,
including HIPC resources, should reach CFAF 120 billion, equivalent to 4.8 percent of GDP
(5.2 percent of GDP in 2008) reflecting a reasonable rate of execution of budget
appropriations. This is attributable to sizable allocations for rural roads and highways,
irrigation, the Kandadji dam, medical equipment, as well as for electricity, in an effort to
reduce the country’s dependence on external supplies (CFAF 10 billion).
20.
Externally funded projects are expected to grow noticeably and to reach
CFAF 213 billion in 2009 (8.6 percent of GDP) as against CFAF 142 billion (6.1 percent of
GDP) anticipated in 2008, reflecting the planned disbursements of the Global Fund for

41
AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the US Millennium Challenge Account, the acceleration of
the road and agricultural development program, and the start of work on the Kandadji dam.
21.
External budget assistance is expected to amount to CFAF 91.7 billion, including
assistance in respect of a new structural adjustment program of the AfDB, as well as an IDA
disbursement in the amount of US$40 million initially scheduled for December 2007. On the
basis of these projections, domestic financing of the budget is projected to amount to
CFAF 65 billion, chiefly accounted for by the utilization of deposits at the Central Bank
created as a result of the signing bonus received in June 2008.
22.
Domestic arrears will be reduced by CFAF 15 billion, on the basis of a program
designed to settle in priority the arrears to the private sector, the suppliers to the embassies,
the arrears to the international organizations, the rents, and the arrears on investments.
23.
Major reforms of the tax system will take place in 2009, as envisaged in the initial
program, to simplify the system and to eliminate those features that hamper the development
of the private sector. Regarding the reimbursement of VAT credits to exporters, during 2009
the Tax Directorate (DGI) will review its technical and institutional aspects and assess the
impact of the full reimbursement. Before end-2009 the provisions of article 34 of the tax
code pertaining to the reimbursement of VAT export credits will be reformulated, in order to
eliminate any ceiling to these reimbursements to exporting firms, while ensuring that no
reimbursement is effected on domestic sale (performance criterion for end-December 2009).
The rate of the profit tax will be reduced from 35 to 30 percent before end-December 2009
(performance criterion), to be applied to profits reported for FY 2009 and following years
(performance criterion) Effective January 1, 2009, the profit tax (ISB) withholding at
customs will be lowered from 7 to 5 percent for those taxpayers lacking a tax identification
number (NIF), to ensure alignment with the rules set forth in the WAEMU directive.
24.
A review of the IRVM (impôts sur les revenus des valeurs mobilières—tax on
investment income) will be carried out in 2009, with a view to standardize the rates, and to
align them to the UEMOA guidelines. Similarly a review of the real estate tax (taxe
immobilière) will be carried out in 2009 to prepare its simplification.
25.
Furthermore, other reforms are currently under consideration with a view to further
simplify corporate and personal income taxes. Discussions on the reform of the investment
code have been initiated. The purpose of this reform will be to eliminate non essential tax
advantages, whereas the ordinary tax code should eliminate the penalizing impact on
investors resulting from the VAT on capital goods, and allow accelerated amortization
instead of the five-year exemption on the profit tax. In the meantime, the tax advantages set
forth in the investment code should be strictly limited in time, without extension, in order to
limit tax losses.

42
26.
With respect to public finance management, in 2009 efforts will focus on:
(i) strengthening financial controls, by increasing the number of controllers and their
training; to support the decentralization process, it is envisaged to appoint one financial
controller for each region; (ii) strengthening the DGCMP (General Directorate for the
Supervision of Public Procurement), and lowering the threshold for contracts subject to its
supervision from CFAF 300 million to CFAF 100 million; (iii) expediting the reporting of
information between decentralized budget offices (centres de sous ordonnancement) in the
regions and the general budget directorate. The updating of action plans of the development
and poverty reduction strategy (SDRP), which will be completed in November 2008, and the
updating of the medium-term expenditure frameworks (MTEFs) for priority sectors will
make it possible to strengthen the preparation of the 2010 budget in a medium-term
framework. Thus, the presentation memorandum for the 2010 Budget Law will include
projections for the main budgetary revenue and expenditure aggregates for the period
2010-2012 (structural benchmark). Technical assistance from the IMF will be requested to
assist in the preparation of a comprehensive MTEF. The MTEF for the infrastructure and
transport sectors is currently being prepared with assistance from the World Bank.
B. Debt Management
27.
As envisaged under the initial program, the authorities have strengthened the Debt
Directorate with external assistance. Semiannual reports on recent borrowing, and
prospective debt trends resulting from planned borrowing agreements, have begun to be
produced since the first such report in October 2008. Loan disbursements should accelerate
in 2009–10 reflecting the finalization of the loan agreements for the construction of the
Kandadji dam, which during its initial phase will result in approximately US$210 million of
new drawings. Close attention will be paid to the terms of these loans, which will in no
circumstances have a grant element lower than 35 percent (continuous performance
criterion); the authorities will endeavor to obtain terms implying a grant element higher than
this floor. The Debt Directorate is in a position to conduct the periodic analysis of debt
sustainability. Thanks to the favorable trends in exports, the debt ratio over the next 20 years
is expected to remain well within the accepted thresholds (150 percent for the NPV ratio of
debt-exports, and 40 percent for the NPV ratio of debt-GDP). However, these ratios are
highly sensitive to the terms of borrowing, thus requiring heightened vigilance over
borrowing terms.
C. Management of Petroleum Resources
28.
The government has entered into an oil production sharing contract and it has granted
an operating permit (permis d’exploitation) to the firm CNPC pertaining to the Agadem
block, and it has signed an agreement with the same company to construct a 20,000 barrel per
day refinery in Zinder as well as a pipeline of approximately 580 kilometers from the oil field
to the refinery. The refinery and the pipeline should be in operation by 2012. The refinery
will be managed by a company in which the state will hold a 40 percent equity stake.

43
Domestic consumption will absorb about one third of output, and the remainder will be
exported. A petroleum products purchase contract (contrat d’enlèvement) is scheduled to be
signed with the national company SONIDEP (Société Nigérienne des Produits Pétroliers).
The sale of crude oil to the refinery and the sale of refined products will be made on a
commercial basis. The government will offer no guarantees for any loans which the refinery
company may take out to finance the investment.
D. Money, Credit, and the Financial System
29.
In 2009, the expansion of credit to the economy should hold steady, reflecting
the continuation of major investment projects. The foreign assets of the central bank may
decline, following the sharp upturn in 2008, and the growth in the money supply may reach
18 percent. The strengthening of the financial system will continue. Efforts are being made
to strengthen housing credit, the specialty of Crédit du Niger, and credit for agriculture.
Regarding credit for agriculture, further analysis is needed to identify the most effective
options for increasing the supply of credit to the sector, in light of the difficulties which the
agricultural banks have experienced in other countries of the subregion. In order to promote
housing credit, steps will be taken to expedite real estate titling, through rapid strengthening
of land registry services. Microfinance networks will be further strengthened through support
from donors and the State. The newly established Microfinance Regulation Agency will play
a key role in supervising and strengthening the sector.
E. Other Structural Reforms
30.
Concerted efforts will be made to achieve further improvements in the business
climate. The numbers of procedures and days necessary to create a business have been
considerably reduced in recent years. However, the cost of setting up a business remains
high, primarily on account of fees for enrollment in the Register of Commerce at the courts;
the government has pledged to reduce these fees by end-June 2009 (structural benchmark).
IV. PROGRAM MONITORING
31.
Program monitoring is based on semiannual and continuous quantitative performance
criteria, structural performance criteria, quantitative and structural benchmarks (Tables 1
and 2) as well as standard continuous PCs. The performance criteria and benchmarks are
presented in the TMU. The quarterly ceilings on domestic financing, net of the position in the
IMF, will be adjusted upward in the event of a shortfall in external budgetary assistance
(net of external debt service) in relation to program forecasts, for up to a maximum of
CFAF 30 billion. It is also requested that the performance criterion on the net domestic
financing of the government for end-December 2008 be modified to take into account the
signature bonus, and that the performance criterion on the reimbursement of VAT credits be
modified and set for end-2009. The second, third, and fourth program review will be
conducted with the IMF respectively by end-May 2009, end-November 2009, and
end-May 2010.

APPENDIX I—ATTACHMENT II
TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
Niamey, December 3, 2008
1.
This technical memorandum of understanding defines the performance criteria and
indicative targets for Niger's program under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF) for the period 2008-11. The performance criteria and indicative targets for
end-December 2008 and for 2009 are set out in Table 1 of the government's Memorandum
of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) dated December 3, 2008 and attached hereto.
This technical memorandum of understanding also sets out data-reporting requirements for
monitoring the program.
I. DEFINITION OF TERMS
2.
For the purpose of this technical memorandum, the following definitions of "debt,"
"government," "payments arrears," and "government obligations" will be used:
(a)
As specified in point 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with
Respect to Foreign Debt adopted by the Executive Board of the IMF on August 24,
2000, debt will be understood to mean a current, that is, not contingent, liability,
created under a contractual arrangement through the provision of value in the form of
assets (including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make one or
more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, according to a
specific schedule; these payments will discharge the obligor of the principal and/or
interest liabilities incurred under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the
primary ones being as follows: (i) loans, that is, advances of money to the obligor by
the lender made on the basis of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in
the future (including deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans, and buyers'
credits) and temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized
loans, under which the obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest,
by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase
agreements and official swap arrangements); (ii) suppliers' credits, that is, contracts
where the supplier permits the obligor to defer payments until some time after the
date on which the goods are delivered or services are provided; and (iii) leases, that
is, arrangements under which property is provided that the lease holder has the right
to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter than the
total expected service life of the property, while the lease grantor retains the title to
the property. For the purpose of this guideline, the debt is the present value (at the
inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the period of
the agreement, excluding those payments necessary for the operation, repair, or
maintenance of the property. Under the definition of debt set out above, arrears,
penalties, and judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment
under a contractual obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment

48
on an obligation that is not considered debt under this definition (for example,
payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt.
(b)
Government refers to the central government of the Republic of Niger;
it does not include any political subdivision, public entity, or central bank with
a separate legal personality.
(c)
External payment arrears are external payments due but not paid.
Domestic payment arrears are domestic payments due but not paid. They
include (i) arrears outstanding at end-1999 identified by the audit conducted by
the Ministry of Finance in 2005; (ii) the reste à payer at the Treasury related
to the budgetary years 2004, 2005 and 2006, remaining due at December 31,
2007.
(d)
Government obligation is any financial obligation of the
government accepted as such by the government (including any
government debt).
II. QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
A. Net Domestic Financing of the Government
Definition
3.
Net domestic financing of the government is defined as the sum of (i) net bank
credit to the government, as defined below; (ii) net nonbank domestic financing of the
Government, including government securities issued in CFA francs on the WAEMU
regional financial market and not held by resident commercial banks, proceeds from the sale
of government assets, and privatization receipts net of the cost of structural reforms to
which these proceeds are earmarked.
4.
Net bank credit to the government is equal to the balance of the government's
claims and debts vis-à-vis national banking institutions. Government claims include cash
holdings by the Nigerien Treasury, deposits with the central bank and commercial banks, and
secured obligations. Government debt to the banking system includes debt vis-à-vis the
central bank (excluding net financing from the IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF), but including government securities) and to commercial banks (including
government securities held by commercial banks), and deposits with the postal checking
system.
5.
The scope of the net bank credit to the government as defined by the BCEAO
includes all central government administrations. Net bank credit to the government and the
amounts of government treasury bills and bonds issued in CFA francs on the regional
financial market of the WAEMU are calculated by the BCEAO, and the net nonbank
financing of the government is calculated by the Nigerien Treasury, whose figures are those
deemed valid within the context of the program.

49
6.
Nonbank net domestic financing includes (i) the change in the amount of
government bonds issued in the regional WAEMU market and not held by Niger's
commercial banks; (ii) the change in the deposits of Treasury correspondents; (iii) the change
in "comptes de consignations" at the Treasury.
7.
The 2008 quarterly targets are based on the change in stock between end-December
2007 and the date considered for the performance criterion or the indicative target. Those for
2009 are based on the change in stock between end-December 2008 and the date considered
for the performance criterion or the indicative target.
Adjustment
8.
The ceiling on net domestic financing will be subject to adjustments if
disbursements of external budgetary support less external debt service and arrears payments,
including disbursements under the PRGF, fall short of projected amounts. For 2008, external
budget support is calculated from end-December 2007, and for 2009 from end-December
2008.
9.
If disbursements fall short of projected external budgetary assistance for each quarter
in 2008 and 2009, the corresponding quarterly ceilings on net domestic financing will be
raised pro tanto, up to a maximum of CFAF 30 billion.
Reporting requirement
10.
Detailed data on domestic financing to government will be provided monthly within
six weeks after the end of each month.
B. Reduction of Domestic Payments Arrears
Definition
11.
Domestic payments arrears comprise (i) arrears identified at end-1999 on the basis
of the audit conducted by the Ministry of Finance in 2005; (ii) the reste à payer(RAP) at the
Treasury for budget years 2004, 2005, 2006 outstanding at end-2007. The stock of arrears
will be reduced to the minimum of the amounts indicated in Table 1 annexed to the MEFP.
The quarterly objectives for 2008 and 2009 are based on the changes in the stock of arrears
from end-December 2007, and from end-December 2008, respectively, and the date selected
for the performance criterion or indicative target. The stock of RAP at end-2008 for the 2008
budget year will not exceed the stock of RAP outstanding at end-2007 for the 2007 budget
year; any excess will be considered an increase in arrears, that will be deducted from the
reduction of arrears as defined as the beginning of this paragraph. Similarly , the stock of
RAP at end-2009 for the 2009 budget will not exceed the stock of RAP at end-2008 for the
2008 budget year.
12.
The Centre d 'Amortissement de la Dette Intérieure de l 'Etat (CADDIE) and the
Treasury are responsible for calculating the stock of domestic arrears, and recording their
repayments.

50
Reporting requirement
13.
Monthly data on the outstanding balance, accumulation (including changes in the reste
à payer at the Treasury), and repayment of domestic payments arrears on government
obligations will be provided monthly within six weeks following the end of each month.
C. Reduction of External Payments Arrears
Definition
14.
Government debt is outstanding debt owed or guaranteed by the government. For the
program, the government undertakes not to accumulate external arrears on government debt
(including treasury bills and bonds issued in CFA francs on the WAEMU regional financial
market), with the exception of external payments arrears arising from government debt being
renegotiated with external creditors, including Paris Club creditors.
Reporting requirement
15.
Data on the outstanding balance, accumulation, and repayment of external payments
arrears will be provided monthly within six weeks following the end of each month.
D. External Nonconcessional Loans Contracted or
Guaranteed by the Government of Niger
Definition
16.
The government will not contract or guarantee external debt with original maturity of
one year or more with a grant element of less than 35 percent. Nonconcessional external debt
is defined as all debt with a concessionality level of less than 35 percent. To calculate the
level of concessionality for loans with a maturity of at least 15 years, the discount rate to be
used is the 10-year average commercial interest reference rate (CIRR), calculated by the IMF
on the basis of the rates published by the OECD; for loans of less than 15 years, the
six-month average CIRR is to be used. The Ministry of Finance will communicate regularly to
Fund staff the list of loans under negotiations, and, in case of objections, the Fund staff will
have to express any objections within two weeks.
17.
This performance criterion applies not only to debt as defined in point 9 of the
Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Dept adopted by the Executive
Board on August 24, 2000, but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for which
value has not been received. However, this performance criterion does not apply to financing
provided by the Fund, to debt rescheduling in the form of new loans, and to treasury notes and
bonds issued in CFA francs on the WAEMU regional financial market.

51
Reporting requirement
18.
Details on any external government debt will be provided monthly within six weeks
after the end of each month. The same requirement applies to guarantees extended by
the central government.
E. Short-Term External Debt of the Central Government
Definition of the performance criterion
19.
The government will not accumulate or guarantee new external debt with original
maturity of less than one year. This performance criterion applies not only to debt as defined
in point 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt adopted
on August 24, 2000, but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has
not been received. Excluded from this performance criterion are short-term, import-related
trade credits and short-term treasury notes issued in CFA francs on the regional financial
market.
Reporting requirement
20.
Details on any external government debt will be provided monthly within six weeks
following the end of each month. The same requirement applies to guarantees extended by the
central government.
III. QUANTITATIVE TARGETS
A. Definitions
21.
Total revenue is an indicative target for the program. It includes tax, nontax, and
special accounts revenue, but excludes revenue from the settlement of reciprocal debts
between the government and enterprises.
22.
The basic fiscal deficit is defined as the difference between: (i) total fiscal revenue as
defined in paragraph 23; and (ii) total fiscal expenditure excluding foreign financed
investment (but including HIPC-financed investment).
23.
This information will be provided to the IMF monthly within six weeks after the end
of each month.
IV.

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value

framework is expressed in NPV terms at the decision point. Hence these two amounts can
not be added.
2/

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion

point corresponding to interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision
point but not disbursed during the interim period.
Decision point—point at which the IMF and the World Bank determine whether a
country qualifies for assistance under the HIPC Initiative and decide on the amount of
assistance to be committed.
Interim assistance—amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision
and completion points, up to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the assistance
committed at the decision point (or 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in
exceptional circumstances).
Completion point—point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its
assistance committed at the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of
interest income as defined in footnote 2 above. The timing of the completion point is
linked to the implementation of pre-agreed key structural reforms (i.e., floating
completion point).

IX.

Safeguards Assessments:

The Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) is the common central bank of the
countries of the West African Economic and Monetary Union, which includes Niger. The
most recent safeguards assessment of the BCEAO was completed on November 4, 2005. The
assessment indicated progress has been made in strengthening the bank's safeguards
framework since the 2002 assessment and identified some areas where further steps would
help solidify it.
The BCEAO now publishes a full set of audited financial statements and improvements have
been made to move financial reporting closer to International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS). Furthermore, an internal audit charter has been put in place, mechanisms for
improving risk management have been established, and follow up on internal and external
audit recommendations has been strengthened.
The results of continuous safeguards monitoring indicate that while certain vulnerabilities
remain in internal control systems and legal structure, there has been some progress in other
areas, including through: (i) improving the external audit process by adopting a multi-year
audit program; (ii) establishing an audit committee; (iii) expanding disclosures on financial
positions of WAEMU countries with the Fund in the notes to the annual financial statements;
and (iv) further strengthening of the effectiveness of the internal audit function.
X.

Exchange Arrangements:

Niger is a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). The
exchange system, common to all members of the WAEMU, is free of restrictions on the
making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. The WAEMU’s
common currency, the CFA franc, was originally pegged to the French franc. On January 12,

6
1994, the CFA franc was devalued by 50 percent in foreign currency terms, and the exchange
rate was adjusted from CFAF 50 = F 1 to CFAF 100 = F 1. Effective December 31, 1998, the
parity was switched to the Euro at a rate of CFAF 655.96 = EUR 1. On November 7, 2008,
the rate of the CFA franc in SDR terms was SDR 1 = CFAF 764.25. The exchange
arrangement of the WAEMU countries is classified as a conventional pegged arrangement.
XI.

Article IV Consultation:

Niger is on the 24-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation discussions were held
in Niamey in September–October 2006, and discussed by the Executive Board on December 20,
2006.

III—STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of October 31, 2008)
1.
While the economic database is broadly adequate for surveillance and programming
purposes, there are deficiencies in the statistical system that complicate the monitoring of
certain economic developments. The common indicators for surveillance are generally
provided to the Fund on a timely basis. Weaknesses mainly affect the national accounts and
the public finance statistics. Niger participates in the General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS), and its metadata were posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin
Board on February 26, 2002. The metadata refer to January 2003 and need to be updated.
Metadata for the health and population data categories have not been updated since June
2001, and there are no plans for improvement for the poverty and education data categories.
As a follow-up to GDDS participation, STA technical assistance (funded by the Japanese
government) is being offered to eight member countries of the Western African Economic
and Monetary Union (WAEMU) to assist with implementation of plans for the
improvement of their statistical systems. A Fund regional statistical advisor initiated a
program of assistance in government finance statistics, which is now managed by the West
Africa Regional Technical Assistance Center (AFRITAC West).
2.
A mission visited Niamey in March 2005 to prepare the data module of the Report on
the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC). It carried out a review of data
dissemination practices against the GDDS, as well as an in-depth assessment of the quality of
national accounts, consumer price, monetary, balance of payments and government finance
statistics. The data ROSC, which was published on June 9, 2006, found that: (i) Niger does
not meet the recommendations of the GDDS for timeliness of all data categories;
(ii) improvements need to be made in data coverage (especially national accounts by
institutional sectors), periodicity (especially quarterly government financial statistics), and
timeliness (especially national accounts, government finance statistics, balance of payments);
and (iii) plans for improvement in these areas should address resource constraints, reinforce
the legal framework for data collection and coordination, and clarify the responsibilities for
dissemination of government operations and public debt data.
3.
Law No 2004-011 of March 2004 transformed the Statistical and National Accounts
Directorate of the Ministry of Economy and Finance into a National Statistical Office (INS),
and created a new unit responsible for statistical coordination, the National Council on
Statistics. Both the institute and the council initiated operations in June 2005.
Real sector
4.
Niger participates in WAEMU’s harmonization of statistical methodologies through
the multilateral surveillance process, currently seeking regional improvements in the area of
national accounts. Ongoing work on overhauling the national accounts and the resulting
change in the base year are based on the recommendations of the ROSC mission and
technical assistance from AFRISTAT. Under the GDDS project for the AFRITAC West
countries, a statistical register and an industrial production index have been established, and a

12
series of missions have taken place to assist in the implementation of the System of National
Accounts, 1993 (SNA 1993).
5.
While the national accounts compilation generally follows best methodological
practice, the data ROSC found that some gaps remain for the full adoption of the SNA 1993.
In addition, national accounts data originate mainly from administrative sources, with many
shortcomings, and the household and informal sector surveys are not up-to-date. This paucity
of data sources has compelled compilers to use some questionable statistical techniques.
GDP is estimated using the production and expenditure approaches, but is based on largely
obsolete ratios for many line items. In the absence of appropriate price indices, deflators are
mostly derived from the Harmonized Consumer Price Index (HCPI). The national accounts at
constant prices are established on an obsolete-base year, 1987. GDP validation possibilities
are limited because the same calculation methods are used for estimates and final data.
Efforts are being made to improve and widen data collection procedures, and reduce delays
in data dissemination. In 2007, the National Statistics Office (NSO) has decided to resume
the implementation of the 1993 System of National accounts (1993 SNA) using the ERETES
software. AFRITAC TA assessed in 2008 the reliability of source data used to compile the
NA for 2006.
6.
The new WAEMU’s HPCI was introduced in January 1998. However, the coverage is
limited to Niamey, the weights are based on a household budget survey conducted during
only three months in 1996. As noted, work is under way to revise the HPCI.
Public finances
7.
Monthly government finance statistics are compiled by the Ministry of Economy and
Finance (MEF) with a one- to four-month lag, based on information provided by the budget,
customs, tax, and treasury directorates. The MEF prepares a monthly reconciliation of
spending commitments made by the budget directorate and payments made by the treasury,
but the data are not disseminated to the general public. Data are limited to the operation of
the budgetary central government, that is covering the general budget, special funds, and
operations of the treasury special accounts. They do not cover the social security
administration. No final budget or treasury accounts are published at the end of the fiscal
year.
8.
Following their participation in the AFRITAC-WEST seminar on the GFSM 2001,
held in Lomé, Togo in November 2005, MEF has approved a strategy for migrating from the
methodology of the Government Finance Statistics Manual 1986 (GFSM 1986) to the new
GFSM 2001. No data are reported for publication in International Financial Statistics (IFS).
Monetary data
9.
The monetary statistics are generally based on the Guide to Money and Banking
Statistics in IFS (1984 Guide), but use an incomplete sectorization of assets and liabilities.
Implementation of the new Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM) has started,
but without a precise timetable. The source data for monetary statistics are generally reliable,
though they may be reported late. However, the free circulation of banknotes within

13
countries of the zone complicates the estimation of currency in circulation. Preliminary
monetary data are compiled by the national agency of the Central Bank of West African
States (BCEAO) and released officially by BCEAO headquarters. There has been an
improvement in the timeliness of data provided on interest rates, monetary institutions, and
deposit money banks. The authorities are now reporting monetary data to STA on a regular
basis, with a reduction in the lag from about six months to about three to four months. Most
of the key monetary statistical issues have been resolved.
Balance of payments data
10.
The balance of payments statistics are compiled in conformity with the Balance of
Payments Manual, Fifth Edition (BPM5). Since December 1998, the responsibility for
compiling and disseminating balance of payments statistics has been formally assigned to the
BCEAO by area-wide legislation adopted by the countries participating in the WAEMU. The
national agency of the BCEAO in Niamey is responsible for compiling and disseminating the
balance of payments statistics, and the BCEAO headquarters in Dakar for delineating the
methodology and calculating the international reserves managed on behalf of the
participating countries.
11.
Data consistency has significantly improved over the past few years, with a full
transition to the BPM5. The BCEAO national agency disseminates balance of payments
statistics with a seven month lag, exceeding GDDS guidelines. The BCEAO also compiles
and disseminates the annual data of the international investment position data with an
18-month lag.
12.
Further improvement in the data for services and transfers (especially workers’
remittances) will depend on the intensification of the contacts with reporting bodies.
Concerning the financial account, the foreign assets of the private nonbanking sector are still
not well covered, especially the assets of WAEMU residents, which are obtained through
partial surveys of residents’ foreign assets. The organization of an exhaustive annual survey
of foreign direct investment transactions is still at a very preliminary stage. The BCEAO has
recently updated the compilation of commercial bank data on payments involving
nonresidents (settlement reports). In principle, these settlement reports should be used to
produce a quarterly balance of payments. In practice, a tentative quarterly statement is
produced but not published, and these data are not used to produce annual balance of
payments estimates, but rather to assess existing information.

Niger remains at moderate risk of debt distress, although debt indicators have improved
compared with the 2007 DSA. The improvement is on account of projected increases in oil
and uranium exports predominantly financed through foreign direct investment (FDI).
I. BACKGROUND
1.
This joint IMF-World Bank debt sustainability analysis evaluates both the external
and the total public debt of Niger based on end-2007 data, using standard debt dynamics
templates for low-income countries. 1
2.
Niger’s debt ratios have been significantly reduced by debt relief, most recently
under the MDRI. Niger reached the HIPC Initiative completion point in April 2004 and in
2006 benefited from MDRI assistance from the IMF, IDA, and the African Development
Fund. Nominal external debt has thus fallen from over 90 percent of GDP at end-2000 to
about 15 percent of GDP at end-2007. By end-2007, debt to the AfDB, IDA and the IMF
accounted for 5 percent, 27 percent and 2 percent of external debt, respectively, while the
remainder was constituted by borrowing from other multilateral lenders.
II. UNDERLYING DSA ASSUMPTIONS
3.
The result of the current exercise differs from that of the 2007 DSA mainly because
of an expected acceleration of FDI and exports in 2008-15 resulting from the launch of an oil
production project as well as significant developments in the uranium sector. Box 1 describes
the two largest oil and uranium projects in Niger, along with some smaller investments, while
Box 2 presents in detail the main macroeconomic assumptions used for the baseline debt

The DSA was produced jointly by staffs of the IMF and the World Bank.

burden ratio calculations. The projected faster export growth in real terms (9 percent per year
in 2008–16) represents a break from the past (3.4 percent per year in 1998-2007) when
mining exports were stagnant.
Box 1: Large Investment Projects
Two very large investments and several smaller ones are planned over the next five years which will
generate significant government revenues: (i) the exploitation of petroleum in the Agadem field and
construction of a refinery; (ii) the development of the Imourarem uranium mine; and (iii) expansion
of the existing uranium mines and development of the Teguida mine. These play an important role in
improving the sustainability of Niger’s debt.
Agadem: A production-sharing contract with China National Oil and Gas Exploration and
Development Corporation (CNODC) was approved in June 2008. The project has three components:
the development of the Agadem oil field to extract reserves estimated at 324 million barrels, the
construction of a mini-refinery in Zinder with a capacity of 20,000 barrels per day, and a 580 km
pipeline linking the Agadem field to the refinery. The estimated cost is about US$1.3 billion.
Production is scheduled to begin in early 2012. Since the capacity of the refinery exceeds the local
consumption, much of the production will be exported. The operator will also conduct further
exploration and if sufficient new discoveries are made, exports of crude through a new pipeline are
envisaged. An initial payment of US$300 million has already been made to the Government, and
construction has started on the refinery.
Imourarem: The development of this new mine would involve an investment of about €1 billion
over the next five years and increase uranium production by about 5,000 tons by 2015, almost double
current national output of 2,900 tons. Formal negotiations have not yet reached closure, although they
are at an advanced stage.
Smaller uranium projects: The largest existing uranium mine, Somair, is in the process of
expanding its output by roughly 35 percent. The other main uranium mine, Cominak, is investing in
improved processing technology to raise its yield. A new mine at Teguida is being developed with
Chinese investment. These investments are already under way and together they will result in some
short term improvement in uranium output and a 40 percent increase in national output by 2012.
In total the above investments are projected to increase uranium production to 9,600 tons by 2015,
more than triple the current level. While the spot price of uranium has fallen with the recent global
economic slowdown, it remains well above the average for the last 20 years and similar to the price
set in current contracts in Niger. The long-term prospects for uranium remain strong given the
renewed interest in nuclear energy. There is no evidence to date that the financial crisis is affecting
the above investments, but some delays are not out of the question given the current global economic
slowdown.

III. EXTERNAL DSA
4.
In the baseline scenario, all external debt ratios remain below their policydependent indicative thresholds throughout the projection period (2008-28). The present
value (NPV) of debt-to-GDP ratio rises gradually and stabilizes below 25 percent by 2028,
and the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio levels off at about 95 percent (Table 1a and Figure 1).
The gradual rise in these indicators results from Niger’s high financing requirements, critical
for promoting growth and achieving the Millennium Development Goals: it is assumed that
one third of total project financing is in the form of concessional loans and the rest in grants.

5.
Given the uncertainties in the international environment, there are significant
risks to the oil and uranium projects due to their externally-financed nature. The risk is
further increased by the downward trend in oil prices and the fact that the Imourarem project
agreement remains to be finalized.
6.
Sensitivity tests show that although Niger’s external debt burden would worsen
if there were plausible adverse macroeconomic shocks, the ratios would remain below
their threshold levels in most scenarios. If key variables remain at the historical average of
the previous 10 years (scenario A1), the NPV of debt-to-GDP and debt-to-exports ratios
would rise to 14 percent and 59 percent respectively by 2028, remaining below the baseline
(see Table 2a). This lower debt profile in the historical scenario reflects less borrowing and
smaller current account deficits than are assumed going forward. Two other scenarios—a
temporary but substantial reduction in export growth (scenario B2), and a sizeable

4
deterioration of the terms for new borrowing (scenario A2) 2 —would significantly worsen
Niger’s NPV of debt to exports ratio, but still not violate the thresholds. Thresholds are
however, breached under two stress tests (scenarios B4 and B5). 3
7.
The external debt situation of the country is also resilient to alternative scenarios
particularly relevant to the case of Niger. In view of the recent lowering of the minimum
grant element for Niger to 35 percent, and the significance of the expected increase in oil
exports, alternative scenarios consider an average grant element of 35 percent for future
borrowing (scenario A3), a decline in oil prices to US$ 50 per barrel by 2012 (scenario A4),
the cancellation of new oil and uranium projects (scenario A5), and a low growth scenario
(A6 - GDP growth of 3.5 percent throughout the projection period). Under all these
scenarios, the debt indicators remain below the threshold levels.
IV. PUBLIC DSA
8.
As was the case in the 2007 DSA, consideration of total public debt, including
domestic debt, does not significantly alter the assessment. Domestic debt stood at
approximately 11 percent of GDP (43 percent of total public debt) at end-2007, but is
projected to fall under the baseline scenario, to about 4 percent of GDP by 2013 and
continuing to decline thereafter (Table 1b). This pattern is explained by relatively low
primary fiscal deficits, averaging 1.3 percent of GDP in the projection period. The average
interest rate on domestic debt is very low (1.4 percent) because the bulk of the debt is
constituted by non-interest bearing arrears, which are projected to be fully repaid by 2015.
9.
A significant proportion of domestic debt as of end-2007 is accounted for by
domestic arrears. The baseline analysis therefore takes into account the ongoing
implementation of a domestic arrears reduction plan, which reduces domestic debt to
15 percent of total public debt by 2013, and nearly eliminates it by 2017. Total public sector
debt (NPV) would remain stable at about 19 percent of GDP up to 2018 and then gradually
increase, driven solely by new external debt. Two sensitivity tests generate a significant rise
of public debt (Table 2b). The first is an alternative scenario that incorporates a slightly and
permanently lower GDP growth (scenario A3), and the second is a bound test (scenario B1)
2
3

Under scenario A2, interest costs are 2 percentage points above the baseline.

These stress tests reflect somewhat unlikely scenarios. Scenario B4 assumes that in 2009
and 2010 all non-debt creating flows (including foreign direct investment) are significantly
below their historical levels, while other current account components (including imports) are
kept as in the baseline scenario. Under these assumptions, the current account deficit widens
substantially because of high imports related to oil and uranium investments with no
matching FDI flows. However, this scenario is unlikely because the investment related
imports will occur only if foreign investment flows into the country to finance the oil and
uranium projects.

5
of strong, temporary lower growth in 2009-2010 4 . In the first case (A3), total public debt
(NPV) reaches about 43 percent of GDP and about 200 percent of forecast revenue by the
end of the projection period (Figure 2). In the second case (B1), the NPV of total public debt
grows up to 35 percent of GDP and 169 percent of revenue by 2028.
V. CONCLUSION
10.
With the expected increase in oil and uranium exports due to continuing
investments financed by FDI, Niger’s debt outlook has improved from the previous
DSA. However, the debt situation remains vulnerable to macroeconomic shocks,
particularly in an uncertain international environment. For this reason, Niger remains
at a moderate risk of external debt distress. Despite the recent improvement in the debt
sustainability outlook, the authorities should continue to pursue prudent debt policies,
combining maximum concessionality in new borrowing with sound macroeconomic
management and export diversification. Policies should aim at boosting growth and
diversifying the productive base of the economy, particularly exports, while continuing to
access grants and highly concessional loans.

4

Scenario A3 assumes that GDP growth is at baseline minus one standard deviation divided
by the length of the projection period. Scenario B1 assumes real GDP growth at the historical
average minus one standard deviation in 2009-10.

6

Box 2. Baseline scenario assumptions
The baseline macroeconomic scenario for 2008–28 hinges on the following assumptions:
• Real GDP growth is expected to rise from its historical average (1998-2007) of 4.8 percent to an
average of 5.2 percent in 2008–13, fostered mainly by increased investment in and production of oil and
uranium. In 2014-28, with oil and uranium production stabilizing, annual GDP growth is expected to
moderate to about 4.9 percent. This level is similar to the historical average, although Niger’s growth
potential could rise considerably due to current investments in irrigation and infrastructure, as well as
ongoing reforms to improve the investment climate.
• The investment rate is projected to be high in 2008-12, between 27 and 44 percent of GDP, largely as
a result of planned oil and uranium-related investments. Investment would hold steady at around
23 percent of GDP in 2013-28, as mining-related investment declines.
• The GDP deflator is expected to rise by 2.5 percent after 2008. In 2012, the introduction of oil into
Niger’s GDP would create a one-year, purely statistical, increase in the calculated deflator.
• The revenue-to-GDP ratio is projected to remain around 15 percent in 2008-28, with a temporary
increase in 2014-16 due to higher tax revenues from oil and uranium exports. Public expenditures would
remain high, between 23 and 24 percent of GDP through the rest of the projection period, reflecting the
authorities’ efforts to increase social spending and promote growth.
• The evolution of total exports in the medium term will be largely determined by developments in oil
and uranium exports resulting from investments to expand production and from higher prices. Between
2009 and 2011 investments to bring into production oil from the Agadem field would be equivalent to
30 percent of 2008 GDP. Its production could increase exports and reduce imports to narrow the current
account deficit by 8 percent of GDP between 2011 and 2012, assuming currently projected prices by the
IMF’s World Economic Outlook. Investments related to uranium in 2008-2012 are projected at about
30 percent of 2008 GDP, leading to a tripling of current production by 2014 mainly because of the new
Imourarem project. Uranium prices have increased by 50 percent from 2007 to 2008, and are
conservatively projected to increase by 2 percent per year in the medium term, in line with projected world
inflation.
• With the sharp increase in oil and uranium exports, overall export growth in constant prices is
projected at about 9 percent per year in 2008-16, which compares to 3.4 percent in the last 10 years when
mining exports were stationary. The stabilization of oil and uranium exports and a projected drop in gold
production (expected to peak in 2010) would result in a significant slowdown of exports after 2015, to a
growth rate in volume of about 2.5 percent per year in 2016-28.
• Oil and uranium-related activity will also boost other items of the current account because of
increased imports of equipment and capital goods, higher repatriation of profits, and larger compensation
to foreign employees. Hence, total imports in constant prices would grow about 8 percent on average
during 2008-15, with the current account deficit-to-GDP ratio peaking in 2011. Afterwards, imports are
projected to grow broadly in line with GDP growth, with the current account deficit as a share to GDP
declining gradually.
• The average interest rate on new external borrowing is projected at 1.2 percent, assuming half of new
external debt is contracted on IDA terms and half at an interest rate of about 2 percent. Project financing in
the form of external grants and loans is projected to rise in line with nominal GDP, with grants being two
thirds of the total. External budgetary financing will gradually fall as a share of GDP after reaching a peak
in 2009, with grants also about two-thirds of the total.
• The domestic debt profile assumes a reduction of domestic arrears in 2007-13 and no domestic
financing of the deficit after 2017. The average interest rate on the stock of debt is very low (1.4 percent)
because arrears do not incur interest charges. The interest rate of new domestic financing up to 2017 is
assumed at 4 percent.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and r = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with Niger
On December 19, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Niger. 1 It also completed the first review of Niger’s
performance under a three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement
approved on May 28, 2008.
Background
Niger’s main challenge continues to be boosting economic growth to sustainably reduce
poverty. The landlocked country, heavily dependent upon drought-prone subsistence
agriculture, ranks 174th out of 177 countries on the United Nations Human Development Index.
The population is not only among the poorest but also one of the fastest growing in the world
(3.3 percent a year).
Since 2000, political stability has been restored; the authorities have followed prudent
macroeconomic policies, supported by three successive PRGF arrangements; and GDP growth
(averaging 4.4 percent per year) has kept ahead of population growth, except during two
devastating droughts. During the previous PRGF-supported program (2005-2008), which
expired in May 2008, significant progress was achieved in macroeconomic stability, revenue
mobilization, expenditure management, and restoration of creditworthiness. Debt relief from the
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
(MDRI) granted in 2004–06 and prudent borrowing policies have greatly relieved the debt
burden and increased fiscal space. Critical factors required to achieve higher growth and reduce
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
poverty, in line with the Poverty Reduction Strategy for 2008–12, are (i) continued prudent
macroeconomic management; (ii) improvements in the investment climate; and (iii) considerable
external assistance on very concessional terms.
Macroeconomic performance was satisfactory in 2007, although growth decelerated. It slowed
to 3.3 percent in 2007 as the harvest returned to normal after two years of exceptional growth
and averaged 5.8 percent for 2005–07. Growth rebounded in 2008, to an expected 5.9 percent,
supported by major investments in mining and petroleum and a harvest that benefited from
good rains. As a result of higher world prices for food and fuel, inflation accelerated in the first
eight months of 2008 but is now decelerating. Although exports increased in 2007 and 2008
because of higher uranium export prices, the external current account deficit widened, reflecting
investment-related imports.
As a member of the CFA franc zone, Niger has no independent monetary policy. Credit to the
economy was buoyant in 2007 and the first eight months of 2008, reflecting loans to the mining,
telecommunication and transportation sectors. As evidenced by the recent Financial System
Stability Assessment, the banking system is relatively sound, but the regional supervisor should
ensure that banks increase their capital to comply with the new regional regulations. Also,
microfinance institutions should be strengthened. The focus of the government in strengthening
the financial system should be on improving the business environment, supervision and
regulation, rather than creating specialized banks.
Budget performance was satisfactory in 2007 and the first half of 2008. In 2007, both tax and
nontax revenue performed well. Despite a strong increase in current expenditures and
domestically-financed public investment, the basic budget deficit remained moderate and below
target (at 0.9 percent of GDP). The reduction of domestic arrears, which has been ongoing
since 2001, was broadly on track at 0.7 percent of GDP. Public expenditures on education,
health, and the rural sector amounted to 9 percent of GDP (marginally below the level of 2006).
In the first half of 2008 the basic budget deficit, excluding an exceptional petroleum signature
bonus received in June (US$300 million or CFAF 123.4 billion, 5.3 percent of GDP) was lower
than programmed, as revenue was in line with the program and domestically-financed
expenditure remained well below programmed level. Public financial management has been
strengthened through closer monitoring of budgetary execution, and stronger expenditure
controls and auditing.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Nigerien authorities on the overall favorable performance
of the economy since the last Article IV consultation in 2006. GDP growth, albeit slowing, kept
ahead of population growth in 2007, and rebounded in 2008 underpinned by high investment
and progress in economic diversification. Following two years of relative stability, inflation
fluctuated in 2008, moving broadly in step with first the sharp rise and then the easing in global
food and fuel prices during the year.
Directors commended the authorities’ response to the major challenge posed by the food and
fuel crisis earlier this year, noting the reactivation of well-targeted food security operations and

3
the resort to costly tax suspensions for only a limited time. It will be important to ensure that the
targeted assistance mechanisms continue to be well funded, and that the authorities release in
a timely manner the government contributions to these arrangements, supplementing those of
the donor community.
Directors noted that Niger faces many challenges, given its susceptibility to external shocks and
widespread poverty. They therefore welcomed the significant investments under way in a
number of sectors—including mining, transportation, irrigation, and telecommunication—which
are expected to bolster activity in 2009. However, a prolonged global downturn could deter
future mining exploration and dampen Niger’s medium-term prospects.
Directors stressed that the present climate of heightened uncertainty makes it even more
important to support Niger’s growth by comprehensive efforts to enhance competitiveness. In
this context, Directors noted that the exchange rate is broadly aligned with fundamentals but
structural reforms—such as improved training of the labor force, better access to finance,
reduction in the cost of business, and improved transport infrastructure—are needed to improve
the business climate and productivity. Budgetary aid in support of priority sectors remains
essential to achieve Niger’s growth objectives and improve its social indicators.
Directors considered the authorities’ economic program for 2009 appropriate, with its focus on
better managing the public finances, closely aligning the budget to Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (PRSP) priorities, streamlining company taxation to improve the investment climate, and
furthering reforms of the financial sector. They welcomed the comprehensive actions taken to
strengthen public financial management, and supported the authorities’ efforts to cast budget
preparation in a medium-term framework. The planned reform in corporate taxation should help
improve the investment climate, attract foreign direct investment, and further diversify the
economy. The allocation of the exceptional resources from the petroleum sector to
infrastructure and the social sectors is appropriate.
Directors commended the efforts undertaken to strengthen debt management. Noting that the
updated Debt Sustainability Analysis still rates Niger as at moderate risk of debt distress, they
underscored that the debt contracted for ambitious infrastructure projects, including a major
dam on the Niger river, should be at very concessional terms and consistent with debt
sustainability.
Directors agreed that deepening financial intermediation is crucial to support economic activity,
including in housing and agriculture. They encouraged the authorities to promote credit to these
sectors but emphasized the need to avoid establishing narrowly based institutions that could
carry excessive risks, as indicated in the recent Financial Sector Stability Assessment

4
report. Directors endorsed the Financial Sector Assessment Program recommendations and
welcomed the authorities’ intention to carry forward financial sector reforms aimed at
strengthening banks and microfinancial institutions, and improving financial sector supervision.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Completes First Review Under the PRGF Arrangement for Niger and Approves
US$5 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has completed the first
review of Niger's economic performance under a three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF) arrangement. The completion of the review enables the disbursement of
SDR 3.29 million (about US$5 million), which will bring total disbursements under the
arrangement to SDR 6.58 million (about US$10.1 million).
In completing this review, the Executive Board granted waivers for the non-observance of
the end-June 2008 quantitative performance criterion on the reduction in domestic payment
arrears and the end-September 2008 structural performance criterion on the adoption of a
decree establishing the modalities for repayment of frozen savings deposits.
The PRGF arrangement became effective June 2, 2008, for a total amount of SDR 23.03
million (about US$35.3 million) (see Press Release No. 08/127).
The Executive Board today also concluded the Article IV consultation with Niger and will
issue its full assessment of economic developments in due course.
At the conclusion of the discussion on Niger's economic performance, Mr. Murilo Portugal,
Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:
“The Nigerien authorities are to be commended on the overall satisfactory performance under
the PRGF-supported programs since the 2006 Article IV consultations. Although economic
growth weakened somewhat in 2007, it remained above the rate of growth of population, and

2
rebounded in 2008, on the strength of a good harvest, higher investment, and progress
in economic diversification. Inflation flared up in the first half of 2008, reflecting the sharp
increase in food and fuel prices on world markets, but is now abating and is expected to
decline further. The authorities have appropriately responded to the food crisis in the first
half of 2008 by firming up already comprehensive mechanisms of targeted interventions in
favor of vulnerable groups, and have maintained the costly tax suspensions on selected
commodities for only a limited time. It is important that the targeted assistance mechanisms
continue to be well funded.
“The budgetary performance was satisfactory in 2007 and the first half of 2008. The basic
budget deficit in the first semester of 2008 was lower than programmed, as revenue
(abstracting from an exceptional petroleum contract signature bonus received in June 2008)
was in line with the program and domestically-financed expenditure remained below the
programmed level. The budget for 2009 allocates large exceptional revenue received in June
to priority development expenditures.
“The outlook for growth in 2009 remains favorable despite the current downturn in industrial
countries as the significant investments under way in a number of sectors, including mining,
transportation, irrigation and telecommunication, are expected to continue to support
economic activity. While economic prospects for 2009 are positive, the downturn in the
world economy, if prolonged, could deter future mining exploration and dampen mediumterm growth.
“Growth must be supported by comprehensive efforts to make the economy more
competitive. Improvements in the investment climate and reductions in the cost of doing
business will be needed to attract investment and promote further economic diversification.
In addition, continued, and possibly increased, foreign financed investment and budgetary aid
in support of priority sectors are essential for Niger to achieve its growth objective and
secure steady improvement in social indicators. A scaling up of aid as envisaged in the
Gleneagles scenario would be compatible with macroeconomic stability. To preserve debt
sustainability, it is essential that debt management remains prudent, with emphasis on grants
and borrowing on highly concessional terms for highly productive projects.
“The authorities program for 2009 appropriately focuses on better management of the public
finances, closely aligning the budget to PRSP priorities, streamlining corporate taxation to
improve the investment climate, and furthering reforms in the financial sector. The
comprehensive actions taken to strengthen public financial management are welcome. Efforts
must now focus on casting the budget preparation in a medium-term framework, with a
careful integration of the recurrent costs implied by the expansion of public investment,”
Mr. Portugal said.

Statement by Laurean W. Rutayisire, Exective Director for Niger
December 19, 2008
On behalf on my Nigerien authorities, I thank staff for the constructive dialogue they had
during the Article IV consultations and the first review under the PRGF arrangement
2008-11. I would also like to thank the Executive Board and Management for the continued
support to the Republic of Niger. My authorities appreciate the set of reports, which highlight
the key challenges facing the country over the medium-term. In particular, they share the
staff’s analysis on the macroeconomic impact of scaling-up aid, which put emphasis on the
positive effects of increasing aid on growth and the pace of poverty reduction. For the period
ahead, they look forward to continue benefiting from Fund’s policy advice, as it contributed
over the three last successive PRGF arrangements to enhance the macroeconomic stability,
strengthen revenue mobilization, and restore Niger’s creditworthiness.
My authorities intend to build upon the positive outcomes obtained since 2000, continuing
thereby to extend their program’s ownership. They are committed to pursue their reform
agenda, despite the existing gaps of human and institutional capacity, for which they rely on
continuous Fund’s engagement on technical assistance. Their determination for a steadfast
reform implementation has been deepened and the lessons drawn from their positive
experience of revenue mobilization were instrumental in strengthening the country’s
financial position. In this regard, while pursuing their strategy of diversifying the economy,
through mining, irrigation, and transportation programs, my authorities attach value to a
better management of public finances, as well as the need for aligning the budget to PRSP
priorities, with the aim to enhancing public expenditure efficiency.
Based on their track record of policy implementation, as well as their commitment to
reforms, my authorities request waivers for the two missed performance criteria,
modification for two performance criteria, and the completion of the first review under the
PRGF arrangement.
I. Recent Economic Developments and Performance Under the Program
Macroeconomic performance over recent years was strong, reflecting a growing interest to
Nigerien economy from external investors, attracted by mining and petroleum sectors
opportunies. At the same time, exceptional weather conditions contributed to boost the
agricultural production, with record levels attained in 2006, 2007 and 2008. The combined
effects of these factors have had a positive impact on GDP, pushing higher the growth rate of
this aggregate over this period. Accordingly, Niger appeared as the best performer among
WAEMU member countries with regard to the GDP, its average growth rate reaching
5.8 percent in 2005-07. The investment ratio, slightly below 14 percent in 2000-04, rose
roughly to an average of 23.4 percent in 2005-07, a level much higher than the average of
Sub-Saharan African countries, but close to that of industrial economies. In their strategy to
design an adequate policy response to world-wide rising food and fuel prices, my Nigerien

2
authorities have put in place a range of measures, including not only the suspension of taxes
on imported food and fuel, but also the reactivation of existing targeted programs such as
(i) the programs of food for work and cash for work; (ii) food distribution to vulnerable
people at moderate prices and free distribution in the lean season ; (iii) funding and setting
up cereal banks; and (iv) the nutritional programs. With the benefits of hindsight, my
authorities recognized the positive role played by the targeted programs, in contributing to
contain the demand pressures and curb the rising inflation trend, but remained skeptical about
the fiscal measures effectiveness. Inflation, which mounted to 15 percent at end-August
2008, from 4.7 percent at end-December 2007, is expected to decline to 8.5 percent at
end-December 2008, and come back to its historical trend of 2 percent by end-December
2009.
Cognizant of the importance of public finance management with regard to the
macroeconomic stability, my Nigerien authorities focused their efforts on the revenue
mobilization, as well as on the expenditure management, with the aim to ensure a better use
of hardly collected fiscal resources. Consequently, revenue performed well, on account of
good performance in 2007 and in the first half of 2008 on tax and nontax revenue collection.
Even if the exceptional revenue pertaining to the signature bonus received from petroleum
sector has not been included in the total, the revenue target for June 2008 could have been
observed easily. As regards the expenditure side, close attention was given to education,
health, and rural sectors, in line with the priorities set in their respective medium-term
expenditure frameworks. Though with some delays, the program of domestic arrears
clearance remains on track, evolving successfully since 2001.
Due to the increasing imports of mining equipment and petroleum products, the external
current account deficit widened in 2007, and my authorities expect so in 2008 and the
coming years, as far as the expected exports from the development of uranium and oil begin
to offset the impact of imports on the external accounts. In the meanwhile, the increase in
uranium revenue following the recent price revision could just soften the deteriorating effects
of imports on the external current account.
On the monetary and financial front, positive developments reflected increased credit to
economy, as well as banking sector’s holding of substantial external assets. While the
expansion trend of credit to the economy has continued, the ratio of nonperforming loans was
declining. This development could prove that the ongoing reforms aiming at improving the
soundness of banking institutions were bearing fruit. My authorities welcome the Financial
System Stability Assessment (FSSA), which underscored the soundness of Nigerien financial
sector, while stressing the low access to financial services in Niger, seen as one of the lowest
in the world. They also believe that given the small size of banking system, the costs of a
systemic crisis would be limited, and could not exceed anytime 2.25 perecent of GDP.
Against this backdrop, my authorities are committed to pursue steadfastly their efforts to
strengthen controls and supervision over the financial sector institutions, while seeking an
appropriate way to promote financial services in a healthy and more dynamic environment.

The program performance has been broadly satisfactory. All quantitative performance
criteria and indicators for end-June 2008 were met, except that related to the reduction of
domestic arrears and the one pertaining to the establishment of procedures for repaying the
frozen deposits of the former ONPE (National Postal and Savings Office). The criterion on
domestic arrears reduction was missed by a margin of 1.2 billion, which has been cleared in
July 2008, thanks to government’s further efforts of reduction. Steps are being taken to reach
the total objective of 15 billion of arrears reduction set for end-December 2008. Likewise,
regarding the criterion on the adoption of procedures for repayment of the frozen deposits,
the needed efforts have been made in early December 2008.
II. Medium-term Outlook and Policy Discussions
My Nigerien authorities appreciated the quality of the discussions they had with staff last
September, which focused on the challenges and opportunities to sustain growth over the
medium-term, make noticeable progress in reducing poverty, preserve the balance payments
position in the current context of rising imports for mining equipment and petroleum
products, and put debt in a sustainable path. In this connection, they expressed their
agreement with the analysis outlined in Box 4 of the staff report, which underscores the
critical importance of scaling-up aid to Niger, as it could help make faster and significant
progress in poverty reduction (1-2 percent increase of annual GDP and a reduction poverty
level of 25 percent by 2015), compared to what have been made so far. The model, from
which staff drew its findings, suggests that a sustained aid attaining 15 percent of GDP from
the current level of 10 percent of GDP is just sufficient to help achieve such an important
progress, without incurring any risk of jeopardizing the macroeconomic stability.
As regards the financing of PRSP priorities, my authorities’ decision to allocate the signature
bonus of 5.3 percent of GDP, collected in 2008 from petroleum sector, to rural development,
roads, electricity generation, shows their commitment to the success of PRSP, as well as their
determination to accomplish their part of efforts, by promoting a policy of better use of their
scarcely resources. They have also reached an agreement with staff on the need to anchoring
the future budget decisions in a multi-year perspective, and steps have been taken towards
the elaboration of these frameworks. Turning to the impact of increased imports on the
balance of payments account and debt sustainability, my authorities agreed with the staff’s
findings showing that Niger remains at moderate risk of debt distress and the impact on the
balance of payments could be reversed after 2012, once expected export flows from mining
and oil sectors get started.

III. The 2009 program
Fiscal Policy
The authorities’ program for 2009 places the public finance management on the centerpiece
of their strategy.
On the revenue side, several measures are envisaged, in particular the reduction of corporate
tax designed to attract foreign investment and promote economic diversification, and further
simplification of corporate and personal income tax, with the aim to eliminate nonessential
tax advantages and limit in time, without extension, some advantages set forth in the
investment Code. Moreover, some revisions related to real estate tax and income tax on
securities, stock and shares will be undertaken in 2009.
In light of the need for designing a multi-year budget framework, consistent with the PRSP
priorities, the 2009 budget was prepared in a closer coordination between the Directorate of
budget, the PRSP coordinating unit, and the action plans for priority sectors. In the same
vein, the authorities decided that the preparation for 2010 budget law will include projections
for the main budgetary revenue and expenditure aggregates for the period 2010-2012, and
agreed with staff that this measure be raised as a structural benchmark. Given the need for
strengthening institutional capacity, my authorities have requested technical assistance from
IMF aiming at helping them in the preparation of MTEF document. After those on education,
health and rural sectors, the MTEF for the infrastructure and transport sectors are currently
being elaborated. In order to improve public finance management, several actions are
underway, including (i) the strengthening of financial controls, by increasing the numbers of
controllers and their training, (ii )the strengthening of General Directorate for the
supervision of public procurement (DCGMP), (iii) the revamping of information circulation
network between general Directorate and decentralized budget office in the regions. As
positive effects of authorities’ efforts to strengthen debt management, semiannual reports on
recent borrowing and debt prospects are already produced. Although the current debt ratio
trends seem appropriate and do not raise any matters of concerns, my Nigerien authorities
pay close attention to debt dynamics, as well as the occurrence of any exogenous shock, from
which could emerge any risks of debt distress.
Exchange Rate, Monetary and Financial Sector Policies
My authorities gave due consideration to the assessment made by staff, suggesting that the
present level of exchange rate is consistent with fundamentals, and does not constitute a
threat for international competitiveness, in view of the current FDI inflows, as well as the
expected receipts from mining and petroleum exports. While pursuing their policy of keeping
inflation under check, with regard to the growing credit demand, they intend to continue
implementing the ongoing financial sector reforms, with the view to strengthen banks and
microfinance institutions.

5
Other structural reforms
The authorities are determined to move ahead with the reforms aiming at improving the
business environment. After the progress made in the simplification of procedures and the
reduction of the number of days necessary to create a business, they intend to focus their
efforts on the reduction of costs, notably those related to the enrollment fees in the register of
commerce at the courts. My authorities reached an agreement with staff, which enabled to
retain this measure, as a structural benchmark for end-June 2009.
IV. Conclusion
Niger has made important strides over the last decade, as evidenced by the significant
progress achieved since 1979 in macroeconomic stability, revenue mobilization, expenditure
management, and restoration of country’s creditworthiness. However, my Nigerien
authorities are aware of the challenges laying ahead, in particular the need for achieving a
sustained healthy growth, which could help meet the MDGs, while making a decisive turn in
their fight against poverty. They have also taken steps to address the challenge of reconciling
the increasing movements of FDI over the coming years with the need to maintain the current
sustainable debt path. This is why my authorities have focused their efforts on the
implementation of their new strategy for poverty reduction, the PRSP with the view to
fostering the development of priority sectors, through the promotion of agriculture, mining,
petroleum, and irrigation projects. The allocation of the entire amount of signature bonus
windfall to PRSP priority sectors, besides normal appropriations for these sectors, show the
authorities’ determination to accomplish their part of efforts in the financing of poverty
reduction strategy. More predictable and timely support is expected from donors in order to
ensure an effective implementation of this strategy, if we are to meet the country's economic
and developmental goals. In this regard, the authorities rely on the continuous support of the
Fund, in particular through its technical assistance as well as its catalytic role in mobilizing
development partners' assistance. They will continue to aim at contracting debt with a grant
element as high as possible, but not below 35 percent in 2008 and beyond. As for the
management of existing debt, they continue to apply a prudent approach, and building
capacity to develop a medium-term debt strategy and to analyze debt sustainability.
Based on their demonstrated track record of policy and reform implementation, and their
commitment to a sound and realistic economic program going forward, I would like to ask
Directors' approval of two waivers for the nonobservance of performance criteria and their
support for the completion of the first review under the current PRGF arrangement and 2008
Article consultation.
