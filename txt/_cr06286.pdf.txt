EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Albania’s macroeconomic performance since the turn of this decade has generally been
good. Growth has been rapid and the country is now emerging from the low-income country
group. Together with large remittances, the rapid growth has significantly reduced poverty.
Debt is declining, and macroeconomic stability has been maintained.
Past accomplishments notwithstanding, macroeconomic stability may be threatened by
rapid credit growth and export shocks. Growth is expected to decline to 5 percent this
year, and the external current account deficit to widen to 8.1 percent of GDP. Moreover,
underlying demand pressures are rising, spurred by rapid private credit growth.
On the structural front, progress with reform has been uneven and the business
environment remains relatively uninviting. Despite advances, weak public institutions
remain a source of vulnerability. Together with infrastructure deficiencies—including in the
electricity sector—these factors constrain medium-term growth capacity. There is no
indication of a significant exchange rate misalignment, but the lack of non-price
competitiveness hinders investment and exports.
Policy discussions focused on the near-term policy corrections required to maintain
macroeconomic stability and on structural reforms needed to promote growth and reduce
vulnerabilities over the medium-term.
•
To safeguard loan quality, there was agreement on measures to strengthen banking
supervision and enhance prudential regulations. Work is also underway to establish a credit
bureau and improve the legal framework for collateral execution. These measures are also
expected to reduce the rate of credit expansion by increasing effective lending costs.
•
As the projected credit growth in 2006 would still generate a small demand impulse, a
mid-year fiscal adjustment will be made in the 2006 supplementary budget.
•
Staff supported the authorities’ strategy of developing a small but efficient
government concentrated on its core functions. A rising share of expenditure will be devoted
to investment and other priority expenditure. Future gains from tax administration reform
will be devoted to tax relief and debt reductions. The planned supplementary budget will
allocate expected structural revenue gains in 2006 according to this strategy.
•
Growth enhancing institutional reforms should focus on areas where Albania lags its
new competitors, such as property rights and contract enforcement, and privatization should
be accelerated in non-core areas of government.
The implementation of the PRGF/EFF-supported program has been broadly
satisfactory, but the performance criterion on the collection and loss rates of KESH was
missed. However, the authorities have taken strong corrective actions. They have adopted a
revised strategy for the electricity sector to promote significantly increased private sector
involvement, including the privatization of electricity distribution. Moreover, they have
secured the technical assistance necessary to move ahead quickly in this area as a prior action
for approval of the review. Therefore, staff supports the authorities’ request for a waiver for
the nonobservance of this performance criterion.

INTRODUCTION
1.
Macroeconomic performance since the beginning of this decade has been
strong, and Albania is now emerging from the low-income country group (Table 1).
Per capita GDP in US dollar terms has more than doubled during this period, helped by
the successful implementation
of PRGF-supported programs.

(per capita GDP in US$, group averages)
Together with large

remittances, the rapid growth
has significantly reduced

poverty, although further
efforts will be needed to

achieve some of the

Goals (Table 2).

a narrowing of the external
current account deficit, the
establishment of price stability, increasing confidence in the currency and the banking
system, and rising international reserves.
2.
These positive developments owe much to sound fiscal and monetary policy
frameworks. Fiscal policy has been aimed at containing net domestic borrowing and
lowering public debt, which fell from above 67½ percent of GDP in 2001 to below
55½ percent in 2005 (partly helped by debt rescheduling). Fiscal consolidation has
supported the monetary policy framework—a reserve money program with the repo rate
as the main policy instrument, combined with a de jure and de facto floating exchange
rate regime—which strives to keep inflation in a 3±1 percent target range.
3.
However, progress with structural reforms necessary to maintain Albania’s
high growth potential has been mixed. As a result, Albania lags behind middle-income
countries—its new peer group—with respect to quality of business climate and
institutions. The differences are most pronounced in crucial areas such as corruption, rule
of law, and infrastructure development (Table 3). The resulting low level of non-price
competitiveness deters investment and the expansion of the export base, which is less
than half of the typical size for a country at Albania’s income level. Moreover, major
vulnerabilities remain due to the sizable short-term domestic public debt, a culture of tax
evasion, and poorly regulated and supervised nonbank financial institutions. These issues
will need to be addressed if Albania is to improve, or even maintain, its position relative
to middle-income countries. Political risk, however, appears to be declining following

6
peaceful elections and transfer of power in 2005, and as the prospect of EU and NATO
accession increasingly provides a strong external anchor.
4.
Although the performance criterion for the financial performance of the
state-owned electricity company (KESH) was not met, the implementation of the
PRGF/EFF-supported program has been otherwise broadly satisfactory. All other
targets of the program were met (Table 4). Revenue administration reforms are
progressing well, and an action plan to implement the recommendations of the 2005
Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) has been developed.
I. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
5.
Past accomplishments notwithstanding, recent unfavorable developments
pose new challenges.
•

The external position has deteriorated. The current account deficit increased to
an estimated 7¾ percent of GDP in 2005, up from 5½ percent in 2004 (Tables 5a,
5b). Hit by weakening import

demand in Italy, its main
trading partner, and by
intensifying competition from
China in its main product
market (textiles), Albania’s
export growth decelerated
in 2005. This, together with
strong import demand and
higher oil import costs, caused

in 2005, a trend that appears to have continued in the first quarter of 2006.

Low and relatively stable headline inflation masked a steady pickup in nontradables inflation (Figure 1). The latter reached the upper end of the 3±1
inflation target range, indicating emerging capacity constraints in non-tradable
sectors. Low food prices and the appreciation of the lek following the elections,
however, kept tradables inflation in check.

•

Growth has slowed. The electricity crisis in October–November 2005 hit the
economy hard and, together with major governance problems within KESH, led
to a sharp worsening of the company’s financial performance (Box 1). Following
a boom in 2003–04, economic activity in the construction sector has weakened.
These factors, together with a slowdown in exports, led to a decline in growth
from 6 percent in 2004 to 5½ percent in 2005. The economy weakened further in
the first quarter of 2006, reflecting the emerging capacity constraints in

•

The dramatic decline in the financial
performance of KESH between
April 2005 and January 2006 unwound
the advances made over the past five
years under a World Bank-led power
sector program. Collections fell rapidly
as technical losses and theft mounted,
and KESH proved unable to enforce
payment of bills. The deterioration
peaked in January 2006, when payment
was received on only a third of
electricity supplied.

Beginning in February, the collection

nontradable sectors. Moreover, the largest metallurgy plant in the country ceased
operations because of high electricity costs, further deteriorating the trade
balance.
6.
On the policy side, the fiscal stance has been restrictive while the monetary
policy stance remained broadly neutral. Under execution of mostly donor-financed
capital spending led to a reduction of the overall deficit to 3.6 percent of GDP in 2005,
down 1½ percentage points from the previous year (Table 6). Partly as a result of a
sizable revenue overperformance, the fiscal contraction was even stronger in the first
quarter of 2006: the surplus reached 1¼ percent of annual GDP, up from a deficit of
½ percent of GDP in the same period in 2005. The monetary policy rate has remained
unchanged at 5 percent since March 2005 (Table 7).
7.
An ongoing credit boom, however, has led to demand pressures that underlie
the high non-tradables inflation and the widening of the current account deficit
(Figure 2). The stock of private credit increased from 9½ percent of GDP at end-2004 to
15 percent of GDP by end-2005, creating a sizable demand impulse. About three-quarters
of loans are foreign-currency denominated, going primarily to companies in non-tradable
sectors and financing mostly imports.

Preliminary analysis of 2005 survey data indicates a further significant
decline in poverty. The absolute poverty rate declined from 25½ percent in 2002 to
18½ percent in 2005 and the extreme poverty rate from 4¾ to 3½ percent. The low
degree of inequality (measured by the Gini coefficient) achieved by 2002 was
maintained, which helped maximize the positive impact of income growth. Besides

11
pensions and relatively small but targeted social transfers, large workers’ remittances—
providing an effective private safety net—played an important role in this regard.1 An
annual report on the implementation of the National Strategy for Social and Economic
Development (NSSED, the Albanian poverty reduction strategy) and a joint staff
advisory note with the World Bank was prepared in January 2006. A new NSSED will be
produced by end-2006.

II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
9.
Discussions focused on the near-term policy corrections required to maintain
macroeconomic stability and on structural reforms needed to promote growth and
reduce vulnerabilities over the medium-term. The authorities thought that the Fund’s
advice had served the country well in the past (Box 2). Looking ahead, their overall
strategy for reforms is to concentrate on core functions and shift non-core functions to the
private sector. On the fiscal side, this implies a small but efficient government and
expenditure reprioritization. The electricity industry is an important non-core area where
the authorities aim to promote greater private sector involvement to secure long-term
solutions to the sector’s severe problems. The key questions for the discussions were:
•

How can macroeconomic stability be maintained in the face of strong demand
pressures from rapid credit growth?

•

What are the critical institutional reforms to maintain high growth?

•

What steps are needed to keep government small and increase its efficiency?

•

What measures are required to reduce vulnerability in the financial sector and
enhance its contribution to growth?

•

What are the necessary reforms to attain secure electricity supply over the medium
term and to improve KESH’s performance in a sustainable manner?
Box 2. The Effectiveness of Fund Surveillance

Overall, the Albanian authorities have a relatively good track record of implementing Fund
advice, but reforms have been delayed in some areas:
On fiscal policy, the authorities have implemented recommendations to reduce domestic
borrowing; redirect resources from current to capital expenditure; and make full use of
contingencies and prepare conservative revenue projections. They have also agreed to delay
the 2006 supplementary budget until it could be determined whether gains due to recent tax
administration reforms were sustainable.
On structural reform, vulnerabilities were identified in revenue administration, debt
management, and banking supervision. The authorities formulated, or are in the process of
formulating, action plans to address these vulnerabilities based on Fund technical
assistance. Implementation has begun, and is particularly advanced in tax administration.
Preparations have also started to develop a credit bureau to help safeguard loan quality.
These actions—along with measures to improve expenditure management and to improve
the financial performance of KESH—have been supported by program conditionality.
Implementation of the reforms to strengthen title registration and enforce contracts has
however been slow.

A. Maintaining Macroeconomic Stability in the Face of Strong Credit Demand
10.
There was agreement that growth in 2006 would slow further to about
5 percent, but with upside potential. A continued slowdown in services and
construction—reflecting emerging capacity constraints and less buoyant housing demand
from remittances—is the main factor underlying this trend. More secure electricity supply
than previously expected has, however, favorably altered the balance of risk. With
improved implementation of foreign-financed public investment projects and higher
electricity imports, the current account is projected to widen further to over 8 percent of
GDP in 2006, despite lower growth.
11.
The authorities concurred that a decisive policy response was needed to rein
in underlying inflationary pressures and improve the external position. The
monetary authorities were particularly worried that the expected strong pickup in public
expenditure later in the year could raise further non-tradables inflation, which would
propel headline inflation outside the 3±1 percent target range. It was agreed that
excessive private credit growth was the prime factor responsible for the underlying
demand pressures. However, it was also recognized that a healthy level of credit growth
was necessary to finance investment that would ease emerging capacity constraints.

There was agreement that private credit growth also needed to be cooled for
prudential reasons. The credit ratio in Albania is lower than in countries with similar
income level and the deepening of financial intermediation is an important factor
fostering growth. Nonetheless, the current pace of credit expansion entails excessive risks
as banks are taking on bigger risks by moving down the credit spectrum. Staff noted that
countries with prolonged expansion of private credit that avoided a subsequent banking
or currency crisis had

authorities suggested
that a relatively rapid credit expansion would be appropriate at this juncture because
prudential indicators were quite favorable (Table 8) and because some of the apparent
increase in lending had previously existed as informal credit. A consensus view emerged
that a further increase broadly in line with that experienced in 2005 (5½ percentage

14
points) would still be consistent with maintaining acceptable loan quality—provided it
was accompanied by strong prudential and supervisory measures.
13.
The discussions thus turned to the appropriate policy package to curb
private credit growth and reduce demand pressure.

2

•

It was agreed that implementing decisive prudential and supervisory
measures should be the first step (Box 3). The prudential measures should serve
to maintain credit quality and, more broadly, the soundness of the fast developing
banking system. Together with active communication to promote self-restraint by
commercial banks, the monetary authorities hoped that these measures would also
slow credit growth by increasing effective lending costs.

•

As the projected credit growth in 2006, after taking these measures, would
still generate a small demand impulse, the policy mix has to be tightened.
Staff argued that this should be done on the fiscal side rather than through an
interest rate increase. Most loans are foreign currency denominated and hence a
rate hike would have limited direct impact on credit growth. As the interest rate
channel is weak, a monetary tightening would work primarily through the
exchange rate channel which would have the largest and most immediate impact
on the tradables sector. 2 It would be preferable to avoid such an impact as Albania
is already buffeted by recent export shocks and needs to rein in strong import
demand, and also keeping in mind that inflationary pressures are being felt
primarily in non-tradables. By contrast, a tighter fiscal stance would weigh less
heavily on the tradables sector.

•

On balance, the authorities thus agreed on the desirability of a modest midyear fiscal correction. Some ¼ percent of GDP of revenue overperformance will
be saved in the supplementary budget (¶26). This, together with saving half the
receipts from bank privatization, will reduce net domestic borrowing to
2.3 percent of GDP in 2006, down from the originally budgeted 2.6 percent. With
remittances relative to GDP expected to remain unchanged in 2006, this would
ensure that no significant additional demand impulse is given to the economy,
reducing the need for monetary tightening (MEFP ¶16-17).

•

With these measures, a rate increase may not to be necessary at this stage,
but there was agreement that the monetary authorities should stay vigilant.
In particular, the authorities would consider a rate hike if excessively rapid credit
expansion continued.

Although international portfolio investment is insignificant, a large stock of foreign currency-denominated
assets held by residents makes the exchange rate responsive to interest rate changes.

15

Box 3. Measures to Strengthen Banking Supervision and Prudential Regulations
Amendments to regulations that will increase the costs of financial intermediation:
•

Increasing reserve requirements on foreign-currency deposits (currently at
10 percent).

•

Imposing minimum capital adequacy requirements higher than the current
12 percent on high-risk banks identified by the banking supervisor.

•

Raising the maximum risk weights applied to high-risk loans above 100 percent—as
permitted under Basel II.

•

Requiring higher provisioning on classified loans.

Actions to protect loan quality:
•

BoA will encourage banks to adopt—and impose on banks if necessary—stricter
debt service-to-disposable income ratios and prudent loan-to-value ratios; tighter
internal loan classification rules; and increased risk premiums in lending spreads to
take full account of indirect credit risk from foreign-exchange exposure of
customers.

•

BoA will also introduce “truth in lending” rules by mid-2007 to disclose annual
percentage rates on loans and the risks associated with foreign-currency borrowing.

•

A credit bureau will be established within BoA (SB; end-June 2007).

•

Legislation will be submitted to Parliament to improve the efficiency and timeliness
of collateral execution (SB; end-December 2006).

Measures to improve supervisory capacity:
•

Decreasing the lag on reporting monthly bank statistics from 40 to 30 days.

•

Improving coordination and communication with home country supervisors of
foreign-owned banks.

•

Increasing targeting of supervision activities—including on-site inspections—
towards credit-related risks.

•

Preparing and mandate by end-2006 enhanced reporting rules for commercial banks
to allow better monitoring of banking sector developments.

•

Submitting a new Banking Law to Parliament (SB; end-March 2007) to grant BoA
the specific legal authority needed to improve and broaden its supervision of
commercial banks; and to strengthen legal protection for banking supervisors.

16
B. Reforms to Generate High Export-Led Growth
14.
There was agreement that institutional weaknesses impede growth and the
development of a strong export base (Box 4).
•

An inefficient government and high compliance costs have led to a large informal
sector and a small tax base. Thus, maintaining even a relatively small government
requires high tax rates, which create distortions and provide further incentives for
business to stay in the informal sector.

•

Other characteristics of the business climate also fall short compared to middleincome countries, particularly with respect to rule of law, control of corruption,
and bureaucratic quality. Business surveys confirm that the lack of non-price
competitiveness—due to poor infrastructure and an unsupportive business
environment—is a significant impediment to FDI, domestic investment and
export growth. As a result, Albania has a small export base.

15.
Although non-price competitiveness is poor, price competitiveness appears
broadly adequate and there is no indication of significant exchange rate
misalignment. While the lack of information on unit labor cost and profitability in
tradable sectors prevents a detailed assessment, business leaders confirmed that the
exchange rate was not a major factor hindering profitability. Albania’s broadly stable
market share in the EU over the last seven years also supports this view; and analyses by
both staff and the authorities suggest that the extent of REER trend appreciation (about
1½ percent annually) is broadly consistent with rapid productivity growth (Figure 3).
16.
The authorities reiterated their determination to fight corruption and
strengthen public institutions (MEFP ¶14-15). They agreed with staff’s assessment that
establishing and enforcing property rights and strengthening contract enforcement are key

to promoting the formalization of the economy and attracting more FDI.3 Regarding
property rights, they set priority on significantly improving access to title registration—
the lack of which is perhaps the strongest impediment to FDI and also heightens financial
sector vulnerabilities because of insufficient loan collateral. Staff urged the authorities to
speed up the preparations for their planned land utilization project in cooperation with the
World Bank, which would also develop a modern title registration system. Contract
enforcement needs to be strengthened by attacking corruption in the court system, by
training judges dealing with commercial cases, and by facilitating collateral execution.
Staff noted that ongoing revenue administration reforms would make an important
contribution in this area.
17.
With ambitious reforms, the high growth of the past decade can continue.
Assuming sustained efforts to improve the business climate and maintain macroeconomic
stability, staff projects a return to 6 percent growth in 2007. This will require a gradual
increase in domestic investment relative to GDP, which will have to be matched by
concomitant increases in domestic savings to maintain safe levels of external current
account deficit and foreign debt.
18.
There are significant risks to these projections. Despite recent improvements,
the fragility of the energy sector remains a major risk to growth over the medium term,
while the relatively high and short-term domestic public debt and continued rapid private
credit growth pose risks to macroeconomic stability. On the external front, staff’s debt
3

An accompanying SIP present staff’s analysis in this area.

20
sustainability analysis shows that on current policies external debt is expected to remain
at manageable levels over the medium-term—even as the composition of public debt
shifts to less concessional sources and private sector borrowing increases (see
Appendix IV). While the debt position is relatively robust, it is vulnerable to shocks to
growth and exports in particular. This underscores the need to broaden the export base.
19.
The authorities’ strategy for poverty reduction is to maintain high growth
and make it more pro-poor by increasing employment. Reductions in high labor taxes
will thus be a crucial part of this strategy. Increasing the share of public expenditure on
education, health care and infrastructure investment will also help the poor enter the labor
market. Noting that poverty reduction is also essential to improving non-price
competitiveness, staff supported the authorities’ overall strategy for fighting poverty.
C. The Fiscal Strategy: A Small But Efficient Government
20.
The authorities’ fiscal strategy aims to keep government small and increase
the share of priority expenditure, while striking a balance between reducing public
debt and the tax burden (MEFP ¶14-15).
•

Over the medium term, public expenditure will be capped at about 30 percent of
GDP. Within this envelope, growth-enhancing capital spending is planned to
increase from 4½ to about 7 percent of GDP by 2010. The share of education and
health expenditure will also increase significantly.

•

Debt is targeted to decline from 55.3 percent of GDP in 2005 to 51½ percent
in 2010 which, according to staff’s analysis, is sustainable (Appendix IV). This
debt path and the planned increase in capital spending imply a rise in the current
surplus from ½ percent to 2¾ percent of GDP during this period. Thus, the
improvement in the government’s net worth—a more suitable indicator to judge
solvency and intergenerational fairness—is likely to be larger than the extent of
the reduction in gross public debt. However, as the stress scenarios show, public
debt remains vulnerable to adverse shocks to growth.

•

Meeting these targets would require revenue to reach about 26½ percent of GDP
over the medium term. Future structural gains from revenue administration
reforms above this level could be made available for tax relief and a faster
reduction of public debt.

Staff noted that the success of the authorities’ small-government strategy
would depend on improving the quality of public expenditure and reducing nonproductive current spending. This will require continuous efforts to improve
expenditure management and medium-term budgeting, also to ensure that increased
public investment is matched by sufficient funds for operation and maintenance. The
staffing of a public investment department in the Ministry of Finance was an important
first step in this regard, as were new requirements issued to line ministries that they only
submit public investment proposals that were consistent with the Medium-Term Budget
Plan (MTBP). Over time, the full integration of the annual budget with the MTBP and the
NSSED will be necessary. The mission considered that, if properly implemented, the
proposed framework would help develop public confidence in fiscal policy, as well as
prevent politically motivated, ad hoc budgetary initiatives.
22.
The authorities agreed that significant debt management reform was needed
to address vulnerabilities resulting from a relatively high level of domestic public
debt (MEFP ¶19). They will formulate a debt management strategy (PC endOctober 2006); and submit to Parliament a public debt law defining the objectives and
the institutional framework for public debt management (SB; end-September 2006).
Following this, reforms will focus on implementing the authorities’ action plan which
incorporates the January 2006 FAD mission’s recommendations (Table 9). Principle
objectives include achieving a significant increase in the average maturity of public debt
(currently somewhat over half year), substantially expanding risk management capacity,
and acquiring the ability, by the end of the program, to produce independent debt
sustainability analysis. Staff welcomed these measures and stressed the need for
allocating sufficient resources to build the necessary public debt management capacity.

The authorities’ tax reform aims to stimulate growth and help formalize the
economy. Given the central importance of

24.
While agreeing with the main goals, staff recommended sequencing tax
measures differently and leaving more room for faster debt reduction. Regarding the
planned reduction of social security contribution rates, they urged the authorities to
ensure that it was consistent with the findings of the ongoing World Bank fiduciary
assessment of the pension system. On other taxes, the mission noted that the 2004 FAD
mission found that the basic design of the Albanian tax system was sound and that tax
rates were in line with regional levels. Thus, there is no urgent need for reducing other
taxes. Staff also noted that while there was some justification for maintaining the same
top rate for PIT and CIT, there was no reason to keep this rate equal to the VAT rate.
Moreover, given the large share of VAT in total revenue, its wide base and relative
efficiency, the mission recommended considering a cut in this tax only in the last phase,
if at all. Thus, only PIT and CIT rate cuts should be considered in the second phase
following the reduction of labor taxes. More generally, staff emphasized the importance
of further simplification of the tax system to reduce compliance cost; and of broadening
the tax base to distribute the tax burden more equitably. The authorities agreed with these
recommendations. The mission also stressed that, as agreed in the IMF program, if
further revenue gains were significant, they should also be used to reduce public debt, as
vulnerabilities from relatively high public debt remained substantial.

Currently, the top personal income tax (PIT) rate, the corporate income tax (CIT) rate, and the VAT rate are
all at 20 percent.

23
25.
Revenue administration reforms are so far on track (MEFP ¶18). Important
accomplishments in this area are the incorporation of all large taxpayers into the LTO and
a significant increase in the share of taxes collected by this office. As a next step, the
authorities will prepare a feasibility study for merging small local tax offices (SB; endOctober 2006). The authorities have requested a follow-up FAD mission to review
progress in reform implementation and to update recommendations. To monitor progress
in improving taxpayer services, the authorities will continue to prepare quarterly reports
on VAT refunds (SB; ongoing); and on the use of the ASYCUDA risk assessment
module to perform customs inspections (SB; ongoing).
26.
The planned supplementary budget, to be approved in July 2006, is
consistent with the new fiscal strategy (MEFP ¶17). Structural gains from revenue
administration reform for this year, estimated at 1–1½ percent of GDP—mostly
stemming from enhanced governance in customs and the strengthening of the LTO,
improvements that now increasingly appear to be sustainable—will be allocated between
additional spending, tax relief, and debt reduction. About 0.6-0.8 percent of GDP will be
allocated to high-quality capital spending, primarily road construction. Besides a
reduction in the social security contribution rate, planned tax measures, costing about
0.2–0.4 percent of GDP, will include the elimination of custom tariffs on imported
machinery, the deferment of VAT on imported equipment, and an increase of tobacco
excises to regional levels. The remaining ¼ percent of GDP of gains will be used to retire
domestic debt.
D. Development and Stability of the Financial System
27.
Standard financial soundness indicators suggest that the banking sector, fully
private and dominantly foreign-owned, is healthy, but close vigilance is warranted.
With assets of 61 percent of GDP, commercial banks dominate the financial system.5
Though rapid credit growth has somewhat lowered capital adequacy and liquidity ratios,
banks appear on the whole to have remained well capitalized, liquid, and profitable
(Table 8). The stress tests performed by the FSAP mission in 2005, and those performed
by the authorities on a quarterly basis, indicate that the banking sector is resilient to
standard exchange rate, interest rate and credit quality shocks, with strong profitability
providing a considerable buffer. Earnings are predominantly from interest margins.
However, cost efficiency has continued to decline. Moreover, high real lending rates,
about 9–13 percent in the past year, reflect major information asymmetries stemming from
the lack of a credit bureau and uncertainties surrounding collateral execution.

The collective assets of insurance companies and credit unions are less than 2 percent of GDP.

28.
The authorities agreed that the prudential and supervisory measures
proposed by the MFD mission would be sufficient at this stage to safeguard loan
quality (Box 3). Nonetheless, they stood willing to take additional actions if necessary.
Before starting implementation though, they wanted to discuss the measures
recommended by the IMF staff with the commercial banks to secure strong efforts on
their part. There was consensus that the present low level of nonperforming loans would
likely rise in the months ahead, as some of the loans given out over the past year become
impaired. However, the authorities viewed this as a normal development in an
environment of rapid credit growth, and did not expect the increase to be large enough to
affect the stability of the banking system.
29.
To promote financial market development, the authorities have begun
preparations to develop a delivery-versus-payment system for trading government
securities (MEFP ¶12). Regarding the existing elements of the payment system, both the
Real-Time Gross Settlements System (AIPS) and Bulk Settlement System (AECH) have
facilitated the use of the banking system in economic transactions, and enhanced
financial system efficiency and security. The authorities acknowledged that ample
banking sector liquidity discouraged the organic growth of inter-bank money markets and
secondary markets in government securities. However, they anticipated that the need for
these markets would increase in the future because the rise in bank lending would
eventually lead to greater liquidity differentiation among banks. They thought that the
envisaged delivery-versus-payment system—for which they have already requested Fund
technical assistance—would facilitate the emergence of these markets. Staff supported
this initiative, noting that such markets would create additional efficiencies and improve
both the monetary transmission mechanism and public debt management capacity. To
promote organic development, the mission advised the authorities to refrain from entering
the inter-bank market when overall banking sector liquidity is sufficient.

25
30.
Staff supported the authorities’ plan to overhaul the currently weak
supervision of nonbank financial institutions (MEFP ¶11). With World Bank
assistance, and in line with FSSA advise, a new legal framework has been approved by
the government to unify all nonbank supervisory institutions—insurance, private pension
funds and securities—within a single agency. The mission urged the authorities to
cooperate closely with the World Bank in finalizing and implementing this framework.
The new agency should be fully independent—including with respect to its staff
compensation levels—and sufficiently funded to enable it to function effectively and to
attract and retain qualified staff. It should also have the necessary capacity to cooperate
effectively with the BoA. The authorities have temporarily limited participation in the
pension fund industry to three firms because of concerns that the governing legal
framework is antiquated and doesn’t provide adequate guidance for supervision. Staff
welcomed this step because of the threat to financial system stability and suggested that
the authorities continue to refrain from issuing new licenses until an appropriate legal
framework has been developed. It will also be important to strengthen AML/CFT
capacities.
31.
In light of worldwide concerns about the possibility of an avian flu pandemic,
the authorities plan to improve contingency planning for the financial sector. Staff
encouraged the authorities to accelerate the implementation of the necessary
improvements.
E. Achieving Lasting Improvement in the Electricity Sector
32.
The authorities describe the electricity sector as being in permanent crisis
and have concluded that the current strategy is not working (MEFP ¶6). They
stressed that the missed performance criterion on KESH’s collection and loss
performance did not reflect a lack of effort—indeed, their efforts had resulted in
significant, though still insufficient improvement since February 2006. The authorities
had concluded, however, that the government could not be an effective owner of KESH
and, therefore, progress in rehabilitation and improvement was not sustainable over the
medium-term. Thus, they intend to develop a new energy sector strategy to promote
increased private sector involvement, including the privatization of electricity
distribution. After discussions with donors, they plan to finalize the new strategy by end2006. To facilitate the timely privatization of electricity distribution, the authorities have
adopted a new electricity tariff structure that would remove currently existing crosssubsides from business users to households and increase the average tariff to reflect
higher import costs.6 In cooperation with the World Bank, the authorities will expand the
existing social transfer scheme administered by KESH to compensate low-income
6

The independent regulator for the electricity sector approved this proposal, but with a reduction in special
tariffs for high-voltage users that would result in a significant revenue loss for KESH. The authorities have
appealed this change.

26
families for the tariff increase. Staff welcomed the shift in the energy sector strategy and
urged the authorities to work closely with the World Bank and other development
partners in fleshing out the details and preparing for the privatization of electricity
distribution. As a prior action for completing the review, the authorities are required to
finalize the necessary arrangements to secure technical assistance for these tasks.
33.
Staff also encouraged the authorities to rapidly privatize remaining large
state-owned enterprises so as to reduce government involvement in other non-core
areas (MEFP ¶6). The authorities agreed that the companies involved—Albpetrol and
ARMO (oil), INSIG (insurance), and Albtelecom (telecom)—should be privatized
without first attempting rehabilitation, as this was a task best left to the future owners.
F. Other Issues
34.
Renewed efforts are needed to strengthen official statistics based on the
recommendations of the March 2006 data ROSC. Noting the major weaknesses of the
recently revised national accounts, staff recommended revising the methodology and
preparing new estimates together with preliminary estimates for 2005 (SB endNovember 2006). They also identified major methodological problems in the balance of
payment statistics related to the way remittances are calculated and recommended
preparing revised estimates (SB end-December 2006). The mission welcomed the
authorities’ decision to conduct a labor force survey to provide much-needed employment
and wage data.
35.
The authorities have continued to make progress in clearing arrears with
non-Paris Club creditors (MEFP ¶25). Albania maintains restrictions under the
transitional arrangements of Article XIV in the form of outstanding debit balances
estimated at €65mn at end-2005 which are derived from inoperative bilateral payment
agreements that were in place before Albania joined the Fund.7 Staff has been in an
ongoing dialogue with the authorities on the removal of these restrictions in the context
of regularization of external arrears. Further progress was made during 2005 with
agreements for arrears clearance reached with Romania and the Czech and Slovak
Republics for €16.7mn. The authorities have engaged private sector creditors, and
reported progress in reconciling outstanding balances with German, Swiss and Turkish
creditors. The authorities expect to clear all arrears with official creditors by mid-2007
and with private creditors by end-2007. Albania continues to implement its WTO
commitments to reduce tariff barriers.

7

There are currently outstanding debit balances with Algeria, Cuba, Greece, Poland, Vietnam, and Serbia and
Montenegro.

27
G. Program Issues
36.
The program is fully financed for 2006 (Table 10).8 The financing gap is
expected to be closed by donor assistance and arrears rescheduling. For 2007, most of the
gap financing has been identified. Projected future debt service to the Fund remains
minimal (peaking at 0.6 percent of exports) (Tables 11 and 12). Non-concessional
borrowing of no more than €70 million (less than 1 percent of GDP) is permitted in 2006,
and would be devoted mainly to infrastructure projects, to facilitate Albania's exit from
the PRGF facility and IDA.
37.
The proposed structural conditionality includes measures that are necessary
to ensure sufficient progress in meeting the goals of the PRGF/EFF-supported
program (MEFP Tables 1 and 2). They are in line with the Fund’s policy on
streamlining program conditionality. Structural reforms will start in debt management, an
area where little progress has been made in the past decade, and will reach an important
stage in the financial sector where the establishment of a credit bureau will help reduce
vulnerabilities. Tax administration reforms will also progress by preparing the ground for
merging small and inefficient local tax offices.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
38.
Albania’s development in recent years has been impressive. Rapid growth
with low inflation, together with large remittances, has raised living standards and
significantly reduced poverty. Sound macroeconomic policies and an increasingly
competitive banking sector contributed to this success.
39.
The floating exchange rate regime has served Albania well. A key benefit of
the regime has been that it has helped avoid a significant misalignment of the exchange
rate. With continued exposure to potentially large idiosyncratic shocks, it will be essential
to maintain exchange rate flexibility in the future.
8

The Lek 2.1 billion reported by the Albanian authorities for end-March 2005 on net credit to government—
which was subject to a performance criterion (PC) in the sixth review under the previous PRGF arrangement—
did not include the Lek 7.7 billion worth of government securities that were issued to the BoA on February 1,
2005. These government securities were issued to the BoA in accordance with the central bank law to cover its
valuation losses on foreign exchange-denominated assets and liabilities. With these securities included, net
credit to the government would have been Lek 9.8 billion compared with the program ceiling of Lek 6.6 billion
for this test date, and the end-March PC on net credit to government would have been missed. The information
on the issuance of these securities was set out in paragraph 18 of the authorities’ MEFP dated February 3, 2005
(circulated to the Executive Board on February 9, 2005). Staff understood that the issuance of these government
securities to the BoA was relevant to the end-March PC on net credit to government, and without revision to the
PRGF-supported program, the end-March target would not be met. However, staff neglected to include a
corresponding adjuster in the program documents. When staff assessed the authorities’ observance of this PC
and updated the Executive Board on Albania's performance under the program in the context of the sixth review
in August 2005, they computed net credit to government as if there had been such an adjuster. Given the above,
the nonobservance did not give rise to a noncomplying disbursement because Albania had relied on the staff
conclusion that the end-March 2005 PC on net credit to the government had been met.

28
40.
Notwithstanding these notable achievements, the business environment has
remained uninviting and the economy is vulnerable on several fronts. Weak public
institutions, particularly in core areas such as property rights and contract enforcement,
and an underdeveloped infrastructure limit Albania’s growth potential. Recurring
difficulties in the electricity sector have been a particular concern. At the same time,
vulnerabilities in debt management and the non-bank financial system may endanger
macroeconomic stability. Moreover, the rapid pace of credit expansion creates significant
risk in the banking sector and exerts pressure on inflation and the external current
account.
41.
Catching up with middle-income countries will require further major
structural reforms. To sustain high growth and create the conditions for a significant
expansion of the export sector, it will be essential to strengthen the non-price
competitiveness of Albanian producers and remove impediments to FDI and domestic
investment. To this end, improving the quality of public institutions and that of the
country’s infrastructure are key priorities.
42.
As its institutional capacity is limited, the government should concentrate on
its core functions. Growth enhancing institutional reforms should focus on areas where
Albania lags its new competitors, such as property rights and contract enforcement. This
will require improving access to title registration; attacking corruption, including in the
court system; training judges that deal with commercial cases; and making it easier for
banks to execute collateral.
43.
The private sector should be encouraged to take the lead in non-core areas.
The authorities’ proposed energy sector strategy—which aims to increase private sector
involvement, including through the privatization of electricity distribution—is an
appropriately ambitious step in this direction. Without this reform, the energy sector is
likely to remain a significant risk to growth over the medium term, and also a drain on
public finances. The remaining large state-owned enterprises should also be privatized as
expeditiously as possible.
44.
The envisaged medium-term strategy of keeping government small and
improving the quality of public expenditure is appropriate. To make this model
successful, expenditure needs to be reallocated to priority areas—such as education,
health care and public investment—with focus on value for money. This will require
strengthening medium-term budgeting to reflect NSSED and integrating these mediumterm plans with the annual budget process.
45.
To improve the business environment, tax reforms should aim to eliminate
distortions and reduce compliance costs. Measures should focus on simplifying the tax
system, broadening the tax base, and creating a culture of tax compliance. Revenue
administration reforms are also essential to reduce fiscal vulnerabilities. Progress made so

29
far in improving customs administration and strengthening the LTO is encouraging but
continued efforts are needed to consolidate these improvements.
46.
If future gains from revenue administration reforms turn out to be
significant, a considerable part should be used to reduce public debt more decisively
then currently envisaged. Reductions in the tax rates could promote higher employment
and growth, but faster fiscal consolidation would reduce fiscal vulnerabilities and leave a
smaller debt burden to future generations. Although the programmed increase of public
investment will improve intergenerational fairness and net worth, the planned gradual
reduction in gross public debt would still leave public finances vulnerable to shocks.
Therefore, in addition to faster debt reduction, the necessary institutional capacity to
manage public debt should also be created. To this end, the public debt management
reform action plan should be implemented in a timely fashion.
47.
Future tax cuts should be introduced at a measured pace, making certain
that revenue gains financing them are sustainable. The authorities’ focus on
promoting employment and formalization of the economy is appropriate. In this respect,
the planned reduction in high social security contributions rates is a step in the right
direction. However, it will be important to ensure that this reduction does not endanger
the financial stability of the pension system. The proposed second step—parallel
reductions in top personal and corporate income tax rates—may also be appropriate if
taken together with sufficient measures to broaden the bases of these taxes. As the VAT
rate is in line with regional levels, and in view of its efficiency and wide base, a cut in
this important indirect tax should not be contemplated for now.
48.
The supplementary budget for 2006 is consistent with the overall fiscal
strategy. It allocates additional resources to high-quality infrastructure investments while
properly balancing the need for tax relief with that for debt reduction. The planned road
projects are much needed to improve poor infrastructure. Saving part of the revenue
administration gains—rather than spending them all as envisaged at the conception of the
program—will provide the necessary support for monetary policy and help reduce public
debt faster than previously envisaged. Although it is a small step in absolute terms, it
shows the government’s willingness to consider the fundamental trade-off between
reducing public debt and lowering the tax burden involved in its fiscal strategy.
49.
Albania has a sound and profitable banking system that is developing
quickly. Nonetheless, potential risks arising from rapid credit growth should be carefully
monitored and proactively managed. The agreed measures to strengthen banking
supervision and enhance prudential regulations—along with the creation of a credit
bureau and the improvement of the legal framework for collateral execution—are
necessary and will help preserve loan quality. The authorities should take every effort to
implement them in a timely fashion and should stand ready to take additional measures if

30
necessary. The prudential measures should also help contain credit growth at a level that
is consistent with macroeconomic stability.
50.
There is an urgent need to strengthen non-bank financial supervision. The
existing supervisory agencies are weak and lack independence, which is a major source
of vulnerability. The authorities’ plan to create a unified agency is therefore welcome.
The authorities should ensure that new agency is independent, sufficiently funded, and
has a properly trained and salaried staff to make supervision effective.
51.
Official statistics need to be improved to serve as a reliable basis for policy
making and program design. National accounts and the balance of payments statistics
contain significant weaknesses. Moreover, the lack of timely labor market data continues
to hinder monetary policy analysis.
52.
Staff supports the authorities’ request for a waiver for the non-observance of
the performance criterion and recommends completion of the first review of the
PRGF/EFF-supported program and the financing assurances review. The authorities
have made continued good faith effort to meet the targets for KESH in the second quarter
of 2006. They are committed to cooperate closely with the World Bank in the electricity
sector and have taken strong corrective actions in this area to ensure the successful
implementation of the IMF program. The authorities have changed their energy sector
strategy to promote significantly increased private sector involvement, including the
privatization of electricity distribution. They also introduced a new electricity tariff
structure to improve KESH’s financial performance and facilitate timely privatization.
The implementation of the prior action will ensure that they receive the necessary
technical assistance to finalize their new strategy and prepare for the privatization of
electricity distribution.
53.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Albania takes place
within 24 months subject to the provisions of the decision on consultation cycles in
program countries.

VII. Safeguards Assessments:
Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Bank of Albania (BoA) will be subject
to a safeguards assessment with respect to the proposed arrangement, to be completed not
later than the first program review. The most recent full safeguards assessment was carried
out in connection with the expiring program and was finalized in June 2002. The
assessment noted that the BoA has made significant progress in implementing the
recommendations of the first safeguards assessment, and that, in general, the BoA has
adequate safeguards in place to reduce the risk of misuse and misreporting of Fund
resources. Nevertheless, the assessment noted minor weaknesses in the bank’s internal

48
auditing, financial reporting, and internal control systems, all of which BoA management
agreed to address.
VIII. Exchange Rate Arrangement:
On July 1, 1992 the Albanian authorities adopted a floating exchange rate system (an
independent float). Under the Fund’s de facto exchange rate regime classification, Albania
follows an independently floating exchange rate regime—although the monetary
authorities occasionally intervene in the foreign exchange market with the objective of
smoothing temporary fluctuations. Albania’s exchange rate arrangement is free from
exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices subject to Fund jurisdiction under
Article VIII. However, the country still avails itself of the transitional arrangements under
Article XIV and maintains exchange restrictions in the form of outstanding debit balances
on inoperative bilateral payment agreements, which were in place before Albania became
a Fund member. These relate primarily to debt in nonconvertible and formerly
nonconvertible currencies, which the authorities are working to resolve by mid-2007 for
official creditors, and by end-2007 for private sector creditors. Albania has not imposed
new restrictions under Article VIII. The exchange rate stood at 97.5 lek per U.S. dollar on
June 15, 2006.
IX. Article IV Consultation:
The conclusion of the 2004 Article IV consultation and the fifth review under the threeyear PRGF arrangement took place in February 2005 (IMF Country Report No. 05/89).
Albania moved from a 12-month cycle to a 24-month cycle, in line with the decision on
consultation cycles approved on July 15, 2002. The last Article XIV Consultation was
concluded in December 2005.
X. FSAP Participation and ROSCs:
An FSAP was carried out in early 2005. The Financial System Stability Assessment was
considered by the Executive Board on August 1, 2005 concurrently with the staff report
for the sixth review of the PRGF-supported program and financing assurances review. An
action plan for implementing the FSAP recommendations has been prepared in
consultation with the IMF and is currently being implemented. A data module ROSC was
published on the Fund’s website in June 2000. A fiscal ROSC was completed in
June 2003. Albania participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS), and a
complete set of GDDS metadata for the external, financial, fiscal, and real sectors, as well
as for the socio-demographic indicators is posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards
Bulletin Board (http://dsbb.imf.org). A data module ROSC reassessment using the Data
Quality Assessment Framework was conducted in March 2006.

49
XI. Technical Assistance:
The Fund, other multilateral organizations and donors have provided extensive assistance
for institutional development in Albania. The Fund alone has sent several technical
assistance missions to Albania every year since 1991. However, further institutional
development is required in virtually every sector.
XII. Resident Representative:
A Fund resident representative has been posted in Tirana since April 1993. Ms. AnnMargret Westin has filled this position since August 2005.

APPENDIX II: IMF-WORLD BANK RELATIONS
Partnership in Albania’s Development Strategy
The Republic of Albania has been a member of the World Bank since 1991. Since then,
the WBG has provided strong support to Albania, including 60 loans mostly in IDA
commitments totaling US$834.8 million, IFC commitments of US$125 million, and MIGA
guarantees totaling US$8.6 million. The quality of the active portfolio has continued to
improve, with an increasing focus on long-term capacity development and implementation
through Government structures.
1.

The World Bank’s Board discussed a new Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for
Albania for FY06-FY09 in January 2006. The new CAS builds on the experience of the
World Bank Group (WBG) since the early 1990s (through three CASs).9 The CAS presents a
program of support which seeks to build on the improved macro-economic management and
progress in structural reforms that has occurred since 2002. It aims to support Albania’s
National Strategy for Social and Economic Development (NSSED) and the European Union
(EU) Stabilization and Association process (SAP) with the ultimate objective of EU
integration and the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
2.

The NSSED, adopted in 2001, remains the main development strategy that aims to
bring Albania’s living standards and income levels closer to the levels of its neighboring
European countries. It represents Albania’s serious effort to use a comprehensive mediumterm national development strategy to move from short-term crisis management to creating
the conditions that promote long-term growth and poverty reduction. The NSSED has strong
government ownership and was prepared through an unprecedented participatory process. It
is based on three pillars: (i) improving governance, (ii) promoting private sector
development, and (iii) fostering human resources development. The NSSED recognizes that
weak governance and institutions are at the root of Albania’s developmental problems, and
acknowledges that economic growth will be the main instrument to reduce poverty, raise
standards of living, and accelerate the attainment of the MDGs. It also contains improved
poverty diagnostics and an ambitious plan for monitoring and evaluation. A Joint Staff
Advisory Note presented the Staffs assessment of the NSSED implementation as
communicated in the Third Annual Progress Report for the NSSED prepared by GoA.
The new government is committed to revise the strategy to better address the link between
MTBP and NSSED processes. Based on the Integrated Planning System, the strategic
planning methodology has been launched, which sets standards for the formulation, approval,
implementation and monitoring of the new national strategy. The new strategy is expected to
be approved by end-2006.

and MIGA.

51
Bank Group Strategy
Reflecting Government priorities, the CAS (2006-2009) program seeks to support
Albania’s efforts in strengthening governance, sustaining a private sector-led growth and
improving service delivery. The new CAS recognizes that more coherent efforts need to be
made to address the challenge of poor governance in Albania, and introduces a ‘Governance
Filter’ compromising of four core principles which will be used to ensure that governance
considerations are mainstreamed into all of the Bank’s interventions. The CAS program is
also more selective, focused on two pillars:
4.

(I)

Continued Economic Growth through Support to Private Sector Development,
with expected outcomes including (a) macroeconomic stability; (b) improved
business climate through better quality of business regulations and improved
public-private sector dialogue; (c) improved public infrastructure; (d) increased
operational efficiency of financial institutions; (e) improved functioning of the
land market; (f) improved corporate governance; (g) increased transparency and
efficiency in the management of public spending and stronger institutions for
planning, tendering and providing infrastructure and services; (h) better
accountability in public administration; and (i) better management and planning
for Albanian coastal resources.

(II) Improving Public Service Delivery, particularly in the Social Sectors, with
expected outcomes including: (a) improved educational attainment and quality of
basic education; (b) improved efficiency and equity of health financing; (c) better
quality of health care; (d) improved fiscal sustainability of the social insurance
system and increased access to well-targeted, sustainable, and effective
assistance; and (e) improved access to safe rural water supply and sanitation.
The CAS proposes a lending range of US$ 75 – US$ 196 million, with actual lending to
be determined by the pace of reform in key sectors. The proposed lending program would be
financed by a blend of IDA and IBRD resources, with gradual transition from IDA to IBRD
beginning in FY06. Up to 11 new IDA/IBRD lending operations are proposed in FY06FY09, of which three would be a series of programmatic Development Policy Loan (DPL)
building on the success of the PRSC series in the previous CAS. The CAS employs also
targeted program of WBG Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA) support.
5.

The active World Bank portfolio includes 15 investment projects with a total
commitment of $245.8 million, of which about $179.1 million remain to be disbursed. The
investment side of the Bank’s portfolio has performed well, and several new activities are
scheduled to be presented to the Board before the end of FY06. Following the Board
approval in June 2005 of three new projects : (i) the Natural Resources Development project
(June 9); (ii) the Integrated Coastal Zone Management and Clean-Up project (June 21); and,
(iii) the new power sector ECSEE-APL2-Albania project (June 28), the World Bank is
preparing three operations that have been presented to the Board before the end of June 2006.
These include:,a) Education Excellence and Quality and Equity Project , b) Health System
Modernization Project.
6.

52
Bank-Fund Collaboration in Specific Areas
7.
As in previous periods, the World Bank assistance for structural reform in Albania will
continue supporting the IMF’s lead role on support for macro-economic policies aimed at
facilitating sustainable growth. Continuing collaboration is likely to become even more
critical given that most of the outstanding areas for reform remain on the structural side. In
areas of direct interest to the IMF, the Bank is engaging in policy dialogue and providing
financial and technical assistance to support (i) improved public expenditure management;
(ii) public sector reform; (iii) pension, health and social assistance reform; (iv) financial
sector reform and development; (v) an improved policy environment for business.

Public expenditure management: Albania’s weak systems of Public Financial
Management (PFM) and related fiscal institutions constitute a main risk for macroeconomic
stability and high quality fiscal adjustment. Over the past years, the Bank has complemented
IMF policy conditionality and technical assistance with a multi-pronged assistance program
including lending operations and fiduciary and diagnostic work. Under the new CAS, the
Bank will continue taking the lead in this area through the ongoing Programmatic Public
Expenditure and Institutional Review and the upcoming Integrated Fiduciary Assessment
(CFAA/CPAR-FY06). These will identify key weaknesses in the PFM system and provide
the underlying analysis for defining further public expenditure management components and
policy reform conditionality in the DPL.

8.

To increase the effectiveness of public expenditure and public financial management
system, the World Bank will support a number of measures to further improve the strategic
allocation of resources mainly through the support to the implementation of the Integrated
Planning System (IPS); improving the linkages between recurrent and investment spending
and strengthening the rigorous review of public investment projects based on economic and
financial criteria.
9.

10. Public sector reform: The civil service and broader public sector employment
structures require continued engagement and support. The Bank and IMF will need to work
closely to ensure that an appropriate framework is in place to allow the Government to move
ahead with efforts to a) restructure the government apparatus by reducing the size of
government and rendering it more efficient, b) increase competitiveness of the salary
structure and the ability of the civil service to attract skilled and competent professionals; and
b) consolidate and deepen the measures aimed at the depoliticization of the civil service
through the expansion of the Civil Service Law in a manner that is fiscally responsible. As
deeper reform of public administration is currently anticipated through the CAS period, the
Bank will also look, to use the DPL to continue to engage on civil service reform.
11. Power sector reform: The Bank and the Fund confirmed their support to the
Government’s efforts to overcome the recent crisis and agreed with the authorities that
sustained implementation of the agreed measures to improve the performance in the power
sector will be indispensable for growth and macroeconomic stability. While the Bank has
taken the lead in developing the policy agenda, the sector's fiscal impact has also motivated
conditionality in successive Fund arrangements.

53

Conditionality related to improving sector performance, sector restructuring, and
strengthening the regulatory and legislative framework is included in successive Bankfinanced projects. On-going projects include the Power Sector Rehabilitation and
Restructuring Project (2002) that covers rehabilitation of the distribution network in three
regions; the Power Sector Generation and Restructuring Project (2004) that will provide new
thermal generation capacity and is co-financed by EBRD and EIB; and the ECSEE APL2Albania Project (2005) that is co-financed by EBRD and will finance the upgrading of the
high-voltage transmission substations, thereby facilitating Albania's participation in the
Energy Community of South East Europe (ECSEE).
12.

Social Insurance Reforms: The financial stability of the social insurance system and
the coverage and targeting of the social assistance system are key components of medium
term fiscal consolidation. Both the Bank and the IMF have focused on pension reform under
the PRSC and PRGF programs, including the increase of the retirement age for men and
women. The short-term agenda will focus on strengthening the financial sustainability of the
existing pension scheme while aiming for a reduction of the overall payroll tax burden in the
medium term so as to help improve competitiveness of Albanian labor. The Bank is
supporting SII in developing its capacity to model medium- and long-term impacts of policy
changes on the fiscal sustainability of the social insurance system and to identify a
sustainable path for future reforms to the social insurance system. The Bank and the IMF will
support such reforms in a coordinated fashion. They will also work closely to ensure that
essential pre-conditions for future structural reforms to the pension system will be put in
place, including strengthening of the financial markets as a one of the preconditions for
establishment of potential future funded benefits systems.
13.

Financial sector reform and development. Albania has made significant progress
towards the adoption of a market-based economy with the support of the World Bank and the
IMF. The Financial Sector Adjustment Credit (FSAC), approved by the Board in June 2002,
has helped to advance reforms in the banking sector, including the privatization of the
Savings Bank, the development of a deposit insurance system, improvement of the
bankruptcy framework and collateral enforcement, strengthening of bank regulation and
supervision, and the development of a Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system. The IMF
has provided technical assistance to the Bank of Albania by funding a resident adviser to
support the implementation of the institutional development program for banking supervision
developed by the Bank of Albania with the assistance from the Bank.

14.

The WBG in conjunction with the IMF will assist the Government in the completion of
the financial sector reform agenda and support the implementation of the recommendations
of the recently concluded Joint IMF-World Bank Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP). The DPL will support policy measures associated with financial sector development,
including (i) adoption of a legal, institutional and supervisory framework enabling sound
development of the non-banking financial sector, including the insurance sector; (ii)
strengthening insurance supervision and regulation; and (iii) adoption and implementation of
an EU-compatible legal and institutional framework for accounting and auditing.
15.

54

This reform agenda will be coordinated closely with European Commission institutions,
especially in those elements of the reform agenda, such as accounting and auditing, for which
the acquis communautaire is relevant.
16.

Improving the business environment. A weak business environment plagued with
considerable administrative barriers, weak governance, corruption, ambiguities in property
and land rights, poor quality and high cost of infrastructure and utilities, is undermining
future growth prospects and job creation. Improving the business environment will be crucial
to overcome high levels of unemployment, attract the badly needed investment flows, and
boost exports. Complementing the IMF dialogue on macro-economic stability and its
technical and advisory assistance to strengthening tax administration, the Bank will use a
combination of instruments, namely the Business Environment Reform and Institutional
Strengthening Project and the Land Management and Urban Development project (expected
board approval in January 2007) in conjunction with the DPL to support improvements in the
business climate, through (i) the adoption and implementation of regulatory governance rules
and tools aimed at improving the quality of business-sector related regulations, (ii)
establishment and operations of a Secretariat for Regulatory Reforms for the removal of
administrative barriers to investment; and (iii) adoption and implementation of a transparent
land registration system.

APPENDIX III: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision is adequate overall for surveillance, although further improvements in some
areas are needed. Albania was a pilot country for the data dissemination module of the
Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC), and a data ROSC was published
on the IMF’s external website in May 2000.10 Albania participates in the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS) and metadata for the external, financial, fiscal, and real
sectors, as well as socio-demographic indicators were initially posted on the Fund’s
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB) in May 2000 and last updated in July 2005.
Plans for improving data compilation and dissemination across all statistical sectors are also
posted on the DSBB. Recently, the authorities expressed an interest in a ROSC data module
using the Data Quality Assessment Framework (DQAF) and subscription to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS). In response, a ROSC data module mission took place
during March 8–22, 2006. The mission assessed data quality in six areas of macroeconomic
statistics (national accounts, consumer price index, producer price index, government
finance, monetary, and balance of payments statistics) based on the DQAF (July 2003), and
reassessed Albania’s data dissemination practices against the GDDS. At the request of the
authorities, the mission also conducted an assessment of dissemination practices against the
SDDS and prepared a work program and timetable for meeting the requirements for SDDS
subscription.
The mission found that Albania’s statistical system has made significant progress in adopting
international statistical standards despite acute resource constraints. Official statistical
agencies demonstrate strong and sustained commitment to plans and programs to further
upgrade statistics in response to greater challenges posed by: i) a rapidly evolving economy;
ii) the desire of the Albanian authorities to subscribe to the SDDS; iii) the adoption of an
inflation targeting regime; and iv) growing national aspirations to join the European Union.
However, due to severe resource constraints at the Institute of Statistics (INSTAT), the
improvement in the national accounts has been slower relative to other datasets.
The Law on Official Statistics (2004) strengthened the legal framework for INSTAT as an
independent agency under the Council of Ministers, and articulated the role of the Statistics
Council as INSTAT’s governing body. In addition, Memoranda of Understandings between
INSTAT and the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and the Bank of Albania (BoA), expected to be
signed soon, will facilitate data sharing and coordination among these agencies.

10

Albania’s ROSC (data module) was undertaken before the formal adoption of the Data Quality Assessment
Framework.

56
A. Real Sector
Price statistics
STA has provided considerable technical assistance to Albania on price statistics. Data on
consumer price index (CPI) are reported regularly for publication in International Financial
Statistics (IFS). In 2001, a revision of CPI weights was initiated by INSTAT based on a new
household budget survey and a revised CPI was finalized in February 2002. The compilation
of the CPI generally follows international standards, and the estimation of imputed rent
within the CPI was improved in 2003. However, given the limited coverage of the 2000
household budget survey (HBS) (only urban areas combined with a rapid change of the
structure of the economy and consumption pattern), new CPI weights should be compiled.
The recent ROSC mission recommended (i) introduction of checks on the prices reported by
enumerators; (ii) replacement of nonrespondents to the HBS with similar households; and
(iii) inclusion of new items into the CPI as they become significant.
A monthly producer price index (PPI) has been published quarterly since March 2002. Prices
are collected for each month, but only once a quarter, due to financial constraints. The
weights were derived from the 1998 annual Structural Business Survey. The ROSC mission
recommended (i) monthly publication of the PPI; (ii) replacement of enterprises that go out
of business; and (iii) validation of the PPI results against all other available price data.
National accounts
In January 2003, INSTAT published the first official GDP estimates for 1996-2000 and, later
that year, preliminary estimates for 2001. Following the first release, revised GDP estimates
have been disseminated but not on a regular basis. In November 2005, INSTAT released
major revisions of the GDP estimates (for 1996-2003) and updates for 2004, reflecting
methodological improvements.
STA missions visited Albania in November 2004 and March 2005 to assist the authorities in
improving the timeliness of the annual national accounts data and in developing quarterly
national accounts. INSTAT has benefited from technical assistance by the Fund and the
European Union (EU), mainly to address weaknesses in methodology, basic data sources,
and incomplete coverage of the private sector.
STA concluded a technical assistance project in March 2006 for which the Italian
government agreed to commit $500,000 from its sub-account with the IMF over a period of
two years. The project was aimed at further improving the national accounts estimates and
basic source data. The Italian National Institute of Statistics (Istat) and the National Statistics
Office of Finland (Statistics Finland) provided technical assistance to INSTAT following the
project contract.

57
National accounts are compiled from numerous but insufficient source data that are
hampered by poor questionnaire design (e.g., Structural Business Survey), limited area
coverage (e.g., HBS), and insufficient frequency of surveys. Despite the technical assistance
provided on methodological procedures, source data still do not supply sufficient information
to compile reliable estimates on the nonobserved economy. The ROSC mission
recommended (i) improvement of source data to adequately capture the nonobserved
economy; (ii) expansion of the scope of annual national accounts to include the income
account, the capital account, and the rest of the world accounts; and (iii) improvement of the
timeliness of GDP data (currently 11 months) so as to meet the 9-month recommendation of
the GDDS.
INSTAT needs additional staff and financial resources to fully carry out its statistical work
program.
External trade
The compilation and dissemination of foreign trade data has improved in recent years,
following disruptions in the late 1990s. One important factor is the implementation of the
Automated System of Customs Data (ASYCUDA), supported by the EU. Further progress is
expected in the area of trade in services as a result of the implementation of surveys.
B. Government Finance
Albanian government finance statistics (GFS) generally follow internationally accepted
standards and guidelines on concepts and definitions, scope, classification and sectorization,
and basis for recording vis-à-vis the Government Finance Statistics Manual 1986
(GFSM 1986). A formal “migration path” to the GFSM 2001 has not been articulated, but a
series of coordinated technical actions at the MoF—including the design and implementation
of an accrual-compatible database infrastructure—are well advanced. The scope of the
general government sector is in line with the GFSM 1986 and encompasses budgetary central
government, (representing a total of about 1520 individual budget institutions), local
government (representing a total of about 2160 units), and two extrabudgetary funds (the
social security fund and the health insurance fund).
The Organic Budget Law and the Guidelines on State Budget Performance clearly mandate
the responsibility of the MoF for compiling and disseminating government finance statistics.
The main data sources, which are timely, are reports of i) District Treasury Offices; ii) the
Debt Management and Financial Analysis System; iii) project implementation units for
foreign financed project; and iv) the extrabudgetary funds. The significant weakness in
source data is in the availability of data on certain external donor financed (grants) projects
that do not pass through the treasury system. Albania recently submitted fiscal data to the
Fund for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. The authorities have
expressed an interest in reporting high-frequency data for publication in the International
Financial Statistics using the GFSM 2001-based monthly Statement of Sources and Uses of
Cash.

58

The ROSC mission recommended that MoF accelerate work aimed at formally adopting the
GFSM 2001-based reporting format and improve source data coverage for external donor
financed projects.
C. Monetary Accounts
The monetary data compilation framework conforms to the methodology recommended in
the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM), and data are compiled and reported
on a timely basis. The depository corporations survey covers the BoA and all the other
deposit-taking institutions (17 commercial banks and 130 savings and loans associations
(SLAs)). The accounts of the SLAs, with the exception of loans, are produced on a cash
basis, which is not in accordance with the MFSM’s recommendations of accrual accounting.
The accounts of the BoA and of the commercial banks are produced on an accrual basis. An
exception is that their holdings of nontradable long-term securities are recorded at book
value.
The authorities revised the accounts of the BoA, commercial banks, and the monetary survey
from February 2001 onward to properly record repurchase and reverse repurchase
agreements; revised monetary data were first published in the October 2002 issue of IFS. The
authorities are also making efforts to revise the historical data.
In January 2005, the BoA reported its monetary data to STA using Standardized Report
Forms. This will facilitate the implementation of an integrated monetary database to be used
for both publication in IFS and for operational needs of EUR.
To further improve Albania’s monetary statistics, the recent ROSC mission recommended
that the BoA (i) apply fully the MFSM’s recommendations on market valuation and accrual
accounting; (ii) implement measures to improve the accuracy of the banks’ reporting; (iii)
implement an electronic (online) reporting system for banks and other financial institutions;
and (iv) introduce a database driven compilation system for monetary statistics.
D. Balance of Payments
The data compiled by the BoA are methodologically sound, although some of the estimates,
particularly for international transactions made outside the banking system need to be
refined. The BoA has established data compilation procedures based on the classification
system of the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual. The BoA reports quarterly
data to STA on a regular and timely basis. It has revised the methodology for the
measurement of tourism services, principally through surveys of travelers. Problems remain
in the areas of service transactions and remittances, and in the monitoring of financial
account transactions, foreign assistance (grants from abroad to regional and local
governments are underreported), and external debt. These problems could be addressed by
strengthening existing data sources and improving estimation methods.

59
A November 2004 technical assistance mission noted that the coverage and accuracy of the
data should be improved through the strengthening of the legal framework and the use of the
banks reporting system to verify data from enterprises surveys. It also recommended
incorporating the results of the direct investment survey as well as investigation and followup of the net errors and omissions observed at the level of individual reporting banks. A
follow-up technical assistance mission by STA took place in February 2006. The mission
focused on remittances, goods for processing, services (particularly travel services), official
transfers, and direct investment.
To further improve compilation and dissemination of balance of payments statistics, the
ROSC mission recommended that BoA (i) improve source data to adequately capture
remittances; (ii) strengthen its law to provide for the sanctions―including fines―needed to
mandate response to surveys by nonbank reporters, to inspect the financial accounts of firms,
and to prohibit the provision of individual reporter’s data to tax authorities; (iii) require
quarterly reporting by significant firms of transactions in direct investment equity, debt, and
reinvested earnings; in portfolio equity and debt; and in trade credit; and (iv) introduce a
database driven compilation system for balance of payments statistics.
The Albanian authorities have not yet initiated compiling data on foreign currency liquidity
in line with the Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity
(Template). While the definition of data on official reserve assets is, in principle, consistent
with that of the Template, the data may not be adequate for monitoring the economy because
other foreign currency assets and currency drains are not included. The ROSC mission, in the
context of SDDS-related issues, discussed with the authorities the various components of the
Template and the data requirements for net predetermined drains and contingent drains.
E. External Debt and Grant Statistics
Good quality external debt statistics for public and publicly-guaranteed debt are compiled by
the MoF. The external debt database, developed with technical assistance from UNCTAD,
became fully operational in mid-2000. The external debt database ensures timely and
accurate reporting of external government debt (including commitments of state-owned
enterprises). However, there have been some irregularities in the recording and presentation
of old external arrears. The External Debt Committee needs to improve inter-agency
coordination to ensure the timely and accurate reporting of the stock of external arrears and
changes resulting from rescheduling agreements. The collection of data on external grants is
not timely, with lags of several months frequently encountered. In consultation with donors,
the authorities are preparing a new framework to improve data collection and reporting, to be
led by the MoF.

APPENDIX IV: EXTERNAL AND PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS (DSA)
The updated debt sustainability analysis is little changed from that presented in the
previous staff report (IMF Country Report No. 06/54)). Over the past decade Albania’s
debt sustainability has improved following debt restructuring and as a result of rapid growth
and relatively cautious fiscal policies. Looking ahead over the next five years, debt ratios are
expected to remain manageable: the public sector debt to GDP ratio falls back a little to
51.4% by 2010 and the external debt to GDP ratio gradually declines to 19.3%. External
debt service capacity also improves and the public debt service to revenue ratio declines.
Although the stress tests suggest that debt sustainability is comfortably maintained under a
range of shocks, Albania looks most vulnerable to shocks to growth and exports. The scale of
these shocks is somewhat exaggerated as they are based on historical averages and standard
deviations that include the 1997 crisis (when the pyramid schemes collapsed)—but the
results are nevertheless indicative of the importance of reforms to improve incentives for
investment, non-price competitiveness and to broaden the export base. Overall, the public
sector debt ratio is projected to decline over time and looks sustainable in the face of shocks.
But the current short duration of domestic debt instruments of only 200 days is a concern
which should be addressed as the government strengthens its public debt management in the
context of the IMF program.
External debt sustainability
Outstanding external debt is relatively low at around 20 percent of GDP and external
debt ratios are expected to remain easily manageable over the medium term. Looking
ahead, the challenge is to maintain external debt sustainability as financing becomes less
concessional and the private sector gains increased external market access. On current
assumptions—which include declining debt concessionality and lower export growth than
during the period after transition—retaining sustainability looks easily manageable as
external debt-to GDP ratios (both on NPV and in nominal terms) are expected to remain at
just under 20 percent and the external-debt-to-exports ratio (both on NPV and in nominal
terms) fall back as the export to GDP ratio improves.11 At the same time, despite the shift
towards less concessional debt, the projected external debt service ratio remains at
manageable levels of between 5 and 9 percent. Two further factors lower the risk of debt
distress. First, Albania is a net creditor to the world given private sector net assets in excess
of public sector net external debt. As the private sector becomes more important for the
economy over the forecast period its net indebtedness is expected to turn positive. Second,
according to the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment,which links the
quality of a country’s policies and institutions to thresholds for debt sustainability and which
11

The assumptions underlying the DSA are unchanged from those presented in IMF Country Report No. 06/54:
Real GDP growth 6 percent, inflation 3 percent and the real effective exchange rate projected to remain
constant. Export growth at 9–11 percent is slower than its historical average of 25 percent. The evolution of
domestic public debt is consistent with domestic borrowing targets under the program.

62
classifies Albania as a medium performer, external debt remains comfortably within the debt
sustainability thresholds (of NPV of debt to GDP of 40 percent and debt to exports of
150 percent), although the level of overall public sector debt to GDP is somewhat above the
40 percent.12
The stress tests show that external debt remains sustainable under a number of
standard shocks, but that Albania is vulnerable to shocks to exports and growth. Under
the standard simulations, external debt looks particularly vulnerable to an export shock which
would cause a fairly severe and relatively long lasting breach of the CPIA debt to exports
threshold of 150 percent. However, this reflects the severity of the shock which is based on
historical averages and standard deviations that include the economic crisis of 1997
(following the collapse of pyramid schemes). If one looks at shocks based on the averages
and variability of exports or GDP over the shorter period of 2000–2005, variability is much
lower and the standard shocks are consequently much smaller. Nonetheless, even the smaller
shock to exports would still move the debt to exports ratio close to the CPIA threshold. This
underscores the importance of reforms designed to remove disincentives to investment, to
improve competitiveness and broaden the export base.
Public debt sustainability
The public debt sustainability analysis is also broadly unchanged compared to that
contained in (IMF Country Report No. 06/54). In the baseline scenario, public debt is
projected to decline to 51.4 percent of GDP at end 2010 (from 55.3 percent of GDP at
end 2005). The standard stress tests show that Albania public debt position is relatively
resilient to shocks. A real growth shortfall of one standard deviation (compared to historical
average) in 2005–2006 is the shock which would have the largest impact, bringing the NPV
of the debt-to-GDP ratio to 66 percent in 2010. But again this is a relatively severe shock
since it is based on averages and variability that include the 1997 crisis—and again the shock
would be much smaller if based on the experience since 2000.

The CPIA index groups 20 indicators into four categories and scores countries against those categories using
scores of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The four groupings are economic management, structural policies, social
inclusion and equity and public sector management. An overall score of 3.25 to 3.75 gains a medium performer
ranking. Albania is classified as a medium performer it scores relatively highly for economic management and
structural policies but scores are weaker for public sector management and policies for social inclusion/equality.

Projections

Includes both public and private sector external debt.
Includes IMF.
Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in terms of Euros.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Defined as the stock of debt less international reserves of the banking system. Net debt of the public sector is defined as PPG external debt minus GIR of the Bank of Albania,
and net debt of the private sector is estimated as private external debt minus foreign assets of commercial banks.
6/ Assumes that NPV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
7/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in terms Euros), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in Euro/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.

Tirana, July 14, 2006
Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
Dear Mr. de Rato:
The approval of our PRGF/EFF-supported program in January 2006 marked the formal
continuation of the International Monetary Fund’s longstanding assistance to Albania. Over
the last decade, the Fund’s support has been pivotal to our efforts to achieve and maintain
macroeconomic stability and to develop and restructure our economy. In this we have
achieved considerable success, and it remains our expectation that our need for the Fund’s
resources will end with the expiration of the current arrangements.
Since the approval of our latest program, economic developments have proceeded largely as
expected and we maintain a firm foundation moving forward. Trend growth is strong,
inflation is in the 3±1 percent range, and confidence in the currency and the banking system
is on the rise. With significant structural adjustment carried out over the last three years, and
with detailed action plans now prepared to implement the FSAP recommendations and to
overhaul our debt management capacity, we are well placed to fully implement the ambitious
reform agenda described in the attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
(MEFP). These policies are consistent with our November 2001 National Strategy for SocioEconomic Development (NSSED) and the Annual Progress Report of July 2005.
With one exception, all quantitative and structural performance criteria under the program
have been observed. We did not manage to achieve the end-March 2006 structural
performance criterion stipulating that KESH would meet the collection rate and loss targets
under our Power Sector Action Plan. However, we steadily improved our collection and loss
performance, and we have taken measures to find a long-term solution to the problems in this
sector—including by securing the necessary technical assistance as a prior action for this
review. We therefore ask for a waiver for the non-observance of this performance criteria.
We request completion of the First Review under the three-year Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility arrangement together with concurrent approval of the First Review under the
three-year Extended Fund Facility arrangement; and also request the second disbursement
under both these arrangements in a total amount of SDR 2.435 million.

2
We believe that the policies set forth in the attached MEFP are adequate to achieve the
objectives of the program, but will take any further measures that may become appropriate
for this purpose. Albania will consult with the Fund on the adoption of these measures, and in
advance of revisions to the policies contained in the MEFP, in accordance with the Fund’s
policies on such consultation. Following this arrangement, and as long as Albania has
outstanding financial obligations to the IMF arising from loan disbursements under the
present arrangement, Albania will consult with the IMF from time to time on economic and
financial policies, at the initiative of the government or the Bank of Albania, or if the
Managing Director of the IMF requests such consultation. These consultations may include
correspondence and visits of officials of the IMF to Albania or of representatives of Albania
to the IMF. In continuing with our policy of transparency, we consent to the publication of
this letter, the attached MEFP, and the accompanying Executive Board documents on the
IMF’s website.

Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) for Albania
I. BACKGROUND
1.
This memorandum lays out the broad thrust of our policies over the remainder of
the 2006-2009 program period, and provides a detailed description of our policy
intentions up to mid-2007. It is consistent with the November 2001 National Strategy for
Socio-Economic Development (NSSED) and the May 2003, May 2004, and July 2005
NSSED Progress Reports. We have started preparing an updated NSSED for 2007-09, to
be completed by end-2006, which will be formulated within the comprehensive
Integrated Planning System introduced in 2005.
2.
Our macroeconomic performance during the previous PRGF-supported
program was solid. With the exception of the supply-induced disruptions of 2002, we
enjoyed a prolonged period of rapid, non-inflationary growth, within which confidence in
the currency, banking system, and viability of our macroeconomic policies
demonstratively improved. As risk premiums declined, inflationary expectations were
anchored at low levels, allowing the monetary policy stance to gradually relax while
reserves increased and the exchange rate maintained a mild trend appreciation. On the
fiscal front, current expenditure, the deficit, and domestic borrowing have been curtailed,
and the 2005 budget delivered the first surplus on current operations since the beginning
of the transition process. The public debt burden has been considerably reduced,
reflecting foreign debt restructuring, fiscal consolidation, rapid economic growth, and the
allocation of half the proceeds of large privatizations to redeem domestic debt. The debt
to GDP ratio declined to an estimated 55¼ percent of GDP at end-2005—a reduction of
10 percentage points since end-2002. We have also made progress in structural reform,
though this has lagged somewhat our macroeconomic success. Nonetheless, reforms
carried out in our financial system, within our customs administration, and in expenditure
management, as well as in the statistical and legal areas have brought us far from our
initial position at the beginning of the transition process. However, much remains to be
done.
3.
Since program approval in January 2006, macroeconomic stability has been
sustained and renewed emphasis given to structural reform, but some underlying
developments pose new challenges.
•

We expect a slight slowdown in growth from 5½ percent in 2005 to 5 percent this
year. The slowdown in 2005 was due to a severe disruption in electricity supply
during the last quarter, and to a weaker trade performance resulting from
increased competition in export markets and slower growth in partner countries.
Activity in the first quarter of 2006 has been slowed by decelerating activity in
services and construction resulting mainly from delays in executing public
investment. We expect public investment to rebound, but much of the impulse

4
will likely be felt towards the end of the year. Electricity production has recovered
and is likely to remain strong for the rest of the year, but the sector’s performance
is uncertain and the risk to growth from this source remains significant.
•

Based on fiscal revenues in the first half of 2006, as a result of improvements in
tax administration—particularly in customs—we expect an overperformance of
tax revenue relative to budget projections of 1-1½ percent of GDP. We have
allocated most of these gains, along with 0.1 percent of GDP of unbudgeted
privatization receipts, in a supplementary budget—primarily for road projects
already included in our NSSED and National Road Strategy, and also to reduce
the tax wedge on labor and to lower our debt stock at a more rapid pace than
envisaged at program conception.

•

Year-on-year inflation up to May 2006 was 3.2 percent, near the middle of the
3±1 percent target band of the BoA. However, price performance was uneven: a
sustained increase in nontraded goods prices above the target range was balanced
by lower tradables prices. Such developments are indicative of rising demand
pressures in the economy and hence an increase in vulnerability, as food prices
are largely exogenously determined and outside the control of monetary policy.
With fiscal policy relatively tight, we believe this demand-pull inflation to be
driven primarily by the rapid growth of private sector credit, which rose by
5½ percentage points of GDP in 2005, and continues to increase at a real rate
exceeding 64 percent. As a similar rate of expansion in 2006 would imply—in our
view—a too rapid increase of 8½ percentage points of GDP, we attach
considerable importance to both reducing the rate of increase this year and to
strengthening prudential regulations to safeguard loan quality.

•

On the external side, rising domestic demand from the credit expansion,
combined with higher energy import prices, and increased travel by Albanians
abroad, are all contributing factors to a widening of our trade deficit from
21.7 percent of GDP 2004 to 24.1 percent of GDP in 2005. The current account
has worsened accordingly.

•

We have moved ahead with our program of structural reform. In accordance with
our program commitments, we extended the ASYCUDA system—including the
risk assessment module—to a total of 11 customs houses (PC; end-March 2006);
we improved the functioning of the Large Taxpayer Office (LTO), which now
accounts for more than 50 percent of all tax collected (SB; end-June 2006); and
carried out a census of the wage bill for all budgetary sector employees (SB;endJune 2006). To improve the quality of public expenditure, we established and
staffed a public investment program department within the General Directorate of
the Ministry of Finance (SB; end-June 2006); and issued instructions for
submitting public investment proposals consistent with the budget and the

5
medium-term budgetary plan (SB; end-June 2006). To improve debt management,
we developed and discussed with IMF staff an action plan for implementing the
recommendations of the IMF TA mission on debt management (SB; endJune 2006). Similarly, in the financial sector, we developed and discussed with
IMF staff an action plan for implementing the recommendations of the Financial
Sector Stability Assessment (FSSA) report (SB; end-March 2006). All ongoing
structural benchmarks under the program concerned with safeguarding the
efficient use of nonconcessional foreign borrowing, strengthening tax
administration, and improving debt management capacity were met.
•

We have made progress in stabilizing the situation in the electricity sector.
Generation has been strong since the beginning of the year due to a combination
of good hydrological conditions and prudent management of water resources. The
reservoir is full, load shedding has been minimized, and we were able to deposit
significant amounts of electricity with our neighbors. By tightening our collection
procedures, and vigorously addressing the widespread theft of electricity, we
achieved a steady improvement in collections and losses up to June. Nonetheless,
the poor performance in January depressed our quarterly average performance and
we missed the first quarter targets on collections and losses under the 2006-08
Power Sector Action Plan (PC end-March 2006). However, we have steadily
improved our collection and loss performance since January, and are working to
find a long-term solution to the problems in this sector. In this regard, as a prior
action for completion of this review, we have concluded a contract with [the
World Bank] to provide technical assistance to (i) develop and finalize a new
energy sector strategy to promote increased private sector involvement, including
the privatization of electricity distribution, and (ii) provide on-going resources
through mid-2007 to assist with preparing for the privatization of electricity
distribution. We are, therefore, requesting a waiver for the non-observance of this
performance criteria.

•

In the statistical area, we met the requirements of the program, in that we prepared
advance GDP estimates for the first half of 2005 and published preliminary
national accounts for 2004 (both SB; end-March 2006). However, we are aware
that the quality of these estimates requires considerable improvement.

4.
Despite our success to date, much remains to be done. Maintaining the pace of
development as our income level rises will require more than a simple replication of past
policies, but will increasingly call for the adoption of the standards of institutional
quality, governance, and infrastructure of the more successful middle-income countries.
Improvement in these areas are needed to address longstanding deficiencies in our
business climate that continue to deny our economy the investment—particularly foreign
investment—necessary to boost productivity and export capacity. On the fiscal front,
despite improvements, weaknesses in revenue administration and public debt

6
management still create vulnerability to economic shocks. Moreover, a higher quality of
public expenditure is needed to better utilize scarce resources for economic development
and poverty reduction. Though relatively more advanced, additional reform and
modernization are also needed in the financial sector if it is to develop safely and
facilitate economic development to its full potential. In particular, prudential supervision
requires further strengthening in light of the rapid growth of credit. Regarding poverty,
our preliminary analysis of the 2005 LSMS data points to a significant reduction over the
last three years. The absolute poverty rate was reduced to 18½ percent in 2005 from
25½ percent in 2002; and the extreme poverty rate fell to 3½ percent in 2005 compared
with 4¾ percent in 2002. Advances are not uniform, however, and some indicators such
as enrollment ratios in education require considerable improvement.
IV. STRATEGY, OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
5.
Our strategy for the next three years will continue to concentrate on
maintaining macroeconomic stability, enhancing growth potential, reducing
vulnerabilities and strengthening government solvency. We recognize that success on
these fronts will require significant progress in adopting the governance and institutional
norms of the more advanced middle income countries.
•

A responsible and appropriate fiscal policy is central to maintaining
macroeconomic stability. The medium-term path for further fiscal consolidation
envisaged at the conception of our program—centered on a steady reduction of
domestic borrowing and improvement in the current and primary balances—
remains unchanged.

•

However, in the immediate term, maintaining macroeconomic stability requires
greater focus on the growth rate of private sector credit. Following the advise of
an IMF technical assistance mission in May, we have significantly strengthened
prudential regulations. We expect this to improve the quality of our loan portfolio,
and possibly to have the incidental effect of lowering the rate of credit expansion
at the margin. For 2006, in combination with a modest fiscal adjustment, we view
a limitation of the annual increase of credit to 6 percentage points of GDP as
consistent with easing the rise of nontraded goods prices, arresting the
deterioration of the current account, and avoiding unnecessary real appreciation
that could hinder export development.

•

Over a longer time horizon, our program addresses deficiencies in our business
climate through a wide range of institutional reforms, with the aim of creating
conditions capable of attracting enough foreign and domestic investment to effect
a rapid increase of our productive capacity. Concurrent with this, it addresses
existing vulnerabilities through a comprehensive reform of our budget process,
financial sector, and debt management capacity. We are also pursuing institutional

7
change outside the program in areas impacting the investment climate, including
measures to improve the commercial court system and the process of land title
registration.
6.
We also intend to significantly downsize government involvement in non-core
areas, primarily by stepping up the pace of privatization. We are increasingly aware
that our electricity sector is in a permanent state of crisis, and that our strategy for
rehabilitation and improvement is not working. We have started, with the support of the
World Bank, to develop a new energy sector strategy to promote private sector
involvement including the privatization of electricity distribution. After discussing it with
donors, we will finalize this strategy by end-2006. . A major initiative in this regard,
which is already underway, is to unbundle KESH and to privatize the distribution of
electricity within two years. We are also moving to quickly privatize the other large
entities remaining in government hands. An international tender for the sale of INSIG has
been issued. The sale of Albtelecom has been delayed as we investigate alleged
irregularities in the previous tender process. However, once the investigation is
concluded, we will move ahead quickly with the privatization process. Tenders for
Albpetrol and ARMO will also be prepared. Our plan is to sell these latter two companies
in their existing condition without first attempting rehabilitation, as we believe this is a
task best left to their future owners.
A. Macroeconomic Framework
7.
The macroeconomic framework envisaged at program conception remains
valid and realistic. Real GDP growth is projected to return to its trend rate of 6 percent
in 2007 as the electricity situation improves, and productive investment begins to rise in
response to improved governance and institutional quality. With demand pressure
contained through an appropriate monetary policy stance—aided by reductions in the rate
of credit growth through other means and supported by a flexible exchange rate regime—
we expect to hold inflation within the target range, while ongoing fiscal consolidation
will allow a steady improvement in government solvency. Public savings will increase
over the program period as we improve our revenue administration and reduce the share
of current expenditure in total spending—including through lower interest costs resulting
from better debt management. We also anticipate a rise in private—mainly corporate—
savings in response to ongoing structural reform and rapidly rising income levels. With
public and private investment also rising, but at a lower pace, the current account will
gradually improve and the growth contribution of net exports will rise. In recognition of
our continued fiscal vulnerability, we will continue to protect this framework from
unforeseen shocks through the use of budgetary contingencies; and also through the use
of conservative estimates of absorptive capacity, tax revenue and privatization receipts,
and by a policy of not expending the gains from tax administration reforms before their
realization.

8
B. Monetary, Exchange Rate, and Financial Sector Policies
8.
We will continue to direct monetary policy toward maintaining price
stability. The current monetary policy framework—a reserve money program with
quantitative targets set in consultation with the Fund and with changes to the repurchase
rate as the main policy instrument—has proved effective in the past. It will be retained
along with the flexible exchange rate regime. However, while the interest rate channel
was previously sufficient to influence the exchange rate and thereby affect the lek price
of traded goods, we now face a new situation where price pressures are largely demand
driven and arise from the rapid growth of credit. We will maintain market-based
monetary policy instruments so long as they remain effective in controlling inflation.
However, considering the limited effect of policy rate changes on credit demand, the
temporary use of direct instruments for preserving price stability may be also considered
as a last resort.
9.
In order to slow credit growth, and prevent a deterioration in loan quality,
we will initially strengthen prudential regulations. Our intention is to implement—
after a full discussion with commercial banks—the following measures and regulatory
changes over the course of 2006-2007. The measures are aimed at bringing prudential
regulations in line with international best practice and strengthening their
implementation.
•

We will raise reserve requirements on foreign currency deposits above 10 percent
after evaluating carefully all its implications on the banking sector.

•

Regulations on capital adequacy will be amended to allow risk weights up to
150 percent to apply to high risk loans or portions of loans;

•

Regulations will be amended to allow for higher provisioning on classified loans;

•

Provisions in existing regulations will be employed to impose higher than
12 percent minimum capital adequacy requirements on individual, relatively highrisk, banks;

•

BoA will encourage banks to adopt—and impose on banks if necessary—stricter
debt service to disposable income ratios and prudent loan-to-value ratios; tighter
internal loan classification and provisioning rules; and increased risk premiums in
lending spreads to take full account of indirect credit risk from foreign exchange
exposure of customers;

•

In addition, BoA will devote sufficient resources to decrease the time lag for
reporting of monthly bank statistics from 40 to 30 days by end-September 2006;
improve coordination and communication with home country supervisors of
foreign-owned banks; and increase targeting of supervision activities—including

9
on-site inspections—towards credit-related risks. BoA will also introduce “truth
in lending” rules by mid-2007 to disclose annual percentage rates on loans and the
risks associated with foreign currency borrowing; and prepare and mandate by
end-2006 enhanced reporting rules for commercial banks to allow better
monitoring of banking sector developments.
If more strict enforcement and interpretation of prudential regulations do not in
themselves result in a deceleration of credit growth, we will consider additional fiscal or
monetary tightening.
10.
We will press ahead with financial sector reform with the aim of reducing
vulnerabilities and creating the financial infrastructure needed to support growth.
Reforms will be guided by our recently-completed action plan for implementing the
recommendations of the Financial Sector Stability Assessment (FSSA) report. Key
measures with respect to the BoA and the banking sector will include:
•

Submission of a new Banking Law to parliament (SB; end-March 2007). Among
other provisions, this law will strengthen legal protection for banking supervisors,
and grant BoA the specific legal authority needed to improve and broaden its
supervision of commercial banks. This will include the authority to: address
banking activities carried out by unlicensed agents; make binding qualitative
judgments on investments of banks; apply capital requirements and supervise
banking groups on a consolidated basis; group together related DMB exposure for
enforcement of prudential regulations; and deem a relationship to be connected
for the purpose of prudential limits. In addition, the draft law will introduce a
formal system of monitoring cross border activity and sharing information with
foreign regulators; and mandate bank collection of information needed for
supervisory purposes;

•

Additional legislation submitted to parliament to improve the efficiency and
timeliness of the execution of collateral (SB; end-December 2006);

•

Establishing a credit bureau within BoA (SB; end-June 2007);

•

Develop rapid response capability in BoA and Deposit Insurance Agency by endSeptember 2006;

•

Continue developing our analytical and forecasting capacity in preparation for an
eventual move to formal inflation targeting.

11.
We will move forcefully ahead with measures to strengthen prudential
supervision of the nonbank financial sector. With World Bank assistance, we expect to
unify all nonbank supervisory functions—insurance, pension fund and securities—within
a single agency. We will ensure that the resulting new agency is fully independent—

10
including with respect to its staff compensation levels—possessed of an appropriate legal
framework, and sufficiently funded to enable it to attract and retain a fully qualified staff.
In the insurance sector, we have secured technical assistance to strengthen prudential
supervision in the short term. We intend to also request technical assistance to modernize
the legal framework for the new private pension industry. In recognition of our
international obligations, we will also strengthen our AML/CFT framework, both by
bringing the AML Law into full compliance with the FATF Recommendations 2003; and
by strengthening the Financial Intelligence Unit.
12.
We attach considerable importance to improving the financial system
infrastructure. The expansion of credit is moving the banking system from a condition
of near universal excess liquidity to a more differentiated system. Under these conditions,
development of liquid government securities and interbank money and REPO markets
would create additional efficiencies and improve both the monetary transmission
mechanism and public debt management capacity.
•

Experience so far with payments system improvements has been highly positive.
Both the Real Time Gross Settlements System (AIPS) and Bulk Settlement
System (AECH) are functioning well. These systems have advanced the use of the
banking system in economic transactions while enhancing efficiency and security.
Over the coming year, we intend to improve their functioning further by
monitoring system utilization and collecting and reacting to customer feedback.

•

The natural complement of these two systems—a delivery-versus-payment
system—will be developed in 2006 to spur the development of the government
securities market. The system will be designed so that it can also promote the use
and development of the interbank money market by allowing the automated
securitization of interbank lending with government securities. To encourage
organic growth of the interbank market, the BoA will refrain from transactions
with individual banks when there is sufficient aggregate liquidity in the system.

13.
We will maintain the treasury bill window at BoA until alternate means of
ensuring nonbank access to government securities are in place. We have insisted on
the use of bank transfers rather than cash for all purchases of securities at the window;
and will only redeem securities in cash if they were purchased or rolled over prior to
August 2006. With the maximum maturity being 360 days, we will therefore have
effectively eliminated the use of cash at the window by August 2007. We will accelerate
preparations to divest government’s minority interest in the remaining commercial bank;
and will refrain from creating any public financial institution or from taking an equity
stake or issuing any explicit or implicit government guarantee to any financial institution.
We will take no legislative or regulatory action that weakens the independence of the
BoA, including the full control over the Bank’s budget—including staff compensation
levels—currently exercised by the BoA’s Supervisory Board.

11
C. Fiscal policy
14.
As we enter the middle-income group of countries, it will be important to
follow our existing fiscal strategy of keeping government small while increasing its
efficiency. Reforms that strengthen our fiscal management will not only improve
efficiency, but will also reduce vulnerabilities and reinforce actions taken in other areas
to improve the business climate and make Albania a more attractive destination for
needed investment. Reducing corruption within fiscal institutions and lowering the cost
of compliance will be critical components of this strategy. Our efforts will therefore
concentrate on reforming the revenue administrations, improving debt management
capacity, and raising the quality and efficiency of expenditure.
15.
The 2006 budget and medium term fiscal framework have been designed to
strike a balance between debt reduction and the need for growth enhancing and
poverty reducing expenditure. Over the program period, we expect a further
2 percentage point decline in public debt relative to GDP, and a fall in recourse to
domestic financing from 2.7 percent of GDP in 2005 to 2.4 percent in 2008. Total
expenditure relative to GDP is programmed to be contained at 30 percent of GDP. Within
this envelope, capital spending will increase by 2¼ percentage points of GDP, reflecting
our determination to direct expenditure towards more productive uses and to alleviate
poverty. We therefore project an improvement in the current balance relative to GDP of
about 2 percentage points. These projections are conservative, however, and make no
allowance for revenue gains from tax administration measures that the outcome in the
first half of 2006 indicate will likely be achieved. Our experience so far with the
enhanced use of contingencies in our 2006 budget has been that they are an effective
means of mitigating budgetary vulnerabilities. In combination with conservative revenue
projections, we intend that they will form an integral characteristic of future budgets.
16.
With the gains from revenue administration expected to be permanent, and
with unbudgeted privatization receipts from the sale of Italian Albanian Bank, we
will table a supplementary budget in July. This budget will allocate 0.6-0.8 percent of
GDP of additional revenue gains from tax administration and 0.1 percent of GDP of
privatization proceeds for infrastructure projects, primarily road construction. The
remaining tax administration gains will be used to lower the employers’ share of social
security tax from 29 percent of wages to 20 percent (0.2-0.4 percentage points of GDP).
We will allocate 0.1 percent of GDP of privatization receipts toward further deficit
reduction. In addition, we will allocate 0.2 percent of GDP in contingencies solely to
deficit reduction, provided that and to the extent that domestic revenues materialize as
budgeted. Our revenue projections, however, are conservative and we feel confident that
we will meet our targets. For large privatization receipts, we maintain the same formula
developed during the previous program—half the revenues will be used to reduce
domestic debt, and half will be spent on well-designed infrastructure projects.

12
17.
The supplementary budget is consistent with our newly-developed
expenditure and tax strategies. As we expect our tax administration gains to be
permanent and to grow over time, a strategy for their division between public investment,
tax relief, and debt reduction became necessary, both to increase the efficiency and
transparency of the process and to lessen the risk of these gains being allocated in an ad
hoc fashion. From 2007 on, in recognition of our still-high public debt burden, we will, in
consultation with the Fund, consider applying the formula for large privatizations of
allocating half of the proceeds to reduce domestic debt also to gains stemming from overperformance in revenue. The remainder will be split between public investment and tax
relief. Given their one-time nature, we will continue to divide privatization receipts
equally between debt reduction and public investment. In both cases, public investment
projects will be limited to those included in the NSSED. With respect to tax policy, our
strategy first aims to minimize tax-induced distortions and promote formalization of the
economy. Priority is therefore on further reducing the tax wedge on labor, mainly through
cuts in social security taxes, which remain the highest in the region. Next in priority is
securing lower rates on personal income tax and corporate profits tax. Adjustments to the
VAT would be our last priority, given its relative lack of distortion and its importance to
our total revenue collections—and would be undertaken only if it can be done without
undermining revenue performance. All tax rate adjustments will be fully costed and
designed in consultation with the Fund.
18.
Continued improvement of revenue administration is a key component of our
program. Revenue administration currently lacks prioritization and focuses too much on
small taxpayers and comprehensive audits with little revenue potential. An excessive
focus on short-term revenue targets also undermines more strategic objectives, such as
encouraging self-compliance. Voluntary compliance is also discouraged by limited
information on taxpayers’ responsibilities and a non-uniform and nontransparent
application of existing regulations. Progress on this front is not only essential to increase
yields and achieve greater equity and compliance through a widening of the tax net, but is
a key institutional reform needed to encourage new investment. Our strategy—based on
IMF technical assistance—aims to refocusing resources towards larger taxpayers and
reshape the revenue collection agencies into modern organizations relying on selfassessment and voluntary compliance. Key measures include:
•

Intensifying staff training, particularly in audit techniques, and achieving full
compliance with existing legislation and regulation regarding human resource
issues and procedures;

•

Merging small branches of the General Directorate of Taxation (GDT) and
establishing bigger and more efficient branches. We expect to prepare a feasibility
study for this transformation by end-October 2006 (SB);

13
•

Improving the LTO structure and instituting measures to strengthen large taxpayer
compliance control. Greater use will be made of risk-assessment software in the
selection of audits; while the design of audits will shift from a comprehensive to a
more narrow or single-issue focus;

•

Improving compliance by (i) more effective implementation of taxpayer
registration; (ii) introducing filing and payment obligations; (iii) expanding the
computerized information system to include all taxpayers and all types of taxes;
and (iv) making better use of information to manage the organization and identify
noncompliance; and

•

Extending the ASYCUDA computerization system to all remaining customs
offices and improving the effective use of the risk selection module. A report on
progress in the actual use of the risk module of the ASYCUDA system to perform
inspections will be issued on a quarterly basis (SB; ongoing).

In addition, the GDT office structure will be rationalized; the role of the tax police will be
reviewed; and better reporting capabilities and practices will be instituted. We will clear
all VAT arrears by the end of 2006. To further improve VAT administration, we will
prepare and provide quarterly reports to the Fund on the aggregate amounts of VAT
refunds requested, paid, and rejected (SB; ongoing). With funding from the US
Millennium Challenge Account, we began a new program of carrying out confidential
questionnaire-based surveys on corruption in the General Directorate of Customs and the
LTO in July 2006, and this initiative will be continued.
19.
Significant reform of debt management is needed to address vulnerabilities
resulting from a relatively high level of short-term domestic debt in a market with a
limited number of participants. Reforms will focus on implementing the
recommendation of the January 2006 IMF TA mission. Principle objectives include
achieving a significant increase in the maturity structure of public debt, improved terms,
significantly expanded capacity in analysis and risk management, better management of
data, and the ability, by the end of the program period, to independently produce debt
sustainability reports. Concrete measures will include:
•

Finalizing and publishing a debt management strategy defining the main goals of
debt management, the targets for the main characteristics of public debt, including
currency composition, average maturity and modified duration, and the main debt
instruments; and a time frame for implementing the debt management strategy
(PC; end-September 2006);

•

Enacting a new public debt law;

14
•

Establishing a new Debt Management Directorate at the same level of the existing
Treasury and Public Debt Directorate;

•

Developing cash forecasting capacity within the Treasury Department;

•

Gradually changing treasury bill issuance to better reflect government cash flow
patterns;

•

Taking steps to further develop the domestic governments security market, such
as opening up the treasury bond auctions to a wider market and relaxing the
payment requirements for corporate and institutional investors;

•

Providing a level playing field for nonresident investors, and modernizing custody
and depository systems;

•

Completing the ongoing treasury modernization project; and

•

Discontinuing the practice of mandatory closing out of the treasury single account
at the end of the fiscal year.

20.
There is large scope for increasing the efficiency of spending by improving
the budget process and financial management. The relative isolation of the annual
budget process and actual spending decisions from the Medium Term Expenditure
Framework (MTEF) and National Strategy for Socio-Economic Development (NSSED)
processes is a longstanding problem. Shortcomings also exist in the selection of public
investment projects and the monitoring of outcomes. Reforms will aim at identifying
measurable objectives in the context of the NSSED, ensuring they are clearly linked to
spending requests, strengthening the MTBP and better integrating both the MTBP and
NSSED with the budget process. In order to safeguard the use of nonconcessional project
loans, we will continue our policy of conducting independent feasibility studies for any
large project13 financed in this manner (SB;ongoing), and will continue to provide to the
Fund a biannual listing and status report of all projects being considered for
nonconcessional foreign financing (SB;ongoing).We will also strengthen the payment
discipline of budgetary units—particularly with respect to the payment of electricity and
water bills. Looking ahead, we intend to approve a new organic budget law aimed at
enhancing the efficiency of public expenditure management, including by improving
budget classification standards and by increasing parliamentary oversight and the
accountability of the public administration.

13

As defined in the TMU.

15
D. Other Structural Reform
21.
In addition to our plans to privatize electricity distribution (paragraph 6), we
intend to aggressively pursue measures to improve the availability and security of
supply and to strengthening the financial position of KESH.
•

We will continue to prudently manage the water resources available to our main
hydro-electric plant; and arrange sufficient volumes and stability of imported
supply to meet demand for electricity in Albania. In this connection, we have
secured sufficient imports of electricity from our neighbors for the third and
fourth quarter, which considerably diminishes the risks of disruptions in
electricity supply for the rest of the year. In the months ahead we will pursue our
efforts to secure additional electricity supply at the lowest possible cost. We have
finalized arrangements to construct an additional thermal power plant in Vlore
and will continue working with our international partners on programs to
strengthen the distribution lines coming from Macedonia and Kosovo.

•

We have replaced our two tier pricing structure—which involved cross
subsidization of households by business consumers—with a more simple scheme
designed to bring electricity prices closer to the international market level while
removing the cross-subsidies from business users to households. As a result, the
prices paid by business users has been significantly reduced. However, we have
appealed the special low tariff for high-voltage users that had been approved by
the regulator as it could result in a significant revenue loss for KESH. A necessary
aspect of our reform was to significantly raise the price for households
consumers. In order to limit the negative social impact this reform will have on
lower income households, we have been working with the World Bank to increase
the number of households eligible under our social transfer program and redefined
the benefit to reflect the new tariffs while keeping the consumption ceiling at its
former level.

22.
Given that domestic production has returned to normal, and we will need to
import less than previously anticipated, we expect the financial position of KESH to
improve. However, energy prices are high worldwide, and the risk of a further regional
price increase is now greater following the closure of a major power plant in Bulgaria.
Consequently, the risk of a supply disruption this winter—and an associated rise in
import prices—remains . Nonetheless, there will be no return to our previous policy of
extending import subsidies to KESH. Instead, should additional funding become
necessary, we will direct the company to seek loans from the private banking sector,
preferably without a government guarantee. We will, however, provide additional support
by ensuring that budgetary and non-budgetary public institutions honor their electricity
bills in a timely manner. We will also continue to work with the World Bank and other

16
donors to restructure the water supply companies and to adjust water tariffs to properly
reflect increased operating costs.
23.
We have designed a broad strategy for modernizing our transportation
network as part of our recently-adopted National Transportation Plan. Our strategy
concentrates on the development of roads and port facilities—we have identified the
Durrës-Kukes-Morine corridor as priority project to develop the northeastern region of
Albania, and as a link to neighboring countries. In carrying out this strategy, we will fully
respect the non-concessional financing limits agreed under the program.
E. External Policies
24.
We will retain our liberal trade regime. We have implemented all commitments
made to the WTO regarding tariff policies, and are close to concluding a Stabilization
and Association Agreement and a free trade agreement with the EU. The technical
negotiations with the EU in relation to the free trade agreement are at an advanced stage.
On a regional level, we have concluded free trade agreements with regional neighbors,
which has significantly boosted our exchange with them, albeit from a low base.
25.
We will continue to make good faith efforts to conclude the rescheduling of
our arrears on inoperative payments agreements. We are engaged in negotiations that
aim at concluding the clearance process with official creditors by mid-2007; and with
private creditors by end-2007. We will provide semi-annual reports to the Fund on the
outstanding stock of external arrears (SB; ongoing) within one month of the end of each
quarter.
F. Data Issues
26.
We will expand the coverage and improve the quality of economic statistics
over the program period. We recognize the shortcomings of the recently published
national accounts based on the labor input methodology. We will complete the revisions
of the national accounts for 1997-2004 and prepare the preliminary national accounts
for 2005 (both SB; end-November 2006). We will prepare provisional quarterly GDP
estimates up to the first quarter of 2006. We are in broad agreement with the conclusions
of the recent ROSC mission, and will adopt a plan to meet the SDDS goals by endSeptember 2006. We are convinced that in order to bring a durable improvement in
national accounts, we need to improve basic data on consumption and employment. To
that effect, we are preparing a household budget survey to be conducted in October 2006;
and will conduct a labor force survey to be conduced by March 2007. We will publish the
results of the Living Standards Measurement Survey (LSMS) before the end of 2006,
which will improve our assessment of poverty. We are aware that the assessment of the
balance of payments is complicated by measurement issues concerning private transfers
and the prevalence of the informal economy. The BoA is working to improve its

17
methodology in consultation with IMF staff. In this connection, we will prepare revised
estimates of private transfers in the balance of payments by end-December 2006 (SB).
G. Program Monitoring
27.
The third disbursement under the PRGF/EFF-supported program will be based on
the end-September 2006 quantitative performance criteria (Table 1 and the TMU); the
end-September 2006 structural performance criteria (Table 2 and the TMU); and
completion of the second review and financing assurances review. The second review
under the PRGF and EFF arrangements is expected to be completed no later than
February 1, 2007; and the third review no later than August 1, 2007. During the program
period, Albania will not impose or intensify restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions; or introduce multiple currency practices,
or conclude bilateral payments agreements inconsistent with Article VIII, or impose or
intensify import restrictions for balance of payments reasons. While taking into account
the recommendations of the joint staff assessment of the 2005 progress report, we will
prepare a new NSSED for the 2007-09 period by end-2006.

ALBANIA—TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
This memorandum defines the quantitative benchmarks and performance criteria established
in the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) up until end-March 2007;
and associated reporting requirements.
H. Net Domestic Credit to the Government
28.
For the purposes of the program, the government covers the State Budget, the Social
Security Institute (SSI), and the Health Insurance Institute (HII).
29.
Net domestic credit to the government (NCG) is defined as gross domestic credit in
lek and in foreign currency extended to the government (as defined above) by the banking
system, savings and loan institutions (SLIs), and other domestic lenders;14 less the sum of
government financial assets held in the banking system and in the SLIs.
30.

The following definitions apply to gross domestic credit to the government:
(i)

Gross domestic credit in lek and in foreign currency extended to the
government includes: (a) securities (including treasury bills and bonds) issued
by the government and held by the Bank of Albania (BoA), deposit money
banks (DMBs), SLIs, and other domestic lenders; (b) loans and advances
extended to the government by BoA, DMBs, SLIs, and other domestic
lenders; (c) negative balances in government deposits with BoA, DMBs and
SLIs; (d) any securities or debt instrument of any kind issued by government
(as defined above) to the Bank of Albania to compensate the Bank of Albania
for its net valuation losses on its assets and liabilities in, or denominated in,
gold, special drawing rights or foreign currencies, and which the Bank of
Albania keeps in its (off-balance sheet) Valuation Reserve Securities Account
of the Bank of Albania, as required in Article 64 of the Law on the Bank of
Albania (No. 8269, dated December 12, 1997)15; and (e) any other form of
financial obligation of the government the issuance of which resulted in
borrowing funds by the government or a payment for an existing payment
obligation of the government.

(ii)

Gross domestic credit in lek and in foreign currency extended to the
government excludes (a) the onlending of foreign project loans to all parts of
government; and (b) advances on profit transfers by the BoA. The value of the
stock of gross domestic credit to government will also exclude the claims held

14

Other domestic lenders comprise firms, nonbank institutions, and households, or any other resident legal or
natural person, or institution.

15

This was equivalent to Lek 11.5 billion at end-December 2005.

21
by the units of government as defined above (in particular, the SSI and the
HII).
(iii)

The stock of gross domestic credit extended to the government and held by
the BoA and DMBs in the form of treasury bills will be valued at issue price.
The stock of gross domestic credit extended to the government and held by
the BoA in the form of other securities and direct loans to government will be
valued excluding accrued interest. The stock of gross domestic credit
extended to the government and held by the DMBs in the form of variable and
fixed income securities (excluding treasury bills) will be valued at face value.
The stock of all gross domestic credit extended to the government and held by
SLIs and other domestic lenders will be valued at face value16.

(iv)

For the purposes of program monitoring, gross domestic credit to the
government in foreign currency will be converted from Lek to SDRs at the
end-of period Lek/SDR exchange rate prevailing on the test date; and then
converted to Lek at the program Lek/SDR exchange rate of Lek 147.8/SDR.

31.
The following definitions apply to government financial assets held in the
banking system and in the SLIs:
(i)

Government financial assets held at the Bank of Albania include: (a)
transferable deposits in domestic and foreign currency; (b) lek deposits held in
BoA for projects; and (c) standard gold deposits of the government. For the
purposes of program monitoring, standard gold deposits will be valued at the
program price of gold (SDR 358.9 per ounce)17.

(ii)

Government financial assets held at the Bank of Albania exclude: (a) foreign
currency deposits related to foreign financed projects; and (b) deposits serving
as the counterpart for non-standard gold and other precious metals owned by
the government.

(iii)

Government financial assets held at the DMBs include: (a) all deposits of
government in domestic and foreign currency; and (b) payable amounts owed
by the DMB to government.

16

Under current reporting standards, the following data is only available at face value: (i) the stock of gross
domestic credit extended to the government and held by the DMBs in the form of fixed and variable income
securities; and (ii) the stock of all gross domestic credit extended to the government and held by the SLIs and
other domestic lenders.

17

The lek value of standard gold deposits will be (a) converted to US dollars using the current end-of-period
lek/US dollar exchange rate; (b) then converted to ounces of gold using the current US dollar market price of
gold; (c) then converted to SDRs at the program price of gold (SDR 358.9 per ounce); and (d) then converted to
Lek at the program Lek/SDR exchange rate of Lek 147.8/SDR.

22

(iv)

Government financial assets held at the SLIs include all deposits of
government held at the SLIs.

32.
For the purposes of program monitoring, government financial assets in foreign
currency will be converted from Lek to SDRs at the end-of period Lek/SDR exchange rate
prevailing on the test date; and then converted to Lek at the program Lek/SDR exchange rate
of Lek 147.8/SDR.
33.
Under these definitions, the stock of net domestic credit to the government was Lek
317.8 billion at end-December 2005. The breakdown of the categories of net domestic credit
to the government as defined above is given in Attachment Table 1.
34.
The limits on the change in net domestic credit to the government will be cumulative
within each calendar year.
I. Net Domestic Assets
35.
The stock of net domestic assets (NDA) of the Bank of Albania is defined as
reserve money—defined as the sum of currency issue (less lek notes and coins held by the
Bank of Albania) and commercial bank reserves held at the BoA—less the net international
reserves of the Bank of Albania (Section C). For program monitoring purposes, all foreign
currency assets and liabilities making up NIR will be valued in local currency at the
exchange rates of end-December 2005. Under this definition, the level of NDA was Lek 77.1
billion as of end-December 2005. The NDA limits will be cumulative changes from endDecember 2005 and will be monitored from the accounts of the Bank of Albania.
J. Net International Reserves
36.
Net international reserves (NIR) are defined as reserve assets minus reserve
liabilities of the Bank of Albania. Reserve assets are readily available claims of the Bank of
Albania on nonresidents denominated in foreign convertible currencies, and held for the
purpose of meeting balance of payments financing needs, intervention in exchange markets,
and other purposes. They include Bank of Albania holdings of monetary gold, SDRs,
Albania’s reserve position in the IMF, foreign currency cash, securities, and deposits abroad.
Excluded from reserve assets are any assets that are pledged, collateralized, or otherwise
encumbered; claims on residents; precious metals other than monetary gold; assets in
nonconvertible currencies; illiquid assets; and claims on foreign exchange arising from
derivatives in foreign currencies vis-à-vis domestic currency (such as futures, forwards,
swaps, and options). Reserve liabilities shall be defined as foreign exchange liabilities to
residents and nonresidents of the Bank of Albania, irrespective of their maturity. They
include: foreign currency reserves of commercial banks held at the Bank of Albania; all
credit outstanding from the IMF; commitments to sell foreign exchange arising from
derivatives (such as futures, forwards, swaps, and options); and all arrears on principal or

23
interest payments to commercial banks, suppliers, or official export credit agencies. Excluded
from reserve liabilities are the government’s foreign currency deposits at the Bank of
Albania.18 Reserve assets and reserve liabilities will both be expressed in U.S. dollars. The
NIR limits will be cumulative changes from end-December 2005, and will be monitored from
data supplied by the Bank of Albania.
37.
During this program, for monitoring purposes, the exchange rates of the SDR and
non-dollar currencies will be kept at their end-December 2005 levels and holdings of
monetary gold will be valued at SDR 358.9 per ounce. Excluded from net international
reserves are holdings of nonconvertible currencies, claims on nonresident financial
institutions denominated in nonconvertible currencies, and other claims which are not readily
available. Under this definition, the level of NIR was US$1,171.7 million at end-December
2005.
K. Adjusters for NCG, NDA, and NIR
38.
The NCG and NDA ceilings and the NIR floor are defined on the assumption that
total privatization proceeds will amount, on a cumulative basis, from January 1, 2006, to:
End-September 2006
End-December 2006
End-March 2007

Lek 5,500 mn (Of which: US$45.4 mn. in foreign currency).
Lek 5,500 mn. (Of which: US$45.4 mn. in foreign currency).
Lek 6,000 mn. (Of which: US$45.4 mn. in foreign currency);

The NIR floor will be adjusted upward (downward) and the NDA ceiling adjusted downward
(upward) by half of any excess (shortfall) in the receipt of privatization proceeds in foreign
currency from these assumed values. The NCG ceiling for end-September 2006 and endDecember 2006 will be adjusted downward (upward) by half the amount of any excess
(shortfall) in the receipt of total privatization proceeds from these assumed values. The NCG
ceiling for end-March 2007 will be adjusted downward (upward) by half the amount by
which the receipt of total privatization revenue in the first quarter of 2007 exceeds (falls short
of) Lek 500 million.
39.
The NCG ceiling will be adjusted upward (downward) by the increase (decrease) in
debt instruments of any kind (valued at issue price if possible) that the government (as
defined above) transfers to the Bank of Albania to compensate the Bank of Albania for its net
valuation losses on its assets and liabilities in, or denominated in, gold, special drawing rights
or foreign currencies, and which the Bank of Albania keeps in its (off-balance sheet)

18

This exclusion is justified by current procedures in Albania, whereby the government's foreign currency
receipts are deposited in a blocked account at the Bank of Albania and the funds are transferred to the
government’s lek account before being spent. A change in this procedure, would require revisiting the NIR
definition.

24
Valuation Reserve Securities Account of the Bank of Albania, as required in Article 64 of the
Law on the Bank of Albania (No. 8269, dated December 12, 1997).
40.
The ceilings on NCG and NDA, and the floor on NIR are defined based on the
assumption that foreign budgetary and/or balance of payments loan financing (excluding
IMF financing, project and commodity loans, and macro-financial assistance from the EU)
will amount, on a cumulative basis, from January 1, 2006, to:
End-September 2006
End-December 2006
End-March 2007

US$5.8 mn.
US$5.8 mn.
US$8.3 mn.

The ceilings on NDA of the Bank of Albania will be adjusted downward, and the floor on
NIR will be adjusted upward by the amount total foreign loan financing exceeds these
projections. The NCG ceiling for end-September 2006 and end-December 2006 will be
adjusted downward by the amount total foreign loan financing exceeds these projections. The
NCG ceiling for end-March 2007 will be adjusted downward by the amount total foreign
loan financing in the first quarter of 2007 exceeds US$2.5 million.19
41.
The NDA ceilings will be also adjusted to reflect the impact of any change in the
required reserve ratio of commercial banks with the Bank of Albania.
L. External Debt and Arrears
42.
As set forth in point No. 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to
Foreign Debt (Decision No. 12274–00/85) August 24, 2000), the term “debt” will be
understood to mean a current, i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual
arrangement through the provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or
services, and which requires the obligor to make one or more payments in the form of assets
(including currency) or services, at some future point(s) in time; these payments will
discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the contract. Debts can take a
number of forms, the primary ones being as follows: (i) loans, i.e., advances of money to
obligor by the lender made on the basis of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the
funds in the future (including deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans and buyers’
credits) and temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans
under which the obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by
repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase agreements and
official swap arrangements); (ii) suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits
the obligor to defer payments until some time after the date on which the goods are delivered
19

For the NCG adjuster, the lek equivalent of deviations from the programmed amounts in terms of dollars is
converted at an exchange rate of Lek 103.4 per U.S. dollar.

25
or services are provided; and (iii) leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided
which the lessee has the right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are
usually shorter than the total expected service life of the property, while the lessor retains the
title to the property. For the purpose of the guideline, the debt is the present value (at the
inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the period of the
agreement excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair or maintenance of the
property. Arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make
payment under a contractual obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make
payment on an obligation that is not considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on
delivery) will not give rise to debt.
43.
The limit on medium- and long-term external debt applies to the contracting or
guaranteeing by the government or the Bank of Albania, of new nonconcessional external
debt with an original maturity of more than one year. It applies not only to debt as defined in
paragraph 15 of this memorandum, but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for
which value has not been received. External debt will be considered to have been contracted
at the point the loan agreement or guarantee is ratified by the Albanian parliament. Excluded
from the limits are refinancing credits and rescheduling operations (including the deferral of
interest on commercial debt), credits extended by the IMF, and credits on concessional terms
defined as those with a grant element of at least 35 percent. The grant element is to be
calculated using the OECD Commercial Interest Reference Rates (CIRRs): for maturities of
less than 15 years, the grant element will be calculated based on six-month averages of
CIRRs; and for maturities longer than 15 years, the grant element will be calculated based on
ten-year averages. Debt falling within the limit shall be valued in euros at the exchange rate
prevailing at the time the contract or guarantee becomes effective.
44.
The limit on short-term external debt applies on a continuous basis to the stock of
short-term external debt owed or guaranteed by the government or the Bank of Albania, with
an original maturity of up to and including one year. It applies to debt as defined in
paragraph 15 of this memorandum. Excluded from the limit are rescheduling operations
(including the deferral of interest on commercial debt) and normal import-related credits.
Debt falling within the limit shall be valued in Euros at the exchange rate prevailing at the
time the contract or guarantee becomes effective.
45.
A continuous performance criterion applies on the accumulation of new external
payments arrears on external debt contracted or guaranteed by the government or the Bank of
Albania. External payment arrears consist of external debt service obligations (principal and
interest) falling due after March 31, 2006 and that have not been paid at the time they are
due, taking into account the grace periods specified in the contractual agreements. Excluded
from the prohibition on the accumulation of new arrears are: (i) arrears arising from interest
on the stock of arrears outstanding as of March 31, 2006; and (ii) external arrears that are
subject to debt rescheduling agreements or negotiations.

26
46.
Large projects (as referred to in MEFP paragraph 20 and MEFP Table 2) financed
by nonconcessional foreign borrowing are defined as those projects involving total
nonconcessional foreign borrowing in excess of Euro 20 million.
47.
The budget commitments related to the contingencies embodied in the 2006
budget will be released after the following conditions are satisfied:
(i) At end-June 2006, actual revenue collection, defined as all revenues collected by
the GDT, GDC and SII (including all revenues collected on behalf of local
governments but excluding revenues collected by local governments directly) is in
line with the indicative total tax revenue target specified under the program;
(ii) The decision to release the budget commitments related to the contingencies is
taken in consultation with the Fund.
M. Tax Revenues
48.
Collection of total tax revenue by the Tax and Customs Departments and social
insurance contributions will be monitored on the basis of quarterly indicative floors. These
indicative floors will include all revenues collected by the GDT, GDC, and SSI (including
revenues collected on behalf of local governments), but exclude revenues collected by local
governments directly.
49.
For the purpose of reporting the share of taxes collected by the Large Taxpayer Office
(LTO), the following definition will apply. The share of taxes collected by the LTO will be
calculated as the ratio of all taxes collected by the LTO to the total collection of all taxes
administered by the GDT (VAT, excises, corporate income taxes, personal income taxes,
social security contributions, national taxes, taxes on packages, and gambling taxes). In
calculating this ratio, social security contributions paid by budgetary institutions will be
excluded from the denominator.
N. Monitoring and Reporting Requirements
50.
Performance under the program will be monitored from information supplied to the
Fund by the Bank of Albania, the Ministry of Finance, the General Directorate of Taxation
(GTD), the General Directorate of Customs (GDC), the Ministry of Economy and INSTAT.

ALBANIA
Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation, First Review Under the
Three-Year Arrangement Under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility,
Review Under Extended Arrangement, Request for Waiver of Nonobservance of
Performance Criterion, and Financing Assurances Review
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the European Department
Approved by Ajai Chopra and Scott Brown
July 19, 2006
1.
This statement reviews developments in Albania since the preparation of the
staff report. The additional information does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
In accordance with the understandings described in the staff report, the
authorities have prepared a supplementary budget for 2006. Because of the strong
revenue performance in the first half of 2006, budgeted total revenue has been increased by
0.9 percent of GDP and—contingent on this target being met—domestic financing will be
reduced by 0.3 percent of GDP. Additional expenditure is allocated almost entirely to
infrastructure investment.
3.
Despite a slowdown in headline inflation, underlying pressures have continued to
build. Headline CPI inflation fell to 2.4 percent (year-on-year) in June mainly due to a base
effect as the quarter-on-quarter rate of inflation picked up. Increases in food prices, however,
were stronger than previously expected. The recent electricity tariff increases, while on
average moderate, will result in a large hike in retail tariffs and a sizable decline in business
tariffs due to the elimination of cross-subsidies. The increase in retail tariffs (by about 40
percent) will likely push headline inflation temporarily outside the BoA’s 3±1 percent target
range in Q3 2006.
4.
Owing to these underlying pressures and to prevent possible second-round
effects from the electricity tariff hike, the BoA raised policy rates by 25 basis points on
July 12, 2006. This increase, the first since April 2002, brings the policy rate to 5¼ percent.
If the second-round effects are minimal, headline inflation is expected to return to the middle
of the BoA’s 3±1 percent target range by late 2007.
5.
The prior action for the completion of the First Review and the end-June
structural benchmarks have been implemented (updated Table 4). The authorities have
made the necessary arrangements with USAID and the World Bank to assist them with
finalizing their new energy sector strategy and preparing for the privatization of electricity

2
distribution. The remaining four end-June SBs, relating to public expenditure and debt
management, were all met on schedule.
6.
Proper accounting for the recapitalization of the BoA will lead to a small
upward adjustment in measured public debt. As discussed in the Staff Report
(footnote 8), the government issued securities to the BoA in 2005 to compensate for its
foreign exchange valuation losses. These securities have so far been treated and reported as a
guarantee in the official statistics on public debt. In addition to the implications for net credit
to government discussed in the staff report, our preliminary estimate is that accounting for
this item as public debt rather than as a guarantee will result in an increase in public debt
from 55.3 to 56.7 percent of GDP in 2005. Projections for 2006–10 will change accordingly.

A safeguards assessment for the Bank of Albania, completed on July 14, 2006,
found weaknesses in the central bank’s safeguards framework. The main vulnerabilities
identified by the assessment concern the quality of the external audit, poor oversight of the
external and internal audit functions and the system of internal controls, and certain
weaknesses in the controls over the Fund data reporting process. The assessment
recommended measures to alleviate these weaknesses and staff will monitor their
implementation.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 26, 2006

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with Albania
On July 24, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Albania.20
Background
Macroeconomic performance since the turn of this decade has generally been strong. Growth
has been rapid and Albania is now emerging from the low-income country group. Together with
large remittances, the rapid growth has significantly reduced poverty. The absolute poverty rate
declined from 25½ percent in 2002 to 18½ percent in 2005 and the extreme poverty rate from
4¾ to 3½ percent. Macroeconomic stability has been maintained—evidenced by low inflation,
increasing confidence in the currency and the banking system, and rising international reserves.
Fiscal policy has contained net domestic borrowing and lowered public debt from 67½ percent
of GDP in 2001 to 55¼ percent in 2005. More recently, reforms in revenue administration have
boosted revenues—which have been allocated in the 2006 supplementary budget between
investment spending, tax relief, and continued debt reduction. The absence of fiscal dominance
has supported the Bank of Albania’s (BoA) monetary policy framework—a reserve money
program with the repo rate as the main policy instrument, combined with a floating exchange
rate regime.
However, progress with structural reform has been uneven and the business environment
remains relatively uninviting. Despite advances, weak public institutions remain a source of
vulnerability, particularly in the fiscal and financial areas. Together with infrastructure
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.
20

2
deficiencies—particularly in the electricity sector—these factors hinder growth and promote
corruption and informal activities. While there is no indication of a significant exchange rate
misalignment, the resulting lack of non-price competitiveness continues to hinder investment
and exports.
Past accomplishments notwithstanding, recent macroeconomic developments pose new
challenges:
Credit growth has accelerated markedly. The stock of private sector credit increased from 9
percent of GDP at end-2004 to 17 percent of GDP by April 2006, creating a sizable
demand impulse. So far, however, the resulting rise in nontradables prices has been
offset by declining traded goods prices, with the result that headline inflation is still low
and relatively stable.
The current account deficit increased to an estimated 7¾ percent of GDP in 2005, up from 5½
percent in 2004, as a result of weakening demand in key trading partners and intensified
competition in textiles (Albania’s main product market). This, together with strong import
demand—partly fueled by the credit expansion—and higher oil import costs, caused the
trade deficit to widen in 2005, a trend that appears to have continued in the first quarter
of 2006.
Growth has slowed. The electricity crisis in October–November 2005 hit the economy hard and
economic activity in the construction sector has weakened. Together with a slowdown in
exports, these factors led to a slowing of growth from about 6 percent in 2004 to 5½
percent in 2005. The economy weakened further in the first quarter of 2006, reflecting the
emerging capacity constraints in non-tradable sectors and the closing of a large
metallurgy plant.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the authorities for Albania’s good macroeconomic performance in recent
years. Strong, noninflationary growth, combined with large and sustained remittance inflows,
have raised incomes significantly and lowered poverty. Directors considered that sound
macroeconomic policies—including the maintenance of a flexible exchange rate regime—and a
more competitive banking system had contributed to this success. In the period ahead,
Directors emphasized the need for far-reaching structural reforms to enhance the business
climate, secure long-term economic growth, and achieve the Millennium Development Goals.
Directors supported the authorities’ fiscal strategy, which aims at maintaining a small
government and the privatization of non-core activities. This approach is expected to improve
efficiency, conserve scarce resources, and serve more effectively Albania’s development
needs. However, to be successful, it will require strengthened medium-term budgeting and
better integration of the annual budget into the medium-term expenditure framework and the
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper.
Directors commended the authorities for their success in strengthening tax administration, and
supported the planned disposition of the resulting revenue gains. However, if the revenue gains

3
continue to exceed expectations, they recommended a more aggressive debt-reduction path
than currently envisaged. Directors agreed that any future tax relief should focus first on
reducing rates on taxes that most distort the labor market, but stressed that tax relief should be
introduced at a measured pace, and only after making certain that other revenue increases that
replace the taxes forgone are permanent.
Directors considered that the 2006 supplementary budget is fully consistent with the new fiscal
strategy, and properly balances the need for infrastructure investment, tax relief, and debt
reduction. The reduced call on domestic borrowing in 2006 will help reduce aggregate demand
and provide appropriate support to monetary policy.
Directors commended the BoA for its prudent monetary policy implementation. They welcomed
the recent increase in policy interest rates, which should help alleviate underlying price
pressures and prevent possible second-round effects of the increase in the electricity tariff.
Directors observed that the floating exchange rate regime has served Albania well, and
recommended that it be maintained in order to help the economy withstand external shocks.
Directors viewed the recent growth of financial intermediation and increased dynamism of the
financial sector as beneficial and necessary for continued rapid economic growth, but noted the
attendant risks to macroeconomic and financial stability. In this regard, they commended the
authorities for initiating early and proactive measures to strengthen banking and prudential
supervision, and urged them to stand ready to take additional measures as warranted.
They recommended that nonbank supervision be strengthened as well. Directors supported the
planned creation of a unified supervisory agency for the nonbank financial sector, which should
be independent, sufficiently funded, and properly staffed.
Directors supported the authorities’ structural reform program, which will help to strengthen
institutional quality and infrastructure and underpin growth at higher income levels.
Better governance, the enforcement of property rights, and efforts to root out corruption will help
to attract the high-quality private investment that is needed to further develop the export sector
and increase the formal sector’s share of economic activity. Directors supported the authorities’
decision to privatize the distribution arm of the electricity company (KESH), and urged them to
proceed in a timely manner with the remaining large-scale privatizations.
Directors encouraged the authorities to work toward eliminating the significant weaknesses that
remain in the national accounts and balance of payments statistics.

Press Release No. 06/164
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 24, 2006

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Completes First Review Under PRGF Arrangement and First
Review Under EFF Arrangement with Albania and Approves
US$3.6 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the first
review of Albania's performance and financing assurances under the three-year Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement and the Extended Fund Facility
arrangement (EFF). The completion of the reviews enables the release of an amount
equivalent to SDR 2.43 million (about US$3.6 million), which will bring the total
disbursement under both arrangements to SDR 4.87 million (about US$7.2 million).
In completing the reviews, the Board approved the authorities' request for a waiver for the
nonobservance of the structural performance criterion on the state-owned electricity company
KESH meeting the targets under the 2006-2008 Power Sector Action Plan with regards to
collection rates and losses.
The concurrent three-year arrangements under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF) and the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) amounting to the equivalent of SDR 17.045
million (about US$25.2 million) were approved on February 1, 2006 (see Press Release No
06/17).
Following the Executive Board's discussion of Albania, Ms. Anne O. Krueger, First Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:
“Albania’s macroeconomic performance over the past year has been good, with strong
growth, large inward remittances, and a significant reduction in poverty. Debt is declining,
and macroeconomic stability has been maintained, with inflation remaining low. Although
the current account deficit has deteriorated somewhat, the lek has continued to strengthen,
reflecting rising confidence and declining risk premiums.
“The expectation is for growth to moderate slightly in 2006, but to return to a faster pace in
2007 and over the longer term. However, sustaining this pace will require significant reforms
to improve infrastructure and institutional quality—including in governance and the rule of
law. Such reforms will enable Albania to attract the high-quality investment needed to
develop further the export sector, which remains small.

2
“The current rapid growth of financial intermediation is a positive development, and
necessary for sustained high growth. However, the rate of increase must remain consistent
with macroeconomic and financial stability, and the program provides for this. Actions will
be taken to tighten gradually prudential regulations and enhance banking supervision, to
safeguard loan quality. Work is also under way to establish a credit bureau and improve the
legal framework for collateral execution. These measures are expected to reduce the rate of
credit expansion by increasing effective lending costs.
“The program’s fiscal framework and the supplementary budget for 2006 are consistent with
the authorities’ strategy of developing a small but efficient government concentrated on its
core functions. A rising share of expenditure will be devoted to investment and other priority
areas, while future gains from tax administration reform will be devoted to tax relief and debt
reduction. The supplementary budget allocates projected structural revenue gains according
to this strategy.
“Future growth-enhancing institutional reforms will focus on areas directly impacting the
business climate, such as property rights and contract enforcement. Privatization is to be
accelerated in non-core areas of government, including in the distribution arm of the
electricity company (KESH),” Ms. Krueger said.

Statement by Arrigo Sadun, Executive Director for Albania
and Carlo Gola, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
July 24, 2006

On the behalf of the Albanian authorities, we wish to express our appreciation to the staff for
a well-written report and a comprehensive set of selected issues papers, which reflect the
frank and constructive discussion held in Tirana for the first review under the three-year
arrangement under the PRGF and the review of the Extended Arrangement. The
implementation of the PRGF/EFF-supported program has been broadly satisfactory. The
request for waiver of nonobservance of a performance criterion reflects the still difficult
situation in the electricity sector. The authorities recognize that the restructuring of the
public-owned company KESH, along the lines established by the Power Sector Action Plan
proved more difficult than expected. The new strategy for the electricity sector, already in
place, establishes a tariff structure that would remove currently-existing cross-subsidies from
business users to households and increase the average tariff to reflect higher import costs.
1. Albanian’s macroeconomic performance remains solid
With the exception of the supply-induced disruptions related to the difficulties in the
electricity sector, the county has enjoyed a prolonged period of sustained growth. The
estimated GDP growth in 2006 remains robust, at 5 percent (against 5.5 percent in 2005),
slightly below the average of the last few years. Growth is projected at 6 percent in 2007.
The electricity crises in October-November of last year, due to climatic circumstances, a poor
distribution network, and mismanagement of the electricity company, created serious power
problems and economic costs. In 2005, the slowdown was also affected by the modest export
performance (only 5.6 percent in volume in 2005, against more than 11 percent, on average,
in the three previous years).
Despite the increase in oil prices, inflation remained subdued. Retail prices increased, on
average, by 2.4 percent in 2005. However, year-on-year inflation up to May 2006 was 3.1
percent: a sustained increase in non-traded good prices was balanced by lower tradable
prices. The authorities remain vigilant in monitoring the phenomenon. Confidence in the
monetary framework has been maintained by a credible monetary policy based on a “soft”
inflation targeting.
The external current account deficit remains high and is expected to reach 8 percent of GDP
this year (excluding official transfers), despite the strong and consistent inflow of remittances
(which are about 15 percent of GDP).

2. The Government is committed to maintaining sound macroeconomic policies
The authorities are determined to preserve the current, prudent macroeconomic policies and
further enhance the quality of the budget and the credibility of the monetary framework.
Fiscal Policy
The fiscal stance was restrictive in 2005. The overall deficit was 3.6 percent against 5.1 in
2004, as a result of the policies aimed at improving revenues administration (tax revenue
increased by 11 percent) and more stringent criteria for capital expenditure and anticorruption policies. Such policies create a temporary stagnation of government expenditure
for public investment (only 38 billion leks, well below the 50.5 billion projected in the
budget). However, the “contingent expenditure” embedded in the Memorandum on
Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) should prevent, in the medium term, undesirable
under-expenditure of the capital account. The supplementary budget, to be approved this
month, will allocate the relevant “contingent expenditure” in high-quality capital spending,
tax relief, and debt reduction. The public debt-to-GDP ratio is steadily declining, although
now at a relatively less rapid stance: this year, as in 2005, it should remain at about 55
percent of GDP (it was 61.8 percent only three years ago). The external public debt is steady
at about 17 percent of GDP.
Limited technical capacities impeded, so far, the initiation of a comprehensive debt
management reform. The authorities recognize that improving budget debt management is
crucial, given the very short maturity of the debt (on average about 6.5 months) and the
number of participant is limited. By the end-October 2006 the authorities will formulate a
debt management strategy and, by end-September, they will present to Parliament a public
management law, followed by an action plan, along the lines suggested by staff and with the
valuable support of donors.
The authorities reiterate their commitment to preserve the current, sound fiscal policy,
reducing gradually but consistently the end-September public debt-to-GDP ratio. They agree
with staff that further simplification of the tax system to reduce compliance costs and further
broaden the tax base is needed. However, they are convinced that, in the future, there will be
room to design a tax regime to stimulate growth and help formalize the economy. In this
regard, while sharing the gradualist approach suggested by staff, the authorities see merit in a
flat-tax system (with a significantly reduced uniform rate) adopted with success in other
countries in the region.
Monetary policy
The authorities are committed to keeping inflation at 3 percent, with a tolerance range of
deviation of plus and minus one percent. The current monetary policy framework is based on

3
a reserve money program with quantitative targets and with changes to the repurchase rate as
main policy instruments. The flexible exchange rate regime is complemented by limited
foreign exchange interventions aimed at maintaining an adequate reserve level and
smoothing-out seasonality and short-term shocks. Since the country does not yet have full
access to the international capital markets, the phenomenon is mainly related to stock
adjustment on the relevant amount of remittances held in foreign currencies. The mediumterm goal is to build up (also with the technical help of donors) a monetary framework for a
formal inflation target.
In the short term, the main problem is the strong private sector credit growth. Like other
countries in the region, this trend is partially related to a convergence problem and to a
“catching-up” effect, given the still very low credit-to-GDP ratio (about 17 percent, to be
compared with only 9 percent in 2005 and the average of 37 percent of transition countries).
More that 73 percent total credit is denominated in foreign currency. The foreign-owned
banks (which account for more than 90 percent of the system) seem not to be exposed to
exchange rate mismatching since their funding is though domestic deposit denominated in
foreign currencies (from remittances). In addition, the banking system is liquid, profitable,
and well capitalized, while the non-performing loans are, up to now, very low.
That said, the rapid acceleration of the credit-to GDP ratio is a source of concern. The
authorities remain vigilant and will not hesitate to tighten monetary conditions should the
economy exhibit preliminary signs of inflationary pressure. However, they also recognize
that the effect of monetary policy is limited, since most of the credit is denominated in
foreign currencies.
Should the traditional transmission channels fail to succeed (creating incentive to shift from
foreign to domestic denominated deposits) the authorities will consider supervisory
measures. A few of them would be: increasing reserve requirements on foreign currency
deposits above 10 percent; amendments in capital adequacy to allow risk weights up to 150
percent to apply to high risk loans; impose higher that 12 percent minimum capital adequacy
requirements. For the moment, the Bank of Albania is encouraging banks, through moral
suasion, to adopt stricter debt service-to-disposable income ratios and prudent loan-to-value
ratios.
3. Structural reforms
The Albanian economy experienced significantly higher growth than other transition
countries, only partially explained by the initial disadvantage. However, in the last few years
this differential has been shrinking. As noted by staff, total factor productivity (TFP), which
captures the enhancement of organizational and institutional factors, is now growing at a
slower pace. To some extent this is a natural phenomenon, as the country is converging
toward the peer group. However, it is true that a new wave of reforms is needed to

4
consolidate current results and to boost growth. The attractiveness of foreign direct
investment is still low and, in general, the rate of growth of both private and public
investments is subdued. It is a source of concern that the investment-to-GDP ratio has
steadily declined in the last few years (from 27.6 percent in 2001 to 23.6 percent in 2005).
The underperformance of the external sector, and the widening current account deficit,
reflects the slowdown in the accumulation of physical capital. It is revealing that, among the
interesting comparative indicators produced by staff in table 3 (EBS/06/91, p. 39), one of the
most "misaligned" with respect to other Western Balkan countries is the trade openness index
(exports plus imports of goods and services as a share of GDP).
The authorities are cognizant that in order to reach the group of middle-income countries a
series of challenges still lies ahead. In particular, they need 1) to improve the country's
infrastructure by channeling the available resources into productive investments, according to
a strict cost/benefit criteria, and prioritizing the allocation of these resources; 2) to enhance
institutional reforms and implementation, particularly in the areas of revenue mobilization,
contract rights, governance, informal economy, and, in general, business climate; 3) to
promote the external sector, not only by developing a more robust manufacturing sector, but
also enhancing agriculture and tourism, where the country has considerable potential; and 4)
to continue with privatization policies, particularly in the area of public utilities. They are
confident that the current three-year arrangement under the PRGF/EFF-supported program
will provide not only a valid strategy to re-address the aforementioned problems, but also a
successful exit strategy from a Fund-supported program.
