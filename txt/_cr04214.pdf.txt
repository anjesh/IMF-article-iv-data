Staff Report for the 2003 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2003 Consultation with Zambia
Approved by Anupam Basu and G. Russell Kincaid
March 22, 2004


Discussions for the 2003 Article IV consultation were held in Zambia from October 28 to November 12,
2003. The staff team met with Mr. Magande, Minister of Finance and National Planning (MoFNP),
Mr. Fundanga, Governor of the Bank of Zambia (BoZ), other senior officials, representatives of the private
sector and civil society, and members of the diplomatic and donor community. A delegation visited
Washington from December 12 to 19, 2003 to continue discussions.



The staff team comprised Mr. Andrews (head), Mr. Thugge, Mr. Tharkur, Mr. Bagattini (all AFR),
Mr. Staines (PDR), Mr. Fassina (FAD), and Mr. Kakoza (Resident Representative). The mission worked
closely with World Bank staff.



In concluding the 2002 Article IV consultation on November 27, 2002, Directors welcomed the
improvement in Zambia’s economic performance but noted that the situation remained fragile. Directors
expressed concern over the composition of budgetary expenditures. They urged the authorities to increase
poverty-reducing spending and stabilize the wage bill as a share of GDP. Directors emphasized the
importance of public expenditure management, macroeconomic stability, and structural reforms for growth
and sustained poverty reduction.



Discussions for the 2003 Article IV consultation focused on sources of growth and medium-term prospects
for growth; policies to support private sector development; the fiscal outlook and sustainability; public sector
reform and expenditure management; the medium-term external outlook; and financial sector development
issues.



Zambia’s last PRGF arrangement expired in March 2003. After consideration of a new three-year PRGF
arrangement was precluded by a large projected budget overrun, the authorities requested a staff-monitored
program (SMP) covering the period July-December 2003.The mission found that early performance under
the SMP had not been satisfactory and discussed an extension of the SMP through June 2004. Discussions
were concluded in early February. The government’s program and a request for the staff to monitor the
program are included in this report.



Since his election in 2001, President Mwanawasa has increased his slim majority in parliament by appointing
opposition members to cabinet and winning by-elections. The government’s anti-corruption campaign has
resulted in the prosecution of former Zambian President Chiluba on charges of corruption and misuse of
public resources.



Zambia has had two ESAF/PRGF arrangements. An ex post assessment is being issued as a background
paper to this report.

Executive Summary
Recent Developments
•
In 2003, Zambia’s economic performance continued to improve. Real GDP is estimated to
have increased by about 4 percent, making 2003 the fourth consecutive year of uninterrupted growth in
over three decades. Inflation, at about 17 percent, declined to its lowest level in two decades.
•
However, this good performance reflected favorable exogenous developments that masked
serious shortcomings in policy implementation. In particular, there was a sharp deterioration in fiscal
performance owing to overruns in the wage bill and ad hoc policy decisions which raised expenditures
markedly. As a result, the targets under the SMP for July-December 2003 were missed by a wide
margin. Progress on structural reforms was mixed.
The Medium-Term Outlook
•
Zambia’s economy remains fragile. The government’s medium-term strategy, articulated in the
PRSP, involves increased diversification of the economy, and targets real GDP growth of at least
4½ percent; an inflation rate in single digits; and a strengthening of the international reserves position.
The Macroeconomic Program for 2004
•
In light of the fiscal slippages in 2003, understandings were reached on a macroeconomic
program for 2004 whose implementation could establish a track record for moving to a new PRGF
arrangement. Consistent with the medium-term objectives, the program is based on real GDP growth
of 3.5 percent, and inflation of 20 percent. Achieving these objectives hinges on the authorities’
capacity to implement prudent financial policies, in particular the 2004 budget.
•
Fiscal adjustment will focus mainly on expenditure restraint. It is therefore crucial that the
government refrains from unbudgeted spending, improves public expenditure management and holds
the wage bill to 8 percent of GDP. The domestic deficit is projected to narrow by 2.2 percent of GDP,
which should permit domestic financing to decline by 3 percent of GDP, thereby reducing pressures on
prices and domestic interest rates.
•
The government’s agenda for structural reforms includes: financial sector reforms, including
measures to deal with insolvent NBFIs; completing the privatization of ZNCB; completing the
commercialization of ZESCO; improving public expenditure management and governance; and
implementing policies to improve the environment for private sector development.
•
The implementation of the proposed 2004 budget, which is broadly in line with the SMP, should
be sufficient to help Zambia avoid an unsustainable spiral of higher domestic debt and interest payments.
Satisfactory performance under the SMP is crucial if Zambia is to move to a PRGF arrangement and to
reach the HIPC completion point.

-5-

I. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER THE SMP
1.
Zambia’s economic performance
has improved significantly in the last
four years. After more than two decades
of economic decline and inflation
averaging over 50 percent, growth has
averaged about 4 percent per annum since
2000, and inflation has been sharply
reduced (Figures 1 and 2). However,
macroeconomic stability remains fragile,
and faster sustained growth is essential to
tackle pervasive poverty.
2.
In 2002, real GDP grew by
3 percent despite difficulties in the
mining sector and the impact of the
severe drought on agricultural output
(Table 2). Drought-induced food shortages
also pushed inflation to 26.7 percent in the
12 months to December 2002. The overall
deficit of the central government narrowed
to 6.3 percent of GDP from 8.1 percent in
2001. In the external sector, the current
account deficit, after grants, narrowed to
6.5 percent of GDP from 10.8 percent in
2001, despite a sharp slowdown in the
growth of copper exports. Gross
international reserves at the Bank of
Zambia (BoZ) rose to 2.2 months of
imports in 2002 from 0.9 month at end2001.

3.
In the face of strong pressures to increase public sector wages, fiscal policy
implementation deteriorated sharply in 2003. In April, the authorities granted large wage
increases and introduced a new housing allowance. If paid in full, total remuneration of
government employees would have exceeded the budgeted figure of 8 percent of GDP by
2½ percent of GDP. Against this background, to facilitate the resolution of this issue and the
transition to a new Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement,
understandings were reached on a staff-monitored program (SMP) for the period July to
December 2003 in which the macroeconomic framework was modified to accommodate part
of the higher payments to government employees, while seeking to minimize inflationary
pressures and protect priority expenditures on poverty reduction.

-6-

4.
In 2003, the overall fiscal deficit (after grants) and domestic financing are
estimated to have exceeded the SMP target by 1½ percent of GDP and 2 percent of
GDP, respectively (Tables 3 and 4). Through end-August, performance was broadly in line
with the SMP, but from September onward there were large unbudgeted outlays. These
included security-related spending and payment of retrenchment benefits and wage arrears of
0.8 percent of GDP to facilitate the sale in December of the Luanshya mine, the Roan
Antelope Mining Company of Zambia (RAMCOZ) (see para. 6 of the MEFP). Expenditures
on poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP) priority projects again fell short of budgeted
levels. Wage payments were broadly in line with the SMP, and the government reached
agreements with some unions to reduce housing allowances awarded in 2003 by two-thirds.
Domestic arrears continued to accumulate, mostly as a consequence of penalties and an
increase in the kwacha value of foreign currency-denominated arrears.
5.
Despite the fiscal slippages, growth picked up and inflation declined in 2003,
aided by a recovery in agricultural production. The increase in real GDP in 2003 is now
estimated at 4.2 percent, slightly lower than the 4.5 percent projected in the SMP, reflecting
slower growth in mining production. The 12-month inflation rate of 17.2 percent in
December 2003 also exceeded the target of 13 percent in the SMP as a result of some
relaxation in financial policies (see below). Although inflation reached its lowest level since
1982, this outcome was due more to favorable food price developments (Figure 2) than
policy implementation.
6.
Monetary policy was initially tightened in 2003 to remove a monetary overhang.
After expanding by 49 percent in 2002, the growth of reserve money was limited to
17 percent in the first nine months of 2003, and the BoZ observed the corresponding ceiling
on net domestic assets (NDA) and the floor on gross reserves (Tables 5 and 6). During the
same period, broad money grew by 12 percent, in line with the SMP. In combination with the
government’s significant financing needs, this monetary restraint kept interest rates on
treasury bills in the range of 30-35 percent for most of the year. However, in the final months
of 2003, interest rates declined sharply in response to a reduction in the cash reserve
requirement (effective October 31) from 17.5 percent to 14 percent. Growth in broad money
of 23.4 percent in 2003 exceeded the SMP target of 17 percent.
7.
The overall balance of payments position through end-December 2003 is
estimated to be better than expected under the SMP. Boosted by a sharp increase in
copper prices in 2003 and further strong growth in nontraditional exports, total exports grew
by an estimated 22 percent, while total imports grew by 15 percent (Table 7). The current
account deficit (after grants) and overall balance of payments deficit are estimated to have
narrowed to 5.9 percent and 7.6 percent of GDP, respectively, compared with 7.5 percent and
8.8 percent in the SMP. The BoZ met the adjusted end-December 2003 reserve target under
the SMP.

-7-

8.
The relatively stable trend in the
real effective exchange rate since the
mid-1990s has continued to support the
growth of nontraditional exports
(Figure 3). During 2003, the real effective
exchange depreciated slightly as a result of
a 15 percent depreciation of the nominal
effective exchange rate. However, there
were diverse movements against
individual currencies. The kwacha
depreciated by only 7 percent against the
U.S. dollar, compared with 29 percent
against the South African rand and 19
percent against the euro.

Progress in implementing structural reforms was mixed during 2003. A mediumterm expenditure framework (MTEF) was discussed with stakeholders in preparation of the
2004 budget. The BoZ also introduced an interbank foreign exchange market. However,
effectiveness of the strengthened commitment control system was undermined by cash
releases for unbudgeted expenditures and, to a lesser extent, by weak enforcement of the
sanctions on accounting officers. Procurement of hardware and software for an integrated
financial management and information system (IFMIS) and the preparation of a multiyear
plan for clearing domestic arrears were also delayed. The authorities completed a draft
Financial Sector Development Plan (FSDP), which was posted on the BoZ’s website for
comments in February 2004. Progress was made in developing plans to deal with three
insolvent nonbank financial institutions. Negotiations with the preferred bidder, for the sale
of 49 percent shares and management rights of the Zambia National Commercial Bank, are
continuing.
10.
The authorities have made some progress toward reaching the floating
completion point under the enhanced Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC Initiative) (Table 8). Measures have been implemented in the areas of health and
education; the privatization of the ZNCB; agreement on the commercialization of the Zambia
Electricity Supply Corporation (ZESCO); the preparation and implementation of the MTEF;
and the preparation of the PRSP progress report, a draft of which is being finalized. A key
outstanding area is the maintenance of a stable macroeconomic environment, as evidenced by
a satisfactory performance under a PRGF arrangement. Satisfactory progress under the
extended SMP could serve as a bridge to a new PRGF arrangement.
11.
Zambia’s core economic database is largely adequate for program monitoring,
although the quality and timeliness of key monetary, fiscal, and external trade data need to be
improved. Zambia’s relations with the Fund and the World Bank Group are summarized in
Appendices II and III, respectively. Statistical issues are described in Appendix IV, and social
and demographic indicators are provided in Appendix V.

II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Medium-Term Outlook and Key Policy Issues
12.
Drawing on the ex post assessment of Zambia’s performance under Fundsupport programs (Box 1),1 the discussions focused on policies to attain the objectives
established in the government’s poverty reduction strategy (PRSP).2 This medium-term
strategy aims to sustain the recent momentum in the growth of per capita income to reduce
the poverty headcount from 73 percent in 1998 to 65 percent by 2004. Key macroeconomic
objectives underlying this medium-term strategy are to achieve real GDP growth of at least
4 percent per annum during 2004-05 and at least 5 percent thereafter; reduce the rate of
inflation to around 10 percent in 2006 and to single digits thereafter; increase gross
international reserves significantly by end-2006, and reduce the external current account
deficit (including grants and debt relief on interest payments) to a sustainable level.

Box 1. Key Points From the Ex Post Assessment
Past performance


Program implementation under the ESAF arrangement approved in 1995 was poor, but generally improved
under the PRGF arrangement approved in 1999. Growth resumed, but fell short of targets. Fiscal outcomes
were not strong enough and inflation remained above 20 percent. Delays in privatization of the copper
company, ZCCM, generated large fiscal costs. Fiscal slippages, including excessive wage increases, put
pressure on interest rates and prevented increases in priority social spending. Progress in monetary
management was more encouraging. Zambia’s relatively open and liberal exchange regime and a flexible
exchange rate have supported private sector activity including growth of nonmining exports.



Progress in structural reforms was mixed. Improvements in public expenditure management were slower
than expected and undermined by poor expenditure policy. There were repeated delays in the privatization
of the insolvent commercial bank ZNCB, and nontransparent processes have adversely affected mining
sector privatizations. After the elections in 2001, the new government launched a policy of “zero tolerance”
of corruption, but fundamental weaknesses in budgetary processes remain an obstacle to good governance.



Zambia’s mixed record of implementation, including delays in privatizations and weakness in expenditure
management and policy, have been indicative of incomplete program ownership. Implementation also
suffered from limited capacity and lapses in coordination.



The growth target in the ESAF-supported program may have been too optimistic. Given the record of fiscal
slippages, the initial program targets to reduce inflation to 4 percent over three years appear overambitious.
Assumptions for external assistance may also have been too optimistic; policy slippages often led to
shortfalls in donor support and higher recourse to domestic borrowing.

Looking ahead


A further PRGF arrangement is needed to assist Zambia in addressing challenges in the Fund’s core areas
of responsibility. A strong track record of implementation would allow Zambia to reach the HIPC
completion point and catalyze higher aid flows for progress towards the MDGs.



Fiscal policy must bear a greater burden of adjustment to facilitate a sustainable reduction in real interest
rates and support private domestic investment. Development and implementation of public sector reforms
to support tight control of the wage bill and improvements in PEM will be crucial to fiscal consolidation
and a reorientation of spending to poverty reduction. It is also essential to strengthen budgetary processes
to improve governance. A consistent policy for the granting of tax exemptions is needed to avoid ad hoc
treatment and to preserve the relatively strong revenue base.



Completion of the privatization program is essential to improve economic efficiency and protect the
budget. Accelerating growth will also require the removal of obstacles to private sector development.
Financial sector reform should follow through on the conclusions of the FSAP, including resolving
government-owned nonbank financial institutions and improving rural banking services.



Avoidance of ad hoc spending decisions and strict enforcement of budgetary procedures will be key tests of
ownership. Public advocacy of the chosen policy path will also be important in demonstrating ownership at
the highest levels of government. Monitoring of implementation needs to be strengthened through improved
coordination within government.

The authorities agreed with many of the points made in the assessment, but argued that more needed to be done to
support private sector growth, particularly through improvements in infrastructure.

- 10 -

Sources of growth and the medium-term macroeconomic outlook
13.
In the medium term, agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and tourism are
expected to be the main sources of growth. The authorities expect agricultural growth to
moderate in 2004 after the strong recovery from drought in 2003, but to pick up steadily to
4 percent by 2006; this growth will be bolstered by support to small-scale farmers and the
privately managed outgrower schemes for export crops. The mining sector is expected to play
a key role, as a result of higher private investments and the positive outlook for copper prices
(Box 2). The government expects the manufacturing sector to benefit from higher demand
from mining and agricultural sectors, and also sees good prospects in the tourism sector,
particularly in the Livingstone area, spurred by infrastructure improvements and the
upgrading of the airport for international flights. The authorities also noted that Zambia
would continue to benefit from the regional trade agreements, as well as from the U.S.
African Growth and Opportunity Act.

Staff analysis indicates that the increase in GDP growth since 2000 reflects a
turnaround in total factor productivity (TFP) growth,3 which can be attributed to improved
macroeconomic management and greater private sector participation in the economy,
especially in the mining sector, following the privatization of the Zambia Consolidated
Copper Mines (ZCCM). The staff and the authorities agreed that the medium-term growth

Box 2. Mining Sector Developments and Prospects
Zambia’s mining sector, which includes cobalt as a
by-product of copper extraction, has suffered three
decades of decline. By 2000, copper production
had fallen to 234,000 tons, or less than a third of
the peak level attained in 1969. This decline was
exacerbated by a weakening of copper prices,
particularly in the second half of the 1990s, and by
the turn of the century, mining accounted for twothirds of Zambia’s merchandise exports, compared

However, the partial exploitation of the Konkola Deep Mining Project is assumed only to offset declining
output from KCM’s other mines. KCM’s share of total production would therefore decline from twothirds to about 40 percent over the medium term, as a result of continued expansion of output from other
existing mines and the opening of new lower-cost mines, such as at Kanshansi and Lumwana. Total
copper production is now expected to reach almost 600,000 metric tons by 2008, a level last attained in
the 1980s. In addition, the recovery of the mining

Despite its projected recovery, the mining sector
is unlikely to regain its former predominance in
the Zambian economy. Although the sector’s
share of GDP is expected to trend slightly upward,
its share of total merchandise exports is expected
to remain around two-thirds because of the
continued expansion of nonmining exports.

However, risks to the long-term growth outlook include exogenous factors, such as drought, a
downturn in copper prices, and a worsening of the HIV/AIDS situation.

Raising growth to between 6–8 percent per year to reduce poverty in line with
the corresponding Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) would require stronger
TFP growth and higher employment rates. To reach this goal, the staff stressed the
importance of increasing the execution of poverty-reducing spending and accelerating the
implementation of the structural reform agenda in public expenditure management (PEM),
the financial sector (including privatizing the ZNCB and improving access to financial
services for rural areas), governance, and removing obstacles to private sector development
(see below). The authorities noted, and the staff agreed, that achieving the MDGs would also
depend on improved access to industrial countries’ markets, especially for agricultural
products, textiles, and clothing. The staff observed that, for Zambia to be able to take
advantage of such a reduction in trade barriers, it would be important for it to continue to
maintain an open trade regime, as well as implementation of the complementary policies,
including an appropriate exchange rate.
Private sector development issues
16.
The staff stressed the importance of removing obstacles to private sector
development. Over 90 percent of land is under customary ownership, with control exercised
by traditional leaders. The remainder is state lands, for which long-term leases or “titles” can
be issued to private individuals. The authorities confirmed that lands under the customary
system could not be used as collateral for loans. There was agreement that the limited
availability of state lands could ultimately constrain commercial agriculture. The government
emphasized the immediate priority of improving the governance and administration of statecontrolled lands and providing infrastructure for the development of farming blocks. A
consultative process has begun on the conversion of more traditional lands to state lands. In

- 13 -

addition, the World Bank is undertaking a poverty and social impact analysis (PSIA) of the
reform of land ownership.
17.
The government plans to revise the Industrial and Labor Relations Act to
streamline bargaining and to reduce illegal strikes and lockouts. The government is also
considering modifications to current legal provisions to reduce retrenchment costs, which
discourage permanent hiring and have proved costly to the government in meeting
retrenchment costs of privatized entities. The staff urged the government to avoid provisions
requiring employers to provide housing or housing allowances for workers, and to avoid
undue restrictions on the hiring of skilled foreign workers. While welcoming the
government’s intention to strengthen the Zambia Investment Center (ZIC) as a facilitator of
foreign direct investments, the staff urged the government to seek private sector views in
revising the Investment Act. In particular, the staff noted concerns over recent public
statements that were seen as inimical to foreign investment and stressed the important role
that higher private investment could play in enhancing growth.
18.
The authorities emphasized the importance of good governance. In this context,
they reiterated their determination to continue with the policy of “zero tolerance” of
corruption, and to strengthen key governance institutions, notably the Anti-Corruption
Commission and the Office of the Auditor General. To improve the transparency of its
operations, the government will continue to undertake regular auditing and publication of its
accounts and the operations of the public enterprises. While supporting the authorities’
governance program, the staff stressed that addressing fundamental weaknesses in budgetary
processes was crucial to strengthening governance.
Fiscal outlook and sustainability
19.
The discussion focused on the urgent need for fiscal adjustment to break the
unsustainable cycle of rising domestic debt and interest payments in recent years. To
illustrate the risks, the staff team presented alternative scenarios.4 Under an adjustment
scenario consistent with higher external support and move in 2004 to a PRGF arrangement
with the HIPC completion point reached soon after, it would be possible to achieve a gradual
phasing out of domestic financing, which would be eliminated in 2008. This should result in
a gradual decline in the domestic debt from 21.9 percent of GDP in 2003 to below 14 percent
of GDP in 2008 (Figure 4), declining real interest rates, and sharply lower domestic interest
payments (from a peak of 3.7 percent of GDP in 2004 to 1.8 percent of GDP in 2008
(Figure 5). This adjustment, supported by effective public sector and PEM reforms, would
allow a steady increase in poverty-reducing spending from 2.4 percent of GDP in 2003 to
5.4 percent of GDP in 2008 (Figure 6). In a scenario without fiscal adjustment, domestic

financing would double from 4.9 percent of GDP in 2004 to 10 percent of GDP in 2008,
entailing an unsustainable rise of domestic debt and interest payments and a sharp reduction
in all components of primary spending (Figure 7).

Against this background, the staff stressed that a firm fiscal policy in 2004 would
be crucial to establish a sustainable path for domestic debt. The staff also noted the risk
that without prompt action, the approach of national elections in 2006 could lead to a costly
delay in the required fiscal adjustment. The authorities agreed with the staff's assessment and
shared the view that concerted efforts were needed to implement a budget in 2004 geared to
restraining domestic borrowing, limiting the wage bill to no more than 8 percent of GDP, and
protecting priority social spending. The authorities also agreed on the need to phase out
domestic financing over the medium term, and reorient spending toward poverty-reducing
programs.
21.
The staff also emphasized the need to maintain the good performance of
Zambia’s tax revenues. While revenue collections have generally been in line with budget
targets and above the average levels seen in the region, the staff expressed concern that

- 15 -

exemptions could undermine this performance. The authorities recognized this risk and
indicated that they would carefully assess the potential budgetary effects of recent initiatives
on tax incentives for investment before their full implementation (see para. 19 of the
memorandum of economic and financial policies (MEFP)) and seek to develop a consistent
policy in this area. In addition, the authorities agreed with staff recommendations that raising
budgetary revenues as a share of GDP by expanding the tax base and improving efficiency of
the tax system should remain a pillar of the planned fiscal adjustment.
Public sector reform and expenditure management
22.
The authorities acknowledged that further public sector reforms were needed to
contain the wage bill while improving efficiency. Despite an ongoing reform plan
supported by the World Bank since 2001, progress was disappointing, especially in
implementing the pay reform strategy. Weaknesses remained in procedures for wage
negotiations and in managing the establishment register and the payroll. The staff stressed the
importance of a new round of public sector reforms on which discussions are underway with
the World Bank and other donors (para. 17). These reforms over the period 2004-08 should
aim to “right size” government operations and to complete the pay reform strategy. The staff
urged that, as well as improving the efficiency of the government’s operations, these reforms
should be geared to reducing the wage bill to below the level of 8 percent of GDP projected
in the MTEF, so as to provide more room for priority spending.
23.
The authorities agreed that progress in strengthening public expenditure
management had been undermined by unbudgeted expenditures. This experience of
recent fiscal slippages and the adverse implications of large domestic borrowing underscored
the need to reinforce the budget’s role in the definition and execution of spending policy. The
HIPC Initiative expenditure-tracking Assessment and Action Plan (AAP), carried out jointly
by the World Bank and the IMF in December 2003, also concluded that only limited progress
had been made in strengthening PEM (Box 3).
Medium-term external outlook and policy issues
24.
The authorities and staff concurred that, with the support of domestic fiscal
adjustment and attainment of the completion point under the HIPC Initiative, mediumterm external prospects were generally positive. Based on discussions with government
and with the key mining companies, copper exports are projected to rise by 20 percent a year
over 2004-06, due to higher prices and a continued expansion of production, including new
mines in Kansanshi and Lumwana; in 2006, production is expected to be about half a million
metric tons, a level last reached in the mid-1980s. The authorities and staff agreed that this
outlook was vulnerable to weaker copper prices (see Box 4) and the continued uncertainty
concerning the sale of a majority share of the Konkola Copper Mines (KCM) (Box 5).

1/ Including additional financing, above gross financing indicated, to close the financing gap.

The baseline scenario assumes that Zambia reaches the HIPC completion point by end-2004 and implements strong fiscal
adjustment through the medium term. External debt service is expected to decline substantially in 2006 as the large
repayments due to the Fund, related to the 1995 arrears clearance, come to an end. Debt-service payments are then projected
to trend upwards because of repayments on new PRGF disbursements since 1999, but will remain below 7 percent of
exports. Payments to other creditors will remain relatively low due to the longer maturities on their lending.
The NPV of debt at end-2003, using decision point discount rates, is tentatively estimated to be 182 percent of exports—
and therefore above the 150 percent sustainability threshold. This is also higher than projected at the end-2000 decision
point mainly because of weaker copper prices. However, the NPV of debt is projected to trend down to about 94 percent of
exports by the end of the projection period. This is less than projected at the decision point, mainly because of a stronger
than expected shift in the composition of external assistance towards grants. The share of loans in gross external financing
fell from about half in 2000 to about 30 percent in 2003 and, in keeping with current donor sentiments, is projected to trend
further down to about 20 percent. Under the first alternative scenario, which assumes that half of the assistance is in the
form of loans, the debt burden by the end of the projection period is higher than under the baseline scenario.
The baseline assumes that copper prices will rise from an average of 78 cents/lb in 2003 to 89 cents/lb in 2008. In the
second alternative scenario, a 10 percent reduction in the copper price from 2004 relative to the baseline would increase the
NPV of debt at the end of the projection period to about 110 percent of exports.
The third scenario takes into account the potential need for higher assistance to help meet the poverty reduction targets.
Although the extent of the increase in assistance required is difficult to gauge, the scenario assumes that gross assistance
would need to be about 3 percentage points of GDP higher than in the baseline starting from 2007—after allowing for
additional financing to close the financing gap. In this scenario, gross financing rises to over 14 percent of GDP over 200712. Assuming that the additional assistance is more heavily tilted toward loans than under the baseline scenario, but that the
overall share of loans nevertheless declines to about 25 percent, the NPV of debt at the end of the projection period would
remain over 100 percent of exports.

Box 5. Ownership Structure of Konkola Copper Mines
After the state-owned copper mines were privatized in March 2000, Konkola Copper Mines (KCM)
emerged as the largest mining company, accounting for about two-thirds of copper production. The
consortium that took over KCM was led by the private sector holding company, Zambia Copper
Investments (ZCI), whose equity stake in KCM was 65 percent. Anglo American (AA) owned 51 percent
of the ZCI. The remaining 35 percent of KCM’s equity was accounted for by two development agencies
(the IFC and the CDC), which each owned 7.5 percent, and by the government’s holding company, the
Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) (20 percent). Although the ZCCM was a minority
shareholder in KCM, the government held a golden share, giving it the right to veto KCM’s involvement
in areas unrelated to mining. In early 2002, AA decided to exit from KCM, citing weak world copper
prices and the high cost of developing the Konkola Deep Mining Project. Subsequently, the two
development agencies also chose to exercise their options to exit KCM and have their original
investments refunded by AA.
Until a new strategic equity partner (SEP) is found for KCM, a transitional ownership structure will be
kept in place, as illustrated below. Temporarily, KCM now has two major shareholders, the ZCI and the
ZCCM, and, although the ZCCM remains the minority shareholder, its equity stake has increased
significantly to 42 percent. Moreover, the stakeholders in both the ZCI and the ZCCM have been
significantly changed. Aside from the previous minority shareholders in the ZCI (mostly European),
whose stake has been increased, AA’s stake in the ZCI has now been taken over by two new stakeholders.
These are the independent Copperbelt Development Foundation (CDF) and KCM’s employees, through
an employee share ownership scheme (ESOP) designed to provide incentives to the management and
employees. The CDF will use any income from the ZCI to invest in projects aimed at diversifying the
economy of the copperbelt and mitigating the social impact of the eventual closure of the KCM mines.
The government continues to be the main stakeholder in the ZCCM, with a golden share in KCM, but a
minority stake in the ZCCM will now be held by private investors. Once a new strategic equity partner
has been found to invest in KCM, it is expected that the SEP will acquire control of at least 51 percent of
KCM outside of both the ZCI and the ZCCM. This tripartite ownership structure would be
accommodated by a dilution of the equity shares held by the ZCI and the ZCCM.

The strong growth in nonmining exports is projected to continue, though at a more modest pace
of about 10 percent per year. The authorities noted the potential for significant growth in
electricity and tourism. On this basis, the external current account deficit (after grants and debt
relief on interest) is projected to trend down to 4 percent of GDP in 2006 from about 6 percent
in 2003.
25.
The authorities noted the significant expansion in trade with countries in the
Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and the Southern African
Development Community (SADC), which now accounted for about one-third of Zambia’s
exports, compared with less than 10 percent a decade ago. This expansion has been facilitated
by the creation of the COMESA free trade area in 2000 and the continuing tariff reduction in
the SADC. The authorities also anticipate that the creation of the COMESA common external
tariff (CET) in 2004 will lead to additional gains in trade. The authorities noted that access to
industrial countries’ markets had been also important to the strong growth in nonmining
exports and stressed that a further expansion of access would be helpful to support continued
growth in this area.
26.
The trade regime remains open and supportive of export development. The simple
average nominal tariff on imports is estimated to have declined in 2003 by 2 percentage points
to 11.5 percent as a result of the reclassification of some goods within the four tariff bands (0,
5, 15, and 20 percent). The authorities affirmed the absence of nontariff barriers. Import bans
introduced against selected imports from Zimbabwe in 2002 were removed in mid-2003 when
agreement was reached through COMESA to permit these goods to be evaluated for tariff
purposes at the market exchange rate rather than at the official exchange rate. Based on the
simple average tariff and the virtual absence of nontariff barriers, Zambia’s trade regime would
continue to carry a rating of 2 under the Fund’s trade restrictiveness index, which ranges from
1 to 10, with a rating of 10 being the most restrictive. Zambia has been selected to participate
in the Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance to Least Development
Countries.5
27.
The staff and the authorities agreed that Zambia’s floating exchange rate regime
was appropriate, given the country’s vulnerability to external shocks. The successful
introduction of the interbank market for foreign exchange in July 2003 was seen as an
important step toward improving the efficiency of the market. To date, the market has operated
well, and the authorities suggested that its wider coverage had contributed to somewhat greater
short-term stability of the kwacha. The staff also agreed with the authorities that the external
value of the kwacha was broadly appropriate and had supported competitiveness and growth in

nontraditional exports.6 Although Zambia had received significant amounts of aid, this was not
seen as exerting strong upward pressure in the kwacha because of its high import content and
because of the accumulation of external reserves since the late 1990s. Any future fiscal
slippages, with their potential for triggering higher inflation and increases in real interest rates
were, however, viewed as posing a serious risk to competitiveness. Similarly, competitiveness
will also deteriorate if public sector wage increases continue to put pressure on private sector
labor costs.
28.
The authorities recognized that achieving medium-term debt sustainability and
meeting PRSP objectives would depend critically on a demonstrated commitment to
sound economic policies, which in turn should permit Zambia to reach the completion
point under the HIPC Initiative. Reaching the completion point would also allow Zambia to
meet the large debt-service obligations due to the Fund through end-2005. External debtservice obligations are projected to drop sharply in 2006, once repayments to the Fund related
to the 1995 arrears clearance under the rights accumulation program (RAP) have been
completed.
29.
The authorities and staff agreed that significant levels of external donor support
would be needed for Zambia to meet its poverty reduction targets. The authorities shared
staff’s concern that policy slippages had jeopardized this support over the near term. A
significantly improved record of policy implementation will be needed to gain higher levels of
donor support. The authorities stressed the need for external support to be provided in the form
of grants, noting that, on current projections, debt-service obligations (including to the Fund)
would fall significantly in 2006 but would start to increase again toward the end of the decade.
However, on the basis of existing data, which would be revised for a new debt sustainability
analysis prior to the HIPC completion point, debt-service payments would remain below
7 percent of exports and the net present value (NPV) of debt would continue to trend
downward to below 100 percent of exports.
Financial sector development
30.
The discussion of financial sector issues took place against the background of
generally sound indicators of the health of the banking system, but low levels of financial
intermediation. The staff emphasized the importance of a prompt selection of a private
strategic investor for the ZNCB, noting that the poor performance of this bank had been a
barrier to efficient banking operations. With the exception of the ZNCB, all banks have
continued to meet their minimum capital requirements. Asset quality remains satisfactory, with
interest earning assets accounting for 74 percent of total assets; however, investments in
government securities continue to account for a large share of banks assets, at 29 percent. The
quality of the banks’ loan portfolio remains satisfactory, with nonperforming loans declining to
6

- 21 -

8.6 percent of total loans, and provisioning has been adequate. However, for the financial
system as a whole, the ratio of private sector credit to GDP is one of the lowest in sub-Saharan
Africa at 6 percent. Moreover, the state-owned nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs), which
were set up to channel funds to specific sectors, such as housing, long-term project financing,
and rural banking services, are insolvent.
31.
The Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) undertaken jointly with Bank
staff noted the need for decisive plans to tackle the problem of insolvent NBFIs. The
government has produced a draft financial sector development plan (FSDP) that seeks to
address this and other issues raised in the FSAP. The authorities concurred with the staff
assessment that the first priority was to address the issue of the insolvent NBFIs, which
continued to expose the budget to additional liabilities (progress in this area would be
monitored under the SMP). The plan also stresses the need to strengthen the independence of
the BoZ, especially in matters of banking supervision. The government has also drafted
regulations to support the development of the microfinance sector that are expected to come
into force in 2004. The draft regulations aim to strengthen the governance of the sector through
increased availability of information and better supervision of corporate governance.
B. The Extended SMP and Economic Prospects for 2004
32.
The authorities recognized that performance under the SMP for July-December
2003 did not provide a strong basis for an early transition to a PRGF arrangement.
Discussions, therefore, focused on a revised fiscal framework for 2004, whose implementation,
including upfront actions to support the required fiscal adjustment, could be monitored under a
SMP extended through June 2004. Growth in 2004 is now projected at 3.5 percent, while
inflation is targeted to be 20 percent by end-December 2004. Gross international reserves are
expected to reach 1.5 months of import cover at end-2004. The authorities were aware that,
only with satisfactory progress—first under the extended SMP, and then under a PRGF
arrangement, as well as further progress on the HIPC Initiative triggers—could Zambia reach
the HIPC Initiative completion point.
33.
The budget framework relies on expenditure restraint and revenue increases to
attain the required adjustment. Overall, domestically financed primary expenditures are
expected to decline by 1.8 percentage points of GDP, while revenues are expected to increase
by 1 percent of GDP (see MEFP, paras. 13-20). As a result, domestic financing would be
limited to 2 percent of GDP, thereby, preventing a further rise in domestic debt as a share of
GDP and easing pressure on interest rates.
34.
On the expenditure side, the adjustment will focus on the wage bill and recurrent
department charges. The wage bill is to be reduced by 0.5 percentage point to 8 percent of
GDP in 2004 by avoiding a general wage increase for government employees—except for the
police and immigration and prison service personnel—and the payment of a modest housing
allowance. Savings are also envisaged in ordinary recurrent departmental charges and in
domestically financed capital spending. Priority poverty-reducing expenditures are budgeted at

- 22 -

2 percent of GDP, or close to double the outcome for 2003. The avoidance of ad hoc spending
decisions during the fiscal year and progress on PEM reforms are key conditions for executing
the budget (paras. 29-36 of MEFP).
35.
On the revenue side, measures focus on broadening the tax base and increasing
the efficiency of the system. Specifically, the value-added tax (VAT) has been significantly
reformed. First, unprocessed agricultural goods, medical supplies, and drugs, currently zero
rated, have been exempted. Second, the possibility of voluntary registration has been
eliminated. Third, the threshold for mandatory registration has been doubled to K 200 million
per year. For businesses below the revised VAT threshold, the government has replaced the
income tax and the VAT with a 3 percent turnover tax. Revenues from new top personal
income tax brackets of 35 percent and 40 percent will more than compensate for lower tax
payments by the bulk of taxpayers, who will benefit from a higher threshold for income tax. In
combination with higher nontax revenues, including higher receipts from sale of fertilizer,7
total revenues are expected to rise by 1 percent of GDP in 2004.
36.
The authorities agreed to refrain from introducing any additional tax exemptions,
rebates, or preferential tax treatment beyond those already factored in the 2004 budget.
They expressed concern that this could conflict with the operation of the Export Processing
Zone Act (EPZA) but agreed to a freeze on all registrants under the act until a study could
assess its potential revenue impact. This study would be completed in time for preparing the
2005 budget to allow for revenue measures to be taken to offset any negative impact of tax
incentives (paras. 18 and 19 of MEFP).
37.
The staff discussed with the authorities the possible poverty and social impact of
some of the proposed fiscal measures. The exemption from VAT of unprocessed agricultural
goods, medical supplies, and drugs means that producers will no longer be able to claim VAT
refunds for inputs used, as was possible under the previous regime, with the zero rating of these
goods. This change may raise production costs and could lead to some price increases.
However, the full execution of poverty-reducing expenditures, which are budgeted to increase
by 1 percent of GDP from the outcome in 2003, is expected to mitigate the possible adverse
impact of these price increases on the poor. In addition, poor households will also benefit from
the authorities’ decision to raise the threshold for exempting income from the personal income
tax.8 The staff also suggested that the fiscal adjustment include (i) higher excise duties on
petroleum products, with the increase concentrated on gasoline, so as to minimize the impact
on the poor of higher diesel prices; and (ii) the introduction of a new top income tax rate of
7

The 2004 budget reduced the fertilizer subsidy. Farmers will now pay 75 percent of the cost of
fertilizer rather than 50 percent as before. This change implies additional revenue of 0.1 percent of GDP.

The previous threshold—unchanged for several years—implied taxing income just above one U.S.
dollar per day.

- 23 -

35 percent. However, in the face of rising import prices for petroleum products, the budget did
not raise petroleum excise duties, opting instead for a more progressive income tax. On the
issue of the fertilizer subsidy, a preliminary PSIA conducted by Bank staff indicated that, while
such a subsidy could benefit the poor, the existing scheme was subject to problems of targeting
and efficiency that undermined its effectiveness.
38.
The fiscal adjustment would enable the expansion of broad money to be limited to
18 percent in 2004. This objective takes into account the monetary overhang at the end of
2003 resulting from the reduction in reserve requirements, while accommodating a substantial
increase in credit to the private sector in real terms. The staff cautioned that the sharp decline in
interest rates—which brought real yields on treasury bills close to zero in December 2003—
was unlikely to be sustainable, given the government’s continued financing needs, and it urged
the authorities to keep the stance of monetary policy under careful review. The BoZ indicated
that it stood ready to tighten monetary policy, including reversing the recent reduction in
reserve requirements, if necessary. The flexible exchange rate regime will remain in place, with
interventions by the BoZ aimed primarily at smoothing out short-term fluctuations in the
market, and in meeting the program’s gross international reserve target.
39.
Copper exports are projected to grow strongly in 2004. However, as a result of large
imports for investment in the sector, the external current account deficit is projected to widen
slightly to 6.1 percent of GDP. Program loans and grants are expected to remain low, at
1.6 percent of GDP, and the gross international reserves of the BoZ are expected to rise slightly
to 1.5 months of import cover by end-2004 (up from an estimated 1.3 months of imports in
2003), provided a PRGF arrangement is in place and the projected donor financing
materializes.
40.
Under the program, structural measures are aimed at strengthening budget
execution, and expenditures controls, and restructuring the insolvent public NBFIs (see
para. 31 above and Table 4 of the MEFP). The government is also proceeding with the
commercialization of the electricity utility company, ZESCO, in line with agreements reached
with the World Bank. The commercialization has progressed satisfactorily, with the agreed
“entry point” conditions for the commercialization strategy met by end-December 2003. The
authorities intend to request a revision of the HIPC Initiative completion point trigger relating
to the privatization of ZESCO, to be replaced by the completion of measures specified as
benchmarks to reach the interim phase of the commercialization (MEFP, para. 38).
Program monitoring
41.
The implementation of the SMP will be monitored under monthly targets and
benchmarks (Tables 3 and 4 of the MEFP). The staff considers that this close monitoring is
required in view of the slippages during 2003. In addition, good performance against monthly
targets may enable more rapid progress to a successor arrangement. To further strengthen
program monitoring, the government has revived the Interministerial Economic Monitoring
Committee, which will now be chaired by the President. The Fund’s Resident Representative

- 24 -

will also be invited to attend the meetings of the technical group that will advise the
interministerial committee.
Risks to program implementation
42.
Developments during the last year have highlighted the risks posed by
unanticipated spending decisions. It is therefore essential that greater program ownership,
developed through extensive discussions in the cabinet on the policy framework for 2004, be
supported by rigorous spending controls. Holding the line on wages also poses a key challenge.
By reopening discussions on government employees’ remuneration in 2003, the authorities
demonstrated their resolve to address this issue squarely. The authorities’ strong advocacy of
the need for wage restraint, and for changes in the income tax code that benefit the majority of
government employees, is also supportive of progress in this area. However, the government’s
strong stance has resulted in strikes by civil servants.
43.
The economy remains vulnerable to climate and terms of trade shocks. However,
the crop early warning system does not point to losses of macroeconomic significance in 2004,
despite below-average initial rains in parts of the country. At the same time, copper prices have
remained above the average levels assumed in the program.
44.
The reserve position of the BoZ may come under pressure as a result of large
financing needs in 2004. Although reserves of US$196 million at end-2003 were equal to
1.3 months of import cover, they are low in relation to forthcoming debt-service payments,
including large obligations (SDR 85 million) due to the Fund in June. The proximity of these
payments underscores the importance of strong performance under the SMP to allow an early
transition to a new PRGF arrangement.
C. Technical Assistance (TA) and Statistical Issues
45.
Zambia has received significant Fund technical assistance in areas such as tax
policy and administration, PEM reforms, and banking and financial sector reforms, as
well as in strengthening the capacity of the BoZ. The implementation of PEM reforms has
not had the desired results, owing to continued extrabudgetary expenditures and the
circumvention of budget procedures (paras. 29 and 31 of MEFP). In 2002-03, TA in the foreign
exchange market resulted in the introduction of an interbank foreign exchange market in July
2003. The joint Bank-Fund Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) of 2002 identified
key financial sector challenges, which are being addressed through tailored Monetary and
Financial System Department (MFD) TA including the preparation of the FSDP, the
restructuring of the NBFIs, payments system reforms, and anti-money-laundering legislation.
The authorities reaffirmed their interest in a data Report on Observance of Standards and
Codes (ROSC) mission in April 2004, which could provide a good diagnosis for further TA to
improve the statistical systems in the Ministry of Finance, the Central Statistics Office, and the
BoZ. In particular, the authorities agreed that TA was urgently needed to improve the quality
and timeliness of national accounts data.

- 25 -

D. Issues Under Fund Jurisdiction
46.
Zambia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the
Articles of Agreement. Zambia maintains an exchange restriction arising from the external
payments arrears accumulated prior to October 1985, which is subject to Fund approval.9 The
introduction of a broad-based interbank foreign exchange market in July 2003 has eliminated
the previous multiple currency practice arising from the spreads between the dealing window
and interbank rates.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
47.
The staff concurs with the conclusions of the ex post assessment of Zambia’s
performance. A further PRGF arrangement is needed to assist Zambia in addressing
challenges in the Fund’s core areas of responsibility. The experience from these ESAF/PRGF
arrangements also points to the need for fiscal policy to bear a greater burden of adjustment to
facilitate a sustainable reduction in real interest rates and support private domestic investment.
Development and implementation of public sector reforms to support tight control of the wage
bill and improvements in PEM will be crucial to fiscal consolidation and a reorientation of
spending to poverty reduction. It is also essential to strengthen budgetary processes to improve
governance. Completion of the privatization program is essential to improve economic
efficiency and protect the budget. Accelerating growth will also require removal of obstacles to
private sector development. Financial sector reforms should follow through on the conclusions
of the FSAP, including resolving government-owned nonbank financial institutions and
improving rural banking services. Avoidance of ad hoc spending decisions and strict
enforcement of budgetary procedures will be key tests of ownership. Public advocacy of the
chosen policy path will also be important in demonstrating ownership at the highest levels of
government. Monitoring of implementation needs to be strengthened through improved
coordination within government. A strong track record of implementation would allow Zambia
to reach the HIPC completion point and catalyze higher aid flows for progress towards the
MDGs.
48.
The recent and welcome improvement in Zambia’s main economic indicators has
continued. Zambia’s longest period of uninterrupted economic growth in over three decades
was extended to a fourth year in 2003, and inflation declined to its lowest level in over 20
years.
49.
However, over the last year, Zambia has benefited from some favorable exogenous
developments that have masked serious shortcomings in the implementation of
9

These arrears include both commercial arrears and arrears with respect to private individuals (see
EBD/02/76). Some of these arrears have already been cleared through a buy-back scheme. Regarding the
remaining debt, the government is verifying claims and negotiating the settlement of the arrears on
substantially the same terms as those for the buy-back scheme or on Paris Club terms.

- 26 -

macroeconomic policies. Real GDP growth of over 4 percent was bolstered by a rebound in
agricultural production from the effects of the drought in 2002. At the same time, while the
resulting easing of food price inflation also contributed to a decline in headline inflation,
nonfood consumer prices rose more rapidly than in 2002. In addition, a recovery in copper
prices in 2003 supported relative stability in the exchange rate and strengthened reserve
position at the BoZ. In contrast to these positive exogenous developments, 2003 saw a sharp
and unsustainable relaxation of fiscal policy, stemming mainly from policy decisions that
entailed expenditures well in excess of budgeted levels. These slippages in policy
implementation added to the sharp increase in domestic debt, both directly, as expenditures
entailed higher borrowing, and indirectly, as they precluded an early consideration of a new
PRGF arrangement that would have been a catalyst to greater external financing.
50.
The authorities’ budget proposal for 2004 is welcome as it seeks a sharp reduction
in domestic borrowing to avert an upward spiral in domestic debt and interest payments.
The focus of fiscal adjustment on expenditure restraint is appropriate. In this context, the staff
also welcomes the authorities’ intention to bring the wage bill down to 8 percent of GDP in
2004. In addition to its contribution to the overall fiscal adjustment, wage restraint is essential
to provide more room for priority expenditures. At the same time, successful implementation
of the budget will require tight control of other expenditures. On the revenue side, measures
included in the 2004 budget should help to broaden the tax base and improve the efficiency of
the VAT system while simplifying its administration. The budget proposal submitted to
parliament is in line with the understandings reached with the staff on the extended SMP.
51.
The steps taken by the authorities to improve budget discipline are encouraging.
The recent strengthening of the commitment control system must be supported by tight
enforcement of procedures, including sanctions against accounting officers responsible for any
overspending and the diversion of funds between budget subheads. However, steps to support
stronger public expenditure management must be accompanied by a firm political commitment
to avoid unbudgeted spending. In particular, it is essential that the Ministry of Finance and
National Planning receives full political backing for strict adherence to the budget, and that
there is no repeat of the ad hoc spending decisions in 2003. In this regard, the extensive
consultations within the government that culminated in cabinet approval of the budget and the
policies set out in the SMP, signal increased policy ownership.
52.
The recent development of a medium-term expenditure framework marks an
important step toward strengthening budget preparation and setting expenditure
priorities to meet goals established in the PRSP. In this regard, the intention to contain the
government wage bill over the medium term is appropriate. Development and implementation
of a medium-term strategy to “right size” government operations and complete the pay reform
will be essential to allow priority poverty-reducing expenditures to increase over the medium
term. The authorities should continue to work with the World Bank and bilateral donors on the
design of this public sector reform program.

- 27 -

53.
The flexible exchange rate regime has been an important element in sustaining the
export growth. Maintaining external competitiveness and export diversification will depend
on consolidating gains through the implementation of tight fiscal and monetary policies that
restrain domestic inflation pressures. Fiscal consolidation is, therefore, an urgent requirement
for achieving sustainable growth, strengthening external viability, and reducing poverty over
the medium term.
54.
The completion of the FSDP is a useful first step toward addressing the issues
identified in the 2002 FSSA. The authorities are, however, encouraged to prioritize the
challenges and ensure that urgent issues, such as the insolvency of the NBFIs, are addressed in
2004. Progress toward the sale of the ZNCB is warmly welcome.
55.
The authorities should continue to improve the environment for private sector
development and foreign investment. In this regard, the authorities are urged to give serious
consideration to private sector views of the reforms that are contemplated for the Investment
Act, labor legislation, and any eventual changes to land legislation. The staff also urges the
authorities to strengthen the land administration system and step up efforts to make more
traditional land available for commercial agriculture.
56.
Policies under the SMP, if implemented, are sufficient to help Zambia avoid an
unsustainable spiral of higher domestic debt and interest payments. Satisfactory
performance under the SMP in 2004 is crucial if Zambia is to move to a PRGF arrangement
and reach the HIPC Initiative completion point. Given the precarious levels of the BoZ’s
international reserves, there is little room for further lapses in policy implementation that might
undermine Zambia’s much needed track record, discourage donor flows, and worsen economic
conditions for the Zambia people. Notwithstanding notable progress, efforts will need to be
accelerated to ensure more satisfactory progress in meeting the HIPC Initiative completion
point triggers.
57.
Regarding the exchange restriction evidenced by the existence of external arrears, the
staff encourages the authorities to continue with their efforts to resolve the remaining arrears. It
is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the 12-month consultation cycle,
subject to the provisions of the decision on consultation cycles approved on July 15, 2002.

APPENDIX I
CONFIDENTIAL
Lusaka
March 16, 2004

Ms. Anne O. Krueger
The Acting Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C.
Dear Ms. Krueger,
The Government of Zambia requested the staff of the International Monetary Fund to monitor
implementation of the government’s program covering the second half of 2003. As described
in the attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies, the initial implementation of
this program fell short of expectations as a result of a significant overrun in nonwage
expenditures, which has added to the recent sharp rise in domestic borrowing. Moreover, the
Government recognizes that some of the program’s end-year targets can no longer be attained.
Therefore, to enable us to develop a track record of performance that would allow us to move
to a PRGF arrangement, the Government requests that the period of the staff-monitored
program (SMP) be extended through end-June 2004. We consider the policies set out in the
attached memorandum for this period, which were endorsed by Cabinet in February 2004, to be
sufficient to safeguard macroeconomic stability through a sharp reduction in domestic
borrowing, supported by strong initial reforms of the tax system and government expenditures.
At the same time, the SMP will continue the implementation of the reform agenda established
in the PRSP.
We hope that, with sound implementation of this SMP, and passage of the budget for 2004, we
will be in a position to request a new PRGF arrangement in the first half of 2004. Successful
implementation of policies supported by a new PRGF arrangement will be essential to allow
Zambia to reach the completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative during 2004. Not
only will this be a key to reducing Zambia’s external debt to sustainable levels, it will be
crucial to reduce debt-service payments in 2004 and 2005 to manageable levels.
Yours faithfully,
/s/
Hon. Ng'andu Peter Magande, MP
Minister of Finance and National Planning

ZAMBIA
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
For the Period December 2003 Through June 2004
I. Performance Under the SMP And Recent Economic Developments
A. Performance Under the SMP, July-December 2003
1.
The SMP went off track as a result of significant expenditure overruns in
September and October, which resulted in net domestic financing exceeding the
cumulative adjusted program ceiling by about 1.7 percent of GDP in December (Table 1).
The programmed payment of domestic arrears was also not observed, and the continuous
prohibition against the accumulation of external arrears was breached. In addition, the target
was not met on the cumulative deposits into the HIPC Initiative account was not met. The
targets that were met included the net domestic assets (NDA) of the Bank of Zambia (BoZ);
gross international reserves (GIR); the ceilings on external debt, including for the Zambia
Electricity Supply Corporation (ZESCO); and the cumulative wage bill. However, arrears were
accumulated on the housing allowance whose cancellation was challenged in court by civil
service unions.
2.
Progress in implementing structural reforms was mixed (Table 2). The
strengthened commitment control system, which has been implemented in most ministries,
helped to limit the accumulation of arrears to just 0.1 percent of GDP in the second quarter,
and the Government has continued to issue quarterly expenditure ceilings. However, cash
releases did not conform to these ceilings, because expenditure policy decisions led to the
execution of unbudgeted expenditures. Enforcement of the sanctions against over-commitment
and virement of funds between budget subheads has been inadequate, despite the improved
timeliness of the Monthly Expenditure Reports (MERs). At the same time, the government’s
commitment to refrain from paying any amounts for which it is not legally liable was not
observed, because the Government found it necessary to take on liabilities of mine workers in
Luanshya (see paragraph 6). Although a comprehensive database of domestic arrears was
completed in June, and only the Office of the Accountant General (OAG) has initiated
settlement of such arrears, the preparation of a multiyear plan for clearing domestic arrears has
been delayed to 2004.
3.
Progress has been made in containing the wage bill, but structural measures in
this area have yet to be implemented. Between April and November 2003, a total of 2,498
employees in the central administration were retrenched and, by the end of the year, this total
was expected to reach 3,500. In line with agreements reached with some trade unions, a
circular was issued in September 2003 to reduce the rates of housing allowances payable in
2003.

4.
The development of a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) for the
2004-06 period and the publication of the Green Paper, discussed with stakeholders and local
communities, has been a major step in improving budget preparation. The MTEF consultations
that have taken place with politicians, Sector Advisory Groups, the Provincial Development
Coordinating Committees, and other stakeholders have enriched the budgeting process and
should strengthen stakeholders’ ownership of the budget. Government will continue to consult
these stakeholders in the process of implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of the MTEF.
A draft of a financial sector development plan (FSDP) has been posted on the BoZ website for
further comments. At the same time, the Government has refrained from providing further
budgetary support to nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs), pending finalization of the FSDP.
B. Recent Economic Developments
5.
Real GDP growth is estimated at 4.2 percent in 2003, not 4.5 percent envisaged
earlier, owing to a lower than anticipated growth in mining. The 12-month inflation rate of
17.2 percent at end-December was above the target of 13 percent in the SMP, reflecting some
relaxation of financial policies and some firming of food prices. Zambia’s external position
through end-December was bolstered by higher copper prices and continued growth in
nontraditional exports, which aided the BoZ in meeting the international reserves target.
Fiscal policy
6.
Although revenue was in line with the program, the fiscal deficit for 2003 was
about 1.4 percent of GDP larger than programmed as a result of higher expenditures.
This overrun was concentrated in nonwage current and capital spending including recurrent
departmental charges (RDCs). The overrun in RDCs included security-related spending,
expenditures on travel, workshops for staff, by-elections, and higher spending on fertilizer
price support. These excesses were partially offset by lower than programmed HIPC-financed
expenditures, and by lower external debt-service payments. Additional expenditure overruns
resulted from unbudgeted payments of K 167 billion (0.8 percent of GDP) to the Luanshya
mine workers of the Roan Antelope Mining Company of Zambia (RAMCOZ) to meet
accumulated wage arrears and retrenchment benefits, to facilitate the sale of the mine to a
strategic investor in December. These payments were expected to yield K 20 billion in income
tax withholding; K 10 billion in 2003, with the balance collected in 2004. Nevertheless, the
overall cash deficit for 2003 is now estimated at 6.6 percent of GDP, thus exceeding the
programmed deficit target by about 1.4 percent of GDP. As a result, by end-December net
domestic financing exceeded the program target (adjusted for the shortfall in external debt
service) by K 354 billion (1.7 percent of GDP).
Monetary policy
7.
Broad money increased by 23.4 percent during 2003, compared with a target of
17 percent in the SMP. The larger than expected growth in broad money was largely
because of the widening fiscal deficit, an easing of monetary policy in late October, when the

- 39 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

BoZ lowered the cash legal reserve requirements from 17.5 percent to 14 percent and a larger
than expected buildup of net foreign assets in the banking system. The lowering of the reserve
requirement was intended to provide banks with additional liquidity for lending to the
agricultural sector. Bank credit to the private sector rose by 31 percent in 2003, with the
increase spread over a wide range of sectors including agriculture, manufacturing, transport,
and communication.
8.
After depreciating by about 12 percent in the first quarter of 2003, the kwacha
strengthened against the U.S. dollar throughout the rest of the year, reducing the
depreciation for the year to 7 percent. However, against the South African rand and the euro,
the kwacha depreciated by 29 percent and 19 percent, respectively, through end- December.
The introduction of the broad-based interbank foreign exchange market in July 2003 helped to
strengthen confidence in the kwacha and was immediately followed by a significant
appreciation of the currency. The interest rate on the 91-day treasury bill remained within a
narrow band of 32-35 percent throughout most of the year, but declined to below 20 percent in
mid-December, mainly as a result of excess bank liquidity, following the lowering of the cash
legal reserve requirements.
External sector
9.
Boosted by a 17 percent increase in copper prices since the beginning of 2003, and
further strong growth in nontraditional exports, the overall balance of payments position
through end-September 2003 was better than expected. Total exports grew by 17 percent
for the first nine months compared with the same period in 2002, while total imports grew by
about 11 percent. Thus, the BoZ was able to meet the adjusted end-December reserve target
under the SMP by a margin of US$46 million through foreign exchange purchases from the
market without putting undue pressure on the exchange rate. The current account and overall
balance of payments are expected to record smaller deficits in 2003 than in 2002 and projected
under the SMP for 2003.
II. The Revised Macroeconomic Framework for 2004
10.
Following the large expenditure overrun and heavy recourse to domestic
borrowing in 2003, a sharp fiscal adjustment is urgently needed in 2004 to address a
growing threat to fiscal sustainability. Moreover, the Government recognized that the
framework for the 2004 budget presented in the Green Paper for the MTEF needed to be
revised. As a result of the increase in the stock of domestic debt in 2003 and higher interest
rates, domestic debt service was expected to be about 1½ percent of GDP higher than projected
in the Green Paper, at 3.7 percent of GDP. At the same time, Government recognizes that
slippages in implementing the SMP may delay a move to a PRGF, raising uncertainty about the
level of external financing available for the 2004 budget.
11.
Government has therefore reformulated the macroeconomic framework for 2004.
The revised framework is designed to break the spiral of rising domestic debt and interest

- 40 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

payments that poses a major risk to macroeconomic stability and growth. In addition, the
Government is determined that, through frontloaded reforms, it will set the stage for a
sustainable fiscal adjustment and an early return to a PRGF arrangement. To this end, the 2004
budget presented to parliament in February 2004, is based on cautious assumptions for external
budget support to mitigate the destabilizing costs of recourse to domestic borrowing should
such external financing fail to materialize.
12.
The revised macroeconomic framework for 2004 envisages (i) real GDP growth of
3.5 percent compared with 4.5 percent previously, (ii) a 12-month inflation rate of not more
than 20 percent (instead of 13 percent); (iii) a build-up in GIR to about 1.5 months of import
cover compared with 1.7 months previously. We recognize that achieving these objectives will
require a more resolute adherence to the agreed fiscal and monetary framework, as well as the
implementation of key structural reforms in public expenditure management, financial sector
reforms and governance.
Fiscal policy
13.
Fiscal policy will be geared to preserving macroeconomic stability, by containing
domestic borrowing to reduce pressures on interest rates, prices and the exchange rate.
On the basis of a passive projection drawn from the fiscal framework presented in the Green
Paper, and with domestic financing reduced to 2 percent of GDP from 5.1 percent of GDP in
2003, there was a financing gap in the 2004 budget of over 2 percent of GDP (about
K 500 billion). This reflected the impact of both higher interest payments and a projected
shortfall in external budgetary support. The Government recognized that, in the absence of
strong adjustment to cover the gap, use of further domestic financing would have led to a
destabilizing spiral of higher debt and interest payments, and a sharp reduction in expenditures
on all sectors, including poverty-reducing programs. Therefore, the Government is determined
to take far reaching expenditure and revenue measures to ensure that the program’s
macroeconomic targets are achieved.
14.
The wage bill will be reduced by 0.5 percent of GDP from the expected 2003
outturn. The nominal wage bill will be constrained by allowing only for a K 40 billion
increase for the police, immigration and prison service personnel, who did not receive a raise in
the last wage round, an allocation of K 38 billion to cover promotion increases or wage creep,
and K 7.2 billion per month for the housing allowance. Aside from these changes, there will be
no nominal increase in wages and the total headcount will not exceed the end-October 2003
level for the core civil service. As a result, the wage bill is expected to decline to 8.0 percent of
GDP. The Government has begun to negotiate on this basis. With a view to implementing an
orderly process of wage negotiations, the envelope available to cover wage increases has been
announced and the Public Service Management Division (PSMD) has created a single team to
negotiate with all unions, and no wage agreements will be concluded until these have been
fully costed by the Ministry of Finance and National Planning (MoFNP) and their implications
set out in a report to Cabinet. The Government will expand the campaign to remove ghost
workers to noncore civil service areas, including teachers and health workers. The Government

- 41 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

has already withdrawn and revised most of the circulars indicated in the Annex I to this letter,
and expects to complete the process shortly.
15.
Allocations on Ordinary RDCs have been reduced by 0.5 percent of GDP from the 2003
outturn of 2.8 percent of GDP. Savings will be achieved through re-organization of operations
and aggressive cutting of discretionary spending. In this area, the Government recognizes that it
is essential to demonstrate to the public, including public service unions, that the burden of
adjustment is being shared. Thus, the Cabinet Office is preparing a plan for rationalizing
government structures in order to reduce costs and government is installing its own internal
telephone system to reduce the cost of telephone services with Zambia Telecommunication. In
addition to strict enforcement of regulations on breaches of expenditure control (see below
under public expenditure management) official travel and other discretionary spending will be
reduced. The Government envisages these actions to be a precursor to the launch of a wideranging program of civil service reform which is now being discussed with civil society and the
donor community, including the World Bank.
16.
Despite this fiscal restraint, Government is committed to increase priority povertyreducing expenditures financed with HIPC debt relief from 1 percent of GDP in 2003 to
2.1 percent of GDP in 2004. The Government will continue to make monthly payments into
account 49 at the BoZ to cover these expenditures. However, the balances of line ministries’
accounts in commercial banks for these expenditures will be monitored closely and funds will
be disbursed to these accounts from account 49 only when existing balances are expected to be
exhausted during the month. At the same time, execution of some nonpriority domestic capital
projects will be rephased, so as to remain within the budget envelope without incurring arrears.
17.
The budget submitted to parliament proposes that revenues in 2004 will be
bolstered by reforms that focus on broadening the tax base and further improving the
efficiency of the system. The original structure, coverage and efficiency of the VAT will be
restored by exempting most nonexport goods that are currently zero-rated. This measure, which
took effect on February 7, 2004, is expected to yield K 95 billion or 0.4 percent of GDP.
Increased compliance with the VAT has been facilitated by doubling the turnover threshold for
the VAT to K 200 million; at the same time, cancellation of voluntary registration below this
threshold should result in savings of K 26.3 billion from VAT refunds. A 3 percent turnover
tax, to be introduced by April 1, 2004, replaces income tax and VAT for companies below the
VAT threshold, and should yield K 7.3 billion. In addition, the personal income tax has been
reformed to alleviate poverty and provide additional resources to the budget. The reform,
effective April 1, 2004, increases the threshold for exempting annual income to K 3.1 million
(from less than K 2 million) and adds two income brackets (at tax rates of 35 and 40 percent)
above the current top rate of 30 percent. These measures should yield K 23.8 billion; a
10 percent excise duty on cell phone airtime, introduced on February 7, 2004, should provide
K 15.6 billion; and the removal of the preferential corporate tax rate for companies listed on
the Lusaka Stock Exchange should yield K 17.4 billion. In combination, the tax policy
measures are expected to raise revenues by 0.7 percent of GDP. Measures on nontax revenues
(increase of fees and penalties) and exceptional revenues (reduction of subsidy on sales of

- 42 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

fertilizer) should generate additional resources of 0.4 percent of GDP. Consequently, total
revenue collection should reach 19 percent of GDP in 2004. Total grants are estimated at
6.0 percent of GDP and include program grants carried over from 2003 and the first
disbursement under a new program from the European Union that would be contingent on
approval of a new PRGF.
18.
The Government will, in 2004, complete a review of the potential adverse impact
of the Export Processing Zone Act on the revenue base and particularly in the area of
direct taxation. The review will be completed in time for its conclusions to be addressed, if
necessary, in the 2005 budget.
19.
The Government is looking into the issue of tax and other incentives for investors,
with the aim of developing a consistent and general policy for the granting of tax
incentives to avoid ad hoc interventions. The Government intends to complete this exercise,
in conjunction with the review of the EPZ Act, and put in place a new policy in this area in
time for the preparation of the budget for 2005. In the meantime, the Government will consider
only limited exceptions to the current policy of not granting any new tax reduction,
exemptions, rebates or preferential treatment. Such tax incentives would be granted only in the
case of new “green field” investments, or for the operation of the Luanshya mine or KCM
following their sales to new investors. Moreover, the revenue implications of any such
incentives would be assessed and offsetting measures taken to protect revenues.
20.
The domestic primary balance is projected to move from a deficit of 0.7 percent of
GDP in 2003 to a surplus of 2.4 percent in 2004 and the overall deficit after grants would
similarly narrow to 4.0 percent of GDP. Net external financing, including small amounts
carried over from 2003 and the first tranche of US$20 million under a new IDA structural
adjustment operation, would amount to 2.0 percent of GDP. Recourse to domestic financing
would therefore be limited to 2 percent of GDP, down from 5.1 percent of GDP in 2003.
Monetary and exchange rate policies
21.
Monetary policy in 2004 will aim to achieve the program’s inflation target while
safeguarding the international reserve position. In line with these objectives, and taking into
account a monetary overhang in the third quarter of 2003, the expansion of broad money will
be limited to about 18 percent through BoZ’s use of indirect monetary instruments. The
proposed monetary framework provides sufficient room for a significant real increase in credit
to the private sector in support of the program’s growth objective, and is consistent with the
fiscal framework. The BoZ will monitor monetary developments very closely and stands ready
to take appropriate action, including, if necessary, raising the legal reserve requirement. The
BoZ will continue to explore appropriate market-based avenues for increasing access to
domestic credit by farmers and other small-scale enterprises.
22.
The Government continues to be concerned by the high level of commercial bank
lending rates and their negative impact on private sector economic activities and on the

- 43 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

prospects for diversification. The Government recognizes that in order to lower interest rates
on a sustainable basis, domestic borrowing requirements need to be sharply curtailed with a
view to providing credibility for the disinflation process. In addition, improving the efficiency
of the banking sector, including the sale of 49 percent of the shares of the Zambia National
Commercial Bank (ZNCB) to a strategic investor, should strengthen the overall banking
system, promote competition, and contribute to a further easing of pressures on interest rates.
In this context, the BoZ intends to continue to adhere to the treasury bill auction guidelines to
ensure that interest rates reflect market conditions. The BoZ is continuing to review measures,
including the current volume and price penalties for rediscounting treasury bills, to facilitate
banks’ liquidity management and reduce banks’ intermediation costs.
23.
The exchange rate will continue to be market determined with BoZ intervention in
the interbank foreign exchange market aimed at smoothing short-term fluctuations and
meeting the program’s gross international reserves target, without putting undue
pressure on the functioning of the interbank foreign exchange market. Given that the
exchange rate is freely determined, that Zambia has an open trade and exchange regime, and
that nontraditional exports have been growing at a rapid pace, the Government is of the view
that the current level of the real exchange rate is broadly appropriate for promoting
diversification and protecting Zambia’s external competitiveness.
External sector policies
24.
Zambia’s external prospects are expected to improve further in 2004 due to strong
gains in both nonmining and mining exports. Copper receipts are projected to rise about
20 percent because of stronger prices and increased production, while nonmining exports
would increase by over 12 percent. Prospects in the copper sector could be bolstered by the sale
of a majority stake in Konkola Copper Mines to a strategic equity partner. These export gains
are expected to be offset by stronger imports, mostly because of large capital expenditures in
the mining sector, including expenditures on the new Kansanshi copper mine due to start
operations in 2005. As a result, the current account deficit (including grants and debt relief on
interest payments) is projected to increase to 6.4 percent of GDP from 5.9 percent in 2003.
25.
External program assistance in 2004, projected at US$70 million, is expected to
come from the World Bank, the EU, and the AfDB, and mostly in the second half of the
year, once a new PRGF arrangement is in place. Following the expiration of the last Paris
Club rescheduling agreement, the Government has contacted the Paris Club requesting
forbearance and to allow payments to continue under the same terms until a new PRGF
arrangement is in place. The Government intends to reach the completion point under the HIPC
Initiative by the end of 2004. The Government is mindful of the need to ensure adequate
international gross reserves, which are projected to increase from US$196 million at end-2003
to US$239 million (1.5 months of imports) by end-2004. As a result, the financing gap in 2004
is projected to be about US$182 million. This could be filled by additional donor program
support as well as by support under a PRGF arrangement.

- 44 -

APPENDIX I

III. Structural Reforms, Public Expenditure Management, and Governance
26.
The Government is committed to implementing financial sector reforms,
strengthening public expenditure management, and improving the transparency of its
operations. With regard to the financial sector, negotiations for the sale of the ZNCB are at an
advanced stage and the Government hopes to conclude the sale and to effect the handover
during the first half of 2004. The costs of retrenchment will be paid out of the gross sales
proceeds. As earlier envisaged, no interest on the bond to recapitalize ZNCB will be paid
before the sale is concluded.
27.
Although a draft of the FSDP was completed in December 2003, some further
work is needed to draw up operational plans. Developing strategies to address insolvent
NBFIs is a priority of the FSDP. In line with the draft FSDP, the BoZ has set a deadline of endMarch 2004 for the Zambia National Building Society and the National Savings and Credit
Bank to reach agreements with the BoZ on time-bound and credible restructuring programs to
be monitored against quarterly targets (Table 4). No public monies will be used to recapitalize
or restructure these two entities before an appropriate FSDP is completed and agreements have
been reached in restructuring plans. Should the proposed restructurings not be considered
feasible by the BoZ, appropriate supervisory action will be taken. The Government has made
an allowance in the 2004 budget for the expected minimum costs of resolving these
institutions. Restrictions have been placed on the Development Bank of Zambia, pending
private sector contribution of 60 percent of its capital base. No public money will be used to
recapitalize the bank.
28.
As a key part of the FSDP, the BoZ has drafted regulations for the microfinance
sector. Smaller microfinance institutions would be subject to nonprudential supervision, with
the onus put on transparency to strengthen the governance of the sector. These regulations will
take effect in 2004 and will facilitate the development of private microfinance institutions
using banking services provided by a network of rural branches to enhance the delivery of rural
financial services and support growth in the agriculture sector.
29.
The Government recognizes the need to reinforce the budget’s role in the
definition and execution of spending policy. This is essential to support both public
expenditure management and good governance. The Government will therefore avoid policy
decisions that would entail expenditures in addition to budget allocations. Unforeseen
expenditure requirements will be funded only to the limits of the contingency resources
indicated in the budget or only after cabinet has approved any changes by making adjustments
elsewhere in the budget.
30.
To strengthen cash management, the Budget Office is issuing quarterly and
monthly expenditure ceilings which will be revised monthly on the basis of updated
projections of revenue, expenditure, and financing constraints. Monthly ceilings will be
backed by corresponding cash releases, so as to provide Controlling Officers in line ministries,
departments, and provinces with reliable limits for commitments.

- 45 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

31.
The MoFNP will strictly enforce sanctions for noncompliance with established
spending procedures. Specifically, on the basis of monthly reports prepared by the OAG, the
Budget Department will reduce disbursements to line ministries, departments, and provinces
responsible for over-commitment, virement of funds, and expenditures lacking ex-ante written
authorization by the MoFNP, as well as failure to report expenditures, as specified in the
circulars issued in September 2002. The existing penalties will also be rigorously applied on
accounting officers responsible for such unauthorized spending.
32.
The Government has introduced activity-based budgeting (ABB) for the
preparation, implementation, and reporting starting with the 2004 budget. The 2004
budget also includes an annex identifying all poverty-reducing spending allocations. Line
ministries, departments, and provinces will report on the execution of spending identified in
this annex through a form attached to MERs. The OAG will transfer these forms, on a monthly
basis, to the Department of Planning, so as to improve cash management in funding povertyreducing programs and contribute to the implementation of the PRSP.
33.
Comprehensive quarterly budget execution reports, including full coverage of
poverty reducing spending will be published within 45 days of the end of the quarter,
beginning with the report for the first quarter of 2004.
34.
The MoFNP will finalize by March 2004 a multi-year plan for clearing the stock of
domestic arrears as at end-December 2002. The plan will prioritize arrears payments by the
penalty accruing, the interest rate applied, and exchange rate affecting overdue payments. On
the basis of the plan, an inter-ministerial committee, chaired by a MoFNP senior officer, will
negotiate with contractors discounts on the payments due. Within the quarterly expenditure
ceilings issued by the Budget Department, the OAG will have the exclusive responsibility to
settle the discounted amounts due.
35.
The Government remains fully committed to implementing an IFMIS, a key
condition for expenditure control and monitoring. Progress has been made toward
implementing the IFMIS, although the procurement of hardware and software, which had been
expected to be completed by end-December 2003, is now expected in the second quarter of
2004 because of delays arising from the World Bank’s procurement procedures. The MoFNP
revised the timeframe for introducing the system and is expected to sign a contract for the
procurement of hardware and software by end-April 2004 and start piloting the IFMIS in three
line ministries shortly thereafter.
36.
The Government will strengthen the independence of the Office of the Auditor
General. By end-June 2004, the Government intends to submit to Parliament draft legislation
to grant autonomy to the Office of the Auditor General.
37.
The Government is committed to bringing forward the budget cycle so that
Parliament can approve the budget before the beginning of the fiscal year. However, since

- 46 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

this requires a constitutional amendment, the Government will present a proposal to this effect
to the Constitutional Review Commission (CRC).
38.
The Government is also proceeding with the reform of the electricity utility,
ZESCO. Following the review by Fund and World Bank staff, the commercialization of
ZESCO has reached the “entry point” and we intend to expedite implementation of the
measures needed to reach the interim point June 2004 and then embark on ZESCO’s
commercialization according to the agreed detailed framework. Following the signature of a
preliminary agreement to settle government’s and ZESCO’s cross-debts, the Controller of
Internal Audit will verify the extent of government indebtedness to ZESCO. The tax liability of
ZESCO, as assessed by ZRA, and subject to any revision by the Revenue Appeals Tribunal,
will be used to estimate the cross-debts between ZESCO and Government. This process will be
finalized before the settlement of any cross-debts between ZESCO and the Government. We
envisage requesting a revision to the trigger for the HIPC initiative completion point on
ZESCO’s privatization to incorporate the completion of measures specified at the end of the
interim phase of commercialization. Such measures could include the passage of the proposal
to amend the Electricity Act, as well as Cabinet approval of the Ministry of Energy and Water
Development’s proposals for separate legal acts for private and public partnership. As
previously agreed, to provide ZESCO some breathing space to build a track record of credit
worthiness, new concessional borrowing by ZESCO guaranteed by the Government will be
permitted, subject to cumulative limits of US$20 million to the end of 2004 and US$40 million
to June 2005. This limit would be subject to review, in consultation with Bank and Fund staff,
in the event that additional concessional resources are required.
39.
The Government remains committed to providing an enabling environment for
private sector growth and diversification and recognizes the need to review key land,
labor and investment regulations. To ensure greater access to land, there is need to improve
the framework for land administration by finalizing the national land policy with broad
stakeholder support. The Government is also seeking to revise labor legislation to reduce the
frequency of strike actions and to decrease the high statutory costs of providing permanent
employment. The Government will also firmly resist amendments that would require
employers to provide housing or housing allowances for workers and that prevent employers
from recruiting skilled foreign workers where such local skills are unavailable. The
Government also proposes to revise the Investment Act with a view to strengthening the
facilitatory role of the Zambia Investment Center.
IV. The PRSP Progress Report, HIPC Triggers, and the MTEF
40.
The Government recognizes that Zambia’s external debt overhang is a serious
obstacle to more rapid growth and sustainable poverty reduction. Zambia has made
substantial progress in implementing the measures for reaching the floating completion point
under the enhanced HIPC Initiative. Specifically, measures have been implemented in the areas
of: health and education; the privatization of ZNCB; agreement on the commercialization of
ZESCO; the preparation and implementation of the MTEF; the preparation of the PRSP

- 47 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

progress report; and the implementation of the IFMIS on a pilot basis (see above). The key
outstanding area is the maintenance of a stable macroeconomic environment as evidenced by a
satisfactory performance under a PRGF arrangement. Therefore, the Government is committed
to implementing the revised SMP so that it can serve as a bridge to a new PRGF which would
pave the way toward the HIPC Initiative completion point.
41.
Preparation of the Government’s first annual report on the implementation of the
PRSP has been completed and will be formally handed over to co-operating partners in
March 2004. The delay in its completion was partly due to the comprehensive consultative
process embarked upon and the need to incorporate a baseline of indicators against which
progress in the second annual report can be assessed. The PRSP progress report has been
prepared in tandem with the MTEF for 2004-2006. The priorities identified and the lessons
learnt as indicated in the progress report have significantly influenced the reprioritization of
Poverty Reduction Programs in the 2004 Budget and has ensured consistency with the
expenditure profile of the MTEF.
V. Program Monitoring
42.
Progress in implementing the SMP will be monitored monthly under the program,
based on the quantitative and structural measures indicated in Tables 3 and 4. These
targets are defined in the attached Technical Memorandum of Understanding. To allow
accurate monitoring of spending on the wage bill, the Government will implement all the
actions indicated in Annex I to this letter.
43.
The Government has revived the economic monitoring committee for Economic
Ministries to monitor implementation of the Economic Program. The committee is chaired
by President Mwanawasa, and meets once every two weeks. Further, the Government has
strengthened the existing Economic Management Monitoring Committee at the MoFNP to
ensure that this meets at least once a week and that steps are taken to avoid lapses in program
implementation. The Fund’s Resident Representative will be invited to attend meetings of the
Economic Management Monitoring Committee as required.

- 48 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

Annex I: Actions to control the wage bill and related payments
In order to ensure support implementation of the envisaged wage policy, the Government will
take the following steps
1.
The PSMD will withdraw the circulars PSMD/53/11/1 n. B.9 (June 26, 2002),
TS/7/2/20 SEC n. 2, n. 3, and n. 4 (April 16, 2003), and any other related circulars introducing
housing allowance.
2.
As soon as negotiations with unions are concluded, the PSMD will revise the circulars
PSMD/7/2/20 SEC. n. B.8 (April 16, 2003) and TS/7/2/20 SEC. n. B. 4 and n. B. 13 (April 16,
2003) in order to eliminate the voluntary Medical Scheme.
3.
In November 2003 the MoFNP issued an instruction introducing the tracking of all
payments related to housing assistance (housing allowance and housing rental) for civil service
employees. The tracking mechanism will allow reporting on all the payments related to housing
assistance executed in 2002 and from January to November 2003. The same instruction will
also allow tracking and classifying under PEs all the payments related to housing assistance
from November 2003 onwards.
4.
By end-December 2003, the MoFNP will set up a unit dedicated to monitoring and
reporting on a monthly basis all payments to civil service employees as specified in the
attached TMU (paragraph 23).
5.
By end-December 2003, the Government will also approve a requirement that the
Minister of Finance and National Planning should submit to the Cabinet an analysis of the
short and medium-term budget costs of any agreement with government employees before it is
finalized.

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT II

Zambia: Technical Memorandum of Understanding for
The Staff-Monitored Program (SMP)
I. Introduction
1.
This memorandum sets out the understandings between the Zambian authorities and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) regarding the definitions of the quantitative targets and the
structural reforms for the Staff Monitored Program, as well as the related reporting
requirements. The definitions are valid at the start of the program, but may need to be revisited
to ensure that the memorandum continues to reflect best understanding of the Zambian and
Fund staff to monitor the program.
II. Quantitative Targets: Definitions and Data Sources
A. Net Domestic Assets (NDA) of the Bank of Zambia (BoZ)
2.
NDA of the BoZ are defined as the monthly-average (based on daily data) of the reserve
money less net foreign assets calculated at end-December 2003 BoZ mid-exchange rates
(program exchange rate).1 Reserve money includes currency in circulation, required reserves on
kwacha deposits, required reserves on foreign currency deposits (at the program exchange rate),
positive current account balances of banks with the BoZ and deposits of non-central
government institutions. Net foreign assets of the BoZ are defined as gross international
reserves (defined below) plus any other foreign asset, including the US$25 million blocked
reserves at the former Meridien Bank, minus foreign liabilities (defined below). The kwacha
figures are derived from the U.S. dollar values using the program exchange rate of K 4,645 per
U.S. dollar.
3.
Foreign liabilities are defined as short-term (one year or less in original maturity)
foreign currency-denominated liabilities of the BoZ to nonresidents and outstanding use of
Fund credit.2
4.
The ceilings on NDA will be adjusted upward by the amount of the shortfall of balance
of payments support net of debt service as indicated in Table 3 of the Memorandum of
Economic and Financial Policies, up to a maximum of US$16 million for the period endDecember 2003 to end-June 2004. External disbursements that occur anytime during the month

1

Unless otherwise defined, program exchange rates for 2004 between the U.S. and other (nonkwacha) currencies, including the SDR, will be equal to the end-2003 rates. Any other assets
(e.g. gold) would be revalued at end-2003 market price.
2

The liability to Camdex will continue to be treated as a short-term foreign liability of the BoZ.

- 54 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT II

of the test date will be treated as if they were disbursed on the first day of the month.3 In the
event of excess balance of payments support net of debt service, the ceiling on NDA will be
adjusted downward by 100 percent of the additional excess support. However, if part of the
excess support is used to reduce treasury-bills or bonds held by commercial banks and the nonbank sector, then the programmed NDA will be adjusted upward by that amount.4 The kwacha
value of the cumulative shortfall/excess will be calculated at the program exchange rate.
5.
The ceiling on NDA will be adjusted downward/upward to reflect decreases/increases
in the legal reserve requirements. The adjustor will be calculated as the percent change in the
reserve requirement multiplied by the actual amount of reserves (kwacha and foreign currency
denominated) at the end of the previous calendar month.
6.
The ceiling on NDA will also be adjusted upwards by the full extent of payments made
in 2004 to settle wage arrears and retrenchment costs relating to Luanshya mine workers, for
which the Government assumed responsibility in 2003.
B. Net Domestic Financing (NDF)
7.
Net domestic financing (Appendix II, Table 1) is defined as the Central Government’s
net borrowing from the banking and nonbanking sectors. All government issued securities will
be recorded at cost (face value less discount). Net domestic financing will be defined as:
(a)
the net position of the Government with commercial banks, including:
(i) treasury bills; (ii) government bonds; (iii) loans and advances; less (iv) support to Meridien
Bank (MBZ); and less (v) Central Government deposits (defined to include account balances
under the authority of controlling officers); plus
(b)
BoZ holdings of: (i) treasury bills; (ii) government bonds; (iii) the Kwacha
bridge loan (overdraft facility); less (iv) the Government’s position at the BoZ; less (v) the
donor suspense account; plus (vi) the long-term non-transferable security issued against
Government’s total indebtedness to BoZ as at end-2002.
(c)

Nonbank holdings will include: treasury bills; and government bonds.

3

This implies that for purposes of monitoring the NDA, disbursements during the month of the
test date will not be subject to averaging and the targeted NDA will be adjusted to reflect the
full amount of the disbursement.

4

Upon the completion of the computerized domestic arrears database and the establishment of
an arrears settlement plan, this adjustor will also apply to the reduction of domestic arrears.

- 55 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT II

(d)
In the event of ZNCB’s privatization, the measurement of NDF will exclude the
government bond issued to ZNCB in 2002 in the amount of K 249 billion.
8.
The NDF ceiling will be adjusted upward by the amount of the shortfall in balance of
payments support net of debt service as indicated in Table 3 of the Memorandum of Economic
and Financial Policies, up to a maximum of US$16 million for the period end-December 2003
to end-June 2004. In the event of excess balance of payments support net of debt service, the
ceiling on NDF will be adjusted downward by 100 percent of the additional excess support.
The kwacha value of the cumulative shortfall/excess will be converted at the program exchange
rate. The ceiling on NDF will also be adjusted upwards by the full extent of payments made in
2004 to settle wage arrears and retrenchment costs relating to Luanshya mine workers, for
which the Government assumed responsibility in 2003.
9.
The data source for the above will be the “Net Domestic Financing “ Table produced by
the BoZ Economics Department, submitted on a weekly basis, and reconciled with the monthly
monetary survey.
C. Gross International Reserves of the BOZ
10.
Unless otherwise noted here, gross international reserves of the BoZ will be defined as
reserve assets of the Bank of Zambia (Appendix II, Table 2). Reserve assets are defined in the
IMF BOP manual (5th edition) and elaborated in the reserve template of the Fund’s special data
dissemination standards (SDDS). They exclude, for example, foreign assets not readily
available to or controlled by the monetary authorities, and foreign currency claims on Zambian
residents.
11.
Gross international reserves consist of (i) monetary gold; (ii) foreign currency in cash;
(iii) unencumbered foreign currency deposits at non-resident banks; (iv) foreign securities and
deposits; (v) SDR holdings and Zambia’s reserve position with the Fund; and (vi) balances in
the BIS account related to debt service to Paris Club creditors. Gross reserves will exclude nonconvertible currencies, pledged, swapped, or any encumbered reserve assets including but not
limited to reserve assets used as collateral or guarantees for third party external liabilities,
commercial banks reserve requirements in foreign currency, and will exclude the
US$25 million deposit in Meridien Bank which is under liquidation.
12.
The floor on gross international reserves will be adjusted: (i) downward by the amount
in U.S. dollars of the shortfall in balance of payments support net of debt service as indicated in
Table 3 of the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies, up to a maximum of
US$16 million for the period end-December 2003 to end-June 2004; (ii) upward by
100 percent of the cumulative excess balance of payments support net of debt service.
However, if part of the excess support is used to reduce treasury bills or bonds held by
commercial banks or the nonbank sector, then the programmed reserves buildup will be

- 56 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT II

adjusted downward by that amount;5 (iii) downward/upward for any shortfall/excess in the U.S.
dollar value of disbursements from the IMF under the PRGF arrangement; and (iv) downward
for any increase in BoZ short-term foreign currency denominated debt (to resident and
nonresidents), using the definition of short-term debt below.
13.
For the purpose of this target, as well as those for external debt and arrears, valuation
will be in U.S. dollars using the program exchange rate.
14.
Data on gross international reserves including its components will be reported by the
BoZ on a weekly and end-month basis.
D. Official Medium- and Long-Term Concessional External Debt
15.
This is defined as all forms of official debt with original maturity of more than one year
contracted or guaranteed by the central Government and BoZ having a grant element of more
than 40 percent, but excludes debts subject to rescheduling. The grant element is to be
calculated by using currency-specific commercial interest reference rates (CIRRs) reported by
the OECD; for maturities of less than 15 years, the grant element will be calculated based on
six-month averages of CIRRs, and for maturities longer than 15 years, the grant element will be
calculated based on 10-year averages. Adjustment lending from the IMF will be excluded.
16.
This target applies not only to debt as defined in Point 9 of the Guidelines on
Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt (Decision No. 12274-(00/85) August 24,
2000) (see Annex), but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not
been received.
17.
Detailed data on all new concessional and non-concessional debt contracted or
guaranteed will be provided by MoFNP on a monthly basis.
E. Official External Short-Term Nonconcessional External Debt
18.
This is defined as the outstanding stock of external debt with original maturity of less
than one year owed or guaranteed by the central Government or the BoZ. For this purpose
short-term debt will include forward commodity sales but will exclude normal trade credit for
imports. There will be no new official external short-term debt during the program period. The
term “debt” has the meaning set forth in point No. 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria
with Respect to Foreign Debt (Decision No. 12274-(00/85) August 24, 2000).
19.

5

The data will be reported by the MoFNP and BoZ on a monthly basis.

Upon the completion of the computerized domestic arrears database and the establishment of
an arrears settlement plan, this adjustor will also apply to the reduction of domestic arrears.

ATTACHMENT II

F. Collateralizing/Guaranteeing of Loans to ZESCO
20.
The Government and the Bank of Zambia shall not extend or guarantee any new
commercial debts to ZESCO, including in the form of loans, suppliers credits and leases. New
concessional borrowing, as defined above (Paragraph 16), will be subject to a cumulative limit
of US$20 million in 2004. The limit on new concessional borrowing will be subject to review,
in consultation with Fund and World Bank staff, in the event that additional concessional
resources are required.
G. Domestic Arrears of Government
21.
Domestic arrears are defined as: (i) any bill that has been received by a spending
Ministry from a supplier for goods and services delivered (and verified) and for which payment
has not been made within 30 days after the due date of payments; (ii) Wage, salary and any
payment to government employees, including any direct or indirect scheme of housing
assistance, that were due to be paid in a given month but remained unpaid on the 15th of the
following month; and (iii) interest or principal obligations which remain unpaid 30 days after
the due date of payment. This definition of domestic arrears excludes changes in the stock on
account of interest, penalties and valuation changes.
22.
The information is to be compiled through audits of the accounts of spending Ministries
and agencies, conducted by the Internal Audit division of the MoFNP. The audits will be
completed and data submitted to Fund staff by the Accountant General within 6 weeks of the
end of each quarter.
H. The Central Government’s Wage Bill
23.
For the purposes of the wage bill, the definition of Central Government includes all
heads covered in the 2004 Yellow Book. The Central Government’s total wage bill will include
payments on wages, salaries, allowances, and all other items specified as personal emoluments
in the Yellow Book, and any direct or indirect payments of housing assistance to employees
(Appendix II, Table 3). The Government will provide, on a monthly basis and by budget head,
the following data: (i) the number of all employees in the Central Government for each budget
head; (ii) the basic salary, the allowances and any other personal emoluments released during
the month; (iii) the arrears incurred during the month on the basic salary, on the allowances,
and on any other personal emoluments; (iv) the number of employees retrenched and the
corresponding retrenchment costs; and (v) the number of ghost workers removed from the
payroll and the corresponding monthly savings on the wage bill.
24.
All the data will be submitted to the Fund staff by the MoFNP within three weeks of the
end of each month.

contained in the database of audited domestic arrears as at end-December 2002, the plan will
prioritize arrears payments by the penalty accruing, the interest rate applied, and exchange rate
affecting overdue payments. On the basis of the plan, an inter-ministerial committee, chaired
by a MoFNP senior officer, will negotiate with contractors discounts on the payments due.
Within the quarterly expenditure ceilings issued by the Budget Office, the Office of the
Accountant General will have the exclusive responsibility to settle the discounted amounts due.
Line ministries, Departments, and Provinces will not settle any arrears.
Government Liabilities
27.
The Government will refrain from making payments for which it is not legally liable,
including ZNOC liabilities on liquidation. It will also guide the liquidation process of public

ATTACHMENT II

ANNEX
Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt
Excerpt from Executive Board Decision No. 6230-(79/140), as revised on August 24, 2000
9.
(a)
For the purpose of this guideline, the term “debt” will be understood to
mean a current, i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual arrangement through
the provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which requires
the obligor to make one or more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or
services, at some future point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or
interest liabilities incurred under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary
ones being as follows:
(i)
loans, i.e., advances of money to the obligor by the lender made
on the basis of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the
future (including deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans and
buyers’ credits) and temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to
fully collateralized loans under which the obligor is required to repay the
funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the
buyer in the future (such as repurchase agreements and official swap
arrangements);
(ii)
suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the
obligor to defer payments until some time after the date on which the
goods are delivered or services are provided; and
(iii) leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which
the lessee has the right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time
that are usually shorter than the total expected service life of the
property, while the lessor retains the title to the property. For the purpose
of the guideline, the debt is the present value (at the inception of the
lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the period of the
agreement excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair or
maintenance of the property.
(b)
Under the definition of debt set out in point 9 (a) above, arrears,
penalties, and judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment under a
contractual obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation
that is not considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to
debt.

Safeguards Assessment:

Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the Bank of Zambia (BoZ) was subject to
the transitional procedures with respect to the PRGF arrangement, that was approved on
March 25, 1999 and has expired on March 28, 2003. The transitional procedures require a
review of only the BoZ's external audit mechanism. The external audit assessment, which
was completed on July 2, 2001, concluded that BoZ's external audit mechanism was
adequate. Currently, the BoZ is subject to a full assessment with respect to a new
arrangement.

APPENDIX III

Exchange Rate Arrangement:

The currency of Zambia is the kwacha. The exchange rate for the kwacha is determined in
the inter-bank foreign exchange rate. On February 4, 2003, the Bank of Zambia mid-rate
was K 4,796.9 per U.S. dollar. On April 19, 2002, Zambia accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, Section 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement. However, the Fund urged
the authorities to eliminate the exchange restriction evidenced by the accumulation of
external payments arrears and the multiple currency practice arising from the spreads
between the dealing window rate and the interbank rate, which are subject to approval by
the Fund under Article VIII, as soon as possible. Following the introduction of the interbank foreign exchange market in July 2003, and the removal of the requirement for
exporters to sell their foreign exchange receipts to the BoZ and the auction conducted by
the BoZ, the potential for multiple currency practice has been eliminated.
X.

Article IV Consultations:

Zambia is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle, subject to the
provisions of the decision on consultation cycles approved on July 15, 2002. The last
Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on November 14, 2002.
XI.

FSAP Participation and ROSC:

Zambia has participated in a financial sector assessment program (FSAP) and an FSAP
mission from the Fund and the World Bank conducted a comprehensive external
assessment of the financial system. The two FSAP missions visited Zambia during April
30-May 15 and July 15-26, 2002.
The Zambian authorities have agreed to the preparation of a fiscal transparency module of
a Report on Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) assessing compliance with the
IMF’s Code of Good Practices on Fiscal Transparency—Declaration of Principles. Based
on the findings of a mission that visited Zambia during May 23-June 5, 2001, the fiscal
module of the ROSC was issued to the Executive Board on October 31, 2001.

APPENDIX III

Zambia: Relations with the World Bank Group
A. Partnership for Development
1.
The World Bank and IMF Boards endorsed the Government’s Poverty Reduction
Strategy, covering the period 2002-2004, embodied in its first full PRSP in May of 2002.
An Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) had been presented to the Board
in July 2000. The PRSP was substantially complete when the new Government took
office in January 2002. The new Government endorsed the PRSP and went further to
expand the PRSP in the Transitional National Development Plan (TNDP) that was
published in October 2002.
2.
Strategic focus of the PRSP. The PRSP highlights the following barriers to
poverty reduction: lack of economic growth, high inequality, excessive dependence on
foreign aid, poor prioritization of public resources, inadequate safety nets, and
HIV/AIDS. Therefore, the PRSP seeks to achieve poverty reduction through promoting
(i) economic growth and diversification of production and exports; (ii) improved access
and quality in the provision of social services; and (iii) the mainstreaming of crosscutting
issues of governance, HIV/AIDS, gender, and the environment. Targets and indicators are
provided for each sector and sub-sector. For example, by 2004 the poverty headcount is to
be reduced to the 1996 level of 65 percent. Even though the MDGs are not explicitly
mentioned in the PRSP, given that the MDGs were not widely discussed when Zambia
prepared its PRSP, some of the targets for improvements in the social indicators parallel
the MDGs.
3.
Joint Staff Assessment of the PRSP. Bank and IMF staff are in agreement with
the major objectives set out in the PRSP. The strengths of the PRSP are: a participatory
process that involved civil society, private sector, and donors; a poverty analysis that
draws on available quantitative and qualitative data, looks at multiple dimensions of
poverty, and provides data broken down by socio-economic group, gender, and region; an
appropriate macroeconomic framework and financing plan; identification of priority
sectors likely to contribute most to pro-poor growth; and the emphasis placed on the need
to improve governance and reduce corruption.
4.
Since 1995, the Fund has supported Zambia’s economic reform program by ESAF
and PRGF arrangements. The Government is implementing a staff-monitored program
covering the period January-June 2004 which is expected to form a bridge on a new
Fund-supported program under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). The
extended SMP focuses on (i) fiscal consolidation, (ii) reducing inflation, and
(iii) maintaining an adequate level of foreign reserves. Successful performance under the
extended SMP and subsequently under the proposed PRGF would remove a key
constraint to reaching HIPC Completion.

- 68 -

APPENDIX III

B. World Bank Group Strategy
5.
The Bank’s Executive Board discussed the Bank’s current Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS), which outlines the roadmap for the Bank’s country support for the period
2004-2006 on March 9, 2004. The CAS is explicitly rooted in a results framework that
links Zambia’s overall goals of the PRSP/TNDP to specific strategic objectives, which
are measured by long-term outcomes. The main focus of the planned Bank activities is to
improve the enabling environment through interventions that remove obstacles to longerterm strategic development outcomes while paying attention to cause-and-result linkages.
Where appropriate, quantitative targets to be reached during the CAS period have been
specified. During the CAS period, the Bank will track progress on specific CAS
outcomes and intermediate progress indicators that are directly affected by Bank
interventions.
6.

Bank activities focus on three strategic priorities:
•

Strategic Priority 1: Sustained Economic Growth Anchored in a Diversified
and Export-Oriented Economy;

•

Strategic Priority 2: Improved Lives and Protection of the Vulnerable;

•

Strategic Priority 3: Efficiently and Effectively Managed Public Sector.

In addition to ongoing Bank lending operations in the areas of public sector reform,
privatization, health, education, social service delivery, infrastructure, and the
environment, the base case of the new CAS includes adjustment lending and support for
diversification, while continuing project support for public sector reforms, infrastructure,
sanitation, health, education, and a reengagement in the agricultural sector.
7.
The Bank continues to undertake substantive country diagnostics, providing a
solid base for policy dialogue, design, and implementation of its lending operations in
Zambia. A combined Public Expenditure Review (PER), Country Procurement
Assessment Review (CPAR), and Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA)
was completed in 2003. The main economic sector work currently in preparation are a
Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), an Investment Climate Assessment (ICA), an
Administrative Barriers study (AB), and a Strategic Country Gender Assessment
(SCGA). In addition, a collaborative Poverty and Vulnerability Assessment (PVA) is
currently underway.
8.
For FY06 a review of labor market regulations, a rural development strategy, a
post privatization copper strategy, and a integrated framework study for trade have been
planned. In the social sectors, the Bank plans to undertake a public expenditure review of
the educational sector in FY06.
9.
Zambia concluded the 1999-2003 CAS period in the low case scenario, which has
become the departure platform for the current CAS. Given that during the last CAS IDA

- 69 -

APPENDIX III

commitments were about US$65 million per year (actuals for FY02/03 were
US$132 million in total), the proposed resource envelope under the new low case
scenario is US$180-240 million for the period FY04-07.
10.
The next higher level, the base case scenario, would result in US$70-80 million
p.a., or between US$280-320 million in total which would exhaust the current IDA
allocation of SDR230 million for FY04-07. If Zambia’s performance is sustained and
even accelerated with regard to macroeconomic and structural reforms and PRSP
implementation, the new high case would call for exceptional allocation of IDA resources
during the 2004-2007 CAS period and would be between US$90-105 million p.a. or
US$360-420 million in total which would be a 30 percent increase over the current IDA
envelope.
11.
The Bank’s active portfolio as of March 2004 contains 15 IDA credits, including
recent approvals, for a total commitment of US$610 million (see Table 1). Three projects
were approved during FY03 and two projects were approved during FY04 as of March
2003: (i) Copperbelt Environment in March 2003; (ii) Emergency Drought Recovery
Project in November 2003; (iii) HIV/AIDS project (ZANARA) in December 2002;
(iv) Southern African Power Pool (Subregional Project) in (December 2003); and
(v) Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project (RRMP) in March 2004.

12.
International Finance Corporation (IFC) is very much aligned with the Bank’s
policy agenda in Zambia. The IFC currently has a small portfolio of 12 projects totaling
US$15 million outstanding. These are a mix of financial sector, agribusiness,

- 70 -

APPENDIX III

telecommunications (mobile telephone), and tourism projects. IFC’s most prominent
recent project was for US$30 million in the equity of Konkola Copper Mines (KCM) with
Anglo-American in 2000. IFC exited in 2002 along with Anglo, in accordance with the
terms of the investment agreement.
13.
Zambia is currently a group 3 country for IFC (as defined in the recently Board
approved IFC strategic initiative for Africa), and thus assessed as a relatively poor
investment climate with limited prospects for stimulating new private investment and
limited progress achieved on reforms to improve the investment climate. In this
environment, IFC seeks to be responsive to individual projects where IFC can play a role
and in which there is strong development impact, but does not invest significant resources
in upstream project development. IFC is exploring jointly with the Bank how to support
the Bank Group’s activities in improving the investment climate in Zambia.
14.
MIGA’s outstanding portfolio in Zambia consists of four contracts of guarantee in
the agribusiness and manufacturing services sector with a US$36.1 million gross
exposure and a US$35.7 million net exposure as of December 2003. The projects are for
the privatization, modernization, and expansion of a foundry, and for cobalt and copper
facilities. They benefit the Zambian economy by saving production costs and by
providing training to personnel working on projects. The estimated total amount of
foreign direct investment facilitated to date is US$155.5 million. MIGA is currently
underwriting a project in the infrastructure sector, with anticipated coverage of
US$20 million, which is expected to be signed in FY04.
C. IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
15.
There are a number of areas where the Bank has taken the lead in the social
sectors, including health, education, social protection, and water and sanitation,
agriculture and rural development, private sector development including regulatory issues
and the environment. There are other areas in which the Fund and the Bank share
responsibility and are coordinating closely their policy advice to the Zambian authorities,
such as trade policy, financial sector, public expenditure management, including debt
management, and improving economic governance. The Fund leads and its analysis
serves as inputs into the Bank policy formulation and advice, including policies to
maintain macroeconomic stability, fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policies. A
summary of IMF-Bank collaboration in Zambia is provided in Table 2.
16.
The Fund and the Bank shared joint responsibility in supporting the Government
in the preparation of the PRSP and its forthcoming first progress report assessing its
implementation. The Fund and the Bank have also jointly provided assistance to Zambia
for evaluating progress to reach the Completion Point under the Enhanced HIPC
Initiative. In addition, the Bank and the Fund will jointly evaluate Zambia’s debt and cash
management practices.

- 71 -

APPENDIX III

C.1. Areas in which the World Bank leads and there is no direct IMF involvement
17.
Areas in which the Bank leads and there is no direct involvement of the IMF are
support for social sectors, agriculture and rural development, economic diversification,
infrastructure, and the environment. In light of the complex and crosscutting nature of
risk and vulnerability in Zambia, the Bank is assisting Government in developing a crosssectoral Social Protection Strategy. The strategy will extend beyond traditional ex post
risk-coping measures (e.g. safety nets) to include a better understanding of the role of ex
ante risk-prevention and risk-mitigation measures. The strategy is being prepared in a
highly participatory fashion, with the aim of integrating it within Zambia’s next PRSP.
For the same purpose, the Bank will undertake a Poverty and Vulnerability Assessment.
18.
HIV/AIDS and health. At this time, the Bank is assisting the Ministry of Health
with a US$12 million subcomponent under the multi-sectoral AIDS program
(ZANARA). In addition, the Bank is carrying out ESW on human resources in the health
sector (FY04) and planning a health sector PER in FY06. Building on this, the Bank will
provide support for the Health Sector Support Program (SWAp) beginning in FY07. The
improvement of water supplies under the Mine Township Services Project will also
contribute to improved health outcomes in the areas served.
19.
In education, the Bank is currently supporting the Ministry of Education’s efforts
through Adaptable Program Lending (APL). The APL1 Credit enables Bank funds to be
devoted to a wide range of purposes in basic education and, following an amendment, to
construct two high schools in Eastern Province. The Bank expects that the APL2 Credit,
to be committed in FY06, will support the education sector more broadly. The Bank will
support the expenditure effectiveness and efficiency and management issues in the sector
through a sector focused public expenditure review.
20.
In the area of technical education, vocational, and entrepreneurship training
(TEVET), the Government is carrying out reforms aimed at improving the quality of
TEVET training, making it more responsive to labor market demand, making it
financially sustainable, and increasing the participation of female trainees and trainees
from socio-economically disadvantaged groups. The Government’s efforts in this area are
being supported by an IDA credit committed in FY01 and by several other partners.
21.
In agriculture and rural development, the Bank’s focus is two fold: to improve
productivity of the sector and increase overall food security. The Bank is reengaging in
the agricultural sector given the priority Zambia itself attaches to this sector as set out in
the PRSP/TNDP. Indeed, if the macroeconomic environment can be improved, an
improved agricultural sectoral policy defined, and infrastructure support put in place–a
major effort could be launched to unleash this growth and poverty reduction potential
through well-targeted interventions for both smallholders and commercial agriculture.

- 72 -

APPENDIX III

22.
Advisory, Analytic, and Advisory (AAA) services are planned to support the
formulation of an agricultural policy that is consistent with planned and ongoing activities
in related sectors such as roads and electricity to remove bottlenecks that prohibit and or
make it difficult for farmers to produce for the market. Hence, the policy dialogue with
the Government on reform and priorities of public spending for agriculture and rural
development will address both short run policy issues holding back the sector, as well as
helping formulate a long run strategy to tap the large agricultural export potential of the
country, through investment in land development, irrigation, and infrastructure. Balanced
treatment of smallholders and commercial agriculture is important for growth and poverty
reduction. As a follow-up to the AAA work, an Agricultural Support Project is planned to
assist the Government with these challenges.
23.
In addition, the Bank is assisting Zambia to develop an Integrated Framework for
Disaster Relief and Mitigation–intended as multi-sectoral response to anticipate and
address the impacts of climate shocks–under the ongoing Emergency Drought Recovery
Project (EDRP). The aim is to increase food security and protect living conditions for the
poorest and most vulnerable in target districts; pilot programs are being designed to
manage and protect against climate shocks, including dams and local irrigation, labor
intensive public works, and agriculture input distribution programs. Feeding programs
will be implemented in primary schools in a subset of districts; young children in Zambia
are particularly at risk to high and rising levels of malnutrition.
24.
The Bank supports economic diversification directly through its SEED project,
which will support the Government’s implementation of a diversification strategy in the
tourism, agribusiness, and gemstone sectors. In the initial phase, the SEED project will
focus on supporting the design and establishment of appropriate policy and legal
frameworks to encourage private investments in the three high potential sectors as well as
also investments, primarily in tourism-related infrastructure. The tourism component will
work toward making Livingstone the flagship tourism destination in Zambia and
strengthen management of national parks, which underpin Zambia’s medium-term
tourism development strategy. The interventions in the gemstones and agribusiness
components are to strengthen the supply chain that links rural/small-scale producers to
local and export markets.
25.
Private sector development. To improve Zambia’s investment climate, the Bank
and IFC will assist the Government with analytical work, notably an Investment Climate
Assessment and a FIAS-led Administrative Barriers to Investment study. These studies
are geared to facilitate the adoption of a new and more business friendly investment act
and result in regular consultations between business and Government to discuss how to
strengthen Zambia’s business climate.
26.
In the infrastructural sectors, the economic program agreed to as part of the
HIPC initiative will assist the need to turn ZESCO around into a financially viable
company that operates on commercial terms. Analytical work will assist the Government

- 73 -

APPENDIX III

with identifying main bottlenecks with regard to competition and effective service
delivery in the sector. The policy recommendations and institutional changes would be
supported through adjustment operations, while the ongoing and proposed investment
projects, Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project (RRMP) and the Water Sector
Reform Project, would provided financial resources needed to undertake the actual
investments. Zambia will also benefit from the Southern African Power Pool Project.
27.
Environmental concerns are addressed as part of each individual project as laid
down in the Bank’s safeguard policies and directly through the Bank’s environmental
project in the Copperbelt, which will assist Government with the cleanup of several
hazardous sides in the Copperbelt and Kabwe area. The proposed SEED project will
assist the Government with sustainability of tourism in protected areas.
C.2. Areas in which the World Bank leads and its analysis serves as input into the
IMF program
28.
The Bank leads the dialogue on institutional dimensions of public expenditure
management and financial accountability as well as public sector reform and restructuring
and privatization. The Bank program will support these areas through a combination of
lending and analytical work. In the area of institutional dimensions of public
expenditure management and financial accountability, the Bank’s long-term objective
is to encourage a more transparent and accountable public sector by improving budget
management, procurement systems, and the accountability of public funds. The public
sector reform and restructuring agenda centers on the need to instill a more productive
and efficient public service. The means to achieve this are creating a more qualified and
motivated civil service, developing a strategic management orientation in line ministries,
improving policy coordination and implementation, and lastly, strengthening local
government’s capacity to participate in the development process.
29.
While the Bank has taken the lead in privatization, the IMF has also a strong
interest in these areas since many of the reforms are critical to achieving macroeconomic
stabilization and enhancing Zambia’s growth prospects. Accordingly, there is a high
degree of consultation and coordination between the two institutions on these matters.
C.3. Areas of shared responsibility
30.
The Fund and the Bank are working jointly in the following five areas (i) trade
policy; (ii) financial sector reform; (iii) debt management and domestic debt market
development; (iv) PRSP monitoring and evaluation; and (v) progress towards HIPC
completion.
31.
In the area of trade policy, the Bank with collaboration from other partners will
undertake the integrated framework exercise. Follow up with regard to the recently

- 74 -

APPENDIX III

completed FSAP will guide the Bank’s policy dialogue and interventions in the financial
sector in close collaboration with the IMF. The Fund and the Bank recently jointly
reviewed the proposed Financial Sector Development Plan for the financial sector in
Zambia.
32.
Assistance in the areas of central government debt management and domestic
debt market development from the Bank and the Fund will focus on improving the
functioning of these interrelated concepts as a means to reduce vulnerability and the cost
of and the need for domestic financing. This work will draw from the Guidelines for
Public Debt Management (published in March 2001) and the Handbook on Developing
Government Bond Markets (published in July 2001). The Bank and the IMF have
recently prepared an accompanying document to the guidelines containing case studies
from a range of countries at different stages of economic and financial development,
which will feed into this work as well.
33.
As one area of truly joined responsibility, the Fund and the Bank are working
closely together to review progress with Zambia’s PRSP. The Bank and the Fund jointly
prepared the JSA for the full PRSP published in May 2002 and are preparing for the JSA
of the first progress report of the PRSP that is to be issued by the end of March 2004.
Another truly joint responsibility is the Enhanced HIPC Initiative. Zambia reached its
decision point in December 2000. The Fund and the Bank jointly prepared the HIPC-AAP
document and jointly monitor progress towards HIPC completion.
C.4. Areas in which the Fund leads and its analysis serves as input into the World
Bank program
34.
The Fund leads the dialogue on macroeconomic framework in particular with
regard to fiscal policy, advising the Government on the overall envelope for public
expenditures, tax policy, as well as monetary and exchange rate policy. In these areas the
Bank takes into account the policy recommendations of the Fund and ensures that its own
policy advice, embedded in its adjustment lending, is consistent.

APPENDIX IV

Zambia: Statistical Issues
Zambia is a participant in the GDDS project for Anglophone African countries and
has begun receiving technical assistance in statistics under the project. Zambia’s
GDDS metadata on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board was last updated in
February 20042003.
The present arrangements for the compilation of macroeconomic statistics involve
duplication of effort and insufficient coordination among the Bank of Zambia (BoZ), the
Ministry of Finance, and the Central Statistical Office (CSO). The situation largely
reflects resource constraints and organizational weakness within the CSO that have
affected its ability to produce economic statistics on a timely basis.
Real sector
An IMF/DFID GDDS mission visited Lusaka from June 24 to July 5, 2002 to provide
technical assistance to the CSO on national accounts, focusing on improving the source
data (surveys); introducing the phased implementation of the 1993 System of National
Accounts (1993 SNA); and developing quarterly GDP estimates. The mission’s main
findings are summarized below.
Since its inception, the CSO has been compiling and disseminating annual national
accounts estimates, using both the production and expenditure approaches. The national
accounts estimates are compiled according to the conceptual guidelines of the 1968 SNA,
but a phased approach to the introduction of the 1993 SNA is planned. Currently, the
estimates are released on the basis of a well-established schedule and cover, on the
production side, 11 industry groups and 23 subgroups, and, on the expenditure side, the 6
main components, at both constant and current prices. For the production approach, 1994
is the latest benchmark year for value-added ratios. For many important industry areas,
such as wholesale and retail trade, construction, business services and many other service
industries consisting mainly of small-scale private service providers, there are no
appropriate indicators. The data that are currently available are mostly quarterly volume
or quantity indicators of production. These are used in the construction of quarterly
indicators of GDP by economic activity/industry at constant prices. Data that would
permit the compilation of the more comprehensive real sector indicators, such as data on
total production and intermediate consumption of establishments, are not available. On
the expenditure side, there are no current indicators of household consumption, and
private final consumption expenditure is derived residually. Source data to estimate gross
fixed capital formation and changes in stocks are incomplete.
Current price estimates for both the production and the expenditure sides are derived
from the constant price indicators by using wholesale price indices (WPIs) and consumer

- 78 -

price indices (CPIs) as deflators. However, for the most recent period, the WPI was no
longer available and the CPI components were used throughout the system.
The range of basic source data for national accounts estimates has rapidly eroded in
recent years at a time when the economy was subject to major structural changes. This
lack of adequate source data to support the national accounts has increasingly detracted
from the quality of the GDP estimates. Moreover, even some major methodological
improvements within national accounts, such as the adoption of the commodity flow
approach to estimate some of the aggregates, have not been adopted. Further, the CSO
has not used the results of the input-output table constructed for the period 1994-1999, to
improve the estimation process. The authorities’ plan to implement the economic census
project for 2002 constitutes a major breakthrough in the development of source data for
the national accounts.
A follow-up mission visited Lusaka during March 3-19, 2003. The mission noted that the
short-term recommendations made during the first mission were not carried out due to
lack of staff resources.
Government finance
Zambia has resumed compilation of government finance statistics (GFS) data, and it
appears that the quality of the reported data has improved; Zambia’s GFS data have been
updated to 1998 for final data and to 1999 for forecast data. However, the coverage of the
data for 1989-99 is limited to budgetary central government.
The authorities report monthly budget data for the Fund’s operational use in a timely
manner. However, data are often subject to substantial revisions later in the year. No
monthly or quarterly fiscal data are reported for publication in International Financial
Statistics (IFS). Local government fiscal data are not available. No data have been
reported for the GFS Yearbook since 1999.
An IMF/DFID GDDS mission visited Lusaka from March 13-26, 2003 to provide
technical assistance to the Ministry of Finance and National Planning on fiscal issues.
The expert provided advice on the initial steps toward migration to the methodology of
the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM2001).
Monetary accounts
There has been progress made in the compilation of monetary statistics, and the monetary
survey is published on a monthly basis. The BoZ has also eliminated discrepancies
between its own records of IMF accounts and data from the Finance Department of the
IMF.

- 79 -

APPENDIX IV

In April 2003, the Bank of Zambia fully switched to a new computing system for
generating its monthly trial balance, which should enable it to produce its monetary
accounts on a timely basis. A July 2003 STA monetary and financial statistics mission
recommended the recording of deposits on a gross, rather than on a net, basis; the
reporting of central government securities at cost, rather than at face value; and the
reclassification of some accounts.
Data reported by commercial banks are adequate, but the other depository corporations
survey should be expanded to cover four nonbank deposit-taking institutions.
Furthermore, the Bank of Zambia should include in the survey the accounts of all the
banks currently in the process of liquidation, classifying their deposits as restricted
deposits and excluding them from broad money.
Balance of payments
In May 2000, a STA mission found compilation of data on imports, exports, and foreign
direct investment to be inadequate and made a number of recommendations to improve
the coverage of the data. Since then, the authorities have prepared a work plan to
implement the recommendations of the mission, and some improvements have been made
in the coverage of the customs data and the methodology for compiling some balance of
payments components. However, the quality of balance of payments data continues to be
problematic, as data sources are poor and unreliable, while the methodology is
inadequate.
There are no sufficient data sources on private sector foreign assets and liabilities
required to compile an international investment position statement.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This paper seeks to assess Zambia’s progress in implementing economic
reforms supported by Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) and Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangements since 1995 and draws lessons for
a possible successor arrangement. Section II briefly presents economic developments prior
to these arrangements, including economic deregulation and reform in the early 1990s.
Section III reviews the performance and progress under the two arrangements in the period
1996 to 2002. Section IV draws some lessons from these program experiences and considers
the main challenges facing Zambia. Section V discusses the role the Fund could play in
helping the authorities to meet those challenges.
II. BACKGROUND
2.
From the mid-1970s onwards, Zambia’s formerly strong mining-based economy
suffered more than two decades of decline. In the first decade following independence in
1964, a strategy of import-substituting industrialization and state ownership was initially
supported by copper revenues, which provided almost all export earnings and about half of
GDP. However, after the oil price shocks of the 1970s, which also marked the beginning of a
long-term decline in real copper prices, Zambia took on large external debts and resorted to
an array of exchange and trade controls rather than a restructuring of the economy. During the
1980s, attempts to reform the economy to support diversification away from the failed policy
of state-led industrialization were subject to frequent reversals. Large-scale borrowing,
including under Fund-supported programs, was not matched by sufficiently strong adjustment
efforts and Zambia fell into arrears to the Fund in the mid-1980s. Mounting losses in the
enterprise sector contributed to a sharp acceleration in inflation in the second half of the
1980s. By 1990, nominal per capita GDP had fallen to US$450, about half its level 20 years
earlier.
3.
The elections of 1991 and the return to a multiparty political system provided
the opportunity for Zambia to embark on a more concerted reform effort. Under a rights
accumulation program (RAP) covering the period 1992-95, the Zambian authorities
implemented extensive market-oriented reforms. Prices were liberalized, interest rates were
decontrolled, and the kwacha was allowed to float. By 1994, virtually all exchange controls
on current and capital transactions had been removed. Quantitative controls on imports and
exports were removed in 1992, and the levels and dispersion of customs duties were reduced.
The privatization process also took on greater vigor following the passage of the Privatization
Act in 1992 and the establishment of the Zambia Privatization Agency (ZPA). Starting from a
highly adverse position—inflation reached 180 percent at the end of 1992—some progress
was also made toward macroeconomic stabilization. However, in part reflecting the large
continuing losses of Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), the parastatal which
dominated the mining sector, monetary expansion remained excessive, and inflation was
above 40 percent in both 1994 and 1995. The ZCCM’s inefficient operations were also a
severe drag on mining sector output, which declined by more than 10 percent per year in the

-4-

four years to 1995. Real GDP contracted by an average of 2.3 percent per year over the same
period.
III. DEVELOPMENTS UNDER ESAF- AND PRGF-SUPPORTED PROGRAMS, 1996-2002
A. Goals of the Programs
4.
Since the conclusion of the RAP, Zambia has had two arrangements with the
Fund. In December 1995, the Executive Board approved a three-year ESAF arrangement in
the amount of SDR 701.7 million (193 percent of quota), of which SDR 661.7 was made
available immediately after Zambia cleared its overdue obligations to the Fund (Figure 1). In
March 1999, the Executive Board approved a three-year PRGF arrangement. Access under
this arrangement was, at 52 percent of quota, lower than the norm for second-time users in
recognition of Zambia’s high level of outstanding obligations to the Fund.

5.
The program supported by a three-year ESAF arrangement approved in 1995,
was designed to reverse the economic decline through the strengthening of market-oriented
reforms, more efficient use of resources by the public sector, the cessation of inflationary
financing, and restoration of normal relations with the international financial community.
Structural reforms aimed to strengthen the banking system, continue the privatization
program (particularly the ZCCM), reform the civil service, and complete the government’s
withdrawal from agricultural finance and marketing.
6.
The PRGF-supported program again sought to bolster economic growth and
reduce inflation to single digits. Faster growth and improved provision of social services
was intended to support progress towards the poverty reduction goals of the government’s
interim-strategy paper endorsed by the Board in July 2000, and the PRSP, endorsed in
May 2002. The effectiveness of monetary policy was to be supported by fiscal tightening, a
broadening of the use of indirect monetary instruments, including open market operations,
and strengthened liquidity management. The program aimed to strengthen the role of the
private sector by privatizing the ZCCM (whose debt obligations had reached 16 percent of
GDP), and by privatizing telecommunications and electricity utilities, financial institutions,
and the petroleum sector. The program also sought to improve governance.
B. Compliance with Program Conditionality
7.
Program implementation under the ESAF arrangement was poor, but
generally improved under the PRGF arrangement. Shortly after Board approval, key
performance criteria (PCs) for end-December 1995 were missed. Satisfactory performance
under a staff-monitored program (SMP) allowed the delayed completion of a midyear review
in March 1997, but no further reviews were completed and the ESAF arrangement expired in
December 1998. Implementation under the subsequent PRGF arrangement initially faltered,
and key performance criteria in 1999 were missed as a result of shortfalls in donor support,
delays in the privatization of the ZCCM, and inadequate progress in civil service reform.
However, performance improved markedly thereafter; the arrangement was extended by
12 months and expired in March 2003, with five of the six reviews completed. The sixth
review was not completed because of delays in privatizing the Zambia National Commercial
Bank (ZNCB).
8.
The monitoring framework for programs supported by ESAF/PRGF
arrangements included quarterly quantitative and structural PCs and benchmarks,
with semiannual reviews. Under the ESAF arrangement, six out of ten PCs for endDecember 1995 were not observed. In 1999, few quantitative PCs were met under the PRGF
arrangement (two out of nine for March and June 1999 and only one in September and
December 1999), and none of the structural PCs were observed. Performance improved
substantially in 2000 (all quantitative and structural criteria for September 2000 were
observed and seven out of the ten for December). Results were again mixed in 2001 when all
structural PCs were observed, but only three of the seven quantitative PCs were met for

-6-

March and September. In 2002, virtually all quantitative and structural performance criteria
were observed for March, June, September, and December.
9.
Conditions set under the two arrangements were broadly within the Fund’s
core areas of responsibility. Under the ESAF arrangement, structural PCs and benchmarks
were largely restricted to issues that have a direct bearing on macroeconomic stability. The
large fiscal losses and large financial sector risks posed by the ZCCM and ZNCB justified
increased monitoring. Under the ESAF arrangement, the average number of structural
conditions per year was low (Table 1) because few were set while the program was off track.
Under the PRGF arrangement, the number of structural conditions was in line with other
PRGF arrangements, except for the lack of prior actions in the Zambian program. The
distribution of conditions was also comparable to the average for all ESAF- and PRGFprograms, with heavy emphasis on conditions in the fiscal and financial areas (Table 2). The
major difference between the profile for Zambia and for other countries was that measures
associated with privatization and with governance were given greater weight in Zambia. This
was appropriate given the importance of these issues for budgetary performance.
C. Attainment of Program Objectives
10.
Economic performance improved under the two arrangements but fell short of
program objectives (Table 3 and Figure 2). During the period 1996-98, growth averaged
2.7 percent, sharply above the average of -2.3 percent in 1992-95 but well below the original
program target of 6 percent per year. Under the PRGF arrangement, and despite a severe
drought in 2002, Zambia recorded its strongest period of sustained expansion in three
decades, with growth averaging 3.5 percent in 1999–2002, compared with the targeted
increase of 4-5 percent per annum. Similarly, inflation remained well above the original
program targets—which called for a decline to 4 percent per annum over both three-year
periods—but still slowed sharply from an average of almost 100 percent per year in the
period 1992–95 to average 28 percent in 1995–98 and 24 percent in 1999–2002.
11.
Progress toward macroeconomic stabilization was hampered by both exogenous
shocks—including a persistent decline in copper prices and droughts—and slippages in
implementation. Revenue performance remained relatively strong by regional standards and
was generally in line with program expectations. However, continued delays in the
privatization of the ZCCM adversely affected implementation, particularly when the fall in
copper prices accentuated operating losses, and led a revision of subsequent annual program
targets. Under the ESAF-supported program, central government’s fiscal deficit was broadly
in line with the program until 1998. However, the financing of ZCCM’s losses through quasifiscal operations contributed to excessive monetary expansion in this period. The original

fiscal targets of the PRGF-supported program were substantially relaxed, particularly in 2000,
to take account of operating losses in ZCCM. The privatization of the ZCCM then paved the
way for the pursuit of a more coherent macroeconomic framework. However, weaknesses in
expenditure policy and management continued to hamper fiscal policy implementation. Thus,
recourse to domestic financing typically exceeded program targets, complicating the
implementation of monetary policy and contributing to a slower decline in inflation and to
upward pressure on real interest rates.
12.
The government wage bill has increasingly been a source of fiscal slippages. The
public service reform program launched in 1998 included the separation of over 15,000
contractual workers and reduced the public service from 139,000 to 104,000. However, by
2002, the total had risen again to around 120,000.19 Pay reform initiatives launched with the
support of the World Bank have, since 2001, focused on decompressing the wage structure
and rationalizing cash and noncash allowances. Progress in these areas has been incomplete
and fragmented; some decompression was implemented in 2003, but the government failed to
reform the system of allowances and allowed total costs to substantially exceed the agreed
resource envelope. As a result of the larger payroll and average wage increases, the wage bill
rose sharply from 5.6 percent of GDP in 1996 to 8.5 percent of GDP in 2003. At this level,
the wage bill now accounts for 47 percent of domestic revenues and is also high by regional
standards. The expansion in the wage bill has, together with a rapidly increased burden of
domestic interest payments, crowded out domestic capital expenditures, including povertyreducing spending.
13.
Despite some progress, the overall reform effort in public expenditure
management under both programs was slow.20 Procedures for budget preparation and
expenditure control remain weak, despite sustained technical assistance efforts in this area. A
strengthened commitment control system, which was not implemented until early 2003, has
slowed the accumulation of arrears, but enforcement of sanctions against over commitment
and the veering of funds between budget subheads remains inadequate. A comprehensive
database of outstanding bills was completed only in June 2003, and the preparation of a plan
for settling domestic arrears was delayed.
14.
Despite the difficulties implied by fiscal slippages, progress was made in
strengthening monetary policy implementation. The effectiveness of the Bank of Zambia’s
(BoZ’s) monetary operations was improved by greater use of new indirect instruments,
improvements in the treasury bill market, the introduction of repurchase agreements, and
steps to improve liquidity management. Progress was also made in financial sector reforms
19

Including security forces, employees of grant-aided institutions, and other bodies, total government
employment stands at about 160,000.

In 2001, Zambia met three out of sixteen benchmarks under the HIPC Initiative expendituretracking and action plan (AAP). By 2003, four of the benchmarks were met.

-9-

including strengthening the regulatory framework. However, there were persistent delays in
moving forward with privatization of the troubled ZNCB. The Financial System Assessment
Program (FSAP) prepared jointly with the World Bank in 2002 identified several
weaknesses, including a low level of financial intermediation, weaknesses in central bank
independence, absence of small and medium-sized enterprise financing, immediate threats
posed by insolvent public nonbank financial institutions, and the pressing problem of high
interest rates fueled by domestic government borrowing.
15.
Zambia’s open and liberal trade and exchange regime and a flexible exchange
rate have supported economic diversification. Large tariff reductions reduced the simple
average import duty from 27 percent in 1994 to 19 percent in 1996. The trade-weighted
average tariff rate subsequently declined from 16 percent in 1996 to 11.5 percent in 2003 as a
result of the removal of a 5 percent import declaration fee, a reduction in the maximum tariff
to 20 percent, and reclassification of some goods into lower tariff brackets. Improvements in
the exchange system included the successful introduction of an interbank foreign exchange
market in July 2003 and the cessation of central bank foreign exchange auctions. In the 1990s
and into the early part of this decade, the real effective exchange rate has fluctuated around a
trend of moderate appreciation, despite the weakening of the terms of trade stemming from
lower copper prices. This outcome in part reflects the impact of rising real interest rates. For
example, a sharp upwards movement in the real effective rate in 2001 coincided with an
increase in domestic interest rates, as well as the sharp depreciation of the South African
rand. However, the real effective exchange rate has since moderated significantly and there is
little indication that the trend of gradual appreciation has adversely affected competitiveness.
Nonmining exports expanded under the PRGF arrangement and sustained growth in
nonmining GDP, especially agriculture, contributed importantly to the overall gains in
economic growth.
16.
External viability has yet to be achieved. Satisfactory implementation of the
PRGF-supported program allowed Zambia to reach the decision point under the enhanced
Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC Initiative) in December 2000. However,
following the expiry of the PRGF arrangement in March 2003, Board consideration of a new
PRGF arrangement was precluded by a large projected wage overrun, and a staff monitored
program covering July-December 2003 also went off track, due mainly to large unbudgeted
expenditures. These delays in moving to a new PRGF arrangement have also postponed
attainment of the completion point under the HIPC Initiative, which will be key to restoring
external sustainability. Exceptional front-loading of HIPC Initiative relief from the Fund was
provided in the interim period to reduce cash debt service payments to the Fund. Zambia’s
gross reserves recovered to more than two months of imports at the end of 2002, but declined
to about half this level at the end of December 2003.

- 10 -

17.
The privatization program accelerated between 1995-97 after the restructuring
of the ZPA in 1995, but subsequently lost momentum.21 By end-2002, 254 out of 280
parastatals under the ZPA were privatized through a relatively transparent and competitive
tendering process. However, privatizations in the mining sector were handled largely outside
of the ZPA and were subject to less transparent bidding and selection processes. Lack of
transparency in the asset valuation and bidding stages contributed to very costly delays in the
privatization of the ZCCM. Although the sale of ZCCM’s largest asset, the Konkola Copper
Mines (KCM) to Anglo American (AA) in 2000 was followed shortly thereafter by AA’s
decision to withdraw, the privatization did yield significant productivity gains and an end to
the use of budgetary resources.22 In contrast, the sale of the Roan Antelope Mining Company
of Zambia (RAMCOZ) in 1997, which was also handled in a nontransparent manner, proved
unsuccessful because the buyers had no experience in mining operations and quickly faced
difficulties in meeting obligations to employees and suppliers, including the electricity
parastatal, ZESCO. Despite additional loans extended from the ZNCB and guaranteed by the
government, as well as tax deferrals, RAMCOZ was ultimately placed into receivership in
2000. Further costs to the budget arose when the resale of the RAMCOZ to private investors
at the end of 2003 was facilitated by the government’s assuming responsibility for wage
arrears and retrenchment costs totaling about 0.7 percent of GDP. In addition, the terms of
privatizations in the mining sector included generous, ad hoc tax treatments. These have set a
precedent for mining investors, and the sector now provides only very modest revenues to the
budget.
18.
Despite some setbacks in privatization, the programs did see an increase in the
role of the private sector. The resumption in growth of mining and nonmining activity was
driven by the private sector. Although caution is needed in interpreting national accounts
data, a reported increase in private investment was also reflected in foreign direct investment,
which was negative in the early 1990s, rose to an average of 5 percent of GDP under the
ESAF-supported program, and reached an average of more than 6 percent of GDP per year
under the PRGF arrangement.
19.
In recent years, progress was made in addressing governance issues at the
political level. Following elections in December 2001, the new government pronounced a
zero-tolerance policy on corruption, and launched a national movement against corruption
with broad-based representation from government, civil society, and the private sector.
21

This discussion draws upon the conclusions of the (unpublished) report of December 2002,
“Zambia: Privatization Review—Facts, Assessment and Lessons,” prepared by World Bank staff at the
request of the Minister of Finance and National Planning.
22

The withdrawal of Anglo-America from KCM in 2002 did not lead to a renewed need for budget
support. The exit package negotiated with AA made provisions for operating losses through to 2004
and copper prices have been sufficient to cover KCM’s operating costs.

- 11 -

Parliament also enacted changes to promote participation in the debating of bills presented in
parliament. Funding for the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) was increased to ensure that
it was adequately staffed and independent. In 2002, the ACC received 836 complaints,
compared with 315 in 2001; high-profile cases of alleged abuse of public resources were
prosecuted and have reached trial stage. The Office of the Auditor General (OAG) was
strengthened, and audited public accounts for 2001 were completed and submitted to
parliament in 2002, as required by law. However, these efforts need to be seen against the
background of continued fundamental weaknesses in budgetary processes, which are an
obstacle to good governance.
D. Program Design and Implementation Lessons
20.
The growth target of 6 percent in the ESAF-supported program may have been
too optimistic. In 1996, the rebound in GDP from the drought of 1995 exceeded
expectations. Thereafter, the delay in the sale ZCCM adversely affected copper production,
which stagnated in 1997 and then fell by a fifth in 1998. The growth of manufacturing output
was also constrained by the sector’s strong linkages to the mining sector, and private sector
activity was hampered by limited progress towards macroeconomic stability. Nevertheless,
the impact on growth of developments in the mining sector, which accounted for only
12 percent of GDP in the mid-1990s, should not be exaggerated. Even if copper production
had developed as programmed, nonmining GDP would have had to grow by more than
5 percent per annum to meet the overall growth target—a sharp reversal of the decline in
nonmining GDP in the previous three years. Under the PRGF-supported program, the growth
in nonmining activity slightly exceeded the implied target of 4 percent per annum through
2001. However, growth fell short of the original targets as privatization of ZCCM was
delayed and copper production again declined; following the privatization, copper production
rose by an average of more than 20 percent in 2001 and 2002. However, in 2002 overall
growth slowed to 3 percent as a result of a severe drought.
21.
Fiscal outcomes were not strong enough to support programmed disinflation.
As noted, delays in the privatization of ZCCM and shortcomings in budget policy and
execution resulted in higher recourse to domestic financing. Persistent shortfalls in external
budget support (see below) also contributed to higher domestic borrowing by the
government. Broad money typically exceeded program targets and inflation objectives were
revised upwards. Acute difficulties emerged in 2001 when the combination of fiscal slippage
and a shortfall in donor assistance resulted in a sharp depreciation of the kwacha. Against this
background of fiscal dominance, and in the light of the mixed record of implementation,
original program targets, which aimed to reduce inflation to 4 percent over three years,
appear over optimistic. However, inflation targets in annual programs were subsequently
eased.
22.
Recourse to domestic financing has introduced an additional risk. Although the
stock of domestic debt appears low by international standards, at around 20 percent of GDP,
the sharp increase in domestic debt in an environment of modest financial savings brought

- 12 -

real interest rates to high levels. As a result, domestic interest payments now exceed external
debt service. Moreover, decisive action is needed to break the cycle of rising domestic debt
and interest payments, which poses a serious risk to macroeconomic stability.
23.
Program assumptions for external assistance appear, with hindsight, to have
been too optimistic. Shortfalls were typically due to failure to observe policy objectives set
by bilateral and multilateral donors. In addition, bureaucratic delays on the part of donors and
a lack of clarity on conditions for the release of funds have also played a role. At times,
program monitoring also allowed too much recourse to domestic financing. The ESAFsupported programs included a ceiling on borrowing from the banking system rather than on
total domestic financing. This was rectified under the PRGF, but the adjuster for shortfalls in
external financing was initially capped at the relatively high level of US$45 million or more
than one percent of GDP. As a result, monetary policy was again called upon to take the
burden of adjustment.
24.
The programs did not include ex ante contingencies to address exogenous
shocks other than shortfalls in aid inflows. Program implementation was adversely
affected by shortfalls in copper exports, which were in part attributed to the delay in the
privatization of the ZCCM. These shortfalls also prompted some modifications to targets
during program reviews. Growth objectives set in the poverty reduction strategy paper
(PRSP) and, hence, in the PRGF arrangement took into account the possible adverse impact
of the subsequent withdrawal of AA.
25.
The programs were not successful in controlling the wage bill. Civil service
reform was included in the conditionality of the ESAF-supported program but, with the
exception of a hiring freeze, this area was not covered by structural conditionality under the
PRGF arrangement. This move was consistent with the policy of streamlining conditionality,
and the World Bank’s lead role in supporting and monitoring wage reform. However, given
the crucial importance of the wage bill for macroeconomic stability—with adequate
provisions for poverty-reducing expenditure—closer monitoring of the wage bill, possibly
supported by conditionality covering related reforms, would be appropriate under a successor
arrangement. The SMP is also seeking to strengthen the process of wage bargaining with
government employees to ensure greater transparency and predictability, with all parties
aware of, and constrained by, the budgeted wage bill. This process will also be helped by the
government’s decision to bring forward wage negotiations to coincide with budget
preparation.
26.
The experience under the ESAF arrangement, in which the ZCCM’s losses were
highly adverse to program outcomes, raises questions on the choice of program
conditionality. In retrospect, it may have been preferable to insist on the privatization of the
ZCCM before starting the ESAF arrangement, in which disbursements were heavily frontloaded. However, given the time needed to conclude the sale, and the need not to undermine
the government’s bargaining position, this approach could have jeopardized Zambia’s
progress in other areas, as well as delayed the clearance of arrears to the Fund. Alternatively,

- 13 -

the program could have put greater emphasis on attempting to strengthen the ZCCM’s
financial position in preparation for privatization.23 More generally, Zambia’s experience of
repeated early derailments after approval of the arrangement and subsequent delays in
completing reviews suggests that, where possible, key reforms should be front-loaded and
monitored as prior actions.
27.
The difficulties that emerged in KCM and RAMCOZ following their
privatizations contributed to increased public and political disquiet over the
privatization program. This was an important factor that delayed steps toward the
privatization of the ZNCB in late 2002 and may also have influenced the government’s
decision to commercialize, rather than privatize, the Zambia Electricity Services Corporation
(ZESCO). In both cases, long-standing policy commitments, which were included as triggers
for reaching the HIPC Initiative completion point, were called into question. This experience,
and the contrast with the more successful privatizations conducted by the ZPA, underlines the
importance of the privatization process for the outcome of such privatizations. In retrospect,
the results may have been better if the Fund and the World Bank had insisted that the ZPA be
solely responsible for the privatization of mining as well as nonmining sector assets, in order
to ensure the transparency of the privatization process.
28.
Program implementation was hampered by limited institutional capacity and
lapses in coordination within the economic team. These difficulties appear to have been
exacerbated during the course of the PRGF arrangement by high staff turnover, particularly in
the Ministry of Finance and National Planning (MoFNP), in part because of the impact of
HIV/AIDS but also because many high officials were removed as a result of the new
government’s efforts to tackle corruption. Monitoring of program implementation needs to be
strengthened through improved coordination both within and among agencies; under the
SMP, existing interministerial arrangements for program monitoring are to be reinvigorated
with the President serving as chair. In addition, greater cohesion of the economic team is
required to ensure that policymakers are fully apprised of the implications of spending and
other decisions. In this vein, following the difficulties that emerged in 2003 as a result of
decisions to grant wages and allowances well in excess of budgeted amounts, the SMP
includes steps to ensure that such decisions are not taken without the agreement of the
MoFNP and the cabinet.
29.
Fund technical assistance was geared to improving public expenditure
management (PEM), supporting tax policy and administration, and strengthening the
capacity of the BoZ. Despite repeated mission recommendations and the assignment of
resident advisors, implementation of PEM reforms has not had the desired results. Although
23

In 1998, when the company was a severe drain on the government budget, measures taken to
improve its financial position amounted to quasi-fiscal subsidies involving lower electricity tariffs,
import duty concessions, and lower tax rates.

- 14 -

there has been some progress—for example, improvements in the commitment control
system, which helped to sharply reduce arrears accumulation in the first half of 2003—these
gains have been undermined by extrabudgetary expenditures and the circumvention of budget
procedures. FAD’s technical assistance (TA) recommendations on the revenue side,
including reform of the Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA), widening of the tax base, and
introduction of the value-added tax (VAT) have mostly been implemented and have been
influential in keeping the revenue-to-GDP ratio stable at 18-19 percent. MFD has provided
extensive TA under both programs in the areas of bank supervision, monetary and exchange
operations, payments systems, information technology, the resolution of insolvent nonbanks,
and the preparation of a Financial Sector Development Plan. Improvements observed in
meeting PCs in the financial sector, the relatively stable state of the banking system, the
generally adequate supervisory and regulatory framework (based on the 2002 FSAP), and the
introduction of the interbank foreign exchange market and indirect monetary policy
instruments, suggest that the MFD’s TA had a positive impact.
30.
The mixed record of policy implementation, including limited follow-up on TA
recommendations, especially in the area of expenditure, also calls into question the
extent of program ownership. In some key areas, ownership of policy reforms has been
very strong. Thus, for example, in July 2003, after the expiration of the PRGF arrangement,
the BoZ successfully introduced an interbank foreign exchange market, making good use of
MFD’s technical support. However, repeated lapses in expenditure policy and the recent
reconsideration of privatization policy point to incomplete ownership of the program. This
may, despite the good participatory process used to develop Zambia’s PRSP, in part reflect
popular misgivings over economic reforms and the role of the Fund. Although growth has
resumed in Zambia, this has not been adequate to reverse public perceptions of poor
economic performance that derive from more than two decades of economic decline. In
addition, Zambia’s prolonged involvement with, and continued high indebtedness to, the
Fund inevitably complicate relations and public perceptions of the process of policy
formulation. In these circumstances, the authorities’ advocacy of the chosen policy path
assumes a particular importance in demonstrating ownership at the highest levels of
government and convincing a skeptical public and often hostile local press that policies are
not “imposed” from outside.
31.
The experience under Zambia’s two arrangements also suggests that a different
modality for the repayment of arrears cleared in 1995 would have been desirable. The
effective refinancing using ESAF and Structural Adjustment Facility (SAF) resources meant
that Zambia remained heavily indebted to the Fund, with all of these obligations falling due
in the period 2001–05. Clearance of some of the arrears with resources other than new
disbursements from the Fund, may have been beneficial for the policy dialogue.
Alternatively, requiring some earlier repayments (i.e., before the end of the 5½-year grace
period for ESAF/PRGF loans) would have provided a stronger incentive for policy
implementation under the ESAF, lowered Fund exposure to Zambia, and avoided the large
“hump” in debt-service payments that both heightens the risk of Zambia’s falling back into
arrears and complicates the policy discussions.

- 15 -

E. Collaboration with the World Bank
32.
Collaboration with the World Bank has generally been close during the two
arrangements. The World Bank took a lead role in supporting public enterprise reform and
privatization, except for the privatization of the ZNCB, in which the Fund took the lead role.
In the petroleum sector, this included price liberalization and liquidation of the Zambia
National Oil Corporation. Support has also been given to the ZPA and for commercialization
of ZESCO. In the mining sector, the World Bank has played a key role in assisting in efforts
to bring a strategic investor into the KCM following the withdrawal of AA. The World Bank
has also supported a strengthening in public sector management, including under a Public
Service Capacity-Building Project. As noted earlier, the World Bank has also taken the lead
in the civil service reforms, including recent attempts to reform the pay structure.
IV. POLICY CHALLENGES FOR THE MEDIUM TERM
33.
Notwithstanding recent gains in economic growth, the extent of Zambia’s
poverty remains formidable. The PRSP set an initial growth target of 5 percent, recognizing
the numerous obstacles to faster growth that remain. However, Zambia will need to grow by
6–8 percent per year to attain a reduction in poverty consistent with the corresponding MDG
for 2015. The main sources of growth are expected to be agriculture, mining, manufacturing,
and tourism, with policies to support a private sector- and export-led growth performance.
Key elements of the strategy for more rapid growth and poverty reduction would include
consolidation of macroeconomic stability, a strengthening of the budgetary processes to
improve fiscal outcomes and governance and facilitate higher donor support of priority social
spending; civil service reform to bring the wage bill to a more affordable level; completion of
the privatization program and removal of obstacles to private sector growth in the areas
business licensing and regulation, land tenure and labor legislation; and financial sector
development to support improved financial intermediation including in rural areas. Progress
in these and other areas is also needed to allow Zambia to attain the HIPC Initiative
completion point, which will be a key step toward reducing the country’s debt to sustainable
levels.
34.
Prudent fiscal and monetary policies will remain crucial to achieving durable
macroeconomic stability and faster growth. Recent program experiences point to the need
to ensure that the burden of macroeconomic stability is borne mainly by tight fiscal policy,
and that real interest rates are lowered to levels supportive of higher domestic private
investments. Conversely, if the government were to continue borrowing in 2004 at the same
pace as in 2003, Zambia would risk entering into a destabilizing and widening cycle of
domestic higher debt and interest rates. Against this background, it is also essential that the
authorities cease to regard domestic borrowing as a convenient means to facilitate
unbudgeted expenditures. Monetary policy will need to be aimed at supporting lower
inflation, while ensuring that the BoZ’s international reserve coverage remains adequate.

- 16 -

35.
Controlling the wage bill will be crucial to fiscal consolidation. With the support
of the World Bank and other donors, development and implementation of a public sector
reform plan will, therefore, need to be a key component of a coherent program that takes into
account the need to maintain tight fiscal policy. At the same time, wage increases will have to
be tightly controlled.
36.
Zambia’s PEM system still requires substantial upgrading in the areas of
budget formulation and execution. The government has identified PEM reform and
financial accountability as priorities in its PRSP. Major initiatives, which are being supported
by the World Bank and other donors, include the introduction in the 2004 budget of an
activity-based classification of operations, a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF)
and the development of an Integrated Financial Management System (IFMIS). Considerable
efforts are also being made to improve existing reporting, accounting, cash management, and
expenditure control systems. The government has recently established a joint donors’ group
to oversee and monitor progress in public sector reforms, including progress in PEM reform.
A technical team is developing a specific action plan, largely based on the World Bank’s
Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR).
However, it will take time before these major initiatives can deliver their anticipated benefits.
Progress is also needed in developing and implementing a strategy to clear the stock of
domestic arrears.
37.
Special attention will need to be focused on ensuring that the higher levels of
support needed to facilitate progress toward the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) are forthcoming. This will require continued close consultation with donors to
clarify commitments and policy conditions. A substantially improved record of program
implementation will also be crucial to gaining higher levels of donor support.
38.
Strengthening budget processes will also be crucial to improving governance.
The government should enforce compliance with existing systems and regulations in a
comprehensive and transparent manner to promote accountability. The independence and
authority of the OAG needs to be enhanced to bolster public sector accountability. More
generally, these steps need to be reinforced by the publicly articulated support of
policymakers and political leaders for greater accountability.
39.
The authorities need to ensure that the mechanisms for tracking poverty
reduction and social spending are improved. In addition to a well-functioning, activitybased budgeting, the authorities will need to ensure that regular assessments of poverty
programs are carried out with the participation of civil society, and that these assessments are
fed into the budget.
40.
While government revenues have remained relatively strong, risks remain. In
particular, as the experience of the mining sector has demonstrated, there is a need to develop
a consistent policy for granting exemptions, to avoid ad hoc exemptions and to preserve the

- 17 -

revenue base. Similarly, there is a need to ensure that tax concessions in the Export
Processing Zone Act do not undermine corporate tax collections.
41.
Although the privatization program is nearing completion, it is essential to
carry through with the remaining sales, to improve economic efficiency and protect the
budget. In particular, in the mining sector, the sale of the KCM to a strategic investor is
expected to be completed shortly. Similarly the sale of the ZNCB to a reputable private bank
will help to improve financial intermediation, while safeguarding the budget from further
losses in the bank. There is, however, no consensus within the government for the
privatization of the telecommunications company.
42.
Zambia’s FSAP report highlighted issues that the authorities now intend to
address in their Financial Sector Development Plan. Key issues include strengthening the
capacity and independence of the BoZ; improving financial sector supervision and regulation;
resolving insolvent nonbank financial institutions; appropriately regulating and supervising
the National Pension Scheme Authority (NAPSA) to address the problems of unfunded
liabilities; developing mechanisms to improve the delivery of rural banking services;
implementing strategies to channel finance for small and medium-sized enterprises;
completing the sale of the ZNCB; improving liquidity forecasting through more effective
coordination between the BoZ and the Ministry Finance and National Planning; establishing a
comprehensive debt-management framework; and implementing the Prohibition and
Prevention of Money Laundering Act of November 2001.
43.
To mitigate the medium-term growth risks posed by dependence on copper, the
authorities need to maintain the open trade and flexible exchange rate regimes that have
supported the strong growth of nontraditional exports in the past ten years. The real effective
exchange rate continues to show relative stability, and the introduction of an interbank
market for foreign exchange should enhance the response of the exchange rate to short-term
movements in the foreign exchange market.
V. FUTURE FUND RELATIONS WITH ZAMBIA
A. Rationale for a Successor Arrangement
44.
The Fund can play an important role in supporting Zambia’s progress toward
macroeconomic stability, which is crucial for growth and poverty reduction. Key
elements of the remaining reform agenda fall within the Fund’s core areas of expertise and
responsibility. These include supporting fiscal consolidation, reducing vulnerabilities to
external shocks, strengthening governance in areas of public expenditure policy and
management, and supporting financial sector reforms.
45.
A sound track record under a successor PRGF arrangement would facilitate
Zambia’s attainment of the HIPC Initiative completion point and ease the burden of
repayments facing Zambia. In addition, with a sustained track record of implementation,

- 18 -

including progress in PEM, a successor arrangement could play an important role in helping
to catalyze donor budget support for meeting the MDGs.
46.
The Fund will need to continue providing adequate and timely TA to strengthen
capacity in key areas, such as public expenditure management, expenditure controls, tracking
of poverty reduction expenditures, tax and administration reforms, financial sector reforms,
and capacity strengthening at the BoZ (as discussed above) and the Central Statistical Office.
The mixed record of implementation underlies the importance of integrating TA
recommendations into program monitoring.
B. Exit Strategy
47.
Zambia faces large and immediate financing needs. Although Zambia’s external
debt service will fall sharply in 2006 with the completion of repayments from the 1995 ESAF
that cleared Zambia’s arrears, large payments are due in 2004 and 2005. Strong adjustment
efforts, supported by a successor arrangement, will be needed to meet the larger financing
needs resulting from the delay in reaching the HIPC completion point.
48.
The Fund’s exposure to Zambia remains high. After falling back in 2006, debt
service to the Fund will build up toward the end of the decade as repayments to the Fund on
disbursements under the recent PRGF arrangement fall due. Since the Fund is expected to
have provided all of its assistance under the HIPC Initiative by 2007, and because Fund
disbursements have shorter maturities than other official lending, the Fund's share of debt
service could peak at over 60 percent of total debt service by the end of the decade (about
70 percent with a new PRGF arrangement). However, total external debt service is expected
to average no more than 7 percent of exports. While Zambia should be able to stabilize the
net present value (NPV) of debt in relation to GDP after reaching the HIPC Initiative
completion point, this will require growth of about 4 percent per annum in real terms, a stable
real exchange rate, and a current account deficit, after grants, of about 5 percent of GDP.
Recent staff projections indicate that these requirements for the stabilization of Zambia’s debt
are possible, assuming continued gains in the trade balance due to stronger copper prices. The
outlook would also depend on the provision of additional external assistance to meet the
MDG targets, largely in the form of grants.
49.
Zambia’s limited progress toward macroeconomic stability and the scale and
duration of the reforms to be addressed do not suggest that the country is a strong
candidate for early graduation from the use of Fund resources. As noted above, the
current large financing needs are expected to decline in 2006. However, debt service to the
Fund is projected to increase thereafter, in an echo of the hump in debt service from the
clearance of arrears in 1995. Further support under the PRGF may be required to help meet
this balance of payments need directly and to provide strong monitoring framework as a
catalyst for higher donor support.

- 19 -

VI. THE VIEWS OF THE AUTHORITIES
50.
The authorities indicated that they agreed with many of the points made in the
assessment. However they felt that greater emphasis needed to be placed on some factors
which had contributed to Zambia’s poor growth performance and thereby prevented the
delivery of adequate social services.
51.
In particular, adjustment programs supported by both the Fund and World Bank did
not provide, in their view, adequate support for economic growth. The thrust of this support
was on policy and institutional reform, geared to encouraging investment and growth.
Although such reforms were necessary, they needed to be backed by practical steps, including
improvements in infrastructure, to encourage investment. For example, while functioning
infrastructure is essential for sectors like tourism and mining, no major investment was made
or supported in the areas with the highest potential, such as Livingstone for tourism and the
“New Copperbelt” for mining. Furthermore, while it is widely recognized that Zambia’s
agricultural potential can be exploited with the benefit of improved infrastructure (e.g.,
irrigation and power) very little investment was carried out in these areas. As it turned out,
much of the financing received by Zambia was adjustment credit, which was mostly used for
servicing the huge debt that Zambia faced. While useful in terms of avoiding a further
contraction of the economy under the heavy debt burden, this did not contribute directly to
growth. Adjustment money was largely used to deal with past problems (debt) rather than
dealing with the future (growth).
52.
In the past four years, the Zambian economy has shown consistent growth, although
still at rather low levels compared to what is needed. The growth has come from mining,
manufacturing, tourism and services. Agriculture has grown when the weather has permitted
and with timely input support; within this, export-based agriculture has shown the strongest
growth. Investments in these emerging growth areas have sometimes occurred with little or
no public (government and donor) support. If public support had been directed to these areas,
growth would be much faster. The authorities conclude therefore that this is one of the key
challenges for the future.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
April 7, 2004
This statement provides additional information that has become available since the
issuance of the staff report for Zambia. This information, which indicates that
developments have been broadly in line with the targets of the staff-monitored program
(SMP), does not alter the thrust of the staff’s assessment.
•
Preliminary data indicate that through end-February, fiscal revenues and
expenditures were in line with the program and the limit on net domestic financing was
observed. Monetary growth of less than 2 percent for the first two months of 2004 was
slower than programmed. However, external debt-service payments were higher than
expected in the program, reflecting some arrears clearance. The authorities explained that
nonpayment of these arrears could have jeopardized some inflows of external assistance.
In addition, there was a delay in receipt of external budget support. As a result, gross
international reserves at end-February fell short of the adjusted target by US$8 million
and the ceiling on net domestic assets was also exceeded by a small margin.
•
In March, the 12-month rate of inflation stood at 17.6 percent, marginally above
the target in the SMP of 17.4 percent. The kwacha exchange rate against the U.S. dollar
has remained broadly unchanged since end-2003 mainly because of the continuing
favorable external sector developments, particularly the increase in copper prices.
•
The implementation of the structural reforms in the SMP is also broadly on track.
The budget that was passed by parliament on April 2 is consistent with the SMP, and
despite initial strikes in the public sector, the government remains committed to
containing the wage bill to 8 percent of GDP. A draft bill to grant autonomy to the Office
of the Auditor General has been submitted to cabinet, and work on the strategy to clear
the audited stock of arrears is continuing. Finalization of plans to resolve the insolvent
nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs), with technical assistance from the Fund is also
continuing. The awarding of a contract for the procurement of hardware and software for
IFMIS also appears to be on track. All the continuous benchmarks have been observed.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 16, 2004

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Concludes 2003 Article IV Consultation with Zambia and Discusses Ex Post
Assessment of Performance Under Fund-Supported Programs
On April 7, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Zambia.1
Background
Zambia's economic performance has improved significantly in the last four years. After more
than two decades of economic decline and inflation averaging over 50 percent, growth has
averaged about 4 percent per annum since 2000, and inflation has been sharply reduced.
However, macroeconomic stability remains fragile, and faster sustained growth is essential to
tackle pervasive poverty.
In 2002, real GDP grew by 3 percent despite difficulties in the mining sector and the impact of
the severe drought on agricultural output. Drought-induced food shortages also pushed inflation
to 26.7 percent in the 12 months to December 2002. The overall deficit of the central
government narrowed to 6.3 percent of GDP from 8.1 percent in 2001. In the external sector,
the current account deficit, after grants, narrowed to 6.5 percent of GDP from 10.8 percent in
2001, despite a sharp slowdown in the growth of copper exports. Gross international reserves at
the Bank of Zambia rose to 2.2 months of imports in 2002 from 0.9 month at end-2001.
In 2003 fiscal policy implementation deteriorated sharply largely on account of large wage
increases and new housing allowances introduced in April. Against this background, to facilitate
the resolution of this issue and the transition to a new Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2(PRGF) arrangement, understandings were reached on a staff-monitored program (SMP) for
the period July to December 2003 in which the macroeconomic framework was modified to
accommodate part of the higher payments to government employees, while seeking to minimize
inflationary pressures and protect priority expenditures on poverty reduction.
The overall fiscal deficit (after grants) and domestic financing are estimated to have exceeded
the SMP targets by 1½ percent of GDP and 2 percent of GDP, respectively. This reflected large
unbudgeted security-related spending and payment of retrenchment benefits and wage arrears
of 0.8 percent of GDP to facilitate the sale in December of the Luanshya mine. Expenditures on
poverty reducing projects again fell short of budgeted levels. To contain the wage bill, the
government reached agreements with some unions to reduce housing allowances awarded
earlier in the year by two-thirds. Domestic arrears continued to accumulate.
Despite the fiscal slippages, growth picked up and inflation declined in 2003, aided by a
recovery in agricultural production. The increase in real GDP in 2003 is now estimated at
4.2 percent, while the 12-month inflation rate of 17.2 percent in December 2003 was the lowest
since 1982.
Broad money increased by 23.4 percent during 2003, compared with a target of 17 percent in
the SMP, largely because of the widening fiscal deficit. In late October, the Bank of Zambia
eased monetary policy by lowering the cash legal reserve requirements from 17.5 percent to 14
percent with a view to provide banks with additional liquidity for lending to the agricultural sector
and other production sectors. As a result, interest rates on treasury bills, which had remained in
the range of 30-35 percent for most of the year, declined sharply to around 20 percent in
December 2003.
The relatively stable trend in the real effective exchange rate since the mid-990s has continued
in 2003 and supported the growth of nontraditional exports. The nominal effective exchange
rate depreciated by 15 percent.
Reflecting a sharp increase in copper prices and further growth in nontraditional exports, the
current account deficit (after grants) and overall balance of payments deficit are estimated to
have narrowed to 5.9 percent and 7.6 percent of GDP respectively.
Progress in implementing structural reforms was mixed during 2003. A medium-term
expenditure framework (MTEF) was discussed with stakeholders in preparation of the 2004
budget. The Bank of Zambia introduced an interbank foreign exchange market; completed a
draft Financial Sector Development Plan (FSDP), and made some progress toward developing
plans to deal with the insolvent nonbank financial institutions. However, effectiveness of the
strengthened commitment control system was undermined by unanticipated spending
decisions. Delays were also experienced in the procurement of hardware and software for an
integrated financial management and information system (IFMIS) and the preparation of a
multiyear plan for clearing domestic arrears. Negotiations were initiated with the preferred
bidder, for the sale of 49 percent shares and management rights of the Zambia National
Commercial Bank.

The Ex Post Assessment of Performance under Fund-supported programs pointed out that
implementation under the ESAF arrangement, approved in 1995, was poor, but generally
improved under the PRGF arrangement, approved in 1999. Zambia’s mixed record of
implementation has been indicative of incomplete program ownership, limited capacity and
lapses in coordination.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors welcomed the continued improvement in Zambia's economic performance in 2003.
Real GDP is estimated to have increased for the fourth consecutive year, and inflation declined
to its lowest level in two decades. However, Directors noted that this good performance
reflected favorable exogenous developments, including the easing of drought conditions and a
large increase in copper prices, which masked serious shortcomings in policy implementation.
They expressed particular concern about the sharp deterioration in fiscal performance, which
stemmed from overruns in the wage bill and ad hoc spending, and which resulted in
nonobservance of the targets of the 2003 staff-monitored program by wide margins and a sharp
increase in the domestic debt.
Directors noted that the Zambian economy remains fragile, economic growth is below potential,
and macroeconomic stability is yet to be firmly entrenched. Against this background, Directors
emphasized that determined implementation of prudent macroeconomic policies and structural
reforms will be needed over the medium term to boost economic growth, reduce poverty, and
achieve the Millennium Development Goals. Of particular importance will be fiscal adjustment to
achieve fiscal sustainability, increase spending on poverty reduction, and free up resources to
support private investment. Directors also encouraged the authorities to take steps to diversify
the sources of economic growth and exports, with particular emphasis on agricultural
development and exports. Directors urged the authorities to accelerate efforts to meet the HIPC
Initiative completion point triggers, as this is essential for debt sustainability and poverty
reduction.
Directors welcomed parliamentary approval of the authorities' 2004 budget, which aims to
sharply reduce domestic borrowing in order to contain the domestic debt and interest payments.
They agreed that expenditure restraint should be the main basis of fiscal adjustment, and urged
the authorities to ensure that the wage bill was held to 8 percent of GDP as budgeted to provide
more room for priority expenditure. However, Directors welcomed the emphasis on measures to
broaden the base of the value added tax and simplify its administration, and to streamline
exemptions.
Directors also welcomed the progress made in strengthening the expenditure commitment
control system. To ensure further progress, Directors recommended that the system be backed
by tight enforcement of procedures, including sanctions against officials responsible for
overspending and unauthorized re-allocation of funds, and a firm commitment to avoid
unbudgeted spending. They stressed that the Ministry of Finance and National Planning needs

-4to receive full political backing for strict adherence to the budget and avoidance of ad hoc
spending. In this regard, Directors welcomed the extensive consultations within the government
that culminated in cabinet approval of the 2004 budget and the SMP, which will help strengthen
ownership of policies.
Directors commended the recent development of a medium-term expenditure framework as an
important step toward the preparation of more realistic budgets and the setting of expenditure
priorities that are consistent with the goals of the PRSP. In this regard, they welcomed the
intention to contain the government wage bill over the medium term. They considered that
development of a medium-term strategy to "right-size" government operations and complete the
pay reform will be essential to allow priority poverty-reducing expenditure to increase.
Directors urged the authorities to continue working with the World Bank and bilateral donors on
the design of these reforms.
Directors urged the authorities to monitor monetary developments closely, particularly in light of
the recent reduction in interest rates, and to tighten monetary policy, if necessary based on a
more ambitious inflation target. They observed that a sustained reduction in interest rates will
require a durable reduction in government borrowing and inflation, as well as greater efficiency
in the financial sector. They supported maintenance of the flexible exchange rate system to
allow adjustment to changes in Zambia's external circumstances. They welcomed the
introduction of the broad-based inter-bank foreign exchange market.
Directors noted that the financial system is generally sound. They considered the completion of
the Financial Sector Development Plan to be a useful first step toward addressing the concerns
identified in the 2002 Financial System Stability Assessment. They encouraged the authorities
to prioritize the reforms to ensure that urgent issues, such as the insolvency of the nonbank
financial institutions, are addressed in 2004. Directors considered privatization of the Zambia
National Commercial Bank to be an important element of financial sector stability and fiscal
sustainability.
Directors underscored the importance of improving the environment for private sector
development and foreign investment in order to accelerate economic growth. In this regard, they
urged the authorities to give serious consideration to private sector views when revising the
Investment Act, labor legislation, and possibly land legislation. They encouraged completion of
the process of finding a strategic investor in Konkola Copper Mines and commercialization of
the electricity company to enhance efficiency and pre-empt potential strains on the budget.
Directors welcomed the government's efforts to improve governance through the anti-corruption
drive and the enhancement of transparency and accountability in government operations,
including the commitment to adhere to budgetary procedures. They observed that this should
enhance the climate for private sector activities.
Directors concurred with the conclusions of the ex-post assessment of Zambia's performance
under past ESAF/PRGF supported programs. They agreed that another PRGF arrangement will
help Zambia address challenges in macroeconomic management and structural reform.
However, they noted that while Zambia has implemented significant reforms, the impact of

-5these on poverty reduction has been limited. In addition, technical assistance to Zambia
seemed to have limited impact in certain areas. Therefore, Directors stressed that an adequate
track record of policy implementation would first need to be established. They also emphasized
that the authorities will need to demonstrate greater ownership of the economic program and
the PRSP process. In this context, Directors welcomed the generally satisfactory performance
so far under the extended SMP for 2004, and stressed that continued good implementation will
be crucial for Zambia to move as soon as possible to a PRGF arrangement to pave the way for
the country to reach the completion point under the HIPC Initiative, as well as obtain increased
external assistance.

Statement by Ismaila Usman, Executive Director for Zambia
April 7, 2004
1.
The staff papers provide a candid assessment of Zambia’s recent economic and
financial developments, key policy issues, and the outlook over the medium-term. My
Zambian authorities are in broad agreement with the policy recommendations contained in
the report and thank the Fund staff for the constructive dialogue and their valuable policy
advice.
2.
The implementation of the Staff-Monitored Program (SMP) for the period July to
December 2003, proved to be difficult as the impact of strong pressures for unavoidable
additional spending on the fiscal position in 2003 was more adverse than anticipated and a
number of structural reform initiatives took somewhat longer to implement than initially
envisaged.
3.
My Zambian authorities, however, have demonstrated their commitment to the
program policies and objectives, by redoubling their efforts to keep the program on track and
accelerating the pace of reform, particularly through a further tightening of financial policies.
In order to support the continuity of the reform process, the authorities have requested the
extension of the SMP to June 2004. As this extension will provide my authorities the
opportunity to fully return the SMP back to the intended adjustment path, I urge the
Executive Board to support this request.
Recent Economic Developments
4.
The year 2003 was marked by contrasting developments in Zambia. The robust
economic growth at 4.2 percent was broad-based, emanating from the strong recovery in
agricultural production from the drought, as well as from the manufacturing and services
sectors. Inflation, albeit higher than targeted in the SMP, continued to decelerate and reached
the lowest level of the past 20 years. The external current account deficit narrowed to 5.9
percent of GDP compared with the 7.5 percent projected in the SMP, while the real effective
exchange rate remained relatively stable. However, these positive developments were
clouded by strains on the fiscal position, which complicated the task of economic
management.
5.
My authorities are mindful of the fact that the achievement of the of the medium-term
objectives set in the Government’s poverty reduction strategy, of sustained economic growth
and financial viability requires perseverance in the implementation of the reform program to
which they remain fully committed. In this connection, the economic policy for 2004 was
placed in a medium-term context to provide the basis for an early completion of negotiations
on a new multi-year PRGF arrangement with the Fund.
Policy Framework for 2004
6.
The authorities are aware that improvement in the public sector finances is
fundamental to their adjustment strategy, namely to preserving macroeconomic stability and

-2ensuring fiscal sustainability in the medium-term. To that effect, a major fiscal adjustment
effort is being undertaken, including in particular expenditure reforms, designed to generate
domestic primary surpluses to reduce domestic borrowing and interest rates. The authorities
are fully cognizant of the need for stricter adherence to fiscal discipline as signaled in the
budget for 2004, which has just been approved by Parliament. To that effect, in complement
to raising budgetary revenues by broadening the tax base and improving efficiency of the tax
system, efforts will be primarily focused on containing expenditure and ensuring a better
allocation of available resources. In this context, the authorities are determined to pursue the
policy of limiting the government wage bill and nonpriority spending while allowing for an
increase in priority social expenditures. Despite strong opposition from the trade unions, no
general wage increase will be granted in 2004 and the number of civil servants will be
broadly kept at their present level. Additional steps are being taken to ensure that the wage
bill and related payments are kept within the programmed limits, as specified in the annex to
the Letter of Intent of the government. As a result, the overall wage bill is expected to decline
to 8 percent of GDP in 2004, compared with the 8.5 percent in the previous year.
7.
Additional measures will also be taken to curb discretionary spending and
rationalizing some operational costs. It is expected that the current policy will lead to a
reduction in the current expenditures as a ratio of the GDP, from 19.7 percent in 2003 to 18.7
percent in 2004. Despite this fiscal restraint, poverty-related social outlays are expected to
benefit from an increase in the magnitude of 1.1 percentage points of GDP. Capital
expenditures have also been scaled down by 1.2 percentage points of GDP due in large part
to cutbacks in foreign assistance.
8.
The authorities are strongly committed to strengthen monitoring and control systems,
which they view as critical tools to provide early warning signals of any spending deviations
and thus contribute for restoring financial discipline. The authorities regard these measures as
initial steps to launch a more comprehensive reform to rationalize and improve the efficiency
of the civil service. A multi-year plan for clearing the stock of domestic arrears is also in the
process of being finalized. Reflecting the authorities’ strong commitment to contain
expenditures within the program limits, quarterly and monthly expenditure ceilings will be
revised monthly and subject to resource availability and sanctions will be enforced for those
not complying with the established spending procedures.
9.
As a result of the introduction of several revenue enhancement measures, which are
fully described in paragraph 17 of the government’s Memorandum of Economic and
Financial Policies (MEFP) revenue is projected to increase to 19 percent of GDP. The aim is
to broaden the tax base and turn the tax system into a more efficient and effective tool, one
that will positively impact on taxpayer compliance, and therefore, on revenue buoyancy.
Moreover, the authorities are currently developing a new policy for the granting of tax and
other incentives to investors and reviewing the Export processing Zone Act with a view to
protecting revenues from any potential adverse impact of these initiatives. Altogether, these
measures will allow the domestic primary balance to shift from a deficit of 0.7 percent of
GDP in 2003 to a surplus of 2.4 percent in 2004, which reflects a significant and ambitious
consolidation effort.

-310.
Monetary policy for 2004 will remain tight and geared towards ensuring further
reduction in inflation and attainment of the international reserves target. To that effect, the
growth of broad money will be limited to about 18 percent through Bank of Zambia’s use of
indirect instruments of monetary control. The envisaged reduction in the government’s
reliance on financing from the banking system will provide room for a significant increase in
credit to the private sector. Efforts to deepen financial intermediation and increase access to
financing for private sector activities – on which future growth and employment prospects
will depend - including in particular, for farmers and small-scale entrepreneurs will need to
be pursued. In this respect, my authorities are particularly concerned with the absence of
viable and sustainable financial services for the majority of the rural population effectively
involved in agricultural production but lacking the financial support. The authorities will
welcome advice and assistance from the Fund and the World Bank to design a meaningful
but sustainable method of financing the activities of this segment of the productive
population to boost the prospects of growth in agriculture, which will be critical for
preventing food shortages and increase in poverty levels.
11.
The prevalence of high level of commercial lending rates remains a matter of major
concern to the authorities given its negative impact on economic growth and prospects for
diversification of production. They are hopeful that the significant reduction in domestic
borrowing requirements and increased competition in the banking system that will result
from the partial sale of the Zambia National Commercial Bank (ZNCB) to a private investor,
will contribute to easing the pressures on interest rates. The exchange rate will continue to be
determined by market forces and the central bank’s intervention in the foreign exchange
market will be limited to smoothing short-term fluctuations and meeting the international
reserves target.
12.
The authorities intend to press ahead with the structural reform agenda with the aim
of further reducing the government’s role in the economy by assigning a more prominent role
to private sector activity to promote economic growth and diversification, and improve
allocative efficiency. To this effect, several actions are being taken, including strengthening
the public expenditure management as cited above, addressing the weaknesses in the
financial system aimed at improving the efficiency, soundness, and competitiveness of the
banking sector, and taking the necessary steps to finalize the commercialization of the
electricity utility, ZESCO. Moreover, steps are being taken to review key land, labor, and
investment regulations in order to improve the legal environment for private sector activities.
13.
The external situation is expected to strengthen over the medium-term, with the
support of tighter financial policies and stronger export performance particularly of the
copper sector but also of the nonmining sectors. The authorities, however, realize that this
encouraging outlook could be undermined by a possible decline in copper prices. Zambia’s
trade regime remains among the least restrictive. As indicated in the staff report, Zambia’s
large external debt overhang remains a serious impediment to more rapid growth and
sustainable poverty reduction. My authorities are strongly determined to implement the
ambitious financial policies and structural reforms outlined in the revised SMP, hoping that it
would soon lead to a new PRGF arrangement to support their strong commitment to address
the remaining challenges in their reform efforts. The ex-post assessment makes reference to a

-4mixed record of implementation of policies and reforms but also recognizes that too
optimistic and even overambitious program targets may be the reasons behind some of the
policy slippages. More realistic program assumptions that are also consistent with the
country’s human and financial capacity to implement would, therefore, be a more advisable
approach and would increase the chances of a more successful implementation of the reform
program.
14.
An early consideration of the new PRGF will also be critical to Zambia to help
catalyze adequate external donor support to assist Zambia in meeting its poverty reduction
goals. It is also important for Zambia as it would help the country to pave the way towards
reaching the completion point under the HIPC Initiative preferably before end-2004, which
will enable the authorities to meet the large debt-service obligations due to the Fund in 2005.
The success of their ongoing reform efforts and fight against poverty will largely depend on
the timely availability of external financial resources including effective debt relief. On their
part, the authorities have reiterated their strong resolve to stay the course of reform.
