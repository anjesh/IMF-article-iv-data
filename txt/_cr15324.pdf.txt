IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Islamic Republic of
Afghanistan
On November 18, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.
Since 2002, Afghanistan has made important strides in building its economy, infrastructure and
institutions, supported by large aid flows. Afghanistan’s Human Development Index (HDI)
increased by about 2.5 percent annually between 2000 and 2013, higher than average HDI
growth in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Afghanistan has also established and maintained
macroeconomic stability, implemented important structural reforms, and built policy buffers—
namely a comfortable international reserves position, low debt, and inflation. Nonetheless,
Afghanistan remains a poor fragile state far from self-reliance; donor grants finance the budget
and external current account deficits. Afghanistan ranks 194 out of 213 countries by GNI per
capita in 2013 (World Bank Atlas method). A large illicit narcotics sector, difficult security
conditions, corruption and weak institutions undermine development, constrain growth, and
weigh on poverty reduction.
Afghanistan had its first democratic transfer of political power in 2014 and the new national
unity government wishes to tackle Afghanistan’s challenges. At the December 2014 London
Conference, the international community welcomed plans to enhance productivity, stimulate
private sector-led growth and mobilize domestic revenue, and reaffirmed their engagement with
Afghanistan. Donors and the authorities also agreed on a Self-Reliance through Mutual
Accountability Framework (SMAF) in September 2015, which will help sustain international
support.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
Significant fiscal and banking vulnerabilities emerged in 2014. Domestic revenue collection fell
below its 2013 level because of lower growth, declining imports, and lower compliance, while
operating expenditure increased. The treasury cash balance fell to dangerously low levels in the
second half of 2014 and domestic payment arrears and unfunded allotments emerged. In
addition, the financial positions of some banks deteriorated in early 2014. Two important banks
were in a hazardous condition.
IMF management approved a Staff-Monitored Program (SMP) in May 2015. The SMP (April–
December 2015) aims at addressing fiscal and banking vulnerabilities, preserving
macroeconomic stability, laying the ground for inclusive growth, and building a track record for
a future IMF financial arrangement. The first review of the SMP was approved by IMF
management earlier this month.
Donor support and policy actions under the SMP helped address these vulnerabilities in 2015.
Despite weak economic activity and limited revenues from new measures, domestic revenues
increased in the first nine months of 2015 because of improved compliance and the treasury’s
cash balance improved. Corrective measures against all weak banks started to be implemented in
2015 and decisive actions were taken to strengthen the two vulnerable banks. More generally,
important progress was made in structural reform, with some delays. A new banking law and
amendments to the anti-money laundering law were adopted while steps were taken to improve
capacity of revenue and customs departments and the sale of New Kabul Bank has been restarted.
Nevertheless, political and security uncertainties have been a drag on economic activity in 2015.
The delays in appointing a new government have delayed policy decisions and attacks by
insurgents have slowed the economic recovery. Apart from agriculture, economic activity has
been subdued. In 2014, real GDP growth declined to 1.3 percent and end-period inflation fell to
1.4 percent y-o-y. Inflation declined further to -1.9 percent y-o-y in September 2015, reflecting
soft economic activity and lower global fuel and food prices.
The future path of the economy is highly dependent on the authorities’ delivering on their
economic reform commitments, continued donor support, and improvements in security.
Although the initial impact of the drawdown of international troops is over, economic activity
remains subdued. The authorities’ ability to navigate this new landscape will determine the
development path in the transformation decade (2015–2024). The government has expressed a
strong commitment to reform and building a healthy economy to benefit all Afghans. It is
paramount that reform policies are implemented to avoid compromising the hard-worked
achievements to date, strong efforts will yield high returns, and inaction carries major risks.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They welcomed the important
strides Afghanistan has made toward raising living standards, rebuilding infrastructure and
institutions, establishing and maintaining macroeconomic stability, and implementing structural
reforms. Directors noted the country’s first democratic transfer of political power and welcomed
the new national unity government’s resolve to tackle the country’s challenges. They were
encouraged by the good progress in policy implementation under the staff-monitored program
despite continued security challenges, weak confidence, and fragile institutions, which hold back
economic performance. Directors commended the authorities’ commitment to reform and
economic transformation, but stressed that strong and sustained efforts, together with better
security conditions and continued donor support, are needed to ensure high and inclusive growth.
Directors considered the macroeconomic policy mix to be appropriate and emphasized the need
to improve confidence by strengthening policy implementation. They agreed that the fiscal
position, including grants, should continue to remain broadly balanced to ensure sustainability,
and that budget management should be improved to increase pro-poor and development
expenditures. Directors underscored the need for monetary policy to continue to foster
confidence in the domestic currency, including by developing domestic-currency denominated
instruments, and welcomed the authorities’ continued commitment to a flexible exchange rate
regime.
Considering Afghanistan’s high dependence on donor grants, Directors underscored the need to
improve revenue mobilization. They recommended introducing new taxes, strengthening revenue
administration, and improving the tax policy mix. Over the medium term, introducing a VAT,
additional excises and property taxes, developing a fiscal regime for natural resource taxation,
and improving enforcement and compliance will be important. Directors also noted the need to
prioritize and increase the efficiency of spending. A few Directors saw room for financing
high-return infrastructure projects, while a few others recommended caution in acquiring new
debt, in order to preserve debt sustainability.
Directors welcomed the progress in bank restructuring, improvements of the regulatory and
supervisory framework, and passage of the new banking law and the anti-money laundering and
countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) laws. They noted that continued efforts are
needed to strengthen the banking system and promote financial deepening. They welcomed the
offer for sale of New Kabul Bank and stressed the need for a swift strengthening of vulnerable
and weak banks. Directors encouraged vigorous implementation of the new banking and

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

AML/CFT laws and regulations, and a further strengthening of the central bank’s supervision
capacity.
Directors stressed the importance of sustained governance reforms to boost confidence and
improve the business environment, including through stepping up anti-corruption measures,
enhancing institutional capacity, and continued strengthening of the AML/CFT regime. Directors
urged the authorities to advance key aspects of their plan to promote inclusive growth.
Directors welcomed the candid ex post assessment of Fund long-term work in Afghanistan. They
noted that Fund engagement has facilitated the establishment and maintenance of
macroeconomic stability and donor support. However, security challenges have led to
higher-than-projected security expenditure, delaying the attainment of fiscal sustainability.
Volatile aid flows have also complicated policymaking. Looking ahead, Directors stressed the
need to focus on macro-critical structural reforms while being mindful of implementation
capacity and institutional constraints. They also emphasized the need for realistic assumptions
for aid flows and security, stronger donor coordination, continued capacity building, and stronger
ownership of reforms.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan will
be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND THE FIRST REVIEW UNDER THE STAFF-MONITORED
PROGRAM

KEY ISSUES
Context. Since 2002, Afghanistan has made important strides in building its economy,
infrastructure and institutions, supported by large aid flows and despite security
challenges. The first democratic transfer of political power that occurred in late 2014
provided a distinct chance to renew impetus in economic reforms on the basis of a clear
and ambitious agenda proposed by the new national unity government. However,
security challenges and delays in policy implementation during the new government’s
settling-in period have held back a recovery in economic confidence, which has
weakened economic growth performance, and, more recently, spurred an acceleration in
migrant outflows. The IMF is supporting Afghanistan through technical assistance and a
staff monitored program.
Outlook and risks. The authorities have a clear plan for the “transformation decade”
(2015–24), which is within reach, providing they implement economic reforms to build
confidence in the economy, donors continue their support, and security improves. The
main challenge is to boost confidence and co-operation among all stakeholders and
thus solidify the hard-won achievements to date and build reform momentum to
improve living standards for all Afghans. Risks are mostly on the downside and are
related to adverse domestic or regional security developments, political instability,
inadequate implementation of economic policies, and donor fatigue.
Policy recommendations. The macroeconomic policy mix remains appropriate. The
fiscal balance including grants should continue to remain broadly balanced to ensure
sustainability; efforts should be stepped up to mobilize domestic revenue, prioritize
spending and further improve budget management. Monetary policy needs to continue
to foster confidence in the domestic currency, including by pursuing its commitment to
a flexible exchange rate regime while maintaining orderly market conditions. Strong
efforts are needed to implement vigorously the new banking, AML, and CFT laws and
their regulations. Efforts to strengthen the business climate to pave the way for private
sector-led, inclusive and gender-balanced growth need to continue.

CONTEXT
1.
Afghanistan is at an inflection point that will shape the country’s landscape for the
years ahead. Since 2002, large aid flows supported reconstruction and growth and Afghanistan has
made important strides in building its economy, infrastructure and institutions. Afghanistan’s Human
Development Index (HDI) increased by about 2.5 percent annually between 2000 and 2013, above
average HDI growth in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Notwithstanding this strong progress,
Afghanistan has experienced an extended period of political and security uncertainty, which has held
back economic activity and, more recently, led to increased emigration.
2.
Afghanistan remains a poor fragile state far from self-reliance; donor grants finance
the budget and external current account deficits. Afghanistan ranks 194 out of 213 countries by
GNI per capita in 2013 (World Bank Atlas method). A large illicit narcotics sector, difficult security
conditions, corruption and weak institutions undermine development, constrain growth, and weigh
on poverty reduction.
3.
Afghanistan had its first democratic transfer of political power in 2014. The new
national unity government wishes to tackle Afghanistan’s challenges. At the December 2014 London
Conference, the international community welcomed plans to enhance productivity, stimulate private
sector-led growth and mobilize domestic revenue, and reaffirmed their engagement with
Afghanistan. The authorities committed to deliver on their commitments ahead of the
September 5, 2015 Senior Officials Meeting (SOM).1
4.
IMF management approved a Staff-Monitored Program (SMP) for Afghanistan in May
2015. The SMP (April–December 2015) aims at addressing fiscal and banking vulnerabilities,
preserving macroeconomic stability, laying the ground for inclusive growth, and building a track
record for a future IMF financial arrangement.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
5.
Political and security uncertainties have been a drag on economic activity. The security
situation has become increasingly difficult. At the same time, there were delays in the formation of a
full administration. These developments made policy making harder, slowed the economic recovery,
and contributed to increased emigration in recent months. Apart from agriculture, economic activity
has been subdued. In 2014, real GDP growth declined to 1.3 percent and end-period inflation fell to
1.4 percent y-o-y. Inflation declined further to -1.9 percent y-o-y in September 2015, reflecting soft
economic activity and lower global fuel and food prices.

This SOM was held on September 5, 2015 in Kabul. The meeting was a continuation of the high-level meetings held
every year to follow up on the Tokyo Conference (July 2012). This was the first high level meeting since the December
2014 London Conference on Afghanistan. The purpose of the meeting was to review progress since the presentation
of the Self-Reliance reform program, discuss key policy issues, and to jointly decide the way forward.

Significant fiscal vulnerabilities emerged in 2014. Domestic revenue collection fell below
its 2013 level because of lower growth, declining imports, and lower compliance. Operating
expenditure increased, as off-budget security-related spending was moved on budget (with donor
grant financing), and because of new benefits for families of martyrs and disabled people. The
government had to reduce discretionary development and operating and maintenance (O&M)
spending. The treasury cash balance fell to dangerously low levels in the second half of 2014 and
domestic payment arrears and unfunded allotments emerged.

the Afghani increased and reserves were lost, as higher emigration boosted foreign exchange
demand.
Box 1. The Impact of Accelerating Emigration
Background. According to the 2014 UNHCR Regional Overview, after more than three decades of
displacement, Afghan refugees still constituted over 21 per cent of the global refugee population and
40 percent of the world’s protracted caseload. In addition, there are a large number of undocumented
Afghans residing abroad, of which at least 2 million in Iran and Pakistan. Since 2002, over 5.8 million Afghan
refugees have returned home voluntarily, but, in recent years, voluntary return has decreased significantly,
hitting a historical low in 2013–14.
Recent developments. The difficult economic and security conditions and uncertainties continue to affect
the decision to return by Afghan refugees and, in some cases, induce reverse movements. Whereas attacks
by insurgents have been ongoing during past years, they have recently escalated, especially in the north of
the country. Moreover, there are reports of criminal activity (particularly kidnapping). Anecdotal evidence
indicates the number of emigrants to countries in the region and beyond has risen in 2015, accelerating over
the past few months. There are reports of a sharp increase in the number of passport applications from the
start of the year, of coaches reaching the Iranian borders, and of asylum requests in EU countries.
Policy challenges. The most visible short-term challenge results from emigrants’ attempts to liquidate their
assets before leaving Afghanistan, which has increased substantially the demand for foreign currency; DAB
has met this increased demand partly through sale of foreign exchange and partly vented through
depreciation of the exchange rate. While data on the level of extra demand for hard currency cash are not
available, it is likely that each migrant nucleus would seek to gather between $5,000 and $10,000 on
average. This higher demand for foreign exchange, if sustained, will likely put downward pressure on DAB’s
international reserves position, with the risk of eroding confidence in macroeconomic stability. Further, it
may give rise to pressure for additional budget expenditure to incentivize potential migrants to stay in
Afghanistan. In addition, departures of emigrants, especially if well educated, will affect Afghanistan’s human
capital base and labor force skills. In the context of inelastic public expenditure due to large security and
development spending needs, budget revenue losses related to emigrants may also create fiscal pressures.
IMF’s role. By assisting the authorities to maintain economic stability, reduce vulnerabilities, improve the
business climate, and promote inclusive growth, the IMF is working with the Afghan authorities to create
conditions for a sustainable and voluntary reintegration of those who have left and an incentive to stay for
those who have not. In this context, the Fund will continue to be flexible with program design to reflect
unanticipated shocks and speed of policy implementation, and partner with the donor community with a
view to supporting the authorities’ efforts to build a resilient, vibrant, and successful economy and, if
needed, to mobilize donor financing to the budget to help deal with fiscal costs of emigrants.

9.
Banking sector vulnerabilities emerged in 2014. Weak governance and regulatory
forbearance in 2014 led to a deterioration in the financial positions of some banks. Seven of the
15 banks were classified as weak (rated 4 or 5 according to CAMEL methodology) and hold
50 percent of bank assets. Two important banks were in hazardous conditions. In late 2014,
corrective measures started to be implemented and in 2015, enforcement actions against all weak
banks were in place and decisive actions were taken to strengthen the two vulnerable banks.

Box 2. The Authorities’ Response to Past IMF Advice
Past IMF advice has focused on the overall macroeconomic policy mix, tax policy and tax administration,
strengthening banking supervision, exchange rate flexibility, and improving economic governance by enacting
anti-money laundering (AML), countering financing of terrorism (CFT), banking and central bank legislation.
While the main economic strategy has not changed, Fund staff has been willing to delay meeting some of the
structural benchmarks because of capacity constraints. The authorities have been broadly responsive to Fund
advice, but the prolonged political transition resulted in delayed or incomplete implementation of some
macroeconomic policies and reforms.
The authorities have maintained macroeconomic stability but fiscal and monetary policy advice was
not fully followed. As a result, fiscal performance deteriorated and reserve money targets were missed in
2014. Operating expenditures increased despite the deterioration in domestic revenue collection, and the
treasury cash balance dropped to dangerously low levels while domestic budgetary arrears emerged. The
authorities have increased their reserve buffers in 2014 and the exchange rate against the U.S. dollar was
broadly stable. The authorities allowed for more exchange rate flexibility in 2015.
Domestic revenue collection fell short of targets in 2014 but recovered in the first half of 2015.
Domestic revenue collection slipped to 8.5 percent of GDP in 2014 from 11 percent in 2011. Budget revenue
has started to recover in the 2015, as compliance efforts were stepped up. On tax reform, the authorities
have implemented revenue measures under the SMP, but the introduction of some measures was delayed.
VAT introduction was postponed in response to the authorities’ concerns and staff’s assessment that the tax
administration needed time to prepare for a successful VAT introduction.
The authorities have taken action to strengthen the financial sector. DAB stepped up its supervision
efforts in the second half of 2014 and took action against weak banks including enforcement actions against
two vulnerable banks. DAB also approved a strategy of dealing with weak banks with a view to improve
banking sector’s CAMEL ratings by February 2016. The authorities have cut losses in New Kabul Bank and
initiated its resale. The new banking law has been enacted. Further, DAB continues to implement Financial
Supervision Department’s (FSD) five-year strategic plan, launched in July 2013. FSD is also revising banking
regulations to implement the new banking law. Amendments to the DAB law are being reviewed by the
Ministry of Justice.
The authorities have strengthened the AML/CFT legal framework and reopened Kabul Bank
investigation. Amendments to the AML and CFT laws were introduced by presidential decree to improve
compliance with Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards and regulations on AML/CFT measures and fit
and proper requirements for the financial sector were issued by DAB. The authorities have also taken
measures to improve the regulatory regime to monitor the cross border transportation of currency. A
presidential decree was issued to reinvigorate asset recovery efforts and initiated a review of criminal cases
in October 2014 that resulted in increased jail terms and fines for two large Kabul Bank shareholders.

10.
Kabul Bank asset recovery has continued. A presidential decree was issued in October
2014 to expedite asset recovery and review criminal cases. Between January 31 and August 31, 2015,
cash recoveries amounted to $16.9 million bringing total cash recoveries to $191 million.2 The
authorities continue to follow up on the requests for mutual legal assistance that were sent to
a number of foreign jurisdictions to facilitate asset recovery.

2

Other recoveries have also been made, totaling $114 million from sale of assets to the government and noncash
recoveries.

11.
Important legal reforms for the financial sector were enacted. Amendments to the antimoney laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) laws were approved by the
President in April 2015.3 The banking law was enacted in August 2015. Further, DAB issued two
regulations on AML/CFT measures and fit and proper requirements for the financial sector.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
12.
The macroeconomic outlook is uncertain. The future path of the economy depends highly
on the authorities delivering on their economic reform commitments, continued donor support, and
improvements in security. The new government presented its Self-Reliance through Mutual
Accountability Framework (SMAF) to donors in September 2015, which puts restoring fiscal
sustainability through increasing revenues as one of the main priorities.4 Although the initial impact
of the drawdown of international troops has ended, economic activity is subdued and investor
confidence remains low.
13.
The medium-term macroeconomic framework projects a recovery in growth. This path,
however, reflects a slower recovery in economic confidence and later implementation of mining
projects than projected earlier. Growth is expected to gain steam, with mining related activity, from
2018 onwards, bringing average annual GDP growth to 5 percent during 2016–20. Delivering on
commitments under the SMAF and associated donor support should help cover fiscal and external
gaps. Inflation is expected to stay in single digits with stable international prices and prudent
monetary policy.

3

By virtue of Article 79 of Afghan Constitution, laws passed by Presidential Decree have to be submitted to
Parliament and remain in force unless rejected.

assessment of the likelihood of realization in the next three years.

14.
Staff discussed with the authorities interconnections and spillovers for Afghanistan.
The principal connection between the Afghan economy and the rest of the world are donor inflows.
These inflows finance most imports and dwarf (licit) exports, financial sector, and foreign direct
investment. Regional developments affecting security and trade have a more limited impact on the
Afghan economy. However, outward spillovers from Afghanistan are possible if a political impasse
led to internal conflict, and a displaced population, internally and in neighboring countries, with
lower trade and costs for countries receiving Afghan refugees. Recent signs of acceleration in
migrant outflows are therefore of concern for the potential impact both on the stability of the local
economy and on the number of refugees in the region. Looking forward, the authorities would need
to assess how this recent acceleration of outflows, if unabated, could affect the fiscal position.
15.
Afghanistan’s economy faces risks; many, but not all, are on the downside. The
principal near- and medium-term risks stem from security, inadequate policy implementation and
lack of progress in reform, slower growth in emerging market economies, especially China and India,
or donor fatigue (see the accompanying debt sustainability analysis (DSA) paper). If realized they
would reduce inflows and budget revenue, causing lower growth, employment, and investment, as
well as possible exchange rate pressures. An upside risk is a political agreement with insurgents that
results in higher confidence, investment, and economic activity. Also, the lifting of economic
sanctions on Iran could benefit the Afghan economy through a boost to exports and an increase in
remittances.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS: STRENGTHENING CONFIDENCE
NOW FOR ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION
16.
The overarching theme of the Article IV consultation is for Afghanistan to build
confidence in its economy now. Afghanistan faces landmark transition challenges. The number
one priority and challenge for the government is to convince their people that their economic
strategy is viable, that it will yield the envisaged results, and that it requires collaboration and
perseverance from all Afghans. Confidence is required to foster domestic demand and foreign
investment, to help DAB deliver price stability, and, more generally, to manage Afghanistan’s
transformation into a self-reliant, inclusive, and growing modern economy. The authorities’ ability to
navigate this new landscape will determine the development path in the transformation decade
(2015–24). It is paramount that reform policies are implemented to maintain the hard-won
achievements to date: strong efforts will yield high returns and inaction carries major risks.
17.
The authorities are well aware of these challenges and remain committed to their
reform agenda. They noted that the new government’s structure and clarification of roles and
responsibilities had resulted in a settling-in period to assure broad-based support for reforms within
government and the population. At the recent SOM, the President and Chief Executive Officer
reiterated their commitment to proceed, including in the period before the 2016 Brussels donor
meeting, with the political, economic, governance, and social reforms to take Afghanistan towards
peace, stability, and self-reliance. Reform implementation will be monitored by the President, Chief
Executive Officer, Cabinet of Ministers, and civil society. Further, the government plans to prepare a
medium-term reform plan by December 2015 based on its 12 national priority programs. The
authorities and staff agreed that reforms need to be tailored to institutions’ capacity and the macro
framework based on realistic assumptions, while continued IMF engagement and support from
donors will remain critical.5

A.

Inclusive Growth and Productivity

18.
Afghanistan has made progress toward Millennium Development Goals, but more is
needed. Access to primary healthcare has increased from 9 percent to 57 percent of population and
over nine million students have been enrolled. Maternal health, child mortality and universal primary
education indicators are at or close to 2015 targets. Pro-poor spending doubled between 2011 and
2014, reaching above 3 percent of GDP. However, poverty reduction remains a priority.6 Experience
shows that growth has been more successful in reducing poverty when policies have been in place
to deal with the risks, vulnerabilities and market failures that hold back participation, which are
constraints in Afghanistan. In this regard, the authorities plan to review how fiscal policy contributes
to inclusive growth and poverty reduction, and tailor policies to boosting growth well above the

Total donor support is projected to stay near current levels this decade. An increasing share of donor support will
be provided on-budget, as the government takes over management of donor-financed projects that were earlier
donor-managed.

population growth rate while protecting the poor by shifting the composition of expenditures
towards civilian spending and making taxes more equitable and growth friendly.
19.
There was a shared vision of private sector-led, inclusive, and gender balanced growth
based on a business-friendly environment. The political transition limited progress in 2014, but
the authorities are determined to push ahead with reforms. They noted that policies to develop the
private sector should focus on providing incentives that generate pro-poor outcomes and create
jobs, which, unlike subsidies, can offer a sustainable source of income. They shared staff views that
pro-poor policies should be directed to eliminate regulatory and administrative barriers for
businesses, improve infrastructure, provide key business services, while strengthening governance,
as signaled in the papers they prepared for the December 2014 conference and the September
2015 SOM. They flagged the initial steps taken included a younger, more professional Cabinet of
Ministers, Public Financial Management Reform, and plan to reform the public administration. In
addition, a policy on sub-national governance will be presented to Cabinet before the end of
2015 and the Cabinet will review concept notes on National Women’s Economic Empowerment Plan,
Citizens’ Charter, Urban Development Program, and Rural Development by mid-2016. The
authorities plan to reform licensing and registration, unify the system for trade and investment
licenses, and establish a one-stop-shop for private businesses, and clarify the roles of the
Afghanistan Investment Support Agency and Ministry of Commerce and Industry. They plan to
amend the Land Management and Land Acquisition Laws to introduce orderly land markets and
prepare a national infrastructure development plan to build domestic and regional connectivity.
They have established a national procurement board to manage all high value contracts and
conducted a review of customs and revenue staffing. Staff will continue to discuss TA needs to
support implementation of the authorities’ ambitious reform agenda.
20.
Over the medium term, potential growth will depend on the authorities’ ability to
develop strategic sectors. The authorities wish to increase productivity, build institutions to
regulate and enable markets, use private public partnerships and development policy to ensure
government activities promote inclusive economic development. They consider agriculture,
extractive industries, and transport as the main pillars of their inclusive and sustainable growth
strategy, which, over time, should be private sector led. Staff concurs. Raising agricultural
productivity by reforming land management, developing sectoral strategies for irrigation, and
removing barriers that prevent farmers from selling their products are the main priorities as
agriculture is the largest source of job creation.7 Further, the authorities believe that investing in
infrastructure to strengthen Afghanistan’s position at the centre of South and Central Asia will allow
it to benefit from increased trade, investment, and connectivity. The mining sector has the potential
to attract foreign investment, raise revenues, and lift the local economy. In this context, staff
welcomed the authorities’ indication that they, after clarification of the legal and strategic

source of shocks to the economy.

framework, wish to proceed with the appropriate exploitation of Afghanistan’s mineral resources, to
ensure that these resources benefit all Afghans.
21.
Staff agreed that sustained, inclusive, and gender-balanced growth will require
improved competitiveness and productivity. Afghanistan’s exports need to be raised significantly
and diversified; the discipline imposed by having to export will provide the necessary stimulus for
innovation and good management practices. At the same time, unrelenting progress in structural
reforms to strengthen governance and foster private sector development and investment remains
crucial. This should contribute to investment and job creation to allow Afghanistan to absorb new
labor market entrants over the medium term and support stronger domestic demand. To
complement these efforts, the authorities also plan to support Afghans, who wish to explore
employment opportunities abroad.

Further, they see scope for higher remittances from Afghans working abroad and expect to receive
revenue from the Central Asia South Asia Electricity Transmission and Trade Project (CASA-1000)
and Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India Natural Gas Pipeline (TAPI) later this decade. Staff
noted that revenue from these sources would strengthen the external current account (before
grants), but the timing and amount of these receipts were subject to some uncertainty depending
on demand for Afghans to work abroad and speed of CASA-100 and TAPI implementation.

assessment of the exchange rate’s level is hindered
by inadequate balance of payments data, the multi-year civil conflict, very large aid flows, high
dollarization, and a large informal sector including narcotics production. Structural impediments
weigh heavily on Afghanistan’s competitiveness (see below). The authorities noted that the high
level of dollarization and inadequate balance of payments data made the exchange rate assessment
difficult.

C.

Fiscal Outlook and Debt Sustainability

25.
Afghanistan needs to mobilize domestic revenue to ensure fiscal sustainability and
reduce donor dependence. Low compliance has taken a toll on domestic revenue in recent years.
Domestic revenues peaked at 11 percent of GDP in 2011 and subsequently declined to 8.5 percent
of GDP in 2014 (covering only about one third of spending), remain significantly lower than regional
and low-income countries (LICs) averages. Donors’ grants finance the bulk of security expenditure
and part of spending related to service delivery, infrastructure development, and operations and
maintenance. Staff highlighted that spending to support strong and inclusive growth will need
success in revenue mobilization and that the country’s development and growth-and-welfareenhancing reforms necessitate a sustainable fiscal framework. Staff noted that the authorities’ ability
to implement countercyclical fiscal policy remains contingent on strengthening debt service
capacity and, while this capacity remains limited in the medium to long term, the overall budget
balance needs to remain close to zero.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

26.
Mobilizing domestic revenue requires introducing new taxes, strengthening revenue
administration, and improving the tax policy mix. Staff stressed that continued medium-term
revenue mobilization efforts will be needed by introducing VAT, additional excises and property
taxes, developing natural resources, reducing exemptions, and improving enforcement and
compliance. Staff projects the revenue measures introduced in 2015 to mobilize revenue of around
1 percent of GDP per year in the medium term. With continued improvement in revenue
administration, VAT introduction, and development of the mining sector towards the end of the
decade, staff projects revenues to reach 13 percent of GDP by 2020. Enhanced anti-corruption
efforts in revenue collection will be critical to minimize leakages, improve compliance, and boost
public confidence.
27.
The mining sector presents a promising source of fiscal revenue. Mining projects have
been delayed as contracts wait to be signed or renegotiated in light of declining international prices.
The development of the sector has also been hampered by ongoing instability, and inadequate
infrastructure, impeding exports. Despite the delays, the authorities are working to develop a
transparent fiscal regime for extractive industries in full compliance with the EITI, including with the
support of FAD TA. Staff supported the authorities’ objective to ensure a sound fiscal regime is in
place while the sector develops, and underscored the need to develop the mining sector in an
environmentally friendly manner and in consultation with civil society.
28.
Prioritizing growing spending needs is also essential. Operating expenditures have

donor-financed capital spending. They noted their limited discretion over spending because a large
part of donor-financed outlays were directed to specific purposes, which constrained their ability to
make spending poverty reducing, growth and employment generating. Staff discussed with the
authorities ways to prioritize spending and make it more efficient, especially in the civil service
sector, and stressed the need to reverse the declining trend in the coverage of operating expenses
by domestic revenue.
29.
Debt remains modest but Afghanistan’s reliance on grants to meet its expenditure
needs poses sustainability risks. The Afghan government does not have domestic debt and its
external public and publicly guaranteed debt amounted to $1.3 billion, or 6.4 percent of GDP, at
end-2014, most of which is owed to multilateral creditors. Under the baseline scenario, with strong
reform effort and donor support, improved security and reduced uncertainty, debt is sustainable.
However, there are significant vulnerabilities; should reforms stall, security deteriorate, or grant
financing fall short of the projected levels, Afghanistan will need to implement significant
compensatory measures or the debt burden would quickly become unsustainable. Under a scenario
of low grant financing, the present value of public debt reaches over 130 percent of GDP by the end
of the projection period. Afghanistan’s external debt is low, but given its heavy reliance on grant
financing, according to the IMF-World Bank framework, public external debt is judged to remain at
high risk of distress (See DSA).10
30.
The authorities agreed with the need to mobilize revenue and prioritize spending to
move towards fiscal sustainability and self-reliance. They reaffirmed their commitment to
continue to mobilize revenue with revenue measures and customs and revenue administration
reforms, and noted that they wished to use growth-friendly tax measures and were concerned that
higher tax rates could result in a surge in evasion and, hence, lower revenues. They noted building a
revenue base requires growth and revenue generating strategic sectors, such as energy and
transportation. They are preparing a borrowing policy to finance high return projects, to maintain a
low level of debt, and plan to seek staff views on the policy, as it is prepared. They believe public
sector investment in strategic sectors can yield high economic and social returns and wish to
consider use of loans, private public partnerships, and build operate transfer arrangements. Staff
cautioned about contracting loans and contingent liabilities given Afghanistan’s very limited debt
service capacity, the risk of crowding out grants and, poverty-reducing and development outlays.
Further, staff indicated that an independent appraisal of projects, their transparent inclusion in the
budget and associated liabilities, and an assessment of their impact on debt sustainability are
crucial.

the Afghani and the high degree of dollarization of the economy make it harder for DAB to project
money demand and to conduct its open market operations. DAB considered that the current
monetary and exchange rate regime, which aims at delivering low inflation, while ensuring orderly
conditions in the foreign exchange market, has served well, despite recent pressures. DAB is also
considering how to increase use of the Afghani. Staff encouraged DAB to strengthen its
communication strategy to clarify the monetary policy framework (objective and instruments) with a
view to fostering public understanding of and confidence in DAB’s actions. DAB indicated it plans to
continue regular communications including press releases after Supreme Council meetings and its
quarterly bulletin.
32.
Monetary operations are also hindered by limited instruments. At present, capital notes
are the only domestic currency-denominated instruments issued by the DAB to steer monetary
conditions, but their absorption is limited by banks’ liquidity. The need for DAB both to provide
U.S. dollar liquidity to the economy to finance current account transactions and to sell U.S. dollars at
its regular auctions to mop up liquidity, in the absence of a deep market for capital notes, risks
blurring monetary policy signals. Moving forward, and as confidence in the Afghani improves, the
DAB should gradually increase its use of domestic currency-denominated instruments for open
market operations. Staff discussed the scope for developing such instruments, including sukuk, and
further TA. The authorities signaled their desire to broaden the range of monetary instruments (see
below) and asked the IMF to provide TA in this area.

E.

Financial Sector

33.
Financial intermediation needs to become more efficient and broad-based. The
authorities wish to build a strong financial sector to increase access to finance, assure safety for
depositors, enhance trade finance, and improve intermediation. They are cognizant of the need to
improve banking sector profitability.11 As banking system weaknesses are addressed, the authorities
expect that credit availability should increase from its low base, though they recognize that the low
private credit reflects the scarcity of profitable and appropriately collateralized lending opportunities
and structural challenges. Staff recommended that policies to promote credit should address
structural issues rather than interventions aimed at forcing banks to lend. The authorities wish to
promote lending to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and agriculture while developing
microfinance to support growth and job creation. They wish to increase the types of financial
instruments available, including Islamic ones for which they see considerable scope, to promote
development of capital markets and the trading of financial products, for use as risk management
tools, and to attract investment. To this end, the authorities are finalizing some Islamic banking
regulations. Further, DAB is preparing a registry of immovable property collateral and the Supreme
Court has recently approved simplified procedures to auction collateral. DAB is also promoting use
11

For the year to July 2015, banks turned in an aggregate loss ($13.6 million) due to large provision expenses and
continuing losses of state-owned banks. At end-July 2015, the banking system—comprised twelve licensed
commercial banks and three licensed branches of foreign banks, with 197 full-service and 213 limited-service bank
branches throughout the country—had total assets of $4.3 billion and deposits of $3.7 billion. Net loans constituted
16.8 percent of total assets and the loan-to-deposit ratio was 19.9 percent. The broad liquidity ratio was at
69.2 percent of total assets (against a minimum requirement of 15 percent).

of mobile banking to increase financial inclusion and noted that consumer protection is available
and consumers have recourse to DAB, the Financial Disputes Resolution Commission, and the
courts. Staff welcomed these initiatives, and encouraged greater financial inclusion over the medium
term by continuing to promote mobile banking and microfinance lending, bank penetration in rural
areas, and financial literacy.
34.
The banking sector is undergoing an important restructuring process that is intended
to signal a break with the past. Much has been done to strengthen the supervision, regulatory and
legislative frameworks, including enhancing on- and off-site supervision, improving information
exchange, assertive enforcement, and passage of the banking law that will strengthen bank
governance. Also, the restructuring of weak banks continues, in accordance with agreed action
plans. Further, the newly-established Bad Debt Commission is facilitating recovery of nonperforming loans: participation is mandatory for public banks and voluntary for private banks. Staff
praised DAB for this important progress and underscored the need to continue with the reform
agenda, that bank restructuring should occur within a sound governance framework, and that ad
hoc institutions should have clear sunset clauses to avoid undermining institutions formally
mandated for such purposes. Staff and authorities agreed on the need to push ahead with the
planned strengthening of vulnerable and weak banks and privatization of New Kabul Bank,
implementing vigorously the new banking, AML, and CFT laws, their regulations, and guidelines, and
continuing to enhance DAB’s supervision. DAB noted the need to strengthen the performance of
some of the state banks.

F.

Business Environment

35.
The business environment remains very difficult. Afghanistan is at the bottom decile of
World Bank Doing Business 2015 index and its ranking declined to 183 (out of 189 economies),
primarily owing to the increasing time and cost of starting a business, dealing with construction
permits, getting credit, and paying taxes. Afghanistan faces significant challenges to improve
business environment ranging from licensing procedures, protection of minority investors to
contract enforcement and property registration notwithstanding the very difficult security
environment.12 Afghanistan was also in the bottom 20 percent in the World Bank’s 2013 Country
Performance Ratings, which assesses the policy and institutional framework that more strongly
fosters growth and poverty reduction among 76 IDA-eligible countries. Corruption remains high,
with a rank of 172 out of 175 countries in Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index
in 2014.
36.
To support a business-friendly environment, the authorities will strengthen anticorruption and AML/CFT frameworks. As noted, the authorities are determined to improve the
business environment. They have implemented measures to strengthen the anti-corruption and
AML/CFT frameworks. The October 2014 presidential decree on Kabul Bank signaled the intentions of
the new administration, which has zero tolerance for corruption and tax evasion. The authorities have

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

made progress since May 2015 to strengthen the AML/CFT legal framework notably through the
issuance of two DAB regulations on preventive measures in the financial sector and fit and proper
requirements. They also are implementing an AML/CFT Action Plan. Staff welcomed the progress and
noted that continued efforts and enhanced implementation are needed for Afghanistan to exit the
FATF’s monitoring process, to help detect and disrupt the receipt and use of, and to confiscate the
proceeds of crimes, including corruption and drug trafficking. The authorities have initiated asset
declarations by senior officials and plan to broaden their scope. Staff welcomed the authorities’ efforts
to improve asset declarations and emphasized the importance of reducing incentives and
opportunities for corruption as well as improving enforcement, while noting that more is needed to
facilitate audit and publication of asset declarations. Staff underscored the role of well-trained staff,
capacity building and efficient use of the information technology, particularly in customs, to fight
against corruption.

Protecting the Poor

37.
Pro-poor spending peaked in 2014 as a result of higher payments to families of
martyrs and disabled. Pro-poor spending stood at 3.1 percent of GDP in 2014 compared to
2.3 percent in 2013. Owing to challenges in securing donor support to finance operations and
maintenance spending on health and education, and better targeting of pensions to families of
martyrs and disabled, the budgeted pro-poor spending is projected to amount to 2.7 percent of
GDP in 2015, a floor in the SMP. The authorities are committed to continue supporting families of
martyrs and disabled and improving the targeting of these payments. They reiterated that the
definition of pro-poor spending in the budget was rather narrow, since it comprised only the
ministries of education, health, and social affairs (about 40 percent of non-security/nondevelopment outlays), and indicated that most government spending favored the poor.
38.
The authorities have a plan to foster inclusion and reduce poverty in the context of the
SMAF. This plan includes specific short-term actions to provide impetus to their inclusive growth
strategy. To provide security and end land-grabbing affecting the urban poor, the government will
launch a national program to survey informal settlements and provide 100 percent coverage of land
tenure certificates in main cities by the end of December 2015. Further, a program will be launched
by December 2015 to provide at least 5,000 rural communities with funds for labor-intensive works
to repair agricultural infrastructure. By year-end, the government will launch a pilot program for
market gardening in urban peripheries to promote food self-sufficiency, and complete new power
distribution systems to provide electricity to 40,000 poor households. In the first half of 2016, the
government will form a commission to review use of child labor in the carpet industry and provide
reform and compliance recommendations to meet Afghanistan's commitments to end the use of
child labor.

J.

Other Issues

39.
Data provision has shortcomings but is broadly adequate for surveillance. The quality
and timeliness of monetary, fiscal, and price data are broadly adequate, although coverage could be
improved. Fiscal accounts cover only the central government. Limited data on the public enterprises
are available, but qualitative information suggests that some of the largest enterprises are operating
at a loss and represent a potential fiscal risk (Annex I). Data on national accounts, balance of
payments, and social indicators also suffer from weaknesses in coverage and consistency. Recording
and monitoring of debt statistics could be strengthened. The authorities have been working to
improve compilation of debt statistics on a regular basis. They reached out to their creditors to
enhance recording of disbursements and debt repayments and are working to improve data entry
mechanism in Commonwealth Secretariat Debt Recording and Management Software (CS-DRMS).
In addition, they plan to reconcile treasury debt data with DAB, AFMIS, and Client Connections. Fund
technical assistance, including from the IMF’s Middle East Regional Technical Assistance Center, is
also being provided to strengthen statistical data systems.

PERFORMANCE UNDER THE STAFF-MONITORED
PROGRAM
40.
Performance under the SMP has been satisfactory. Worse-than-expected security
conditions and delays in forming a government have complicated policy implementation.


All June 2015 quantitative targets and September indicative targets have been met
except, for social and other priority spending for June and September and the budget
revenue target for September. Revenues fell short of the target by Af 0.5 billion during the
first nine months of 2015, as over-performance in the first half was reversed by underperformance in the third quarter due to delays in implementation of revenue measures. Propoor spending so far was below target due to delays in budget execution, but the year-end
target is unchanged with higher execution expected in the fourth quarter. The treasury’s cash
balance was depleted in August but grants received in September raised the cash balance above
the indicative target. Monetary targets were also met, including that on the adjusted NIR,
reflecting a deliberate reduction in foreign exchange auctioned by the DAB in late May and
June.



Progress on end-June structural benchmarks was slower than planned. Revenue measures,
including the increase in the business receipts tax, introduction of a telecommunications fee,
and increases in the fuel fees collected at customs, originally planned to be introduced in June,
were implemented by decree on August 17.13 The telecommunications fee entered into effect on
September 23, but this measure was rejected by the lower house of parliament on October 14,
but remains in effect, unless rejected by the upper house of parliament, since it was mentioned
in 2015 budget law approved by parliament. If the fee is rejected by the upper house, the
authorities will take compensatory measures. Further, they plan legislation to maintain the fee in
and after 2016. The banking law was enacted by decree on August 19. The structural benchmark
on hiring an independent party to audit bad debt recoveries at a state bank was met in
September. The regulation on currency reporting has been issued and need strengthening in a
few areas, which will be done by end-December 2015.



Follow-through on earlier financial sector reforms has proceeded, but progress has been
slower than planned in a few areas. DAB did communicate its enforcement actions to the
vulnerable systemic bank, which has increased its capital above minimum levels and is working
to reduce its large exposures and foreign exchange open position. For the other vulnerable
bank, a five-year operating strategy has been prepared and is being reviewed by DAB. Chief
Operating and Credit Officers have been hired, but a Chief Executive Officer has not, because it

13

Although the increase in the fuel fee was less than planned (raising it to Af 2 per liter rather than to Af 3), the effect
on the tax base was offset by the introduction of the fuel fee on LPG and higher axel fees.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

has not been possible to identify a qualified candidate. The end-June capital target for this bank
was met.
Progress on structural reforms to be completed later in the year continues at various
speeds. Structural benchmarks to strengthen the revenue administration have been
implemented and new banking regulations are being prepared.



41.
The strengthening of weak banks has proceeded as envisaged in the agreed action
14
plans. The cabinet decided in August to proceed with the sale of NKB, and the sale of NKB was
initiated on October 28, 2015. Further, the newly-established Bad Debt Commission is facilitating
recovery of nonperforming loans. Nonetheless, weaknesses remain in the banking system and the
authorities are committed to continue with strengthening of vulnerable and weak banks,
implementing vigorously the new banking law and its regulations. They revised the banking
regulations on asset classification and provisioning in September, the section on credit risk exposure
needs strengthening; and a regulation on corporate governance and related-party lending is being
prepared. DAB is determined to enhance its supervision capacity and make a transition to a riskbased bank supervision regime.
42.
The SMP’s macroeconomic framework has been revised compared to the original
program projecting lower growth and inflation in 2015. Real GDP growth is now projected at
2 percent, down from 3.5 percent in the original program, and inflation for 2015 has been revised
down from 5 percent to 1.0 percent on a year-on-year basis. Lower nominal GDP growth is
projected to lower demand for real balances with lower reserve and broad money growth. Further, a
revised budget revenue projection takes into account lower nominal GDP growth, the delay in
implementing revenue measures, and the measures to offset the impact of this delay. Grantfinanced development budget expenditures were also revised down reflecting the mid-year budget
review. Grants to the operating budget, however, are higher than earlier projected, reflecting new
donor pledges made recently some of which were linked to the SMP.
43.
A significant increase in revenue performance remains a cornerstone of the program,
supported by expenditure control. Domestic revenue is projected to increase by more than
1 percentage points of GDP (to 9.6 percent of GDP) in 2015. The delay in implementation of revenue
measures is projected to result in about Af 3.3 billion (0.3 percent of GDP) less revenue in 2015 and
lower nominal GDP growth is expected to reduce revenue by Af 3 billon. To offset this loss, the
authorities started to implement expenditure contingency measures by reducing allotments by
2 percent to yield Af 1.7 billion and plan to take revenue measures of Af 1.6 billion, including
collection of tax arrears and vehicle registration fees. The latter revenue measures are projected to
offset any further legal and capacity constraints encountered in the introduction of new revenue
measures. On the expenditure side, the authorities continued to contain nonpriority spending and
implement strict control of other nonsecurity related spending. They limited increases in wages and
pensions, bonuses, and conducted a review of the targeting of payments to martyrs and disabled.

14

Action plans were prepared by DAB last year and are discussed in IMF Country Report No. 15/140.

26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

44.
Reserve money continues as the nominal anchor for monetary policy. The pick-up in
money demand has been slower than anticipated so far this year reflecting real growth and inflation
well below programmed levels. As a result, the end-December year-on-year target for reserve
money growth has been revised down to 7 percent. The acceleration of emigration has put
pressures on the foreign exchange market. This development and the revision to the reserve money
growth target also called for a revision of the December year-on-year net international reserves
accumulation target down to zero. DAB reiterated its commitment to a flexible exchange rate policy,
while maintaining orderly market conditions.
45.
The SMP also aims at helping create a business friendly environment. The authorities
plan to reform licensing and registration, unify the system for trade and investment licenses, and
establish a one-stop-shop for private businesses. They will clarify the roles of the Afghanistan
Investment Support Agency and the, Ministry of Commerce and Industry to improve service to the
private sector. They will also amend the Land Management and Land Acquisition Laws to introduce
orderly land markets and prepare a national infrastructure development plan to build domestic and
regional connectivity.

STAFF APPRAISAL
46.
Despite its enormous progress over the past decade, Afghanistan remains one of the
poorest countries in the world. Security and political uncertainties, the drawdown of international
troops, and weak institutions have held back growth and weighed on social outcomes. The national
unity government, which started work in late 2014, is committed to economic transformation to
assure durable and inclusive growth over the medium term.
47.
Afghanistan is at a critical juncture; early and decisive action is needed to ensure
strong economic performance. The envisaged recovery in the real economy is slow with projected
growth in 2015 only slightly above 2014. The authorities have expressed strong commitment to
reform, have tackled key vulnerabilities, and made a determined start to implement structural
reforms, though the pace was slower than planned because of a settling-in period, resistance from
interest groups, and unexpected shocks. Better economic performance will require strong and
sustained reforms and improved security conditions, without which risks to the economy and the
country are important and potentially far-reaching.
48.
The economic outlook for 2016 and beyond continues to depend on political and
security stability, steadfast economic reform, and donor support. Peace dividends for a country
like Afghanistan would be truly significant. The authorities’ economic strategy would benefit from
strengthened implementation, particularly with regard to removing obstacles to boosting private
sector activity, a better understanding of linkages between the opiate sector and the rest of the
economy, and assuring continued donor flows. The latter will be needed to help maintain
macroeconomic stability, support economic reforms, and finance security and development needs
to allow Afghanistan to make the transition to self-reliance. Reforms need to be tailored to
institutions’ capacity and the macro framework based on realistic assumptions. Over the medium

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

27

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

term, inclusive growth will depend on the ability to develop strategic sectors, enhance the business
climate, and consolidate Afghanistan’s position at the centre of the region.
49.
The macroeconomic policy mix remains appropriate and the need to strengthen
confidence in economic management and policies is paramount. Dissemination of the mediumterm reform plans that will be completed later this year will explain policy intentions and should
help build confidence. The fiscal balance including grants should continue to remain broadly
balanced to ensure sustainability, and efforts should be stepped up to mobilize domestic revenue
and further improve budget management. These actions are required to ensure pro-poor and
development expenditure are increased to help achieve the millennium development goals (MDGs)
and sustainable development goals (SDGs). Monetary policy will need to adjust to changing
conditions and continue to foster confidence in the domestic currency. To this end and to facilitate
monetary policy implementation, further development of domestic-currency denominated
instruments will be helpful. DAB should continue to pursue its commitment to a flexible exchange
rate regime and maintain orderly market conditions.
50.
Mobilizing domestic revenues and prioritizing expenditure need strengthening.
Revenue mobilization requires introducing new taxes, strengthening revenue administration, and
improving the tax policy mix. Over the medium term the authorities should introduce VAT,
additional excises and property taxes, develop natural resources, reduce exemptions, and improve
enforcement and compliance. Higher revenue is essential to finance needed development and
security outlays and reduce reliance on donor funding. At the same time, prioritizing growing
spending needs and making sure that scarce resources are spent efficiently are crucial tasks for the
authorities.
51.
The banking system needs to play its role in fostering economic development. The
central bank’s strengthened monitoring of the banking system and insisting on prudential standards
and implementing enforcement actions, especially for banks that are loss-making or have weak
financial positions, and passage of the banking law have been welcome developments since the
previous consultation. However, the banking system remains vulnerable to adverse shocks, bank
credit is low, and determined efforts continue to be needed to assure effective banking supervision
(including AML/CFT supervision). The planned strengthening of vulnerable and weak banks and
privatization of (or other viable options regarding) NKB need to proceed expeditiously. Strong
efforts are needed to implement vigorously the new banking, AML, and CFT laws and their
regulations, and to enhance further DAB’s supervision capacity. Full implementation of the action
plan agreed with the FATF will ensure that the banking sector maintains its international
correspondent relationships.
52.
Reducing incentives and opportunities for corruption, sustained progress to improve
the anti-corruption and AML/CFT framework, and improved enforcement are needed. The
authorities’ plans to improve revenue administration, bank governance, the business environment,
and progress in strengthening the AML/CFT regime are welcome and should be supported by
effective implementation and enforcement, capacity building and efficient use of the information

28

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

technology, particularly in customs, to fight against corruption. These actions will be critical to
supporting private sector-led growth.
53.
The outlook remains subject to significant risks, most are on the downside. Recent
security developments are casting a shadow over the outlook. Heightened security risks weaken
public confidence and undermine a sustainable pick-up in economic activity. Dependence on donor
financing, large expenditure needs, and a limited domestic revenue capacity, and a still fragile
banking system are important vulnerabilities. As the DSA shows, while under a benign baseline
scenario the present value of public external debt would remain low in the longer term, this
outcome depends on the financing gap being covered by grants. Adverse domestic or regional
security developments, political instability, inadequate implementation of economic policies, and
donor fatigue remain the main potential threats to the economy.
54.
Staff has continued its close engagement through policy advice and technical
assistance, including in the context of the SMP. The SMP aims at addressing fiscal and banking
vulnerabilities, preserving macroeconomic stability, while laying the ground for sustainable inclusive
growth. Staff supports the proposed modification to the December targets for reserve money
growth, net international reserves and budget revenue, which take into account lower nominal GDP
growth, lower demand for real balances, the increase in emigration, and delays in policy
implementation. The nine-month SMP was also designed to build a track record; successful
performance would support a request for an extended credit facility (ECF) arrangement.
55.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Afghanistan take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Annex I. Performance and Oversight of SOEs in Afghanistan1
1.
Non-financial public companies in Afghanistan consist of around 35 State Owned
Enterprises (SOEs) and 15 State-Owned Corporations (SOCs). The SOEs are set up under the
State-Owned Enterprise (Tassady) Law of November 2005, and operate with 100 percent state
ownership under the control of the relevant line ministry.2 The SOCs, on the other hand, are set up
under the Corporations and Limited Liability Companies Law, and operate under varying degree of
state ownership and control depending on the level of state shareholding. The state shares of SOCs
are held by the relevant line ministries. The SOCs report to their board of directors and a
representative of the Ministry of Finance (MoF) has a membership in the majority of SOCs’ board.
2.
A large share of these SOE and SOCs were either unprofitable or made little profit in
2014 (Table 1). The total profits of the nonfinancial public companies, for which data are available
were around Af 2.5billion or 2.5 percent of total government revenues in 2014.2 Total profits have
been declining nominally for the past 3 years. Enterprises operating in the energy and transportation
sectors, including Shamal Coal, Afghan Gas, Mazar Electricity, and Millie Bus, have employed a
significant part of the workforce in the public enterprise sector, and those in the energy sector have
accounted for most of the profits earned, with 80 percent of all profits coming from one SOE:
Shamal Coal. Ariana Airlines, however, have been running deficits for the past 3 years, and together
with the National Insurance Company, experienced the largest losses in 2014.3
3.
Effective financial and operational oversight of SOEs and SOCs could contribute to
strengthening public finances and moving toward fiscal sustainability. While SOEs and SOCs
are a source of non-tax domestic revenue—with the former yielding less than 0.1 percent of GDP in
dividends annually between 2012-2014, the amount of government support provided to the
sector—in the form of loan guarantees, concessions, tax expenditures, subsidies, and
recapitalizations—is poorly understood or accounted for. As low dividends to government arising
from poor financial management in these entities, and implicit and explicit government obligations
to assist them in case of failure could create large budgetary costs, the fiscal risks arising from SOEs
and SOCs operations should be identified in a timely manner and monitored closely.
4.
Currently financial oversight of SOEs is undertaken by the SOE department within the
MoF, but needs strengthening. This oversight task includes (i) the approval of an annual financial

1

Prepared by Elif Ture (FAD).

2

The MoF owns the SOEs and has a representative on the SOE’s Supreme Council (Board) serving as the vice
chairman, while the minister or the chief of the agency, which supervises the enterprise, chairs the Supreme Council.
2

The Central Statistics Organization (CSO) publishes quarterly revenue and expenditure data on SOEs and SOCs that
submit their financial statements to the MoF regularly. CSO currently publishes quarterly data on 38 of 50 SOEs and
SOCs.
3

Another loss making SOC, which is not included in the CSO reports, is Afghan Water Supply and Sewerage, which
has been running deficits of around Af250mn annually between 2011 and 2013 according to the records of MoF
Department of SOCEs.

plan submitted by the SOE in the first quarter of the fiscal year; and (ii) the review of subsequent
quarterly reports submitted to show the progress on implementing the approved plan. However, the
oversight of fiscal risks is hampered by the lack of accounting capacity within SOEs, which means
they are not able to report their financial operations and positions adequately and in a timely way,
and the lack of analytical capacity within the SOE department to monitor the reports effectively.4
Although, the SOE Law requires annual external audits of SOE financial statements, capacity
constraints have prevented undertaking such audits being conducted regularly.
5.
There is limited financial oversight over SOCs. In 2013, the SOE Department established a
unit for channeling the instructions of MoF to SOCs and monitoring and assessing the financial
performance of SOCs ex-post. After the creation of this new unit, the name of the SOE department
was changed to the SOCE department; however, until the SOCs law is amended, it does not have a
supervisory mandate or enforcement authority.
6.
The government proposed amendments to the laws governing SOE and SOCs that aim
to unify and strengthen the state ownership and oversight function within the MoF. While the
amendment to the SOE Law will enhance the MoF’s role in financial oversight of SOEs by
establishing a robust framework of monitoring their performance, the amendment to the
Companies Law aims to bring the SOCs under MoF oversight officially.5 The draft amendments to
SOEs Law and Corporations Law have been sent to Ministry of Justice for processing in 2013, and no
progress has been achieved since then.
7.
Staff recommends the amendments to the SOE and SOC Laws, which were committed
to as part of the previous ECF-supported Program, be passed promptly. After enactment of the
amendments and transfer of legal ownership to the MoF of all state shares in SOCEs,6 and following
the 2012-2013 FAD-led PFM TA recommendations:
i)

the MoF should review the capacity of the SOE department to assess needed staffing and
seek technical assistance, including through IMF, to improve the capacity for operational and
financial oversight of the SOCEs by ensuring regular external audits, preparing quarterly and
annual analytical reports on financial performance and position of SOCEs, and assessing
their fiscal impact and risks within the medium-term fiscal framework, with particular
attention to identifying the financial flows between the MoF and SOCEs, the latter’s quasifiscal activities and associated contingent liabilities;

4

See Afghanistan Public Financial Management and Accountability Assessment, August 2013,
http://treasury.gov.af/Content/files/PEFA%20Afghanistan%202013.pdf.
5

The proposed amendment to the Companies Law does not have an explicit requirement for SOCs to submit their
annual financial plan and quarterly progress reports to the MoF. However, these plans and reports are required to be
submitted to the Board of Directors of the SOC, and the Minister of Finance as the majority shareholder can bring the
SOC under MoF oversight (See “Public Financial Management Reforms: Next Steps,” June 2013 IMF TA report on
Afghanistan).
6

Recently some ministries have thought more shares in SOCEs, for example the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and
Livestock asked for approval to increase its holdings in Baghlan Sugar Company and Nangarhar Canal.

ii) the board of directors of the SOCEs should review the Articles of their entities to strengthen
the merit based hiring practices and capacity development operations to contribute to the
strengthening of fiscal performance and service delivery of SOCEs.

Appendix I. Letter of Intent
Kabul, November 1, 2015

Ms. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
Dear Ms. Lagarde,
We value the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) continued support to our economic reforms
through the Staff-Monitored Program (SMP) and its capacity building assistance. We have made
important progress in addressing vulnerabilities and advancing our structural reform agenda despite
delays in the formation of a new government and increasingly challenging security environment.
This letter updates our May 2015 Letter of Intent and Memorandum of Economic and Financial
Policies (MEFP), which remain valid, and proposes revisions to some December quantitative targets
and the technical memorandum of understanding.
We have met all the end-June quantitative targets set for the first review of the SMP except for the
target on social and priority spending. Structural reform implementation, however, was slower than
planned; three of four structural benchmarks were implemented, with delays, because technical
preparations and building the needed consensus in favor of these measures took longer than earlier
envisaged. Budget revenue measures, including the increase in the business receipts tax, and fuel
fees collected at customs, were implemented by decree on August 17 as was the
telecommunications fee, which entered into effect on September 23. The telecommunications fee
was rejected by the lower house of parliament on October 14, but remains in force, as this fee was in
the 2015 budget law approved by parliament. We plan to submit legislation to parliament so this fee
remains in effect in and after 2016 and expect its approval. Although the increase in the fuel fee was
less than planned (we doubled the fee instead of tripling it), we introduced fuel fees on LPG and
raised vehicle fees to more than offset the effect on the tax base. The risk based audit case selection
process has been implemented, meeting the end-October target date. The banking law was issued
by decree on August 19. The structural benchmark on hiring an independent party to audit bad debt
recoveries at a state bank has been met. The regulation on currency reporting has been issued and
needs strengthening in a few areas, which will be done by December 2015.
Security uncertainties and weak domestic demand have held back growth, which together with
lower commodity prices, contributed to the decline in 12-month inflation to -1.9 percent year-onyear in September 2015. Downward pressures on the Afghani’s exchange rate have increased in
recent months and it depreciated by 11.7 percent between March 21 and October 21, because of
delays in donor inflows and as higher emigration boosted demand for foreign exchange. Money

48

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

growth declined in 2015. The accumulation of government deposits in DAB, lower confidence, net
inflows, and seasonal factors reduced reserve money growth to -0.8 percent year-on-year in
September. Broad money growth was low due to the impact of bank restructuring measures. DAB
maintained a comfortable reserve buffer, at over 7½ months of imports.
Fiscal performance was better than expected in the first half of 2015. Domestic revenues increased
by 12 percent because of improved compliance. Tariff increases, however, yielded less than
projected as traders cut their import orders. While operating expenditure was lower than planned,
owing to delays in budget approval and centralization of the public procurement, development
expenditures increased, as 2014 arrears were repaid. As a result, the operating deficit (before grants)
was 25 percent below the mid-year target, and, with larger than expected grant financing, the
overall balance was in surplus at mid-year.
We continued to strengthen the banking sector. In late 2014, corrective measures started to be
implemented. In 2015, enforcement actions against all weak banks have been issued and decisive
actions were taken to strengthen the two vulnerable banks. The vulnerable systemic bank increased
its capital above minimum levels and is reducing its large exposures and foreign exchange open
position. For the other vulnerable bank, a five-year operating strategy has been prepared and is
being reviewed by DAB. Chief Operating and Credit Officers have been hired, but it has not yet been
possible to identify a qualified candidate for Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the government has
initiated a public process to hire a new CEO. The end-June capital target for this bank was met. The
new banking law is in effect and is expected to improve banking regulation and supervision and
bank governance.
We project a lower growth and inflation path in 2015 compared to the original program targets. A
slower than earlier projected recovery in economic confidence has resulted in economic activity and
domestic demand being lower than earlier anticipated. Further, international fuel and food prices in
2015 are lower than projected earlier. As a result, we have revised down projected real GDP growth
(to 2 percent) and inflation for 2015 (average and end-period inflation are projected to
be -1.3 percent and 1.0 percent y-o-y, respectively). Lower nominal GDP growth is projected to
lower demand for real balances with lower reserve and broad money growth. Further, a revised
budget revenue projection takes into account lower nominal GDP growth, the delay in
implementing revenue measures, and the measures to offset the impact of this delay. Projected
grants, however, are higher than earlier envisaged, reflecting new donor pledges made recently.
Against this backdrop, we propose revising the macroeconomic framework for the remainder of
2015, updating some of the December 2015 quantitative targets and indicative targets. The
December 2015 targets for budget revenue, the fiscal operating balance, net credit to government,
reserve money, currency in circulation, and net international reserves are adjusted as are projected
external financing to the budget and development spending in the attached table (Table 1).
The SMP’s key policy objectives remain unchanged. We remain committed to implement the agreed
policies to preserve macroeconomic stability, address vulnerabilities, lift inclusive growth through
structural reform, while sustaining donor flows. We will continue our efforts to: (i) mobilize domestic
revenue and catalyze continued donor support to finance higher security and development
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

expenditure, and maintain the treasury’s cash balance, while limiting carefully debt accumulation,
with careful appraisal of debt creating projects to assure debt sustainability; (ii) protect the
international reserves position and competiveness by continued exchange rate flexibility; and (iii)
strengthen the financial sector and improve economic governance. These principles will also guide
our preparations for our 2016 economic program and budget.
A significant increase in revenue performance remains an important target under the program.
Domestic revenue is projected to increase by over 1 percentage points of GDP (to 9.6 percent of
GDP) in 2015. We are pressing ahead with the implementation of the recently approved revenue
measures as well as improving compliance. The delay in implementation of revenue measures
outlined in the May MEFP is projected to result in about Af 3.3 billion (0.3 percent of GDP) less
revenue in 2015. To offset this loss we started to implement expenditure contingency measures by
reducing allotments by 2 percent to yield Af 1.7 billion and plan to take revenue measures of
Af 1.6 billion including collection of tax arrears and vehicle registration fees. We also have made
progress in strengthening tax administration including updating the taxpayer and arrears registries
and establishing a Risk Analysis and Case Selection Unit. Development of ARD’s five-year strategic
plan and implementation of structural benchmarks to strengthen the revenue administration is on
track.
On the expenditure side, we continue to contain nonpriority spending and implement strict control
of other nonsecurity related spending. We will improve cash management to ensure that the
government’s payment obligations remain within projected cash availability to avoid arrears and
ensure the treasury’s discretionary cash balance does not fall below Af 5 billion at end-2015. We will
also settle arrears incurred lawfully in 2014. Implementation will be through fortnightly meetings of
a cash management committee chaired by the minister of finance. Pro-poor spending is projected at
2.7 percent of GDP in 2015 and we expect to meet the target for 2015 as a whole. At the mid-year
review of the budget, we revised up by Af 3.1 billion operating expenditure financed by
discretionary sources, expenditure financed by security grants was revised down by Af 15.1 billion,
and development budget outlays were revised down by Af 2 billion. We limited increases in wages
and pensions, bonuses, and conducted a review of the targeting of payments to martyrs and
disabled. We are also strengthening public financial management as outlined in the May MEFP,
working on improving the medium-term framework including the recently endorsement of the PFM
Roadmap II on which there was extensive consultation with development partners and stakeholders,
better identifying recurrent and capital expenditures, either discretionary or nondiscretionary, to
inform budget ceilings, and setting up a database for capital projects (in eight line ministries for
projects above Af 0.5 million). We are establishing a cabinet-level committee to conduct quarterly
reviews of budget execution.
Reserve money continues as the nominal anchor for monetary policy. The pick-up in money demand
has been slower than anticipated. Slower reserve money growth, well below programmed levels, led
us to propose adjusting end-December target for reserve money growth to 7 percent between
December 2014 and December 2015. We also propose revising down our net international reserves
accumulation to zero to take account of the revised reserve money target. We will continue to mop

50

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

up any excess liquidity and carefully manage money growth with a flexible exchange rate policy
while maintaining orderly market conditions. We will strengthen our communication strategy to
foster public confidence in the DAB’s actions.
With the technical assistance of the Fund, we will work to develop domestic currency-denominated
instruments, including sukuk, which will facilitate gradually moving away from foreign exchange
auctions toward using domestic currency-denominated instruments for open market operations.
This move will make monetary policy signals more transparent, which are presently blurred as DAB
provides U.S. dollar liquidity to the economy to finance current account transactions, but also sells
U.S. dollars at its regular auctions to mop up liquidity.
We made a good start in strengthening the banking sector and will build on this momentum. The
strengthening of weak banks has proceeded as envisaged in the agreed action plans, the cabinet
has decided in August to proceed with the sale of New Kabul Bank (NKB), and the sale of NKB was
initiated on October 28, 2015, as planned. Further, the newly-established Bad Debt Commission is
facilitating recovery of nonperforming loans. Nonetheless, weaknesses remain in the banking system
and we are determined to continue to push ahead with the strengthening of vulnerable and weak
banks, implementing vigorously the new banking law and its regulations. We have revised the
banking regulations on asset classification and provisioning in September and are preparing a
regulation on corporate governance and related-party lending. We will continue to enhance DAB’s
supervision capacity and transition to a risk-based bank supervision regime. We are committed to
building robust institutions and strongly support the independence of the DAB.
We are also strengthening the fit and proper framework in the financial sector, notably with the
issuance of a DAB Regulation in June 2015. Furthermore, a regulation on currency reporting at the
border was issued in April 2015. We will amend this regulation by end-December 2015 to bring it in
line with FATF Recommendation 32. A DAB regulation on preventive measures for financial
institutions was adopted by DAB’s supreme council in June 2015. We will follow up on the legislative
reforms to submit by end-December 2015 draft legislation to parliament to criminalize corruptionrelated crimes in line with the UN Convention against Corruption and amend the Law on Overseeing
the Implementation of the Anti-Administrative Corruption Strategy to provide for the review and
publication of the asset declarations in accordance with the constitution.
We are determined to improve governance and create a business friendly environment. We plan to
reform licensing and registration, unify the system for trade and investment licenses, and establish a
one-stop-shop for private businesses. We will clarify the role of the Afghanistan Investment Support
Agency and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry to improve service to the private sector. We will
also amend the Land Management and Land Acquisition Laws to introduce orderly land markets and
prepare a national infrastructure development plan to build domestic and regional connectivity. We
have established a national procurement board to manage all high value contracts and conducted a
review of customs and revenue administration staffing.
We believe that the policies set forth herein and in the above-mentioned MEFP are sufficient to
achieve the objectives of our program, and we stand ready to take any additional measures that

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

51

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

may become necessary for this purpose. We will consult with Fund staff in advance of any revision of
the policies described here and in the May MEFP, in accordance with the Fund’s policies. We will
remain in close contact with Fund staff and provide timely information required for monitoring
economic developments and implementation of policies under the SMP. We authorize the IMF to
publish this letter and the policy documents related to this Article IV consultation and the first
review under the SMP, subject to the removal of market-sensitive information.

Sincerely yours,

B. Quantitative Performance and Indicative Targets
2.
The quantitative targets for June 2015, and December 2015, specified in Table 7 of the
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies, are:


Floors on revenue of the central government and net international reserves (NIR); and



Ceilings on reserve money; net central bank credit to the central government (NCG); contracting
and/or guaranteeing new medium- and long-term nonconcessional external debt by the public
sector, (continuous); short-term external debt owed or guaranteed by the public sector

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

53

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

(continuous); accumulation of external payment arrears, excluding interest on preexisting arrears
(continuous); lending from state-owned banks or the central bank to, or government guaranteed
borrowing by, public enterprises in need of restructuring (continuous).
3.
The above variables also constitute indicative targets for March and September 2015.
In addition, the program includes the following indicative targets for the four above-mentioned
dates:


Ceiling on the operating budget deficit of the central government excluding grants; and



Floor on treasury cash balance and social and other priority spending.

4.
The central government consists of the Office of the President, the ministries and other
state administrations and governmental agencies, including the attorney general’s office; the
National Assembly; and the judiciary, including the Supreme Court.
5.
Reserve money is defined as currency in circulation plus Afghani-denominated commercial
bank deposits at the central bank, excluding deposits held at the DAB’s branches (because of the
unavailability of reliable and timely data from the DAB’s branches), but including balances
maintained by the commercial banks in the DAB’s overnight facility.
6.
Treasury cash balance is defined as the total discretionary cash balance at the treasury
account in DAB, including balance in the main TSA account in Kabul, funds in provincial expenditure
accounts (unexecuted allotments), and unrealized foreign exchange gain using the current exchange
rate.
7.
Rerouting of treasury’s IMF accounts to central bank’s balance sheet. For program
purposes, the government’s financial positions arising from dealing with the IMF is treated as if
these functions were performed by DAB on behalf of the treasury that is as if DAB have assumed
these positions and have established corresponding counterpositions vis-à-vis the treasury.
8.
Net central bank credit to the government is defined as the difference between the
central bank’s claims on the government and government deposits at the DAB, excluding deposits
held at the DAB’s branches. Claims include the so-called “promissory note”, in the amount
outstanding (at face value) of DAB’s claim on a bank in liquidation that has been guaranteed by the
ministry of finance though issuance of a promissory note, and up to the amount specified therein.
9.
Net international reserves are defined as reserve assets minus reserve liabilities of the DAB,
both of which are expressed in U.S. dollars.


54

Reserve assets of the DAB, as defined in the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual
(BPM5), are claims on nonresidents denominated in foreign convertible currencies controlled by
DAB, and are readily and unconditionally available for DAB to meet balance of payments
financing needs, intervention in exchange markets, and other purposes. They include DAB
holdings of monetary gold, SDRs, Afghanistan’s reserve position in the IMF, foreign currency cash

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

(including foreign exchange banknotes in the vaults of the DAB, but excluding cash held in the
DAB’s branches), and deposits abroad (including balances on accounts maintained with overseas
correspondent banks). Excluded from reserve assets are any assets that are pledged, collateralized,
or otherwise encumbered; claims on residents; precious metals other than monetary gold; assets in
nonconvertible currencies; illiquid assets; and claims on foreign exchange arising from derivatives
in foreign currencies vis-à-vis domestic currency (such as futures, forwards, swaps, and options).


Reserve liabilities are defined as short-term (original maturity) foreign exchange liabilities of DAB
to nonresidents (held at DAB headquarters); all credit outstanding from the IMF; foreign
currency reserves of commercial banks held at DAB headquarters; commitments to sell foreign
exchange arising from derivatives (such as futures, forwards, swaps, and options); and all arrears
on principal or interest payments to commercial banks, suppliers, or official export credit
agencies.

10.
Revenues of the central government are defined in line with the Government Financial
Statistics Manual (GFSM 2001) but on a cash accounting basis, excluding grants. Revenue is an
increase in net worth of the central government (including its units in the provinces and agencies)
resulting from a transaction.


Revenues of the central government include taxes and other compulsory transfers imposed by
central government units, property income derived from the ownership of assets, sales of goods
and services, social contributions, interest, fines, penalties and forfeits and voluntary transfers
received from nongovernment other than grants. The definition for program monitoring
excludes grants and other noncompulsory contributions received from foreign governments and
international organizations; such transfers between central government units would be
eliminated in the consolidation of the fiscal reports and not recorded as revenue. Receipts
collected by central government on behalf of noncentral government units should not be
counted as revenue (e.g., Red Crescent fees). Receipts from the sale of nonfinancial assets (e.g.,
privatization and signature bonuses from natural resource contracts), and transactions in
financial assets and liabilities, such as borrowing but excepting interest payments, are also
excluded from the definition of revenue.



Revenues should be recognized on a cash basis and flows should be recorded when cash is
received. The official Afghanistan Government Financial Management Information System
(AFMIS) reports will be used as the basis for program monitoring; in particular, the monthly
financial statements prepared by the Treasury department based on AFMIS data. Exceptional
advanced payments will be treated as if received on the normal due date.

11.
Social and other priority spending is defined as the sum of pro-poor spending identified
in accordance with the ANDS poverty profile by the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Public Health,
and Ministry of Labor, Social Affairs, Martyrs, and Disabled within the central government’s
operating budget for a particular fiscal year.

12.
For program purposes, the definition of external debt is set out in Executive Board Decision
No. 6230-(79/140), as revised on August 31, 2009 (Decision No. 14416-(09/91).
(a)

(b)

The term “debt” will be understood to mean a current (i.e., not contingent) liability,
created under a contractual arrangement through the provision of value in the form of
assets (including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make one or
more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at some future
point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities
incurred under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones being
as follows:
(i)

loans (i.e., advances of money) to the obligor by the lender made on the basis of
an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including
deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans and buyers’ credits) and
temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans
under which the obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest,
by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase
agreements and official swap arrangements);

(ii)

suppliers’ credits (i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer
payments until sometime after the date on which the goods are delivered or
services are provided); and

(iii)

leases (i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee has
the right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually
shorter than the total expected service life of the property), while the lessor
retains the title to the property. For the purpose of the guideline, the debt is the
present value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be
made during the period of the agreement excluding those payments that cover
the operation, repair or maintenance of the property.

Under the definition of debt set out in paragraph 13 (a) above, arrears, penalties, and
judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment under a
contractual obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an
obligation that is not considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery)
will not give rise to debt.

13.
Long-term and medium-term external debt. A ceiling applies, on a continuous basis, to
the contracting and guaranteeing by the public sector of new nonconcessional borrowing debt with
nonresidents with original maturities of one year or more. The ceiling applies to debt and
commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not yet been received. This applies to
private debt for which official guarantees have been extended and which, therefore, constitute a
contingent liability of the public sector. Excluded from the limits are refinancing credits and
rescheduling operations, credits extended by the IMF, and credits on concessional terms as defined

56

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

below. Consistent with the Public Finance and Expenditure Management (PFEM) Law, the MOF
should have sole responsibility for the contracting and guaranteeing of external debt on behalf of
the government.


The definition of “government” includes the central government (including government
departments), as well as official agencies that do not seek profit and whose budgets are issued
independent of the annual operational or development budgets. The public sector comprises
the government as defined above, the DAB, and nonfinancial public enterprises. Public
enterprises are defined below in paragraph 17.



For program purposes, the guarantee of a debt arises from any explicit legal obligation of the
public sector to service a debt in the event of nonpayment by the debtor (involving payments in
cash or in kind), or from any implicit legal or contractual obligation of the public sector to
finance partially or in full any a shortfall incurred by the debtor.



For program purposes, a debt is concessional if it includes a grant element of at least
60 percent, calculated as follows: the grant element of a debt is the difference between the
present value (PV) of debt and its nominal value, expressed as a percentage of the nominal value
of the debt. The PV of debt at the time of its contracting is calculated by discounting the future
stream of payments of debt service due on this debt. The discount rates used is 5.0 percent.

14.
The zero ceiling on short-term external debt applies on a continuous basis to the stock of
short-term external debt owed or guaranteed by the public sector (as defined in paragraph 13 of this
memorandum), with an original maturity of up to and including one year.


It applies to debt as defined in paragraph 13 of this memorandum.



Excluded from the limit are rescheduling operations (including the deferral of interest on
commercial debt) and normal import-related credits.



Debt falling within the limit shall be valued in U.S. dollars at the exchange rate prevailing at the
time the contract or guarantee becomes effective.

15.
A continuous performance criterion applies to the nonaccumulation of new external
payments arrears on external debt contracted or guaranteed by the central government or the
DAB. External payment arrears consist of external debt service obligations (principal and interest)
falling due after March 20, 2015 and that have not been paid at the time they are due, as specified
in the contractual agreements. Excluded from the prohibition on the accumulation of new arrears


Government control of an entity can be established based on the following criteria: (i) ownership of the majority of
the voting interest; (ii) control of the board or other governing body; (iii) control of the appointment and removal of
key personnel; (iv) control of key committees of the entity; (v) golden shares and options; (vi) regulation and control;
(vii) control by a dominant public sector customer or group of public sector customers; and (viii) control attached to
borrowing from the government.


The calculation of concessionality will take into account all aspects of the loan agreement, including maturity, grace
period, payment schedule, upfront commissions, and management fees.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

57

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

are (i) arrears arising from interest on the stock of arrears outstanding as of March 20, 2015; and
(ii) external arrears that are subject to debt rescheduling agreements or negotiations.
16.
Lending to, or guaranteeing borrowing by, public enterprises. The zero ceiling on new
lending from state-owned banks or the central bank to, or government guaranteed domestic
borrowing by, public enterprises in need of restructuring applies on a continuous basis.


For the purposes of this performance criterion (i) “state-owned banks” refers to those banks that
are wholly or majority owned by the government (as defined in paragraph 14 of this
memorandum), including Bank Millie, Bank Pashtany and New Kabul Bank; (ii) “public enterprises
in need of restructuring” refers to enterprises that meet either of the following: (a) public
enterprises that have not had an audited balance sheet in the past two fiscal years, (b) public
enterprises that have been identified by the Ministry of Finance for liquidation, or (c) public
enterprises subject to restructuring plans that do not have cabinet-approved restructuring plans;
and (iii) “public enterprises” refers to enterprises wholly or majority owned by the government,
including those covered by the State-Owned Enterprise (Tassady) Law, and all state-owned
corporations and any other public entities and government agencies engaged in commercial
activities but not covered by the Tassady Law.



It applies to any new loans (or financial contributions) extended directly from the central bank or
state-owned banks to public enterprises in need of restructuring, and also to any explicit
government guarantees for borrowing undertaken by these public enterprises (including loan
agreements and guarantees for which value has not been received).

17.
Operating budget deficit of the central government excluding grants is defined as
revenues of the central government minus operating budget expenditure recorded in AFMIS and
reported in monthly financial statements.

C. Adjustors
18.
The floor on NIR and the ceiling on the NCG are consistent with the assumption that core
budget development spending will amount, on a cumulative basis from the beginning of the
respective fiscal year, to:
Date

Accumulative over the Respective Year
(Billion Afghani)

March 20, 2015
June 21, 2015
September 22, 2015
December 21, 2015

8.0
25.8
49.7
82.8

Should core budget development spending exceed these projections, the NIR floor will be adjusted
downward and the NCG ceiling will be adjusted upward by the difference between the actual level (up to
the appropriated amount) and the projected level of development spending.

58

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

19.
The NIR floor and NCG ceiling are defined consistent with the assumption that
the external financing of the core budget and receipts from the sale of nonfinancial
assets will amount, on a cumulative basis from the beginning of the respective fiscal year, to:
Date

Accumulative over the Respective Year
(Billion Afghani)

March 20, 2015
June 21, 2015
September 22, 2015
December 21, 2015

29.6
85.6
144.8
224.0

Should external financing of the core budget (including that associated with off-budgetary spending
coming on budget) and the receipts from the sale of nonfinancial assets collectively exceed (fall
short of) these projections, the NIR floor will be adjusted upward (downward) and the NCG ceiling
will be adjusted downward (upward) by the difference between their actual level and the projected
level. The overall downward adjustment to the NIR floor will be capped at $500 million and the
overall upward adjustment to the NCG ceiling will be capped at Af 29 billion.
20.
Should the ministry of finance recapitalize (receive dividend from) DAB, the NCG ceiling
will be adjusted upward (downward) by the amount of this recapitalization (dividend).
21.
Should Afghanistan receive an SDR allocation the NIR floor will be adjusted upwards by the
amount of this allocation.
22.
Should some expenditure currently financed directly by donors outside the budget be
moved on to the operating budget, the NIR floor will be adjusted downward, and the NCG ceiling
and the indicative targets (ceilings) for the operating budget deficits of the central government,
excluding grants, will be adjusted upward, by the actual amount of these expenditures on the
conditions that (i) the moving on budget of these expenditures is justified by a statement from
donors indicating their decision to stop financing them outside the budget; and (ii) they are subject
to a supplementary appropriation approved by parliament. The overall downward adjustment to the
NIR floors will be capped at $300 million.

D. Provision of Information to the Fund
23.
To facilitate monitoring of program implementation, the government of Afghanistan will
provide the Fund through the office of the Resident Representative of the IMF in Afghanistan, the
information specified below and summarized in the list of reporting tables provided to the Technical
Coordination Committee.

Nonfinancial Relations
Exchange Arrangement
Afghanistan is an Article XIV member country. The authorities confirmed that there are no
restrictions on current account transactions and maintain an exchange system that is free of
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. The
authorities confirmed their desire to move to Article VIII status. The de jure exchange rate regime is
classified as floating, although the authorities have been implementing a de facto managed float
system with no predetermined path for the exchange rate. On August 17, 2015, the average of the
buying and selling exchange rates in cash transactions on the Kabul money exchange market was
63.78 Afghanis per U.S. dollar.
To conduct monetary policy, the authorities have used foreign exchange auctions since May 2002
and capital note auctions since September 2004. The foreign exchange auctions were initially open
only to licensed money changers, but since June 2005, they are also open to commercial banks. The
capital note auctions are open to commercial banks. Auctions are linked to the overall monetary
program and are held on a regular basis.
Article IV Consultation
The last Article IV consultation with Afghanistan was discussed by the Executive Board on
May 16, 2014. Article IV consultations with Afghanistan are held in accordance with Decision
No. 14747-(10/96) on consultation cycles adopted on September 28, 2010, as amended.
Safeguards Assessment
Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) was subject to a
safeguards assessment with respect to the ECF arrangement approved on November 13, 2011.
An initial safeguards assessment of the DAB was completed on June 12, 2006, updated on
March 18, 2008, and then in December 2011. The latest update for the safeguards assessment found
that while most of the previous safeguards recommendations had been implemented, an effective
internal audit mechanism had still not been established and governance oversight was weak. The
assessment also made recommendations to address new risks emerging as a result of the Kabul
Bank crisis including with respect to central bank autonomy. Since the assessment, some
recommendations have been implemented, albeit with delay. In particular, a Memorandum of
Understanding on central bank capitalization has been signed and an external auditor has been
appointed. DAB is committed to implementing the remaining safeguards recommendations, with
priority assigned to development of the internal audit function (with external support) and
strengthening of Audit Committee oversight. Following IMF advice, DAB has prepared, in
accordance with IFRS, interim semiannual balance sheet and income statement, which will be
submitted to the Supreme Council. The third quarter Financial Accounts have been submitted to the
Supreme Council. Also, as per its Law, DAB has started preparing a pro-forma balance sheet to be

submitted to the Ministry of Finance. Since February 2013, the Comptroller General’s Office (CGO)
has been successful in implementing all the activities related to internal audit. To structure and
implement a suitable Risk Based Internal Audit (RBIA) model, DAB considers it important (and has
requested TA under the World Bank's FSRRP project) to provide training to CGO staff and hire an
expert adviser to assist CGO amend existing policies and procedures and develop new ones.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(As of September 2015)
1.
The World Bank Group’s program in Afghanistan is governed by the joint Interim Strategy
Note (ISN) for FY12-FY14, which focuses on three themes: (i) building the legitimacy and capacity of
institutions; (ii) equitable service delivery; and (iii) inclusive growth and jobs. The process for
preparing the next country strategy––Country Partnership Framework for Afghanistan––has been
launched, with work on the Systematic Country Diagnostics (SCD) in progress.
2.
Since 2002, IDA has committed a total of $3.12 billion in grants (86 percent) and credits
(14 percent) in Afghanistan. Thirty-seven development and emergency-reconstruction projects and
four budget-support operations have been committed as of end-August 2015. In addition, the ARTF
has generated $7.99 billion from 33 donors, and committed $3.61 billion for the government’s
recurrent costs and $3.79 billion for government investment programs. At end of August 2015, the
active IDA portfolio was worth $725.98 million and the active ARTF investment portfolio was worth
$2.5 billion.
3.
The Bank also administers the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) – the World
Bank Group’s largest single-country multi-donor trust fund. The ARTF provides grant support to
Afghanistan based on a 3-year rolling financing strategy. Together, International Development
Association (IDA) and the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) provide close to $1 billion
per year in grant resources (about $150 million from IDA and about $800–$900 million from the
ARTF). The ARTF is a key vehicle for providing Government with predictable and transparent onbudget financing and provides a platform for policy dialogue between Government and donors.
4.
In fiscal year 2015, the World Bank Board approved additional financing for an existing
project–– the Second Customs Reform and Trade Facilitation Project––in the amount of
$21.5 million. No new projects were approved under the ARTF during the political transition period.
Funds were, however, allocated to ongoing projects for a total of $450 million, which includes
$50 million for the National Horticulture and Livestock Project, $100 million for National Solidarity
Program III, $100 million for the Rural Access Program, and $200 million for the System
Enhancement for Health in Transition Project. In fiscal year 2015, $419.56 million was disbursed
under the Recurrent Cost Window, including the baseline financing ($125 million), Incentive Program
($132.5 million, of which $65 million was through the O&M Facility), and additional donor grants
through the ad-hoc mechanisms of $146.9 million.
5.
The World Bank continues to engage in rigorous analytical work and places large emphasis
on policy dialogue. These non-lending activities have been supportive of the Bank’s lending
program and have played a crucial role in informing government of its strategic choices and
advancing dialogue between the Government of Afghanistan and its international development
partners. In recent years, four pieces of analytical work stand-out: Transition Economics, Resources
Corridors, Poverty Analysis, and Agriculture Sector Review. The Bank also prepared Policy Notes on

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

key sectors of the economy to help guide its policy dialogue with the new administration and
launched the preparation of a comprehensive revenue analysis.
6.
IFC’s portfolio in Afghanistan has increased to about $135 million. IFC is following an
integrated advisory and investment strategy focused on improving the investment climate, building
capacity, and supporting selective investments in sectors with high development impact and job
creation. Currently, IFC’s portfolio includes two investments in the telecommunication sector and
two operations in the financial markets. Going forward, IFC is looking to expand its investment
program in Afghanistan, in the areas of infrastructure, finance, manufacturing, agribusiness and
services.
7.
MIGA has $154 million of gross exposure in Afghanistan, supporting telecoms and agribusiness projects. In 2013 MIGA launched its “Conflict Affected and Fragile Economies Facility,”
which is supporting the agency’s exposure in Afghanistan. MIGA is currently supporting three
projects in Afghanistan, of which one is a joint effort with IFC in the telecoms sector (MTN). The
other two are MIGA-only dairy and cashmere production projects.

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE JOINT MANAGEMENT
ACTION PLAN ON BANK-FUND COLLABORATION
(August 17, 2015)
1.
Joint Management Action Plan (JMAP). The Afghanistan country teams of the World Bank
(led by Mr. Saum, country director) and the IMF (led by Mr. Ross, mission chief) held several
consultations in 2014 and 2015. The teams regularly exchanged views on the recent economic
developments and their outlook, identified the macroeconomic priorities and challenges facing
Afghanistan and discussed ways to coordinate their respective work programs. As part of the
cooperation effort, the World Bank team participated in SMP missions as observer.
2.
2015 showed a small improvement in economic activity and a number of economic reforms.
The security transition and the protracted elections affected confidence and considerably slowed
down reform progress in 2014. The SMP program provided a macroeconomic framework for a swift
recovery in economic activity and structural reforms. The following areas are critical from the
macroeconomic perspective in the short and medium terms:

10



Sustaining macroeconomic stability. Policies should focus on revenue mobilization,
improving the effectiveness of public expenditures, containing non-priority spending and
controlling the money growth to manage inflation. A flexible exchange rate and
international reserves should help accommodate shocks. The success of this strategy is
predicated to a large extent on the continued donor flows, as pledged at the 2012
conferences in Chicago and Tokyo. The government’s delivery on its commitments under the
IMF-supported program as well as the ARTF Incentive Program and the IDA-financed
Development Policy Grant will be critical towards sustaining donors’ confidence.



Advancing fiscal sustainability and strengthening efforts to mobilize domestic
revenues. The revenue effort faltered further in 2014 and it will be critical to restoring
Afghanistan’s revenue trajectory. Teams therefore agree on the need to emphasize revenueenhancing measures in their dialogue with authorities. In order to improve our
understanding for the scope of reforms, especially in the medium-term, the teams agree to
cooperate on relevant analysis.



Safeguarding the financial sector. Macroeconomic policies must be complemented by
prudential measures to safeguard financial stability. The banking sector is weak and should
be strengthened to be able to meaningfully contribute to economic development.
Improving banking supervision at the central bank is critical to this effort.



Strengthening economic governance. The high level of corruption and deficiencies in the
rule of law are serious constraints on growth and—in the case of Afghanistan—have the
potential to destabilize the economy.



Improving absorption capacity and government effectiveness. Budget execution rates
linger around 50 percent. Increasing on-budget aid, especially through the transfer onbudget of security expenditures previously managed by donors, is challenging absorption
capacity. More efforts need to be undertaken in advancing public financial management
(PFM) reforms, improving the capabilities of the civil service and lifting constraints to service
delivery and the implementation of public infrastructure projects.

3.
Prioritizing reforms. Teams agreed that policy recommendations for 2015 should focus on
revenue mobilization, improved expenditure management, better coordination between the fiscal
and monetary policies, and addressing vulnerabilities in the financial sector.
4.
The Bank’s work program is guided by the Interim Strategy Note (ISN). The ISN, approved by
the Bank’s Board in March 2012 and spanning 2012–14, envisages that the Bank will continue to
expand its support to institutions and processes associated with transparent economic and financial
management and community-level governance, especially through the National Solidarity Program.
Regarding economic management, in 2014 and continuing into 2015, the Bank has supported the
government with technical assistance in the areas of customs reforms, mineral resource
management, and economic statistics. Under the ARTF, the bank’s team is preparing a new Incentive
Program (IP) that will provide funds for achievements in revenue mobilization, strengthening PFM
and revenue administration systems (including customs), and improving tax policy, investment
climate and , land administration. Since January 2013, the IP has also supported the government's
operation and maintenance expenditures. The new Incentive Program will provide a total financing
envelope of $900 million for 2015–2017. The Bank will also initiate consultations with the
government toward the end of 2015 on designing a new Development Policy Grant (Table 1).
5.
The Fund’s work program focuses on close engagement through the SMP program
approved in March 2015. The first SMP program review will take place in September 2015. The
program has two test dates, June and December 2015. The SMP includes a set of informal
quantitative targets and structural measures for 2015. These targets and measures aimed at
maintaining macroeconomic stability and structural reform momentum. The authorities met all the
quantitative targets for June test date. However, some structural benchmarks took longer than
anticipated to implement.
6.
The Fund focuses its efforts on helping the authorities maintain economic stability, manage
the economic transition, and advance important pieces of legislation, including the new banking law,
the central bank law, and AML and CFT laws. The Fund has also provided advice on the monetary
policy, banking supervision, and customs reform. Technical assistance has been provided to the
central bank on problem bank management and external sector statistics. In 2015, the Fund,
through the SMP, is helping the authorities build on these achievements, including through
strengthening economic governance, advancing structural reforms, central bank capitalization
framework, developing a fiscal regime for natural resources, revenue mobilization, further
strengthening banking supervision, and improving macroeconomic statistics. The Fund will continue
its close engagement with Afghanistan to ensure the stability of macroeconomic framework.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of August 31, 2015)
1.
Afghanistan is a founding member of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), established in
1966. After a hiatus from 1980 to 2001, ADB resumed its partnership with the Government of
Afghanistan. In the London and Kabul conferences in January and July 2010, respectively, and in the
Chicago (May 2012), Tokyo (July 2012), and London (December 2014) conferences, ADB reaffirmed
its long-term development partnership with Afghanistan. This included the transition period
(2012-14) and the transformation period (2015–2024) based on the government’s development
strategies, which along with national priority programs (NPPs) will remain the agreed basis for
partnership in the next decade.
2.
Current ADB operations in Afghanistan are based on the Country Operations Business Plan
(COBP), 2015–2017. The COBP is fully aligned with NPPs and the government’s priorities in the
infrastructure sector—the backbone of economic and social development—with ADB’s investments
contributing to Afghanistan’s socio-economic development in the transformation period. The COBP
continues ADB's focus on Afghanistan's energy, transport, and agriculture and natural resources
sectors, including management, governance, and further institutional and human capacity
development. From 2009 to 2013, ADB’s operations were underpinned by the Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS), which was aligned with the Afghanistan National Development Strategy (2008–2013).
At present, ADB’s operations are based on the Interim CPS 2014–2015, which extends the strategic
focus of the CPS 2009-2013. The Interim CPS is aligned with NPPs and the government’s
development strategy—Towards Self Reliance—A Strategic Vision Beyond 2025.
3.
ADB is one of the largest donors to the government of Afghanistan. By end-December 2014,
ADB’s total assistance comprising grants, loans and technical assistance (TA) reached $4.03 billion.
Since 2007, ADB has provided all of its public sector assistance on a 100 percent grant basis. Grants
make up around 74 percent of ADB’s overall assistance to Afghanistan. In the July 2012 Tokyo
Conference, ADB committed another $1.2 billion to support Afghanistan through 2016.
4.
ADB supports co-financing of its projects to increase synergies by combining the strengths
of development partners, governments, and ADB itself. As of August 31, 2015, the cumulative direct
value-added official co-financing amounted to $518.6 million for 22 investment projects and
$14.7 million for 14 TA projects. ADB manages the Afghanistan Infrastructure Trust Fund (AITF)—a
financing modality for development partners and private sector who are interested in pooling
resources to finance infrastructure projects in Afghanistan. AITF allows development partners to
meet the pledge of 50 percent on-budget and 80 percent alignment with NPPs as agreed in the
2010 Kabul Conference. As of 30 June 2015, the total amount received in AITF was $350.65 million,
with total commitments of $490.55 million, including funds from Japan (Embassy of Japan,
$126.0 million), United States (USAID, $105.0 million), and United Kingdom (DFID, $119.6 million out
of a total commitment of $259.55 million).

5.
ADB is the largest on-budget donor in the transport sector. As of December 31, 2014, ADB
has provided $2.2 billion to construct or upgrade over 1,700 km of regional and national roads and
to rehabilitate four regional airports. All four are fully operational, with usage more than doubled.
Travel times on selected national roads decreased by more than half as a result of ADB-assisted
projects. ADB funded Afghanistan’s first railway line between Mazar-e-Sharif and the border of
Uzbekistan, which became fully operational in 2012. To date, about 9 million tons of goods have
been transported. ADB supported the establishment of the Afghanistan Railway Authority to
regulate and ensure the sustainability of the railway sector.
6.
ADB is the largest on-budget donor in the energy sector. As of 31 December 2014, ADB has
invested $921.31 million in Afghanistan’s energy sector, and committed an additional $750 million
to strengthen the country’s energy supply chain. ADB-assisted projects have added 590 km of
transmission lines, providing electricity to more than 5 million people. Ongoing projects will
generate an additional 4.5 megawatts of power, add 500 km of transmission lines, and provide
100,000 new power connections. ADB financed the power master plan of the government and is
currently working on the gas sector master plan. ADB also supports the Turkmenistan, Afghanistan,
Pakistan and India (TAPI) gas pipeline project as well as the Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan,
Afghanistan and Pakistan (TUTAP) electricity project.
7.
The natural resources sector is another government priority sector assisted by ADB. As of
December 31, 2014, total investment reached $545.48 million to rehabilitate and establish new
irrigation and agricultural infrastructure, and strengthen the institutional environment to facilitate
economic growth and improve water resources management. Around 140,000 hectares of irrigated
land have been rehabilitated and upgraded. The investments have led to a more efficient use of
water resources, a rise in agricultural productivity, and improved farm livelihoods.
8.
ADB assistance has improved fiscal management through policy, institutional and capacitybuilding reforms covering expenditure and revenue management, civil service management,
provincial administration, and transparency and accountability in the public sector.
9.
ADB’s private sector operations in Afghanistan began in 2004. As of August 31, 2015,
cumulative approvals in six projects have amounted to $198.1 million. Total outstanding balances
and undisbursed commitments to private sector projects amounted to $3.5 million. One of the
major private sector projects is the lending to Roshan Cellular Telecommunications Project. ADB
provided financial assistance in the form of direct loans totaling $70 million for Phases 1 and 2 of
the project, as well as B loans and a political risk guarantee. In 2008, ADB approved a direct loan of
$60 million to finance Roshan's Phase 3 expansion. In 2012, this project received an award for
Excellence in Fragile States Engagement from the US Treasury. In the financial sector, ADB invested
$2.6 million in Afghanistan International Bank (AIB), thus establishing the first private commercial
bank in the post-Taliban regime.
10.
ADB is an active member of the Joint Coordination and Monitoring Board (JCMB) and the
Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund Management Committee. ADB plays an active part in other
donor coordination activities, including the JCMB Social and Economic Development Standing

Committee, the Ministry of Finance's High Level Committee on Aid Effectiveness, and the InterMinisterial Committee on Energy. ADB strongly supports all international policy dialogues on
Afghanistan. Furthermore, it takes the lead in the infrastructure sector and regional cooperationrelated policy dialogues. ADB is a member of the core donor group (5+3) to ensure coordination
and harmonization among donors and the government over policy reforms and development
programs. ADB consults continuously with civil society and non-governmental organizations with
regard to project design and implementation.

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN: STATISTICAL
ISSUES
(As of October 17, 2015)

I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. The key
data shortcomings are in national accounts and in the external sector mainly due to
organizational weaknesses and difficult security situation.

National Accounts. The compilation broadly follows the System of National Accounts 1993
(1993 SNA). GDP is compiled by the production and expenditure approaches. Key expenditure
aggregates (household consumption, gross fixed capital formation, imports and exports) are
available, while changes in inventories are derived residually. Coverage of economic activities is
limited due to data gaps which are severe for some provinces and some activities. Foreign trade
data should be improved in terms of coverage, concepts, and timeliness. The 2002–2003 base
year is more than 10 years old and needs to be updated.
Price Statistics. The CSO compiles and publishes monthly consumer price indexes for the
nation, the capital city Kabul, and nine other major cities. Overcoming severe security and
resource constraints, CSO has recently undertaken a major overhaul of the CPI, including
(i) implementation of full, five-digit Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose
(COICOP); (ii) update of consumer basket weights using data from a recent household survey
(previous weights dated back to 1987); and (iii) expansion of coverage from six to ten
cities/provinces (out of 34). While concepts and compilation practices attempt to follow good
practices, there is a scope for additional improvement including further expanding coverage,
upgrading the IT system and communication channels with remote provinces, strengthening
quality control and field supervision of price collectors, as well as hiring and training more staff.
Government Finance Statistics. Fiscal data are compiled for the central and general
government on cash basis based on the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM
2001). The timeliness and quality of the central and general government core budget data
have been improving, particularly after completion of the roll out and connectivity of the
Afghanistan Financial Management Information System (AFMIS) to all central government
line ministries and agencies in Kabul and all provincial offices. With IMF support, the Ministry
of Finance is implementing GFSM 2001, with annual data for both above and below the line
transactions being reported. The authorities are reporting monthly GFS data to the IMF for
the central government core budget and the ministry is also working on expanding the
coverage of monthly and quarterly GFS data to general government.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

Monetary and Financial Statistics. Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) reports the Standardized
Report Forms (SRFs) 1SR for DAB, 2SR for the other depository corporations (ODCs), and 5SR for
monetary aggregates for publication in the IMF's International Financial Statistics (IFS) on a
monthly basis with a lag of one month. However, there are data reporting issues arising from the
restructuring of the Kabul Bank.
Financial Sector Surveillance: Afghanistan reports 11 of the 12 core financial soundness
indicators (FSIs) and 9 of the 13 encouraged FSIs for deposit takers, and 2 FSIs for real estate
markets on a quarterly basis for posting on the IMF’s FSI website.
External Sector Statistics. Balance of payments and international investment position (IIP)
statistics have been compiled according to the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual.
Steps to convert the data into the sixth edition of Balance of Payments and International
Investment Position Manual format are underway. Several TA missions provided by METAC have
assisted the DAB in improving international accounts compilation in the past years, the most
recent during November 3–7, 2014. In spite of this technical assistance (TA), progress in some
areas—such as foreign trade, estimation of informal trade transactions, collection, and
classification of data on current and capital transfers, and direct investment survey
implementation—is still slow. Progress in those areas would require stronger commitment by the
authorities to implement former missions’ recommendations, strengthening inter-institutional
and inter-departmental cooperation, and leveraging resources. The compilation of external debt
arrears and reserve assets, as well as the consistency across external sector datasets and with
monetary and financial statistics also need further improvement. In September 2015, METAC will
provide further TA mission to DAB staff.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Afghanistan has been a GDDS participant since June
2006, but its metadata has not been updated since then.

No data ROSC has been published

III. Reporting to STA
The authorities are reporting data for the Fund’s International Financial Statistics, Government
Finance Statistics Yearbook, and the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND FIRST REVIEW UNDER THE STAFF-MONITORED
PROGRAM—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By
Adnan Mazarei and
Dhaneshwar Ghura (IMF),
and Satu Kahkonen (IDA)

International Monetary Fund15
International Development Association

Afghanistan’s external debt is low after extensive debt relief, but given its heavy reliance on
grant financing (43 percent of GDP in 2014, including both on and off-budget grants), public
external debt is judged to remain at high risk of distress according to the IMF-World Bank
framework. Under the baseline scenario, with strong reform effort and donor support,
improved security and reduced uncertainty, debt is sustainable. However, under a scenario
assuming a plausible grant-financing shortfall, debt burden indicators quickly become
unsustainable. If security and macroeconomic conditions improve, an improvement of the risk
rating could be considered in a future assessment. Accordingly, the authorities should continue
their efforts to mobilize revenue, raise the efficiency of public spending through careful
prioritization, and press ahead with their reform efforts, while donors should continue to
provide financing in the form of grants.

15

This DSA was prepared by IMF staff with input from World Bank, using the standard debt sustainability framework
for low-income countries (LIC-DSA); see “Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the Joint Bank-Fund Debt
Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries” http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2013/110513.pdf. The
LIC-DSA compares the evolution over the projection period of debt-burden indicators against policy-dependent
indicative thresholds, using the three-year average of the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment
(CPIA). With an average 2012–14 CPIA of 2.7, Afghanistan is classified as having “weak performance” under the LICDSF.

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK
8.
The DSA’s baseline macroeconomic scenario assumes a gradual improvement of security with continued
reform and donor support during the Transformation Decade (2015–24). This scenario is similar to the
previous DSA of April 2014 (Box 1). The baseline also assumes political stability with regular election
cycles and continued economic reform with governments delivering on Afghanistan’s development
goals and priorities that improve the business environment and governance to support privatesector-led inclusive growth. The baseline scenario also assumes continued donor support, in line
with donors’ statements at the December 2014 London Conference, namely, their Tokyo
commitment of providing $16 billion through 2015, and sustaining support, through 2017, at or
near the levels of the past decade. Going forward, donors committed to significant and continuing
support that would decline.16 This support for Afghanistan’s social and economic development
priorities through the Transformation Decade is predicated on the Afghan government delivering on
its commitments under the Mutual Accountability Framework. At the same time, donors expect that
Afghanistan will gradually increase its contribution and, over time, assume financial costs of the
security sector.

1/ The differences between the base period exports and imports in the current and previous DSAs are explained by
having new and improved data as well as new mining sector projections.
2/ Change in imports in 2014-18 between the current and previous DSAs is due to higher grant related imports.

9.
In this scenario, growth is projected to recover and the external current account
(before grants) to improve gradually. GDP growth is projected to average about 5 percent in the
16

In the baseline, total off budget and on budget grants are projected to decline as a share of GDP, from 45 percent
in 2015 to 30 percent in 2020, and 12 percent in 2035, with an increasing share provided to the civilian sector.

medium term (2016–20), supported by investment and production in the mining industry later in the
decade, and to stabilize at about 4½ percent in the long run (Table 1), similar to the projection in
the previous DSA. The main change relative to the previous DSA relates to lower growth rates in the
near term. This lower growth is due to a slower recovery in economic confidence than projected
earlier, because the political transition was longer than expected and some delays in planned
implementation of mining projects as well as lower commodity prices. This lower growth is expected
to be temporary, as the political transition has been completed. Growth is expected to gain steam
with a recovery in confidence, increasing mining and energy related activity from 2018 onwards and
the impact of continued reform, although there is downside risk that mining development could be
delayed with renegotiation of several contracts and weaker commodity prices. The external current
account deficit before grants is expected to improve gradually over the projection period as a whole.
The initial deterioration of the external current account reflects the import of mining-related capital
goods in minerals extraction. Non-mineral exports are projected to increase progressively from a
low level. At the same time, imports are projected to stabilize in outer years with donor-financed
imports slowing. Accordingly, the current account deficit excluding grants should narrow gradually
from about 37 percent of GDP in 2014 to about 10 percent of GDP at the end of the projection
horizon (Figure 1).

Expenditures would decline marginally as a share of GDP over the coming decade.
Expenditures are driven by three factors: security, development, and the civilian operating costs,
including wages, pension contributions, and operating and maintenance costs of public
infrastructure. Security spending will remain substantial and is projected to reach 17 percent of GDP
by 2020, decline to 13 percent by 2025, and stabilize at about 7–8 percent in the outer years, as
security conditions improve and with some reduction in the size of security forces that will start
toward the end of this decade. Non-security operating spending is expected to grow as the onbudget transfer of spending that was previously donor-managed and the associated large

operations and maintenance costs related to donor-funded infrastructure projects continues.17
Finally, public spending will also rise on account of increases in the size of the civil service,
particularly in health and education, to facilitate a meaningful progress towards the Sustainable
Development Goals, and a gradual rise in pensions.18 Given Afghanistan’s large development needs,
development spending, including off budget spending, is projected to be about 10 percent of GDP,
an increase of 1 percent of GDP on budget in this decade to meet Afghanistan’s human
development and infrastructure needs.
11.
Significant growth in domestic revenues is projected in the medium term, despite the
VAT introduction and mining revenue coming on stream only later. Domestic revenues declined
by 2.5 percentage points of GDP during 2011–2014, reflecting lower compliance and enforcement as
well as lower import growth and economic activity due to political and security uncertainties.
Furthermore, VAT implementation planned for 2015 has been postponed. Other revenue measures
were introduced in 2015, to help mitigate the revenue impact of the postponement of the VAT
introduction, and are expected to mobilize revenue of around 1 percent of GDP per year in the
medium term. The impact of mining and energy projects on the medium-term revenue outlook
remains substantial notwithstanding the delay compared to the 2014 DSA. The introduction of VAT
by the end of decade and a sustained effort to improve compliance will also be needed. The
baseline scenario assumes that: (i) the VAT introduction in 2019 will yield around 1 percent of GDP
in its initial years and above 2 percent of GDP in the long term; (ii) the tax policy mix is improved,
e.g. through the introduction of excise and property taxes, and rationalization of exemptions will
yield up to 1 percent of GDP in additional revenues after 2020; (iii) tax and customs administration
reforms will be forcefully implemented; and (iv) revenues from mining and energy projects will start
flowing in 2018. As a result, by 2025 the ratio of domestic revenues to GDP will reach 16-17 percent
of GDP, similar to the previous DSA, and 20 percent of GDP by 2035, a level that is typical for a lowincome country.
12.
Given these revenue and expenditure trends, Afghanistan’s total financing needs are
expected to remain significant. Over the long term, the overall budget deficit (excluding grants)
will remain at above 12 percent of GDP, as in the previous DSA. A small share could be financed
from external concessional loans, and there is also some limited scope for domestic financing
through a sukuk— projected to be introduced in 2018—mainly for market development and
liquidity management purposes. This will leave a projected financing gap of over 10 percent of GDP
in 2020 and beyond. Fiscal sustainability—defined as domestic revenues covering operating
spending—will likely only to be reached after 2035.

17

The recurrent operation and maintenance costs for all assets built in Afghanistan since 2002, excluding the security
sector, are estimated at about $1 billion annually or more—and growing as new assets are being built. Sustainment
costs in the security sector are harder to estimate, but could be as high as $2 billion per year.
18

Wage restraint is assumed, with the wage growth rate indexed to inflation until 2020 and limited to 3 percentage
points over inflation until 2025, and equal to nominal GDP growth rate after 2025.

DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
13.
Afghanistan’s public debt remains modest. Afghanistan passed the HIPC completion
point and received debt relief in 2006. External public and publicly guaranteed debt amounted to
$1.3 billion, or 6.4 percent of GDP in 2014, mostly to multilateral creditors.19 It is equivalent to 3.4
19

This debt stock is after delivery of the already-pledged debt relief commitments and excluding some minimal
amounts of non-yet-reconciled or disputed debt. Afghanistan is still following up with one Paris Club creditor on its
debt relief commitments, as well as with several non-Paris Club creditors on debt relief on comparable terms. In
terms of debt structure and composition: apart from a small amount of legacy debt (less than 1 percent of total),
most of the external debt is owed to multilateral institutions, mainly regional and international financial institutions.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

percent of GDP in present value (PV) terms, and to about 22 percent of exports and 40 percent of
government revenues (Table 2a). Under the baseline scenario—in which Afghanistan’s financing gap,
net of domestic financing, is entirely met by grants—the present value of public external debt would
be about 3.3 percent of GDP by the end of the projection period, while total public debt would be
19.7 percent of GDP, both below the indicative debt-burden threshold applicable to a country like
Afghanistan.20
14.
Although the debt burden is modest, potential risks to grant financing put
Afghanistan at high risk of external debt distress. Risks to this baseline include an abrupt decline
in grants (an alternative scenario) combined with a shift towards debt financing, a deterioration in
the security situation, which would put upward pressure on spending, or slow or reverse revenue
mobilization reforms. These factors could put Afghanistan’s debt burden on an unsustainable path.
While donors have reconfirmed their financial support in the short to medium term at the 2014
London Conference, the longer-term prospects are less certain and will be discussed in 2016 at the
Warsaw and Brussels conferences.
15.
The standard Debt Sustainability Framework shocks result in benign outcomes. They
result only in three breaches of the debt thresholds (the present value (PV) of external debt to
exports and PV of external debt to revenue during this decade and PV of public debt to GDP ratio
by the end of the projection period).21 However, the standard shocks generated by the Debt
Sustainability Framework are mostly driven by the economic performance over the past ten years.
While for many countries the recent past might be a useful guide for projections, this is less so in
the case of Afghanistan—with average annual real GDP growth of 8.9 percent and official transfers
of 53 percent of GDP. The high GDP growth represented a catch-up from a low post-conflict base,
and while large grant financing has been committed for the medium term, its projected magnitude
is less (as a share of GDP) than grants received over the past decade, which were exceptionally large
and front-loaded to finance post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction. Therefore, to ensure the
risks are correctly captured, a customized illustrative scenario, which examines debt sustainability
with plausible downside risks that are Afghanistan-specific, is developed.
16.
The customized illustrative scenario takes into account Afghanistan’s circumstances
and possible downside risks and indicates that Afghanistan faces significant risks, which if
realized, would breach debt thresholds and result in a high risk of debt distress.22 The
customized scenario focuses on the debt dynamics generated by a downward shift in the grant path.
This scenario does not take into account second round effects on trade, security, interest rates, and

Under the DSA framework, the external debt thresholds for countries with similar economic performance and
income level as Afghanistan are: for the PV of debt—30 percent of GDP, 100 percent of exports, and 200 percent of
revenues; for debt service, 15 percent of exports and 18 percent of revenues.
20

The PV of debt to exports and PV of debt to revenue ratio thresholds are breached when net official transfers and
net FDI are one standard deviation below their historical average (Figure 3). The shock is applied to two years
(2016-2017) and thereafter the PV of debt to exports declines.

growth. However, on the upside, if security stabilizes, and macroeconomic conditions continue to
improve, the external risk rating may be lowered in future DSAs.
17.
The customized illustrative scenario assumes a gradual drop in grants starting in 2017.
This scenario assumes that lack of progress in reforms, donor fatigue, and/or a shift in donors’
priorities lead to a gradual reduction in aid beginning in 2017 and reaching a level of 50 percent of
the baseline by 2021 and beyond. At the same time, it is assumed that the nominal GDP levels are
similar to the baseline, the level of public services envisaged in the baseline scenario is preserved,
and additional revenue is not mobilized. 80 percent of the resulting financing gap is covered with
concessional external loans, and the remainder with domestic non-concessional borrowing. Under
this scenario, debt burden indicators deteriorate rapidly, breaching virtually every threshold. The PV
of external debt would reach over 90 percent of GDP, or about 375 percent of exports, by the end of
the projection period. The PV of total public debt would reach over 130 percent of GDP, around 660
percent of revenues, and the debt-service-to-revenue ratio will rise to about 35 percent (Figure 4).

AUTHORITIES’ VIEWS
18.
The authorities broadly agreed with the conclusions of the DSA. They emphasized that
continued donor financing is critical to ensure debt sustainability, while delivering on their
commitments to the donor community, and that they wished to keep the debt level low. They
recognized substantial risks going forward, including potential donor fatigue and underscored the
importance of prudent fiscal policy. The authorities also pointed out Afghanistan’s large upfront
expenditure needs, particularly big infrastructure projects with potentially high rates of economic
and social returns, which could support regional integration and growth, and were open to
exploring options to mobilize other types of financing in addition to existing donor grants, including
concessional loans. They also acknowledged the IMF’s advice that contracting concessional loans
would require careful project selection and an independent technical appraisal of expected returns
to maintain debt sustainability, given the limited debt service capacity, and for transparent recording
of its financial impact. They shared staff’s view that sukuks (domestic borrowing) should be used as a
liquidity management instrument and to build up the treasury’s cash balance, rather than to finance
projects or recurrent fiscal deficits. They underscored that further aligning donor support with
Afghan priorities and channeling more funds through the budget could potentially result in
expenditure savings.

CONCLUSIONS
19.
Afghanistan’s debt sustainability will hinge on improved security, and continued
donor grant inflows. After extensive debt relief and substantial medium-term pledges from donors,
Afghanistan’s debt outlook, under the baseline scenario, is benign. However, this is predicated on
continued economic growth, progress in reforms, improvements in security as well as all donor
assistance being provided in the form of grants. The outlook is subject to three main risks. First, an
escalated and prolonged conflict would dampen or stop economic growth and would imply limited

economic reforms and a highly constrained ability by the central government to generate budget
revenues. Second, mining revenues may be delayed, lower than hoped for, or highly volatile, leading
to additional financing needs, and potentially spending cuts that would impact growth. And third,
donor grants may not be forthcoming in the amounts needed, also leading to spending cuts and
lower growth. Under any of these scenarios, Afghanistan would need to implement compensatory
measures and, in the event of a sustained drop in grants (customized illustrative scenario), its debt
burden would quickly become unsustainable and could threaten, in the extreme case, the continuity
of government functions. This analysis underscores the need to redouble efforts to mobilize
domestic revenue—with new policy measures as well as through administrative reforms to improve
compliance—prioritize spending carefully, pursue expenditure rationalization, and raise the
efficiency of public spending. In addition, maintaining macroeconomic stability and vigorous
economic reform efforts will continue to be needed to improve economic governance, strengthen
the financial sector, and spur future growth.

3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price
and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Sources: Afghan authorities; and IMF staff estimates and projections.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly
assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Statement by the Staff Representative on Islamic Republic of Afghanistan
November 18, 2015

This statement updates information in the staff report and does not alter the thrust of the staff
appraisal.
The recent earthquake in Afghanistan affected about 1,500 villages, resulting in 110 fatalities
with hundreds injured and 18,500 houses damaged or destroyed. Preliminary assessments by the
UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs indicate that 129,000 people are in
need of humanitarian assistance. The Afghan National Disaster Management Authority and
NGOs have been delivering emergency aid to people affected by the earthquake. President
Ghani has established a committee to assess the damages from the earthquake. Further, the
authorities have doubled contingency funds for emergencies (to over $20 million) in the
2016 budget. Staff is in touch with the authorities to assess the potential impact on the budget
and stands ready to help respond to this tragic event.
Opium production declined in 2015. The UN Office on Drugs and Crime 2015 opium survey
indicates that opium poppy cultivation area decreased for the first time since 2009. It also
indicates that potential opium production halved in 2015 compared to the 2014 though some of
this decline may reflect a methodology change incorporated in the 2015 survey. While opium
production is not part of the GDP in the staff report, this drop must have contributed to the
slowdown in economic activity in 2015 through its spillover effects on the services sector.
The overall budget recorded a small surplus for first ten months of this fiscal year. Revenue
collection amounted to about 8 percent of annual GDP, 0.2 percent of GDP higher than
projected. Operating expenditures, however, were 0.8 percent of GDP lower than projected,
while development spending was in line with projections. With total grant inflows to the budget
lower than expected (in large part linked to lower operating expenditure), the overall budget
balance was in small surplus for first ten months of this fiscal year. The discretionary cash
balance was Af 13 billion, above the indicative target of Af 5 billion.
The cabinet submitted the 2016 budget to parliament on November 8, 2015. Domestic revenues
are budgeted at 10.2 percent of GDP. Operating expenditure remains constant in nominal terms,
whereas the development expenditure is planned to increase by 17 percent, the bulk of which

2

will be financed through nondiscretionary donor funds. The envisaged budget surplus is
0.7 percent of GDP. Staff will discuss the 2016 budget and medium-term fiscal framework with
the authorities during a staff visit in December.
Following a news report about a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the authorities
and ex-chief executive of Kabul Bank, the President's office issued a press statement. The news
report indicated that there was a MOU related to building a new township in Kabul. The
statement from the President's office indicated that the Kabul Bank verdicts still stand, that the
MOU is not valid, and that the Attorney General’s office will monitor full enforcement of the
court’s verdicts.

Statement by Jafar Mojarrad, Executive Director for Islamic Republic of Afghanistan
and Abdelalil Jbili, Advisor to Executive Director
November 18, 2015
On behalf of our Afghan authorities, we thank staff for the high quality reports and Executive
Directors and management for their continued support to Afghanistan. The authorities are highly
appreciative of the Fund’s continued engagement with them in these challenging circumstances,
and agree with staff analysis and recommendations.
Overview
The Afghan authorities have made significant progress over the last decade in rebuilding the
economy and institutions, achieving macroeconomic stability, and improving human
development indicators. As documented in the report, access to primary health, maternal health,
child mortality rates, school enrollment, and universal primary education are close to the 2015
targets. However, adverse external and domestic conditions have not allowed the economy to
fully reap the benefits of these advances. The drawdown of international troops, increased
security concerns, and political uncertainty in the aftermath of the 2014 presidential election
adversely affected confidence and held back the recovery.
Notwithstanding these challenges, the new administration of President Ghani and Chief
Executive Abdullah, which took office in late 2014, moved forward to address vulnerabilities
and advance the structural reform agenda in close collaboration with the Fund under a Staff
Monitored Program (SMP), and other development partners. Following up on the Tokyo
conference in July 2012 and the London conference in December 2014, the authorities

2

reaffirmed their strong commitment to addressing the many challenges facing Afghanistan in the
context of the Senior Officials Meeting (SOM) of September 2015.
Recent economic developments and outlook
The sharp growth deceleration that started in 2013 continued into 2014, with real GDP growth
falling further to 1.3 percent, reflecting the difficult security situation and weak private
investment during the political transition. In turn, subdued economic activity and rising
unemployment contributed to increasing emigration. The fiscal situation also deteriorated owing
to the decline in domestic revenue collection and higher operating expenditure, leading to a
sharp fall in cash balances and the emergence of domestic payment arrears. Inflation fell to
1.4 percent by end–2014 and to -1.9 percent in September 2015, reflecting weak economic
activity and lower global fuel and food prices. The external current account deficit, excluding
official transfers, rose to 37 percent of GDP in 2014, but was more than covered by official
transfers. Gross official reserves exceeded 8 months of imports and the exchange rate remained
in line with medium-term fundamentals.
Afghanistan’s medium-term outlook hinges critically on lasting improvement in the security
situation, steadfast implementation of reforms to address current fragilities, continued donor
assistance, and execution of important mining projects. Developments in these areas going
forward can tilt the balance of risks to the downside as well as the upside. In 2015, the recovery
is expected to remain modest with growth picking up to 2 percent, as uncertainty dissipates,
before gradually increasing to 3-5 percent from 2016 onward.
Performance under the SMP
Staff indicates that performance under the SMP for end-June and end-September 2015 has been
satisfactory. All quantitative PCs have been met, except for social and other priority spending
for June and September and the budget revenue target for September. The Treasury’s cash
balance was replenished following the disbursement of grants in September and was above the
indicative target. Pro-poor spending was below the target, but the pace of execution is expected
to pick up during the last quarter. Implementation of structural reforms has been slower than

3

expected given the time needed for technical preparation and to build consensus around these
measures. Nonetheless, three out of four structural benchmarks were observed.
Against the background of lower-than-envisaged growth and inflation in 2015, and given the
increasing pressure on the foreign exchange market emanating from the migration outflow,
reserve money growth and international reserve accumulation targets for end-December 2015
under the SMP were revised.
Fiscal policies and debt sustainability
The fiscal situation remains challenging against the background of low revenue collection as a
result of weak economic activity, high security risks, and rising spending needs. While the
authorities agree with the need to strengthen revenue mobilization and prioritize spending, donor
financing of development spending and part of operating expenditure will be needed for several
years to come.
The authorities have taken important steps toward enhancing revenue mobilization. A number of
revenue measures were introduced in 2015 under the SMP, including an increase in tariffs,
overflight fees, the business receipt tax, and fuel fees collected at the customs, as well as the
introduction of a telecommunications fee. These, together with improved tax compliance, are
projected to yield additional revenue of about 1 percent of GDP per year in the medium-term.
The authorities also made progress in strengthening tax administration and plan to enhance
collection of tax arrears. While the VAT was postponed pending better preparation to ensure its
successful introduction, the authorities are confident that it will help strengthen the revenue base
over the medium-term, together with taxation of future mineral activities, for which a
transparent fiscal regime is being developed in line with the EITI.
On the expenditure side, efforts have been directed toward containing non-priority spending,
limiting increases in wages, pensions, and bonuses, and reviewing the targeting of payments to
families of martyrs and disabled persons. Pro-poor spending will be maintained at 2.7 percent of

4

GDP in line with the SMP target. Public Finance Management is being strengthened in
consultation with donors and stakeholders.
Afghanistan’s debt is very low (6.4 percent of GDP at end-2014) and is sustainable under the
baseline scenario of continued reform and donor financing of the gap through grants, although it
would be vulnerable to security or political instability shocks.
Monetary and financial sector policies
Monetary policy will continue to adjust to an environment of slower-than-anticipated growth in
money demand, weak economic activity, and lower-than-programmed inflation. DAB remains
committed to a flexible exchange rate policy and intends to enhance its communication strategy
to strengthen confidence. In parallel, efforts are under way to develop domestic currencydenominated instruments, including sukuks, to be used for open market operations.
Notable progress has been made in banking sector reform. The sale of New Kabul Bank (NKB)
was initiated in October 2015, while asset recovery by the Bad Debt Commission has continued.
The banking law was enacted in August 2015, and will help address remaining weaknesses in
the banking system. Regulations on asset classification and provisioning have been revised in
September 2015, and work is underway to introduce regulations on corporate governance and
related-party lending. Banking supervision has been stepped up and the authorities are
determined to build robust institutions and strengthen the independence of DAB. Moreover,
amendments to the AML/CFT laws were approved by the President in April 2015.
Fostering high and inclusive growth
As presented at the recent donor conference and the September SOM, the authorities’ strategy to
promote inclusive growth and raise productivity involves wide-ranging reforms, including
reforming the public administration, strengthening governance and combating corruption,
unifying trade and investment licenses, establishing one-stop shop for private businesses, and
reforming land management and acquisition laws. The authorities also plan to develop strategic
sectors, such as agriculture and mining, which can boost growth and increase job opportunities

5

and tax revenue. Investment in infrastructure through PPPs could also allow Afghanistan to
benefit from its position at the confluence of South and Central Asia. The authorities look
forward to technical assistance from the Fund and development partners in support of their
reform strategy.
Ex-post assessment of longer-term program engagement
The authorities share the candid assessment and conclusions of the EPA, which provides useful
lessons for future Fund engagement with Afghanistan. Of particular interest is the report’s
emphasis on the need for strong program ownership, realistic assessment of implementation
capacity, well-prioritized and macro-critical structural conditionality, and effective coordination
among donors, along with scaled-up capacity building. The authorities are committed to do their
part in this joint effort and look forward to a follow up Fund-supported program after the
expiration of the current SMP.
