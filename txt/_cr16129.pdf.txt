IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Colombia
April 29, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Colombia.
Colombia showed strong resilience to changing global conditions in 2015. Despite facing a
terms-of-trade shock larger than most of its peers, Colombia posted one of the highest growth
rates in the region (3.1 percent) and achieved important social gains with improvements in
poverty reduction, income inequality and financial inclusion. Growth was underpinned by a
strong real private consumption while private investment slowed down. The decline in oil prices
eroded exports and fiscal revenue, and led to a strong depreciation of the peso which fueled
inflationary pressures as the external adjustment process got under way. The central government
reaffirmed its commitment to the fiscal rule and achieved its structural balance target through
timely expenditure cuts and revenue increases from the end-2014 tax reform. The central bank
initiated a tightening cycle in September to ensure the anchoring of inflation expectations and
contain the widening current account deficit.
A moderation in domestic demand will guide a soft-landing in 2016. Colombia is facing a second
large terms of trade shock. Growth will slow to 2.5 percent, as private investment will moderate
despite the advances in the 4G infrastructure agenda. As the current weather shocks subside,
inflation will moderate and gradually converge toward the target band. The ongoing fiscal
restraint and monetary policy tightening will help bring the current account toward levels
consistent with a more subdued outlook for global financing. The large peso depreciation would
boost non-traditional exports but they will also be constrained by the weak economic outlook in
Colombia’s neighbors.
A broadly sound financial system and corporate and household balance sheets also contributed to
Colombia’s resilience. The real growth in bank credit has moderated in recent months but some
areas are still growing at a fast pace. Consumption-related credit has slowed down more
markedly in line with subdued durable-good consumption; however, commercial credit has

remained buoyant due in part to corporates’ efforts to replace external credit lines. Corporate and
household leverage remains modest by international standards.
The medium-term outlook is favorable but surrounded by downside risks. Growth will gradually
approach its medium-term potential of about 4 percent supported by the 4G infrastructure agenda
and some recovery in non-traditional exports and oil prices. The current account deficit will
gradually decline and approach its medium-term sustainable level through a combination of
import compression and export expansion. The main near-term risks stem from Colombia’s still
significant near-term external financing needs and potential capital inflow reversals resulting
from volatile global financial conditions. Further declines in oil prices could fuel additional
currency depreciation and inflation. On the upside, bringing the peace process to fruition could
further improve business confidence and capital inflows, reinforcing the recovery that will
follow the necessary adjustment process.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive directors were encouraged by the Colombian economy’s resilience to adverse global
conditions, which has been supported by its strong policy framework and the authorities’
coordinated and proactive policy response. Directors commended the tightening of
macroeconomic policies, in particular by allowing the flexible exchange rate to be the first line
of defense to absorb the impact of a large and persistent terms-of-trade shock. They also noted
that the country recorded one of the strongest growth rates in the region over the past year, which
supported further progress in reducing income inequality and enhancing financial inclusion.
Directors noted that Colombia’s medium term outlook is generally favorable, but clouded by
heightened downside risks. They shared the view that volatility in global financial markets,
including stemming from China’s ongoing economic adjustment, vulnerability to swings in
market sentiment, and the weak economic outlook of some of Colombia’s neighbors pose key
risks. Directors concurred that the resolution of the domestic peace process could unleash further
regional development and foster business competitiveness.
Directors welcomed the central bank’s resolve to tighten monetary policy to guide inflation
expectations back to the target range. Some additional policy tightening may be needed, if
conditions warrant it, to help guide the current account deficit toward its medium term
equilibrium level. They emphasized that exchange rate flexibility should continue to be used as a
shock absorber. Directors noted that the broadly smooth functioning of local financial markets
amid the very large peso depreciation reflects the well earned credibility of the inflation targeting
regime.
Directors saw merit in further fiscal consolidation and welcomed the authorities’ commitment to
the fiscal rule. They called for prompt efforts to implement a structural tax reform this year

which will protect key social spending, while adhering to the rule’s targets. Directors encouraged
efforts to step up domestic revenue mobilization by broadening the base and enhancing tax
administration, while also making the tax system more efficient and progressive in order to
replace revenues lost with the oil price shock.
Directors commended recent advances in financial regulation and supervision that have further
expanded the ability to respond to changing global and local conditions. They encouraged the
authorities to continue reforming the regulatory framework in line with Basel III and
strengthening the resolution framework. Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to enhance
their stress testing framework and corporate surveillance, but also noted the importance of
continued vigilance of corporate sector developments and the timely approval of the financial
conglomerates law. They commended the authorities for volunteering to be the first emerging
market to undertake a pilot self assessment under the FSB’s “Key Attributes of Effective
Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions.”
Directors welcomed further efforts to advance a well designed structural reform agenda that will
underpin economic diversification and inclusive growth over the medium term. They welcomed
recent progress on the public-private partnership based infrastructure agenda and called for
continued efforts to improve the business environment, strengthen competitiveness, and improve
access to quality education.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
April 18, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context. A strong policy framework has allowed Colombia to begin to adjust smoothly
to the large decline in oil prices since mid-2014. The current account deficit, relative to
GDP, widened to historical highs with the steep drop in oil exports. In 2015,
macroeconomic policies were tightened to curb the growth in domestic demand and
contain inflationary pressures arising from the sharp currency depreciation. A sound
financial system and resilient corporate and household balance sheets have also
contributed to the smooth adjustment. Real GDP growth slowed last year but still
outperformed most countries in the region. The authorities are pressing ahead with
their infrastructure program and a completion of the peace process is expected later
this year.
Outlook and risks. Colombia is facing another large terms of trade shock in 2016,
together with tightening global financial conditions. Staff projects real growth to slow
further to 2.5 percent in 2016 and gradually rise toward its potential of about 4 percent
a year over the medium term, supported by the government’s PPP-based infrastructure
program and some gradual export diversification. Risks are mainly to the downside,
stemming in part from large gross external financing needs, and include bouts of global
financial volatility, a protracted period of slower growth in advanced and emerging
economies and a further decline in oil prices.
Macro-financial policies. Additional tightening of demand policies will help ensure a
soft-landing and spearhead the external adjustment to a dimmer outlook for oil exports
and fiscal revenue. Fiscal restraint will also put public debt back on a downward path. A
tighter monetary stance will keep inflation expectations anchored and contain credit
growth. Approval of the financial conglomerates law will improve the authorities’ ability
to manage cross-border risks.
Medium-term challenges. Continued progress in the authorities’ structural reform
agenda will facilitate economic diversification and further advance inclusive growth. A
structural tax reform that improves progressivity and strengthens business
competitiveness is urgently needed to protect key expenditure areas while complying
with the fiscal rule targets.

BACKGROUND
1.
Despite adverse global circumstances, Colombia’s successful policies and inclusive
growth agenda continued in 2015. During the last decade Colombia’s strong policy framework
has underpinned high GDP growth, a steady reduction in poverty rates and, to a lesser extent, in
income inequality. In 2015, the poverty rate further declined to 24.1 percent from 24.6 percent in
2014. Income inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient declined to 52.2 in 2015 after being
near 54 for three consecutive years. Financial inclusion improved as well. Colombia’s process of
accession to the OECD is on track, which has resulted in further strengthening of the institutional
framework.1
2.
The Colombian government has intensified its efforts to reach the completion of the
multi-year peace negotiations. The government has been holding peace talks with the main
guerilla group (FARC) since 2012 and this represents a key objective for President Santos’
administration. In September 2015, President Santos announced an agreement on a framework for
transitional justice, an important milestone. This follows previous achievements on land reform,
FARC participation in the political process and agreement on illicit narcotic crops. Pending issues
include the timeline for disarmament, and the procedure to ratify the peace agreements. A deadline
set to reach an agreement (March 23, 2016) was missed, but both the government and the FARC are
committed to continue negotiations and reach an agreement in the near-term. Recently, the
government announced the initiation of peace talks with the second largest guerrilla movement
(ELN).
3.
Exchange regime and economic data. Colombia has a floating exchange rate regime (de
jure and de facto). Colombia maintains an exchange restriction subject to Fund approval under
Article VIII arising from the special regime for the hydrocarbon sector (see IMF Country Report
No. 13/35 for details). Data provision is adequate for surveillance.
4.
Past Fund advice. Recent policy measures have been broadly aligned with past Fund advice
with no major area of disagreement. Since the 2015 Article IV Consultation, the authorities have
advanced on some key remaining 2012 FSAP recommendations including on legal protection and
independence of supervisors, regulation and supervision of conglomerates and stress tests analysis.
They also made progress on the infrastructure agenda and streamlining of regulations. The
authorities plan to submit a structural tax reform later this year to create space for key social
spending while complying with the fiscal rule, and while they agreed with the importance of pension
reform, the urgency to adjust to changing global conditions has understandably delayed efforts on
this area. At the same time, the authorities aptly tightened policies in response to more protracted
global shocks and inflationary pressures than anticipated at the time of the 2015 Article IV
consultation.
1

As of April 10, 2016, 15 OECD committees (the approval of 23 committees is required for accession) have given
green light to Colombia’s accession.

Colombia’s external environment
worsened in 2015. The large decline in oil prices, a
much larger terms-of-trade shock than the regional
average, was accompanied by weaker growth
among Colombia’s trading partners (notably
Venezuela and Ecuador). External financial
conditions also tightened with an increase in
government bond spreads and smaller portfolio
inflows (after record levels in 2014)

.Despite the large external shock, Colombia’s
economy showed remarkable resilience in 2015. The
fall in oil prices led to a reduction in national income
and a strong peso depreciation. Real GDP growth
moderated to 3.1 percent as investment weakened,
while private consumption remained brisk on the back
of relatively strong credit growth (Figure 1). Still, staff
estimates that the economy posted a small positive
output gap in 2015. The depreciation and weatherrelated food shocks pushed inflation outside the target
band (2−4 percent) since February, closing the year at
6.8 percent; core inflation ended at 5.2 percent, while
expectations increased to 4.5 percent.

Box 1. Monetary and Financial Conditions in Colombia
A study of monetary and financial conditions indices provides useful insights about macro-financial linkages.
Traditional indices based on interest rates and spreads suggest that financial Conditions have loosened since
mid-2014. However, a more recent indicator that can be related to intermediaries’ balance sheet data suggests
otherwise—in line with our assessment of a moderation in credit and demand growth.

Overall, the MRP has been increasing since mid-2014,
suggesting that the risk appetite of financial
intermediaries is decreasing as their balance sheets
tighten—which is consistent with a slight moderation of
credit growth. Moreover, the ongoing monetary policy
tightening will further reduce the risk-taking capacity of
the banks and contribute to the slowdown of credit
growth in line with the envisaged slowdown in aggregate
demand.

These indices summarize the information in financial
price variables, ignoring balance sheet data.
Moreover, they give too much weight to exchange
rates—which are performing an important in the current
economic adjustment process in Colombia. Thus, we follow
Adrian et al (2010) and study the impact of balance sheet
indicators on the determination of an aggregate “Macro
Risk Premium” (MRP) that excludes the exchange rate. They
show that when intermediaries are less capital constrained
by their value at risk limit, their risk appetite and the supply
of credit increase, while the MRP decreases. We find that
the MRP is indeed negatively correlated with GDP growth,
and that higher credit growth is associated with lower MRP.

Monetary Conditions and Financial Conditions Indices
(MCI and FCI) explore the link between broad
financial conditions and real economic activity. These
indices suggest that financial conditions eased since mid2014, reflecting largely the depreciation of the currency.
However, the ongoing monetary policy tightening and
subsequent increase in lending spreads, together with a
slowdown in the depreciation rate, are likely to tighten
financial conditions and weigh on growth going forward

Note: An upward movement of the index implies more accommodative financial conditions.

Corporate and household balance sheets remained resilient but with some signs of
vulnerability in commodity-related sectors. Bank loans remain the main source of corporate
financing and foreign currency funding represents about 33 percent of total corporate debt.
Corporate debt is modest by international standards but the authorities’ analysis shows that debtat-risk—owed by firms with an interest coverage ratio (ICR) less than 2—amounts to 30 percent of
total sample debt. Debt indicators have worsened mainly in the oil and airline industries but
solvency problems remain contained (Box 2). Moreover, debt service capacity had improved for the
largest 100 firms through end-2014, but these gains have been partially erased by the
materialization of commodity price and depreciation shocks in 2015. Household debt is also modest

at 20.5 percent of GDP and 31.8 percent of disposable income. Debt-service capacity seems ample
with debt payments representing about 9½ percent of disposable income. Banks’ remain sound,
with robust asset quality and profitability indicators (Table 7).
11.
The 4G-PPP infrastructure agenda is on track and efforts to finance the agenda started
to pay off. All first-wave projects were allocated and the construction phase has started. The
development fund (FDN) is facilitating financial arrangements with major banks and institutional
investors, and successful funding deals with global banks have been recently completed. The timely
sale of ISAGEN (the public electricity company) for about US$2 billion will help finance the
upcoming waves.
12.
The latest data suggests that the coordinated policy tightening has started to be
transmitted to the economy. The central bank has continued the tightening cycle this year and
increased the policy rate to 6.5 percent in March. Despite a further increase in inflation to 8 percent
in March, inflation expectations have moderated somewhat in early 2016. Weak consumer
confidence in January and February and a further slowdown in credit growth would help contain
private consumption, and there are signs that the currency depreciation is boosting industrial
activity and non-traditional exports.

compensate in part the impact of low oil
prices and tightened policies in 2016. The main short-term adverse impact of the oil shock on
growth is expected through investment (Annex II), which could consequently weaken the oil
production outlook. On the positive side, the cumulative peso depreciation since mid-2014 would
help rebalance spending spur import substitution and buttress non-oil exports. As a result, the
current account deficit will decline to 6 percent of GDP this year and gradually approach its
medium-term sustainable level thereafter (3.8 percent of GDP in 2020).
14.
Monetary and financial conditions will continue to be tightened and contribute to
domestic and external adjustment. The acceleration in inflation continued in early 2016 but is
expected to reverse during the year guided by some further tightening and as the weather-related
food shock and the pass-through from the depreciation die out (Box 3); inflation is expected to
return to the target range by early 2017. Overall credit activity will moderate, as banks absorb the

credit losses from the recent shocks and the slowdown, contributing to a further moderation in
domestic demand and a reduction in external imbalances. A reallocation of credit away from
consumption and toward construction, as the source of growth shifts from commodities to
infrastructure, would underpin the pickup in activity from 2017 onwards. A strong and wellsupervised banking system will withstand the materialization of downside risks.

current account deficit, sizeable corporate short-term external
debt, and higher reliance on portfolio inflows to cover the
current account deficit. Global risks have increased since the last Article IV Consultation and include
weaker growth in advanced economies and uncertainties around issues such as the Fed’s next steps
and the asynchronous unwinding of unconventional monetary policies across reserve-currency
economies. These factors could fuel global risk aversion and lead to reduced risk appetite for
emerging markets assets. Further, a sharper-than-expected growth slowdown in China would have
important spillovers including by further compressing oil and other commodity prices, trade and
capital flows (see RAM). Sharp and persistent drops in oil prices could make large swathes of the oil
industry unprofitable and drastically reduce production. Similarly, delays in the 4G infrastructure
agenda would reduce demand and competitiveness. On the upside, bringing the peace process to
fruition and a prompt approval of a structural tax reform could improve business confidence and
capital inflows.

Box 2. Corporate Sector Vulnerabilities
Background
Colombian private sector corporate debt and leverage have steadily increased from early 2000, in part
influenced by the effects of the peso depreciation. As of June 2015 private sector corporate debt stood at
45 percent of GDP which is modest by international standards. Slightly more than half of total corporate debt
is owed to domestic financial institutions and about 2/3 is peso-denominated.

Stability Report, September 2015). Debt of these fragile
firms (debt at risk) amounted to 30.1 percent of total debt in
the entire sample. At the same time, there are important
differences across industrial sectors. The share of debt at risk is higher in agriculture (36 percent of debt in
that sector is owed by fragile firms), real estate (39 percent) and retail (33 percent).
Staff analysis focused on the largest 100 Colombian corporates, suggests that large firms are less fragile, with
only 5 percent of debt is at risk. The decline of this indicator in recent years (40 percent in 2009) is consistent
with the observed growth in profitability and still favorable
external financial conditions.
The S&P Capital IQ data used by staff, also only covers up to
end 2014 which does not fully account for the additional
adversity (further depreciation and even lower oil prices) faced
by Colombian corporates in 2015 and early 2016. As an
attempt to capture developments since between end-2014,
and end-2015 we applied a “shock” in line with the observed
changes in earnings (10 percent increase) and depreciation
shock (30 percent) to latest available 2014 corporate data. Under this scenario debt at risk increases to about
12 percent. Hence, while large

Macro-financial implications of the oil sector conjuncture.
As described in Annex II, the Colombian economy remains somewhat dependant on oil-related activities,
primarily in terms of export concentration. Yet, the oil sector only represents about 4 percent of total
corporate loans from the banking sector. About half of these loans are to oil industry suppliers and the other
half is related to government-owned oil company Ecopetrol. Given the low direct portfolio exposure to oil and
oil-related entities this would imply relatively contained impact on bank losses (NPLs) and bank solvency from
distress and default in this industrial sector (see IMF Country Report No. 15/142). No other significant financial
stability impact or broader macro-financial implications would result from this direct oil-bank sector loan
linkage. However the financial stability impacts could become more significant if downgrades in oil-sector
entities were to result in downgrades for the sovereign and Colombian banks.
Ecopetrol’s response to the oil shock has included a large
reduction in investment and a shutdown of operations
with higher marginal cost of production. Capex will be cut
by about 25 percent in 2016. While Ecopetrol has limited
debt amortizations in the next three years, a lower capex
outlook will constraint near-term production outlook and
weaken debt service capacity.

Box 3. Estimating Exchange Rate Pass-Through in Colombia
The pass-through to inflation from the 30 percent NEER depreciation since mid-2014 and the ongoing El Niño
episode are temporarily adding up to 320bps to inflation. On this basis, staff expects inflation to decrease in
coming months and converge to the target band in 2017.
The exchange rate depreciation contributed around 120bps to inflation in 2016Q1 but its effects are
expected to vanish quickly. Two types of econometric exercises (VAR and local projections) using
information on the NEER, inflation, economic activity, and external variables (oil prices and U.S. growth)
indicate that a one percent depreciation results in an increase in inflation of 0.04-0.07 percent that
materializes in full in about 6-9 months (this is the so-called pass-through coefficient). The results are in line
with other studies. As the Western Hemisphere April 2016 REO notes, Colombia’s pass-through is relatively
low in regional perspective. Given the econometric results and the projected stabilization of the NEER in
coming quarters, staff projects the impact of depreciation on inflation to have peaked in 2015Q4 and decline
rapidly.

The drought caused by the ongoing El Niño episode is also contributing to inflation through high
food prices. Estimates based on the relationship between the Southern Oscillation Index (a measure of El
Niño based on oceanographic data) and Colombian inflation indicate that the current El Niño episode could
be adding 125-200bps to inflation. Since El Niño is a highly temporary phenomenon, its influence on
inflation is very likely to vanish in the second half of 2016.
Indexation mechanisms may add persistence to inflationary pressures. The increase in regulated goods
inflation to 6.3 percent in February 2016 reflects the existence of indexation in markets such as education
and health and will push up inflation for the remainder of the year. Since there is no clear statistical link
between salaries and inflation, the 7 percent increase in the minimum salary in 2016 may not be an
additional source of inflationary pressures (see accompanying SIP).

16.
The authorities broadly agreed with the outlook and characterization of risks. They
noted that Colombia is indeed undergoing a gradual adjustment that will require a slowdown in
domestic demand, and consequently expect some growth slowdown in 2016. They also
emphasized the benefit of a coordinated policy response in order to contain the current account
deficit, which has become a source of concern. Among the sources of risk, the authorities
emphasized the weak outlook for neighboring countries (e.g. Ecuador, Venezuela, Brazil) that
represents both a headwind for the ongoing external adjustment (as they were natural markets for

Colombia’s non-traditional exports) and a source of additional risks if the situation were to further
weaken in those countries. The authorities agreed that a disorderly adjustment in China is an
important global risk that will have important implications for financial flows, despite limited direct
trade links. They also noted that the banking system is robust to severe credit and market risk
stress tests.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Discussions focused on the appropriate policy mix to facilitate a near-term soft-landing
amid the large and protracted oil shock; reforms to mobilize fiscal revenue and actions to
promote financial stability and medium-term economic diversification.

A. Preserving External Stability
17.
The authorities agreed that a tighter policy mix in 2016 will significantly contribute to
the external adjustment. In addition, the flexible exchange rate should continue to serve as the
first line of defense in addressing external sector pressures with the rules-based FX auction program
mechanism preventing disorderly depreciation. In this regard, staff shares the authorities’ view that
as volatility subsides and the exchange rate stabilizes in line with oil prices a lower intervention
threshold is appropriate.

depreciated real exchange rate and slower
domestic demand support a continued decline in imports. Non-traditional exports would also
benefit from the authorities’ efforts to simplify custom procedures and disseminate preferential
trade agreements, managerial best practices and innovation. Valuation effects keep the current
account to GDP ratio high, but those effect are reversed from 2017 onwards (see Footnote 2). By
2019, the current account deficit would fall below 4 percent of GDP. While investment in the oil
sector is expected to decline significantly, FDI inflows into other sectors are expected to finance
most of the current account deficit. External debt to GDP has also risen due mostly to valuation
effects, but it remains sustainable (Table 11 and Figure 8).

percent of GDP in 2016, double the level in 2013, driven in part by the valuation effect of the peso
depreciation. In the baseline scenario, there is no ex-ante funding gap, but the outcome remains
sensitive to shifts in investors’ risk aversion. Reserve buffers would cover more than 100 percent of
annual gross external financing needs over the medium-term, with the FCL providing additional
buffers.

methodologies produce conflicting results about
exchange rate over-undervaluation (see Annex I), staff considers a current account norm of around
­2 to -3 percent as appropriate, in line with historical averages and with the EBA ES method. The
current gap to the norm, about 3 percent, is expected to narrow gradually in the medium term as
imports contract further and non-traditional exports respond to increased profitability and the
opening of new markets. The authorities’ broadly agreed with this assessment and noted that their
models and methodologies also produce a wide range of results. They also noted the high
correlation between the peso/USD exchange rate and the oil price.3

B. Macroeconomic Policy Mix: More Tightening is Needed
21.
The authorities’ plans for a further tightening of macroeconomic policies in 2016 are
welcome. The authorities’ coordinated policy response will help domestic demand adjust to the
decline in income associated with permanently lower oil prices. The transitory acceleration of
inflation and widening of the current account deficit require a further slowdown in aggregate
demand to supplement the expenditure-switching associated with the real exchange rate
depreciation.
22.
The central bank’s tightening cycle will most likely continue during early 2016 in order
to guide inflation expectations back to the target range. In the context of a moderately negative
output gap, the authorities agreed that raising the policy rate further would help guide inflation
expectations back to the target range and credit growth to lower levels more in line with the
expected moderation in domestic demand. Staff suggested that some further tightening would be

The authorities also noted that, while Colombia is an oil exporter, it should not be placed in the same group as
other countries that produce oil in a much larger scale.

needed and the authorities agreed, though they
noted their decisions would be highly datadependent. They also noted that the transmission to
bank lending rates was much more effective this
tightening cycle than during the previous one in
2014 (see Figure), when strong capital inflows
tended to override this key transmission mechanism.
The authorities also agreed that while a persistent
current account deficit and the possibility that
prolonged high inflation could activate indexation
mechanisms called for continued tightening, a
stronger-than-anticipated slowdown in activity could
prompt a re-calibration of the policy stance.

plan to bolster revenue collection by about 0.5 percent of GDP through tax administration efforts
underpinned by recent strengthening in technical and human resources at the tax authority.
However, under staff growth assumptions, further adjustments of around 0.3 percent of GDP would
be needed to meet the headline deficit target. The authorities noted that while they have identified
possible additional cuts, the additional expenditure restraint could come instead from the normal
level of under execution. Staff encourages the continued emphasis on tax administration that would
also build from the gains achieved in 2015 (see table) and noted the importance to protect the
execution of key social programs. Further fiscal restraint will come from sub-national governments’
weaker spending after the 2015 election cycle. In all, staff estimates a negative fiscal impulse of
about 1.6 percent of GDP. Public debt will reach around 50 percent of GDP in 2016, decline over the
medium term and remain sustainable (Figure 7).

Staff estimates that this is tighter than what would be allowed by the structural fiscal rule by around 1 percent of
GDP.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

COLOMBIA

C. Structural Tax Reform and the Medium-Term Fiscal Outlook
24.
Staff shares the authorities’ urgency to mobilize revenue to help offset the decline in
oil revenue and protect key expenditure areas. Central government’s oil fiscal revenue will decline
from 3 percent of GDP in 2013 to near zero in 2016 (1 percent of GDP lower than anticipated during
the last Article IV Consultation). Staff estimates suggests that absent a structural tax reform,
achieving the structural balance targets imposed by the rule would require about 1.4 pp of GDP of
primary expenditure cuts between 2017 and 2021, which would leave virtually no room to address
pressures stemming from high social needs and the multi-year infrastructure plan. The tax expert
commission’s report published early this year is closely aligned with recent technical assistance from
FAD and will set the basis for the authorities’ proposal that will be fine-tuned to specific revenue
needs. Staff welcomes the authorities’ commitment to seek the approval of a structural tax reform
this year. This is essential to not only make the fiscal adjustment more balanced and less reliant on
expenditure restraint and also help cover expenses related to the completion of the peace
agreement. The authorities noted their continued commitment to the fiscal rule as the underlying
fiscal anchor and to identify and include any potential peace-related expenses in their medium-term
fiscal framework.

1/ The medium-term fiscal outlook is broadly based on the authorities' medium-term fiscal framework. It assumes that taxes currently scheduled
to disappear starting in 2019 (about 1.2 percent of GDP) will be extended as done in the past. It does not assume any structural tax reform
and already incorporates expenses related to existing peace-related programs such as victims' reparation.

D. Protecting Financial Stability
25.
The financial system has also been resilient to changing global and local conditions,
but there is a need for continued vigilance. As noted in previous consultations, Colombian banks'
expansion into Central America in recent years continues to pose risks, including in terms of the
exposure of systemically important financial conglomerates (see Annex III). Further, the sharp fall in
commodity prices and the recent increase in corporate debt has created some pockets of
vulnerability in specific industries (oil and airlines in particular, Box 2) and the impact of exchange

rate moves bears monitoring given that 1/3 of corporate debt is FX-denominated. The authorities
have increased their vigilance of potential materialization of credit and liquidity risks, applying a
battery of stress tests to the corporate and financial systems. Stress tests indicate that under
standard earnings and depreciation shocks to corporate profitability and debt service, banks’
solvency remains above regulatory minima for the large majority of banks and the risks of these
shocks adversely affecting the supply of credit and economic growth are low given large
countercyclical provisions. Similarly, risks from weaker household balance sheets have risen
marginally and remain contained. Risks from rising house prices are mitigated by low loan-to-value
ratios (51.4 percent) and small mortgage portfolios of banks (12.3 percent of total loans). The
authorities broadly shared the staff assessment of the financial system and welcome ongoing
technical assistance from MCM to further strengthen their framework for conducting stress tests of
the financial system.
26.
The funding structure of some financial entities has changed in recent months in
response to structural changes and the ongoing monetary policy tightening. During 2015, as
part of the establishment of a single-treasury-account (CUN), the government moved its cash
deposits to the central bank and away from the four largest commercial banks, which have, as a
result, sought to replace them with similarly stable longer-maturity deposits. The increased
competition for these deposits, as banks gear up to fund the authorities’ infrastructure program,
combined with the ongoing monetary policy tightening have increased funding costs, in particular
for smaller entities. However, liquidity stress tests indicate bank liquid assets would remain more
than 2.5 times their liquidity needs as identified by their short-term liquidity risk indicator (IRL),
raising no systemic funding concerns. The supervisory authority (SFC) has undertaken actions for
banks and other financial institutions to strengthen their liquidity planning, management and stress
testing capabilities. Staff welcomes the authorities’ continued efforts to intensify the supervision of
all entities including of their liquidity models and contingency plans.

While the Colombian authorities have finalized and implemented many of the FSAP
recommendations, including those that help address cross-border risks, there remain

COLOMBIA

important areas that require further action. Since December 2015 the supervisor has the
authority to impose higher levels of capital and liquidity to individual financial institutions that
exhibit a higher risk profile. In addition, laws granting independence and legal protection of the
supervisor came into effect in January 2016 and laws awarding further regulatory powers over
holding companies of financial conglomerates are currently before Congress—a prompt approval of
this law would further expand the authorities’ ability to manage cross-border risks. The authorities
noted that while work on addressing the identification of systemic financial conglomerates has
progressed, assessing risks from mixed conglomerates remains challenging given complex
ownership and offshore structures where SFC regulatory reach is limited (see Annex III). The
authorities’ plans to further embed Basel III elements in their regulatory framework and enhance
their resolution frameworks, measures that would bring Colombia closer to international best
practices. Staff encouraged the supervisory authority to engage in further communication efforts to
explain the peculiarities of the Colombian regulatory regime and the strengths of the supervisory
framework.

E. Structural Reforms
28.
Despite recent advances, Colombia’s lingering structural bottlenecks could hinder its
productive transformation away from commodities. As measured by the World Bank’s Doing
Business database, Colombia’s overall business competitiveness has improved in recent years and is
among the strongest in the region. At the same time, it still ranks low in some items including ease
of trading across borders (110th) and paying taxes (126th), both critical to unleashing the potential
for non-traditional exports. Colombia also faces an important infrastructure gap (Box 4) especially
on roads, as it ranks 126th according to the WEF’s Global Competitiveness Report which also
highlight primary education (105th) and taxation on investment (131th) and employment (113th) as
important obstacles.
29.
The authorities’ structural agenda rightly targets key areas now that stand to foster
economic diversification and inclusive growth. A recently approved customs code will reduce
important bottlenecks for international trade. Regarding infrastructure, the growth impact of the
ongoing 4G infrastructure agenda will be amplified by the recently launched plan to improve multimode transportation logistics including tertiary roads. Advances in these areas will also help achieve
more inclusive growth by integrating distant geographical areas and promoting agricultural
development. Recent progress at the planning department (DNP) to streamline regulations and
reduce subsidies in line with OECD best practices, has the potential to improve business
competitiveness including of non-traditional exports, which would also benefit from the planned
simplification of import tariffs and identification of production clusters. On education and training,
the authorities recently launched programs to expand school coverage and better link training
centers with firms’ demands. Advances in reducing labor informality have been significant in recent
years, but consideration could be given to further easing hiring costs. The implementation of peacerelated initiative will have important consequences for regional development, competitiveness and
could provide momentum for further structural reforms. Staff encouraged the authorities to
continue prioritizing and deepening this rich structural reform agenda.

Box 4. Infrastructure Agenda, a Medium-Term Growth Driver 1
Colombia is undergoing a gradual adjustment to a large terms-of-trade shock, which calls for further
diversifying the production and export base. Infrastructure gaps are an important obstacle for economic
diversification. The urgency to improve infrastructure, including road transport, is being addressed by the
authorities’ 4G infrastructure program. A general equilibrium model is used to illustrate the main channels
through which stronger infrastructure will contribute to growth over the medium-term.
Colombia’s infrastructure is an important obstacle for inclusive growth. As discussed in previous
consultations (see Country Report 15/142), investment in infrastructure has lagged behind peers, and has
resulted in important gaps, especially in road transport. Inadequate supply of infrastructure has been
identified as the third most important obstacle for doing business (Global Competitiveness Report). Export
competitiveness has been particularly affected by weak infrastructure as Colombia has an important
infrastructure quality gap with its trade competitors. Further, access to quality infrastructure differs greatly
across regions in Colombia, also contributing to regional income inequality.

The government’s structural reform agenda rightly aims to reduce infrastructure gaps and improve
competitiveness. The government’s 4G PPP-based infrastructure agenda is on track and efforts to introduce
innovative financing instruments and secure seed capital (e.g. ISAGEN sale) have come to fruition. The
authorities are also pressing ahead with an overall plan to improve transportation (multi-mode)infrastructure with special emphasis on tertiary roads, which stand to complement and amplify the benefits
of the 4G agenda and foster agriculture and regional development.
The wave-structure of the 4G agenda will result in a staggered distribution of the construction-phase
capex. Capital expenditures will peak at around 1 percent of GDP in 2018. As discussed in last year’s staff
report (IMF Country Report No. 15/142), financing of the agenda will come from a combination of public
resources, local financing (including, banks and pension funds) and foreign financing (including equity and
debt).

result from the increased demand for non-tradable
goods).
Once all the general equilibrium effects are internalized, the model suggest a positive growth yield
that peaks at about 0.4 percentage points in 2019 as well as positive crowding in effects on private
investment (see solid line). This estimate does not incorporate the long-term benefit that a completed
agenda could have for export diversification and regional development, nor the impact of parallel
infrastructure programs (e.g. tertiary roads) the government is also undertaking (see above).

According to the PIMA, Colombia’s public investment management compares well against regional
peers, but also exhibits areas that warrant further strengthening.3 In line with Colombia’s overall strong
fiscal discipline, the public investment framework helps ensure the investment level is sustainable. The PPP
framework is broadly transparent in the scrutiny, selection and oversight of projects. However, for public
investment as a whole, the process for project selection could be further strengthened. Further, according to
the Economist Intelligence Unit (2014), the LA5 (Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru) are the countries
in the region with the most attractive overall environment for PPPs.4

STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
Colombia’s broad resilience to drastic changes in global conditions reflects its very
strong policies. Despite facing a terms of trade shock larger than its peers, Colombia still posted
one of the strongest GDP growth rates in the region and achieved important social gains by
reducing poverty and income inequality. This is a reflection of the strength of the policy framework,
and the authorities recognize that growth has to moderate to reduce the external and internal
imbalances.
31.
The authorities’ coordinated policy response will help achieve a soft landing provided
Colombia is not hit by another major shock. Growth will slow down in 2016 due in part to a
decline in investment, despite the start of the 4G infrastructure agenda. Some additional fiscal and
monetary tightening will help align domestic demand with the subdued outlook for national income
and guide inflation expectations back to the target range, as headline inflation returns to the target
band in early 2017. The peso depreciation will help boost exports, which together with some import
compression will spearhead the decline in the current account deficit toward its medium-term
equilibrium level. Credit growth will continue to slowdown as a result of both demand and supply
factors in 2016 and subsequently support the reallocation of resources away from commodities and
toward construction.
32.
Downside external risks have grown significantly in the last year but should remain
manageable. Colombia is particularly exposed to swings in global financial market sentiment with
its currently wide current account deficit and reliance on portfolio inflows. Sources of risks include a
disorderly slowdown in China and a reversal in capital inflows. Weak conditions in Colombia’s
neighbors (who are also exposed to China) and further declines in oil prices also represent
important risks. The flexible exchange rate has served as an important buffer against changing
global conditions. Reserves are ample for precautionary purposes and the FCL stands as an
additional buffer. Stress tests provide reassurances that the financial system would weather the
materialization of severe shocks; nevertheless, continued vigilance is warranted as the corporate
sector adjusts in line with the process of economic diversification.
33.
A prompt approval of a structural tax reform is essential to help the adjustment,
without leading to an undue compression of public spending. A reform that improves
progressivity and business competitiveness will also help achieved strong and inclusive growth. The
expert commission recommendations constitute a valuable blueprint which can be fine-tuned to
specific revenue needs—including those stemming from the peace process. Staff welcomes the
authorities’ commitment to incorporate all peace-related initiatives transparently in their mediumterm fiscal framework.
34.
The medium-term outlook is favorable in the absence of further major shocks. The
authorities’ 4G infrastructure agenda will support growth during its construction phase and once
completed stands to ease an important growth bottleneck. Ongoing efforts to eliminate trade

22

COLOMBIA

obstacles, streamline customs procedures and regulations, and foster innovation will support growth
and economic diversification.
35.
Recent advances in financial regulation and supervision have underpinned the
financial system’s resilience to changing global conditions; further actions will bring Colombia
closer to international best practices. The financial system solvency and liquidity has remained
strong amid less favorable external financing conditions, sectoral credit issues and changes in local
funding conditions. Expansions in regulatory and supervisory powers have widened both
information availability and the policy toolkit including of macro-prudential tools. Colombia should
continue to move its regulatory framework closer to the latest standards by enacting the
conglomerates law currently in Congress, adapting key Basel III elements and strengthening its
resolution framework.
36.
The development plan offers a useful roadmap of additional measures to foster
inclusive growth. Improving access to quality education, streamlining subsidies and regulations,
and expand the logistic network across the country would help improve labor productivity and
better integrate all regions, unleashing agriculture and industrial potential.
37.
Staff does not recommend approval of the retention of the exchange restriction
arising from the special regime for the hydrocarbon sector, since the authorities have no
plans for its removal.
38.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation takes place on the standard
12‒month cycle.

Annex I. External Sector Assessment1
Colombia’s external position appears weaker than implied by fundamentals although
there is significant uncertainty around equilibrium exchange rate estimates. EBA
estimates vary over a wide range from overvaluation to undervaluation, potentially
reflecting lags in the current account adjustment to a depreciated exchange rate.
Significant adjustment has yet to occur in the current account deficit, but non-traditional
exports have already started to shift away from slow growing regional partners, and the
demand for imports has contracted and is expected to continue to do so as a result of a
depreciated exchange rate and additional fiscal adjustment.
1.

The external position appears weaker than implied by fundamentals while the

economy is adjusting to a new equilibrium. While the real exchange rate depreciated by
34 percent over the last two years, its full

higher than current account norm estimates under EBA ES and EBA CA methodologies, while the
methodology based on a model for the real exchange rate (EBA REER) indicates a 15 percent
undervaluation. In staff’s view, the current account norm is closer to the ES estimate; in the -2 to
­3 percent of GDP range also more in line with historical levels. The fact that the EBA CA norm
estimate is much higher may reflect the fact that it does not take into account the sizable
repatriation of profits. It also reflects a relatively low ratio of proven oil reserves to production, which
may underestimate the number of years left of production relative to other oil producing countries
as proved reserves have been and may continue to be subject to significant upward revisions in
Colombia.
REER, Terms of Trade, and Current Account

With the end of the commodities super

cycle, the real exchange rate has reverted close
to its 2000 levels, but the current account has
yet to adjust. From 2000 through 2012, the

trade, the current account deficit gradually expanded as percent of GDP. After 2012, both the terms
of trade and REER dropped with the end of the commodities super cycle. The current account deficit
as percent of GDP, however, continued to deteriorate as the valuation impact of the exchange rate
depreciation has not been compensated by a significant reduction in the US$ value of the deficit.
Looking forward, a correction in the current account deficit is expected, as export and import
volumes react to the ER depreciation and as the fiscal sector adjusts to meet the targets under the
current fiscal rule.
3.

The CA deficit has widened significantly since 2013, mainly driven by a reduction in

commodity and non-traditional exports. With average oil prices falling from a 104 in 2013 to 51
in 2015, commodity exports have contracted

by US$19 bn. At the same time nontraditional exports have also contracted, with
key regional trading partners, Venezuela and
Ecuador, hit by low commodity prices and
raising barriers to trade with Colombia.
Imports contracted significantly over the last
year and the primary balance has improved
significantly as payments to foreign capital in

the oil sector have dropped. However, the
latter do not compensate for the impact of the steep reduction in exports in US dollar terms on the
current account. The deterioration in CA/GDP is particularly steep, as the valuation effect from
exchange rate depreciation significantly reduced the US dollar value of GDP in 2015.
4.

As demand for non-traditional exports by regional trading partners has dropped,

exports are starting to shift to alternative markets, albeit at slow pace. Exports to the United
States and the Euro Zone increased from

The IIP reached -44 percent of GDP in 2015 from -30 percent of GDP in 2014. Most of

the drop observed in 2015 reflects the valuation impact from the depreciation in the exchange rate,
which accounts for 12 percentage points. Gross liabilities are estimated at 95 percent of GDP in
2015, of which, 51 percentage points correspond to FDI. While the NIIP is sustainable, increases in
portfolio liabilities over the last few years and now amounting to 25 percent of GDP could lead to
heightened vulnerability to global financial volatility.

Annex II. Macroeconomic Adjustment to the Decline in
Commodity Prices1
This annex presents cross-country analysis on the macroeconomic adjustment to the
decline in commodity prices. The experiences of Chile, Colombia, and Peru highlight the
importance of flexible exchange rates to help with the adjustment to the new commodity
prices. The analysis also suggests that a stronger adjustment in domestic demand would
be needed in Colombia in order to facilitate the current account adjustment.
1.

The “commodity super-cycle” has come to an end as commodity prices have been

decreasing steadily since 2011, and this external shock is likely to be persistent. First, this annex
summarizes the impact of the decline in oil prices in Colombia. Second, it analyzes the
macroeconomic adjustment in Chile, Colombia and Peru induced by the significant drop in
commodity prices. This comparison is relevant as these are commodity exporters’ emerging
economies (copper for Chile and Peru, and oil for Colombia), which are comparable in size and
feature sound macroeconomic frameworks (with both fiscal rules and inflation-targeting regimes in
place). Moreover, given that the adjustment started earlier in Chile and Peru, this analysis could
inform about the expected response in Colombia.

A.

The impact of the shock in Colombia

2.

Since the second half of 2014, Colombia has confronted a severe oil price shock. This

shock is expected to reduce Colombia’s fiscal oil revenues from 3.3 percent of GDP in 2013 to
almost 0 in 2016. Similarly, oil exports declined

the same time, the authorities have allowed the

is playing a key role in the adjustment process.

Ecopetrol’s capex expenditures. Finally, Colombia’s sovereign risk premium increased more than in
other emerging economies, due to the strong dependence on oil.

B.

The experience in Chile, Colombia, and Peru

3.

An initial consideration is that both the timing and size of the shock in Chile and Peru

have been different than in Colombia. While the price of copper has been declining since 2011,
the oil price decline began in the second half of 2014. Thus, Chile and Peru are in the final stages of
the adjustment process, while Colombia is in the midst of adjusting to more recent price declines in
oil. Moreover, the shock that Colombia suffered was more severe in that oil prices plunged by about
40 percent in 5 quarters, whereas the price of copper took 18 quarters to decrease by 45 percent. As
expected, these large commodity price shocks deteriorated their terms of trade substantially, with
Colombia suffering the most.

The exchange rate and current account adjustments are important elements of the

macroeconomic response to the terms of trade fall.2 In the case of Chile, when the terms of trade
initially started to fall, the exchange rate was relatively slow to adjust. However, by the end of its
adjustment process, Chile’s real effective exchange rate had depreciated by 5 percent. In contrast,
given the magnitude and speed of the shock, Colombia experienced a sharp and fast real
depreciation of its exchange rate of around 18 percent (data is through 2015Q3). Peru, however, had
a minor real appreciation of about 6 percent, which could be in part the result of the Central Bank of
2

Recent analysis on the external adjustment and the role of the real exchange rate in Latin America shows that the
deterioration in the terms of trade explains the majority of the exchange rate depreciations in Chile and Colombia.

Peru FX interventions to prevent sharp movements in its currency. Consistent with this more muted
adjustment in the real exchange rate, the current account deficit in Peru has slightly deteriorated
since 2011, from 2 percent to 4 percent of GDP. The exchange rate adjustment in Chile allowed for a
significant adjustment in the current account, with a deficit that is now mostly closed. Finally, in
Colombia the current account deteriorated as a result of the oil prices decline, and has yet to reflect
the adjustment in quantities.

Another element of the adjustment is the response in domestic demand. In the three

cases we observe a slowdown in total domestic demand at the time the shock hit. However,
one salient difference is that the initial slowdown in Chile and Peru was significantly more abrupt
than in Colombia, despite the shock being more acute in the latter. Furthermore, in the final stages
of the transition, Chile had a stronger adjustment in domestic demand than Peru, which is consistent
as well with the adjustment in the current account explained above. The macroeconomic adjustment
in these countries has also affected the dynamics of GDP growth. In the cases of Chile and Peru, real
GDP growth has decreased continuously after the fall in their terms of trade. Colombia seems to be
following the same path as GDP growth also declined after oil prices started plunging.

A variable that seems to be crucial in both the boom and the adjustment process, is

consumption of durable goods. The growth in durable consumption in Colombia and Chile was

very pronounced in the expansionary phase of the commodity cycle. In line with the Chilean
experience, durable consumption is expected to slow down significantly in Colombia as the
adjustment process gathers pace. Regression analysis indicates that factors such as depreciation,
increasing interest rates, and slowing credit will weigh on durable consumption in 2016.

In sum, the experiences of Chile, Colombia, and Peru highlight the importance of

flexible exchange rates to help with the adjustment to the new commodity prices. The analysis

also suggests that a stronger adjustment in domestic demand would be needed in Colombia in
order to facilitate the current account adjustment.

Annex III. Macrofinancial Stability Assessment1
The financial sector has continued to develop in Colombia resulting in deeper
macrofinancial linkages. Colombian banks’ have performed relatively well despite
recent commodity and depreciation shocks. Non-performing loans (NPLs) remain low
and well provisioned. Funding has become more challenging but is manageable. The
annex also details how corporate vulnerabilities under adverse shocks could lower bank
capital, credit and economic growth but are not impactful. Colombia has continued to
make supervisory and regulatory enhancements with regard to risk based and financial
conglomerate supervision. Work on financial integration is also discussed. Finally
Colombia has remained committed to strengthening its AML/CFT framework.

A. Structural Features and Forward-Looking Vulnerabilities
1.

As the financial sector has continued to develop in Colombia macrofinancial linkages

have grown and deepened. This annex provides a summary of financial sector stylized facts
charting recent developments in Colombia. Banks’ asset-liability and performance have been
impacted by their loans and funding to the real sector. The annex also details how corporate
vulnerabilities and shocks impact bank capital, credit and economic growth. Key supervisory and
regulatory enhancements are detailed for Colombia whose aim is to ensure macrofinancial stability
is maintained. Finally financial integration is discussed as a means to enable the safe and sound
development of the financial system in support of the macroeconomy.
2.

The financial system in Colombia has continued to grow and deepen macrofinancial

linkages despite adverse shocks. The financial system in Colombia grew 4.72 percent in real terms
in 2015 despite lower commodity and oil prices and large depreciation shocks. The resulting
increased market volatility and lower economic growth in 2015 did not adversely impact the growth
of credit institutions such as banks, financial companies and cooperatives (7 percent real).
Macrofinancial linkages and financial deepening has continued:
Robust year-on-year real growth of the financial system has led to an increased importance

of the financial sector resulting in greater macrofinancial linkages. Financial assets were
equivalent to 1.56 times GDP in December 2015, compared to 1.45 times in 2014. The share
of credit as a share of GDP also increased, from 44.13 percent in Dec-14 to 49.16 percent in
Dec-15 (Figure 1).



Loan growth to key economic sectors remained strong in 2015: Wholesale & Retail
(17 percent); manufacturing (16 percent); construction (14 percent). Loan growth to the
mining, quarrying and oil sectors fell, as expected reflecting lower commodity prices, large
losses and some defaults in the sector.



Financial access and inclusion continues to grow in Colombia with 75 percent of all adults in
households having access to some type of financial products especially banking products
(Figure 1).



In December 2015, investments in pesos by mandatory pension funds in domestic public
debt represented 49.6 percent of total investments, followed by investments in dollars with
29.4 percent. Compared to 2014, there was a sizeable portfolio shift towards investments in
dollars increasing by 6 percentage points while peso assets decreased by 8 percentage
points. This was in the main due to valuation effects from depreciation.

3.

Deposits form a large proportion of banks and other credit institutions liabilities while

loans and bonds held as assets are mainly domestic. The majority of funding for banks are
deposits and demand accounts (84 percent of total liabilities). Around 40 percent of those deposits
are from large (100) institutional depositors, mainly from fiduciaries, other entities, government and
pension funds. Under funding stress the rates for these can rise more sharply than for individual
checking and savings accounts. Moreover around 10 percent of liabilities also come from issuance
of debt securities which are sensitive to credit ratings with 5 percent coming from money market
operations (usually short term) (Figure 2). On the asset side the large proportion of bank loans are
domestic (91 percent), with nearly all government bond holdings by banks also domestic (99.6
percent) (Figure 2).

Banks remain profitable and well provisioned and unlikely to see dramatic increase in

NPLs due to slower growth in 2016. Bank profitability remains robust with ROA (3 percent) and
ROE (22 percent) unchanged from 2014, though overall net-interest (58 percent) and non-netinterest margins (42 percent) are little lower in 2015 in part reflecting impact of adverse commodity
and depreciation shocks with slower growth (Table 7). NPLs for all loan portfolios remains relatively
low (3 percent) while coverage in terms of provisions for NPLs has increased (154 percent). As
growth continues to slow in 2016 profitability will be more adversely impacted from higher general
provisions as NPLs rise. However given robust (general and countercyclical) provisioning practices in
Colombia NPLs are expected to remain manageable (Figure 3).
5.

Macrofinancial impacts from adverse corporate shocks are contained. Stress tests by

staff indicate that under adverse but plausible earnings and depreciation shocks to corporate
profitability and debt service, the banking system solvency remains above regulatory minima though

capital buffers are lower (Figure 4).2 Two banks with the lowest capital starting positions fall just
below the 9 percent regulatory minimum. The risks of these shocks adversely affecting the supply of
credit and economic growth are low given release of countercyclical provisions to absorb losses.3
Authorities continue to make great strides in stress testing, linking real sector (corporate and
household) vulnerabilities with financial sector solvency concerns into liquidity impacts and
contagion assessments. Advanced model development using DSGE and network models allied to
more straight-forward balance sheet assessments, including more focused specific (thematic)
liquidity and contagion stress testing will enable interconnected and systemic risks to be
accommodated while identifying weaknesses in financial institutions business models and forwardlooking plans. The Fund is continuing to provide Technical Assistance (TA) on stress testing
developments and encouraging authorities to ensure resourcing and coordination between BanRep,
Superfinanciera (SFC) and the corporate superintendency (Supersociedades) for such work remains a
high-priority.

liquidity strengthening by banks, including through restriction of dividend disbursements. The
authorities have also created additional opportunities for banks to strengthen their capital positions
voluntarily through introduction of greater loss-absorbing Basel III-type hybrid (debt-to-equity)
instruments. Some banks have indicated that they intend to increase capitalization levels further in
2016.

Supervision and Regulation
7.

Risk based supervision (RBS) has started to become more coherent and consistent. The

SFC has started to consolidate the work on RBS for the banks through deeper risk-led inspections,
monitoring and assessment of internal controls. To that end more forward looking thematic stress
tests exercises are being carried out with regard to potential future financial system (bank and
nonbank) solvency vulnerabilities arising from: (i.) direct and indirect impact related to Oil and oil

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

55

COLOMBIA

related industries; (ii.) impact of El Niño on agricultural and commercial and microcredit loan
portfolios; (iii.) Commercial loan portfolio impacts from sustained depreciation; and (iv.) payment
capacity deterioration of housing and consumer loans. The SFC is also challenging credit institutions
assumptions of the credit deterioration arising from slowdown in 2016. They are undertaking a
deeper assessment of SME portfolios and ensuring provisions remain robust to avoid risk
underestimation by financial institutions. The SFC is also broadening out its forward-looking RBS
methodology to brokerage firms, pension funds, trust companies and securities issuers. The SFC
continues to develop tools which will enable it to better identify systemic, country and interest rate
risk on the banking book from financial conglomerates activities. This will include also monitoring
and mapping foreign exchange and liquidity concerns of conglomerates.
8.

Looking forward the SFC is proposing to further embed the implementation of Basel

III and strengthening risk management. The SFC is drawing up proposals to implement the Basel
III Net Stable Funding Ratio as a complement to the short-term liquidity (IRL) measure. Adjustments
are being made to strengthen financial institutions liquidity risk measurement by incorporating
concentration of depositors’ sources of funding. Adjustments are also being made to enhance
market risk measurement (VaR) in order to improve the response to high volatility (tail-risk)
scenarios. Banks will also be required to fully define their procedures in their capital adequacy selfassessments (ICAAP).
9.

On the regulatory front the implementation of the conglomerates law and

macroprudential adjustments to existing FX limits will address key systemic risk concerns. The
law awarding regulatory powers over holding companies of financial conglomerates will enable SFC
and BanRep to identify and better monitor regulated and unregulated parts of financial
conglomerates through improved regulatory data capture. This would cover 21 financial
conglomerates that represent 86 percent of Colombian financial system assets and 125 percent of
GDP. The law will also provide powers to restructure conglomerates and ultimately enable
authorities to impose additional systemic capital add-ons to better address cross-border risks.
BanRep recently imposed some additional macroprudential tools to limit systemic concerns from
greater currency, maturity and FX liquidity risk. The tools are an FX risk indicator by currency and a
short term exposure indicator. The new measures complements the existing FX risk limits on loans,
deposits and net open positions for financial institutions.
10.

The law on conglomerates provides limited reach into mixed conglomerates with

much of their activity remaining outside of the supervisory and regulatory perimeter. Mixed
conglomerates that offer not only financial services but also non-financial and commercial services
have tended to have opaque organizational and ownership structures that consolidate operations in
56

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

COLOMBIA

jurisdictions (including offshore) with relatively more permissive regulations. The mixed
conglomerates can then branch out their activities to other countries. Even with backing of the new
law the SFC would not have sufficient regulatory powers over the non-financial institutions that form
part of a mixed conglomerate to mitigate regulatory arbitrage within the group. Ideally it would be
important to impose capital, liquidity, and risk management requirements at group-wide and solo
levels but this may not translate into having the same level of “enforcement” powers over the nonfinancial institutions as over the financial ones within a mixed group. Enhanced monitoring of such
intra-group flows between regulated and unregulated entities should be undertaken involving the
SFC and the Superintendencia de Sociedades (SS).
11.

Growth and expansion of Colombian conglomerates and banking groups has involved

a change in regulatory and supervisory focus as regards consolidated and conglomerate
supervision. The new powers sought by the SFC regarding conglomerates aim to deliver more
comprehensive information not just on 21 financial conglomerates but also cover 215 subordinated
entities in 21 Latin American and Caribbean countries which represents 29 percent of total
Colombian financial system assets. There exists significant potential for risks to the domestic
financial system from losses by these cross-border entities. Colombian banks have been very active
in the Central American region and Peru (Table A). The current collection of data on these crossborder entities is limited. The SFC has a regulatory project in 2016 which will collect important asset
and liability information, asset quality indicators on loan portfolios, profit, solvency, investments and
securities information in different currencies for all these cross-border entities to be better able to
map exposures and risks from large conglomerates and banking groups.

The Colombian authorities volunteered in 2015 to undertake a pilot self assessment

under the recent Key Attributes of Effective Resolution for Financial Institutions.4 Colombia is
the first emerging market (EM) country to undertake this assessment. The findings will help the
Financial Stability Board (FSB) to further develop the Key Attributes and increase their applicability to
EMs. Some of the key recommendations for Colombia suggest: (i.) the need for additional powers to
transfer asset and liabilities to a private sector buyer or bridge bank; (ii.) additional powers to enable
timely resolution based on early determination of non-viability of financial institutions; and (iii.) the
power to override shareholders consent. Staff congratulates the authorities for their commitment to
strengthen their resolution and recovery framework for financial institutions in line with best
international standards. This will further strengthen Colombia’s crisis management tools and powers.

The pilot assessment was carried out by a team comprising the IMF, the FSB and the World Bank. The Colombian
authorities have indicated that they are willing to publish the Detailed Assessment of Observation Report.

Financial integration

There are important ongoing initiatives to foster financial integration within Latin

America. Since 2011 the Presidents of Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru have met regularly to take
forward the agenda of the Pacific Alliance (PA). Most recently, on July 2, 2015 they issued the
Paracas Declaration reaffirming their commitment to foster market integration between their
countries. Private sector banks, particularly from Colombia, are moving across the region,
establishing themselves as regional institutions with risks being closely monitored. Meanwhile, stock
exchanges are establishing regional presence: the Integrated Latin America Market (MILA) initiative
aims to foster equity and bond market integration across the PA countries. The combination of
political and market enthusiasm may make the PA a more successful initiative than earlier regional
attempts. A coordinated approach to remove the remaining barriers, addressing risks particularly if
based on reciprocity across the PA countries, and more widely in the region, could enable reforms
to proceed more effectively, generating significant early results, which would help sustain
momentum. Colombia in particular is fostering its capital market development (and offer diversity
away from bank financing) for corporates. However challenges remain in enabling foreign issuers to
have access to local investors. Specifically there is a need for:


Greater recognition of issuers and of the types of instruments, so that the initial placement can
be made by issuers in the 4 countries of the PA. This will ensure a greater diversity of assets on
offer in the region through primary and secondary public offerings.



Allowing the free marketing of investment funds which are authorized in any of the member
countries of the PA.



Improving the treatment of the investments of the Pension and Severance Fund Management
Companies (AFP) in assets or products of the region. This is so that investments of the AFP in
securities, instruments or funds of the PA have the same treatment as for local investments.



Reviewing the tax and exchange treatment in order to seek efficiencies among the countries of
the PA



Continued PA countries support and further development of the private-led initiative for

capital market integration through Integrated Latin America Market (MILA) initiative

Colombia has consolidated a comprehensive risk based supervision scheme of AML/FT

for financial institutions that is a reference in Latin America. In 2017, the IMF will assess the
money laundering and terrorist financing prevention system against Colombia’s compliance and
implementation effectiveness of the 40 FATF Recommendations. The SFC is currently leading an
inter-institutional project aimed at reaffirming the important work undertaken in recent years
regarding the reinforcement of the AML/FT regime. The original mid-90’s system of prevention of
money laundering SIPLA, has evolved into a more comprehensive system called SARLAFT. This
system engages all entities under surveillance of the SFC to design and implement a Money
Laundering and Financing of Terrorism Risk Management System, that permits the adequate
identification, measurement, control and monitoring of this risk. The scope of this system has
migrated from a strict compliance system to a risk-based supervision scheme, which promotes an
anti-money laundering culture and anti-terrorist financing activities. Current regulatory projects
intend to improve compliance, as well as deepening, strengthening and consolidating the legal
framework for the prevention and control of ML/FT. The current Colombian legal system has earned
international recognition, and has served as a referent for other countries such as Costa Rica,
Guatemala, Honduras, Panama and soon in Ecuador.

15.

Further strengthening of inter-institutional coordination mechanisms is an expected

result of the 2017 assessment. Although Colombia has a solid scheme for internal AML/FT
supervision, the SFC expects to strengthen and encourage memorandums of understanding in order
to share relevant information with the national authorities, such as the Ministry of Justice and Law,
the Attorney General's Office, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and international organizations, such as
CCICLA, UIAF, UNODC, GAFILAT, the Central American Council of Superintendents of Banks, among
others. In this regard, Colombia has been supported by the U.S. government, through agencies such
as the Department of Justice, the FBI and OFAC.

WORLD BANK RELATIONS1
The World Bank Group Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for FY 16−21 was discussed by
the Board on April 7, 2016. The new CPF is well aligned with both the Government’s National
Development Plan and the Bank Group’s twin goals. Informed by a Systematic Country Diagnostic,
the demand expressed by Colombian authorities and the WBG’s comparative advantage in
Colombia, the CPF selectively focuses on three strategic areas for engagement: (i) fostering balanced
territorial development; (ii) enhancing social inclusion and mobility through improved service
delivery; and (iii) supporting fiscal sustainability and productivity. Support for the peace building
process cuts across all areas of Bank Group engagement, from land property rights in rural areas, for
instance, to improving justice service delivery and access to justice.
The CPF proposes a flexible approach enabling ready adjustments to respond to changing
client needs and macroeconomic developments. In implementing the new CPF the World Bank
Group will continue to provide integrated packages of services spanning World Bank, IFC and MIGA
contributions to address Colombia’s ambitious development agenda with complementary financial,
knowledge and convening services. In addition to providing programmatic knowledge services, a
large number of South-South Knowledge Exchanges have been organized by the Bank under the
different engagement areas. These include a number of study tours for high-ranking government
officials to and from Israel, Pakistan, Indonesia, Vietnam and Peru, to learn more about social
assistance programs, health policies, conditional cash transfers and a variety of other issues.
As of March 2016, Colombia is IBRD’s 7th largest Bank borrower with US$8.5 billion in
outstanding debt. The active portfolio is composed of 9 IBRD and 2 stand-alone GEF projects
totaling US$3.3 billion in net commitments. Colombia also has a considerable Trust Fund portfolio
amounting to US$53 million and representing a variety of sectors. In FY 16, two large DPF
operations of US$700 million each for Sustainable Development and Sustained Growth and Income
Convergence, respectively, were approved. For FY 17, the lending pipeline includes two DPF
operations in the areas of territorial development and fiscal and growth productivity, as well as two
IPF operations in support of Colombia’s development program for its Pacific region (“Plan Pacifico”).
A Multi-Donor Trust Fund has been launched to support the peace and post-conflict initiatives. The
WB chairs the steering committee. Current overall contributions are at US$6.5million, of which the
Swedish Development Cooperation contributed SEK 19.5 million and the WB­administered State and
Peace Building Fund US$4 million.
As of end-February, 2016, IFC's outstanding portfolio in Colombia amounts to US$743m in
55 projects. It is the 11th largest portfolio worldwide and 3rd regionally. In terms of commitments,
the top sectors are: finance and insurance (63 percent), transport and warehousing (15 percent), oil,
gas and mining (5 percent) and electric power (5 percent). In terms of products, 55 percent is in
loans and guarantees and 45 percent in equity and equity-type products. Participants' and Asset
Management Company outstanding balances total US$201 million and US$545 million, respectively.

IFC Advisory in Colombia is active in PPPs (schools), corporate governance, collateral registries,
microfinance and sustainable energy finance, royalties, palm oil evaluation, taxes, and green building
code.
MIGA’s current portfolio in Colombia stands close to US$100 million. MIGA coverage is entirely
in the financial service sector across two projects: (i) Findeter, the first Non-Honoring of a Financial
Obligation of a State-Owned Enterprise (US$95 million); and (ii) ProCredit Holding, the insurance of
mandatory reserve at the Central Bank of Colombia (US$ 2million). The Findeter project was issued
in December 2015 and supports the expansion of lending operations by Findeter to intermediary
financial institutions for urban infrastructure development projects in a number of cities across
Colombia; tenor is 10 years. The ProCredit Holding project was issued in December 2010, with a
focus on banks’ capital optimization, i.e., reduction of risk weighting for mandatory reserves on a
group’s consolidated balance sheet thereby reducing capital provisioning; tenor is 10 years.

INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK RELATIONS1
Colombia’s current Country Strategy covers the period 2015–2018 and identifies three policy
areas of dialogue with the government: productivity, effectiveness of public management and
social mobility. These areas are part of a comprehensive vision for the development process of the
country, aimed at a vision where the country can achieve a path of sustainable growth and become
a developed country in the long run. There are cross-cutting requirements associated with this
objective and to growth and overcome conditions of poverty and inequity, which are: (i) increase
tax-fiscal revenues in order to ensure a sizable flow of public goods, and (ii) recognizing both
infrastructure development, and human and social capital development as necessary factors for
greater productivity and strengthen the middle class.
The sovereign guarantee lending envelope under the current Strategy is estimated at
US$822.5 million per year, which total US$3.3 billion for the years 2015 to 2018. In 2015, the
Bank approved 5 operations for US$941 million in sovereign guarantee operations.
As of March of 2016, the Bank portfolio is currently composed of 27 sovereign guarantee
operations, totaling US$2.0 billion, with a disbursed percentage of 25 percent. Operations are
concentrated in infrastructure (62.5 percent), governance (23.8 percent) and social development and
integration (13.6 percent). The IDB is the second multilateral creditor with a total debt owed of
US$6.8 billion (42 percent of Colombia’s total multilateral debt). The non-reimbursable technical
cooperation portfolio includes 59 operations, with an approved value of US$37.9 million.
The current portfolio of private sector initiatives (non-sovereign guarantee) in Colombia
totals US$289.6 million. The Inter-American Investment Corporation has a portfolio of
US$107 million.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of April 8, 2016)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts: The National Department of Statistics (DANE) is responsible for the compilation of the
national accounts, although the Banco de la República (BdR) compiles the financial accounts. Annual and
quarterly estimates of GDP by the production and the expenditure approaches use 2005 as the reference year
for the annually chained volume measures. GDP compilation conforms to the methodological
recommendations of the System of National Accounts 1993 (1993 SNA) and some recommendations of the
2008 SNA. Development has recently begun, collaboratively between DANE and BdR, of the quarterly accounts
for institutional sectors, expected to be completed by mid-2018.DANE also publishes a monthly indicator of
economic activity Índice Mensual de Actividad Económica de Colombia (IMACO).
Price Statistics: DANE is also responsible for price statistics, and currently compiles and disseminates the
consumer price index (CPI) and the producer price index (PPI). The basket and weights of the CPI have not
been updated since 2008 and are based on the Income-Expenditure Survey (2006–2007). These CPI weights are
out of date and may not reflect current expenditure patterns. DANE disseminated an updated and revised PPI
in 2015. There is need to expand PPI coverage to include additional economic activities.
Government Finance Statistics: The Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (MFPC) is responsible for the
compilation of public revenue, expenditure, and financing data. The Colombian authorities have reaffirmed
their commitment to adopt the GFSM 2001 framework, enhance inter-institutional coordination, and increase
the resources allocated to compiling government finance statistics. While progress has been made, and the
authorities submit comprehensive GFS to the IMF’s Statistics Department, there are concerns regarding data
quality and the latest reported data will not be published in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook
(GFSY). The priority is to improve data compilation and consistency of time series data, and correct unusual
data patterns. Next steps include: improving classification of revenue and expense, consolidation, adopting a
common list of public sector entities, and disseminating high-frequency data on a national and international
level. The General Accounting Office (GAO) developed a single accounting framework for the public sector
based on International Public Sector Accounting Standards and maintains a financial management information
system containing accounting information of all public sector units. The MFPC’s Macroeconomic Policy Unit
and the GAO developed a bridge table that converts national accounting classification to the GFSM 2001
framework to compile GFS on accrual and cash bases.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: The Bank of the Republic (BdR) reports the Standardized Report Forms
(SRFs) 1SR for BdR, 2SR for the other depository corporations (ODCs), and 5SR for monetary aggregates for
publication in the IMF's International Financial Statistics (IFS) on a monthly basis with a lag of two to 5 months.
The Superintendencia Financiera de Colombia (SFC) compiles data on 4SR for other financial corporations
(OFC). However, the last reported OFC data are for December 2014. This delay in reporting is due to an
ongoing review of the SFC and efforts to map the former to the International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS). The classification of financial instruments and economic sectors follows the MFSM with some exceptions.
For December 2001 through November 2004, some financial assets and liabilities where economic
sectorization is unavailable are allocated to the economic sector having the largest volume of transactions in

COLOMBIA

the category and accrued interest on various financial instruments is included in Other Items (Net) rather than
in the outstanding amounts of the financial assets and liabilities.
Financial Sector Surveillance: Colombia is currently reporting some of the core Financial Soundness
Indicators (FSI).
External Sector Statistics: The BdR is in charge of compiling and disseminating quarterly balance of payments
and international investment position (IIP) statistics, which are produced on a sixth edition of the Balance of
Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6) basis. Improved surveys, particularly in the
services sector, have enhanced the coverage of balance of payments statistics. Recording of transactions in
securities between residents and nonresidents in secondary markets could be improved.
The BdR also monthly compiles and disseminates the Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign
Currency Liquidity, reports semi-annual data to the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS), and
submits quarterly external debt statistics to the Quarterly External Debt Statistics (QEDS) database. However,
Colombia has not reported data to the Coordinated Direct Investment Survey (CDIS) yet.

Statement by Maria Angelica Arbelaez, Alternate Executive Director for Colombia
April 29, 2016
The Colombian authorities are grateful to the mission team for the constructive and
fruitful discussions held in Bogota. They broadly agree with the staff’s assessment and
policy recommendations.
Economic outlook
The Colombian economy has been hard hit by the sharp decline in the terms of trade
since 2014 that has continued in 2016, compounded by a severe supply shock stemming
from El Niño weather phenomenon, weaker growth among trading partners notably
Venezuela and Ecuador, and tighter and volatile financial conditions. Despite the
coincidence of these adverse set of shocks the economy grew 3.1 percent in 2015, one of
the highest rates in the Latin American region.
Given the permanent nature of the decline in oil prices, the economy has been gradually
adjusting to a new reality. Indeed, growth slowed down in 2015, and lower domestic
absorption is expected to continue in 2016. To ensure an orderly adjustment of the
economy, the authorities’ policy responses have been grounded on exchange rate
flexibility as the main shock absorber, and on appropriate fiscal and monetary policies.
As a result of the drop in oil prices, the supply weather-related shock and the tightening
of financial conditions, the Colombian peso has depreciated significantly, the current
account deficit has widened as a percentage of GDP, the sovereign bond spreads have
risen, and inflation and fiscal pressures have mounted. Against this backdrop, the central
bank (Banco de la República) has tightened the monetary policy and the government has
undertaken a fiscal adjustment in order to maintain macroeconomic and external stability,
thus supporting confidence. The 4G PPP infrastructure agenda, coupled with the reentrance into operation of the Cartagena oil refinery, has added to growth and partially
offset the negative impact of the shocks. In addition, the authorities have adopted other
structural reforms to boost non-traditional exports that will contribute to the adjustment
of the current account deficit and help sustain growth.
However, the authorities agree with staff that risks threaten on the downside. The main
hazards stem from instability and higher volatility in global financial conditions,
disorderly slowdown in China, rising vulnerabilities in emerging markets, further decline
in oil prices and weaker growth in Colombian trading partners. To face global financial
risks, the authorities are committed to maintaining good macroeconomic policies, a
floating exchange rate, keeping an adequate level of international reserves, and closely
monitoring banks, corporate and households’ balance sheets in order to ensure financial
stability. Access to the FCL also plays an important supportive role.

2
Fiscal policy
The fiscal stance embedded in the Medium-Term Fiscal Framework is well anchored by
the fiscal rule, whose compliance is a priority for the authorities. The drop in oil prices
has posed significant fiscal challenges as oil-related revenues declined from 3.3 percent
of GDP in 2013 to 0.1 percent in 2016, and interest payments increased 0.7 percent of
GDP due to the currency depreciation. The total shortfall of 4 percent of GDP between
2013 and 2016 was absorbed through higher non-oil related revenues of 1.5 percent of
GDP (a tax reform was approved in December 2014), spending cuts of 1.2 percent of
GDP, and the remaining 1.3 percent of GDP corresponds to a cyclical increase of the
deficit allowed by the fiscal rule. These measures permitted compliance of the Central
Government’s fiscal deficit target of 3 percent of GDP in 2015, and 3.6 percent of GDP
in 2016. The authorities remain committed to making additional adjustments if needed to
meet this year’s target.
Under the new normal of oil prices, the government is aware that further revenue
mobilization is needed in the years to come in order to comply with the fiscal rule and
help the adjustment of the current account deficit. Indeed, they are in the preparation
phase of the structural tax reform that will be submitted to Congress in the second
semester of this year and that should be approved no later than December 2016. The
report and recommendations of the tax expert commission have been an important input,
and other institutions such as the IMF, the IDB and the OECD are also supporting the
government in fine tuning the proposal.
Mainly due to the exchange rate depreciation, public debt increased around 5 percentage
points of GDP since 2014 (the Central Government’s net debt grew from 35 percent of
GDP in 2014 to 40 percent expected in 2016). However, in accordance to the fiscal rule
targets, debt will decline gradually to reach around 29 percent of GDP in 2024.
Monetary Policy and External Position
Inflation targeting serves the economy well. As a result of the supply shock and the
depreciation of the Colombian peso, inflation breached the upper bound of the target in
2015 (range of 2-4 percent) and continued to increase in 2016. The central bank started
increasing the policy rate in September 2015 to contain temporary inflation pressures and
anchor inflation expectations. Inflation is expected to return to target in 2017, as supply
shocks recede and the pass-through from depreciation fades.
Exchange rate flexibility has been the main shock absorber and the peso depreciated
strongly until early 2016, with a slight reversal in the last month. The freely floating
framework has been complemented since October 2015 by a rules-based contingent FX
auction program aiming at mitigating excess volatility. This mechanism has not been

3
triggered yet. The current account deficit widened last year to 6.5 percent of GDP, and is
expected to narrow gradually as domestic absorption adjusts and expenditure switching
effects kick in. For 2016 the deficit is projected at 6 percent of GDP, but in dollar terms
the reduction will be significant (from USD19 billion in 2015 to USD16 billion),
remaining comfortably financed by FDI and portfolio inflows.
Financial sector
The financial sector remains sound, liquid, profitable, well provisioned and capitalized,
and has sufficient buffers to cope with shocks. Stress tests conducted by the central bank
and the Bank Superintendency to financial entities and corporate to assess risks of lower
growth, exchange rate depreciation, lower oil prices and external financial tightening,
show that, in general, the impact on the capital adequacy ratio and liquidity of credit
institutions is limited and would not pose a significant threat to the vulnerability of the
financial system.
However, the authorities continue to push ahead with the reform agenda and are
finalizing the implementation of the FSAP recommendations. They are moving forward
with the adoption of best practices in line with Basel III. In addition, since December
2015 the supervisor has the authority to request higher buffers (levels of capital and
liquidity) to individual financial institutions that reveal higher risks. Finally, a law that
grants more power to regulate and supervise financial conglomerates is being discussed
in Congress.
The authorities continue to closely monitor financial stability risks. Corporate debt has
increased as well as that of households in line with deeper financial inclusion, but both
remain low by international standards. In addition, the share of foreign currency
denominated debt of corporate is low (one third of total debt) with no evidence of large
currency mismatches. The regulation of foreign currency in banks’ balance sheets is
stringent, so their exposure and currency mismatches are contained. The Central Bank
has recently tighten the regulation to limit currency mismatches and extended it to
conglomerates, and has also imposed liquidity requirements at a consolidated level,
important steps to manage cross-border risks.
In October 2015, the FSB, the IMF and the World Bank assessed the Colombian bank
resolution regime against the principles exposed in the “FSB Key Attributes of Effective
Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions” (KA). This assessment was carried out as
a voluntary request by the authorities, the first time the KA was applied to non-G20
countries. The pilot assessment found out that Colombia has a large and diversified
financial system compared with similar countries with significant cross-border
institutions, and the authorities have strong powers to manage weak and failing financial
institutions. However, the Colombian resolution regime has room for improvement and

the authorities are planning a way forward to implement the very useful
recommendations made.
Structural Reforms
The continuous reform process is at the core of the Government’s agenda. The social and
economic strategies, policies and targets for the next four years are outlined in a
development plan law (Plan Nacional de Desarrollo 2014–2018) which is also in line
with OECD requirements in some areas. The three pillars are peace, equity and
education, which will be developed through, among others, social mobility, rural
transformation, and improved competitiveness and infrastructure. The last two areas are
critical for the transition to a more diversified economy and less dependent on
commodity exports. As shown in the staff report, Colombia is making enormous progress
on infrastructure with the successful 4G PPP program complemented by the tertiary roads
projects. At the same time, the government is implementing other reforms to boost nontraditional exports, such as a new simplified custom status, tariff reform, education and
human capital measures in order to reduce mismatches between labor force supply and
demand, and is working closely with businessmen in order to take better advantage of
free trade agreements.
