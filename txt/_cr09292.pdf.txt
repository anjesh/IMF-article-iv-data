Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2009 Article IV Consultation with Tonga
Approved by Joshua Felman and Anthony Boote
August 14, 2009
 Discussions: Nuku’alofa, May 5–13, 2009. The team met with Minister of Finance
Matoto, National Reserve Bank of Tonga Governor Mafi, and other senior government
officials, as well as private sector representatives.
 Team: Mr. Davies (Head), Messes. Leony (APD) and Ogawa (OAP). Mr. Kartiyono
(OED) and Mr. Faletau (Asian Development Bank) joined the discussions.
 Past surveillance: The 2008 Article IV Consultation was completed on July 17, 2008.
Executive Directors’ have stressed the importance of fiscal consolidation and a balanced
policy mix in recent Article IV consultations. Improved governance and further progress
on public sector reform have also been emphasized.
 Focus of discussions: Near-term macroeconomic policy discussions focused on
responding to the reduction in growth without threatening medium-term sustainability.
Medium-term policies need to focus on promoting private sector-driven growth and
safeguarding debt sustainability.
 Outreach: The mission held a press conference, and also met with business, donor, and
diplomatic representatives.


Exchange rate: Basket peg with monthly adjustment band of ±5 percent.

 Exchange system: Accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. The
authorities plan to retain the exchange restriction in the form of a tax certification
requirement applied to various current international transactions. Board approval for this
restriction expired on July 9, 2008. At this point, staff does not propose an approval of this
restriction.
 Statistics: Data quality, coverage, and timeliness have been hampered by several
deficiencies, including capacity constraints, which have complicated effective surveillance.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background: Tonga is a small, remittance dependant, open economy vulnerable to domestic
and external shocks. In common with many Pacific Island economies, the global economic
slowdown has taken a toll on growth, halting the economy’s rebound from the 2006/07
domestic disturbances and economic contraction.
Main issues: Growth is likely to be low in the near term as remittances remain constrained
by global economic conditions and the domestic banking sector continues to consolidate. The
reconstruction of the central business district and increased subsistence agriculture are likely
to cushion the downward pressures. Risks are, however, tilted to the downside, mainly due to
increasing unemployment in remittance sending economies and rising oil prices.
Staff’s views: The government’s policy space to respond to slowing growth without
prejudicing medium term economic stability is constrained by the high risk debt position, the
low level of international reserves and financial sector fragility.


The 2008/09 budget targets a small surplus excluding loan-financed reconstruction.
Achieving this will require strong expenditure prioritization given the budget’s
optimistic growth and revenue projections. Including reconstruction the fiscal deficit
will widen significantly to around 4 percent of GDP.



The drawdown of the large reconstruction loan will lead to high risk debt levels over
the medium term. Any additional external borrowing should be strictly limited.



The current cautious monetary policy stance is appropriate. However, if economic
conditions deteriorate some easing should be considered provided the outlook for
international reserves and inflation environment is benign.



The exchange rate is consistent with external stability. The existing adjustment band
could be used to gradually correct its modest overvaluation.



Intensive supervision is required to monitor any further build up of bad loans and
ensure strong risk management.

Authorities’ views: The authorities have a more optimistic growth outlook than staff, but
share the risk analysis and broadly agree with staff’s policy recommendations. They intend to
remain within the budget’s macroeconomic targets and will reduce non-priority expenditure
allocations if revenues fall short of targets. They are committed to ensuring high local
content in the use of the reconstruction loan and to using the proceeds to finance high quality
projects. They agree that maintaining a prudent fiscal stance and sustaining GDP growth are
key to debt sustainability. Structural reforms to encourage private sector development are
therefore central to their development strategy.

I. CONTEXT AND RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Tonga is a small open economy vulnerable to domestic and external shocks.
Domestic political disturbances in 2006 caused widespread damage in the capital,
Nuku’alofa, and GDP contracted by around 1¾ percent in 2006/07.1 2 The economy
rebounded by 2½ percent the following year, leading up to the coronation of a new king in
August 2008. However, given its reliance on imports (41 percent of GDP in 07/08) and
remittances (31 percent of GDP) global economic developments over the last year have, in
common with the rest of the Pacific (Box 1) renewed pressure on the economy.
2.

2008/09 has been a challenging year.

Remittances fell by around
15 percent, reflecting the recessions
in the two main source economies—
the United States and New Zealand.
The associated decline in import
demand and retreats in international
commodity prices reduced external
pressures while unusually strong
investment and capital flows in the
latter half of 2008 allowed reserves
to rise to US$60 million—above
4 months of import cover.

Box 1: The Impact of the Global Crisis on the Pacific Island Economies
The global financial crisis was slow to
hit much of the Pacific. The main initial
impacts stemmed from drops in world
commodity prices and stock markets.
Commodity price falls had a beneficial
effect for many countries, easing external
and inflationary pressures. However,
commodity exporters (Papua New Guinea
and Solomon Islands) and countries with
large trust funds (Kiribati, Marshall
Islands, Federated States of Micronesia)
were immediately hit.

Fiji

Fiscal sectors have been particularly
hard hit, particularly in countries with
underlying structural problems. Declines
in imports and consumption have reduced
tax bases and growth outturns significantly
below budget assumptions have resulted in
cash shortages, expenditure cutbacks and
significant increases in deficits in a number
of countries (Solomon Islands, Fiji, Samoa,
Tonga). These problems have been
particularly severe in countries that were
already grappling with structural issues
before the onset of the global recession.

Financial sectors have, thus far, remained largely insulated. However, with real sectors
coming under increasing pressure asset quality is deteriorating in a number of countries (Fiji,
Tonga). Parent banks in Australia and the United States are less likely to provide liquidity
support given the constraints they face in their home markets.

agriculture are likely to cushion the downward pressures. International reserves are likely to
fall to around 3.3 months of import coverage, due to weak remittances and higher
construction imports. The likely peak in reconstruction and a recovery in remittances should
support stronger growth in 2010/11 before it returns to trend in the medium term.

Risks are tilted to the downside.



Remittances are vulnerable to a sharper-than-projected fall if unemployment rates in
the United States and New Zealand continue to increase. On the other hand,
expansions of seasonal worker programs and initiatives to reduce transfer costs could
provide some support.

5.
The authorities, however, are
more sanguine. They broadly shared staff’s views on the risks to the outlook. However, with
a more optimistic view on the impact of reconstruction and on sustained growth in domestic
commerce the budget forecasts growth of 1¾ percent for 2009/10.
6.
Policy discussions focused on the space available to the authorities to respond to
slowing growth without prejudicing medium term stability. The authorities are conscious
of the need to shield the population from the effects of the global economic downturn,
particularly as a result of falling remittances. Staff agreed with the authorities that, given the
exchange rate peg and weak transmission mechanism of monetary policy, fiscal policy was
the principal instrument. Staff, however, noted two key constraints: the high risk debt
position (see Box 2 and supplement), and; the vulnerability of international reserves.
B. Fiscal Policy
Background
7.
Fiscal management in 2008/09 was complicated by an overly ambitious budget.
Revenue increases of around 10 percent were targeted despite policy changes that reduced
the tax base.3 With growth failing to reach expectations and import volumes falling, revenue
actually declined by around 10 percent due to significant shortfalls on sales and trade taxes.
8.
Nevertheless, tight expenditure control and high grants allowed a budget
surplus. The shortfall in revenue, together with pressures from the coronation and the
purchase of a domestic power company (that was only partially offset by the sale of shares in
one of the main commercial banks) pressured recurrent expenditure, including road
3

The 2008 tax reform consisted of converting ad valorem tariffs of vehicles, fuel, tobacco and alcohol into
specific excises. In line with WTO accession commitments, remaining duty bands were reduced, lowering the
effective tariff and capital goods were also exempted from trade tariffs. In addition, the corporate tax rate was
reduced to 25 percent from 35 percent.

8

maintenance and operational expenditures. Significant increases in grants, driven by a large
payment from China, allowed an increase in capital expenditure and a build up of cash
balances, including 15 million pa’anga that will be placed in a newly established emergency
and natural disaster fund . The overall budget surplus was around 1¼ percent of GDP,
including initial expenditure from the reconstruction loan.
Box 2: Debt Sustainability and the Reconstruction of the Central Business District
The reconstruction of the Central Business District following the 2006 disturbances is mainly being
financed by a US$63 million loan from the EXIM Bank China. The loan will be drawn down over the
three years up to 2012 and repaid on concessional terms (2 percent interest) over 20 years (with a
5 year grace period). It will be used in part to finance public works in the capital; the remainder of the
loan is being on-lent to the private sector for rebuilding offices and shops.
Reconstruction will be implemented on a turn-key basis by a Chinese construction company. They are,
however, required to use Tongan labor, unless they can show that the skills required are not present
within the local labor force. Government cabinet and technical committees will oversee loan
implementation and select projects.
Loan drawdowns of US$15 million were made in 2008/09. However, construction only began in
earnest in April 2009 and total 2008/09 expenditure is expected to be only around US$2.5 million,
predominately on public works. A number of applications for private sector lending have been
approved by the Cabinet committee and expenditure will commence on these in early 2009/10. These
commercial and retail projects will rely on continued private-sector growth for their viability.
When loan drawdowns are completed, the net present value of Tonga’s external debt will be around
40 percent of GDP and 290 percent of exports, considerably above the respective indicative risk
thresholds of 30 percent and 100 percent. Although remittances will continue to provide a substantial
cushion against external debt distress risks, stress tests indicate significant vulnerabilities.
Debt sustainability will rely on sustained GDP growth. This emphasizes the importance of loan
financed projects adding to the economy’s productive capacity.



A 10 percent wage increase for the public sector is also incorporated. The wage
increase, the first since the 70 percent increase in 2006/07, is intended to be an
integral part of the ongoing reform of the public sector that aims to contain the wage
bill through reducing the size of the public service, while improving performance
through recognizing merit and flattening the grade structure. Progress has been made
in reducing the size of the public service and attention is now shifting to improving
performance. The current package, which has the support of the workforce. also
includes linking annual salary increments to merit rather than seniority, reducing
leave entitlements and abolishing vacancies.4



Financing is projected to come from increased revenue, as a result of improved
enforcement and economic activity, and external grants, including budget support of
US$10 million from the Asian Development Bank. In view of economic
circumstances the government decided not to increase tax rates.

broadly balanced budgets is important for
debt sustainability given the sharp
increase in debt stemming from the EXIM Bank loan.5 This will require sustained
improvements in revenue enforcement and careful expenditure prioritization, particularly
with regard to personnel costs. Non-reconstruction deficits of just 1 percent of GDP,
combined with slow GDP growth would see public debt above 40 percent of GDP in 2020,
compared to staff’s baseline projection of 21 percent. Additional future borrowing to finance
infrastructure investment, such as the US$45 million infrastructure loan currently being
discussed with China, will intensify debt sustainability concerns and would be better
financed through improved government revenue, expenditure reprioritization or grants.

11.
Staff supported the 2008/09 budget’s target of a modest non-reconstruction
surplus but argued that additional policy actions would be needed. A surplus of
1¾ percent of GDP (including grants but excluding reconstruction) is broadly appropriate
given growth pressures and the need to keep the overall balance under control. However,
with a significantly lower GDP growth forecast than the authorities, staff projects that
revenue will be around 20 million pa’anga (2 percent of GDP) less than budgeted. As a
result, planned expansions in non-wage expenditure will be impossible to achieve while
remaining within the budget’s macroeconomic framework. Significant cuts from 2009/10
levels will be required if grants fall short of projections. Staff advised the authorities to
carefully prioritize expenditure allocations, including possibly phasing the public sector wage
rise, and to step up effort in revenue enforcement. Tax increases were not advocated in the
short-term given the pressures on the domestic economy.
12.
The authorities stressed their commitment to prudent fiscal policy. They cited the
budget surpluses achieved in recent years as evidence of their commitment to sound
macroeconomic and budget management even in the face of significant revenue shortfalls.
The authorities appreciated the fiscal risk of the public sector pay rise but stressed that it was

essential to achieve broad support for the ongoing program of public sector reform that is
central plank of the National Strategic Plan. They stressed their commitment to ensuring
reconstruction spending is productive and expected full loan utilization.
13.
The authorities remain confident on revenue and grants, but are ready to take
contingency measures. A new customs management system is expected to provide scope for
significant gains in enforcement. However, in the event of revenue shortfalls, the authorities
stressed that the expenditure review committee chaired by the Prime Minister would ensure
that priority areas, particularly the social sectors would be protected.
C. Monetary and Financial Sector Policies
Background
14.

2008/09 was a turbulent year for the financial sector.



At the beginning of the year banking sector liquidity was tight and lending growth
was rapid (around 20 percent). As the year progressed, liquidity increased as
pressures on reserves moderated; credit growth halted as banks tightened their
lending requirements and NRBT withdrew excess liquidity to protect reserves and
safeguard financial sector stability. Broad money declined as deposits were
withdrawn in the face of worsening economic conditions. Interest rates declined from
their late-2008 highs, but remain high.



Reflecting in part the impact of slowing growth and remittances and also inadequate
risk management in the banks during 2008’s lending surge, bad debts began to build
from mid-2008. The non-performing loan ratio stood at 20 percent in mid 2009.
NRBT has ensured that the two main commercial banks have taken provisions and,
reflecting their ongoing commitment to their Tonga operations, their foreign parents
have injected capital to remain in line with prudential regulations.

Policy Discussions
15.
Staff supported the current cautious monetary policy stance, but encouraged
easing should economic conditions worsen. Given the exchange rate peg and with reserves
likely to remain in the lower part of NRBT’s comfort zone, restraining credit growth is
appropriate, particularly given the increase in non-bank credit in the economy as a result of
reconstruction activity. Should economic conditions worsen, staff suggested that NRBT
should consider reducing or eliminating the sale of NRBT notes to allow a moderate pace of
credit growth, providing the outlook for reserves and inflation environment is benign.
However, the banking sector may not respond given its current highly cautious lending
policies.
16.
The authorities stressed that a tight monetary policy was in line with their policy
objectives—international reserves, inflation and financial sector stability. Economic growth
is not part of NRBT’s objectives; nevertheless, given economic conditions easing remains an
option they are considering. NRBT was concerned, however, that the transmission
mechanism to growth was not clear, particularly given the strong correlation between credit
and import growth. They also noted that past evidence suggested that current excess liquidity
would feed into credit with a lag and were conscious of the importance for financial sector
stability of not reigniting credit growth.
17.
Staff emphasized the importance of stepped up bank supervision in preventing a
recurrence of the recent problems in the financial sector. Recent events have shown that
head office oversight of international banks cannot be relied upon to insulate the financial
sector from problems. Despite the banks’ recent aggressive measures to improve credit
policies, a continuation of NRBT’s more intensive supervision, including more frequent onsite inspections, will be crucial in monitoring and guarding against a further increase in nonperforming loans. The recently approved new prudential regulations on banks’ governance
and other areas, when implemented, will help prevent a recurrence.
18.
The authorities agreed that supervision was crucial but stressed that it could not
substitute for sound lending practices in commercial banks. They emphasized the limited
human resources in NRBT’s banking supervision department. Nevertheless, when the
deterioration in asset quality became apparent, NRBT took strong enforcement actions to
ensure that banks remained compliant with its prudential regulations. NRBT is conscious of
the need to learn from the experience and has commissioned an independent study of
supervisory actions leading up to the episode. They are actively seeking, with staff’s support,
further technical assistance, including from MCM.

D. External Viability and Exchange Rate Policies
Background
19.
The pa’anga traded in line with its peg. Reflecting the sharp changes in
international alignments, the pa’anga depreciated against the US dollar, increasing the
domestic value of US sourced remittances, and appreciated against Australia and New
Zealand dollars, decreasing the domestic value of remittances but reducing the price of food
imports that are predominately sourced from New Zealand. NRBT did not make use of the
monthly adjustment band within the exchange rate peg.

20.
The exchange rate is consistent with external stability. Staff’s estimates using a
variety of techniques are limited by data deficiencies, but suggest that the pa’anga is
modestly overvalued.1 However, the external current account deficits projected over the
medium term are in line with historical levels and can be financed by official and private
capital inflows.
21.
Trade policy has been broadly stable following WTO accession in 2007. The
2008/09 budget has however introduced some small policy changes to correct perceived
anomalies caused by the 2008 abolition of duties on capital goods. Regional trade
commitments will see tariff levels continue to decline in the coming years.

1

The macroeconomic balance approach suggests a REER overvaluation of around 9½ percent, the equilibrium
real exchange rate approach suggest overvaluation of about 12 percent. The external sustainability approach
suggest that the REER is overvalued by about 2½ percent.

14

Policy Discussions
22.
Staff and the authorities agreed that the exchange rate peg provides a valuable
policy anchor. The authorities, however, hope, if technical assistance is available, to review
the weights before the next Article IV consultation.
23.
The monthly adjustment band provides considerable flexibility for the
authorities to respond to changing economic circumstances. Staff encouraged the
authorities to use this flexibility to gradually correct the modest overvaluation of the pa’anga,
which would increase the local value of remittances, moderate current account pressures and
lessen the burden on monetary policy. The authorities stressed that they stood ready to adjust
the rate, particularly if renewed pressures came on reserves. They emphasized, however, that
price competitiveness was not the major constraint to existing export sectors—that are more
constrained by structural factors such as infrastructure, market access and quarantine
regulations. In light of the import dependence of the economy, and the likely upward trend in
commodity prices, the authorities intend to proceed cautiously on exchange rate flexibility.

E. Structural Policies
Background
25.
Tonga’s growth has been
frustrated by the lack of a dynamic
private sector. The public sector is large
and state-owned enterprises have
traditionally occupied sizable portions of
the productive arena, controlling around
20 percent of fixed assets yet contributing
only 6 percent to GDP. The government

is rationalizing its holdings in public enterprises and has recently divested its ownership of
the duty-free retail operation and its shares in a commercial bank. It has, though, also taken
into public ownership the power generation and distribution company. The private sector has
been further constrained by excessive regulation and discretionary licensing requirements.
Policy discussions
26.
Staff and the authorities agreed on the critical importance of accelerated
progress on structural reforms to promote private sector development. The
Government’s Strategic Planning Framework places this at the centre of the agenda and some
good progress has been made in recent years. Tonga now compares well with regional peers
in the cost of doing business—however, it ranks very poorly on key indicators such as
protecting investors, registering property and obtaining credit. Progress is being made
however, which is reflected in improvements in its rating for government effectiveness and
corruption in the World Bank Governance indicators. Priorities for further reform include
commercial law reform and reintroducing the Companies Registry that was destroyed in the
2006 disturbances. Continued progress on divesting, rationalizing and improving the
governance of public enterprises will also be important as will strengthening public financial
management. Making further progress on the broader governance environment will enhance
stability and increase investor confidence.
27.
Improved economic statistics will enhance policy making, particularly in the
budget area. The authorities have recently published a revised set of national accounts with
broader coverage and improved estimation technique; improved balance of payments
statistics are also being developed. However, resources are very limited and further
improvements will require investment in source data. The authorities acknowledge this and
are working with donors to make improvements in the resources available to the national
statistics office while also improving the use of statistics in policy making. A key element of
this is to bring a more structured basis to policy discussions by adopting common forecasting
tools across all economic agencies.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
Tonga’s recovery from the 2006 disturbances has been hampered by global and
domestic economic conditions. Growth will likely slow to less than ½ percent in 2008/09
and 2009/10, as remittances decline and banks curtail credit in response to a build-up of bad
loans. The decline in international food prices should, however, allow inflation to remain
moderate and reserves adequate. Risks are tilted to the downside, particularly if remittances
fall more sharply than projected due to prolonged high unemployment in the United States
and New Zealand. A return to high world oil prices would renew external pressures.
Reconstruction activities may provide additional support for growth, but could add to
inflation.

16

29.
The authorities’ ability to respond to the weak growth environment is limited.
High public debt limits the scope for fiscal stimulus and monetary policy is constrained by a
weak transmission mechanism and relatively low international reserves.
30.
The 2009/10 budget takes a broadly appropriate macroeconomic stance, but is
based on ambitious revenue projections. Shortfalls are likely to occur against the budget’s
projections for revenue and grants. As a result, the increases to priority expenditure areas
planned as part of the government’s fiscal stimulus package will not be possible, particularly
given the large public sector wage increase. Greater attention to improving revenue
enforcement, especially in the customs, area will be crucial to budget implementation.
31.
The risk of debt distress will increase with the drawdown of the large
reconstruction loan. The planned disbursement profile is consistent with manageable—if
high risk—debt dynamics, but this depends on continued GDP growth, broadly balanced
budgets over the medium term and productive loan-financed expenditure. Careful vetting of
proposed reconstruction projects is therefore vital. Additional borrowing, such as the large
infrastructure loan that is being considered, could lead to unsustainable debt dynamics.
32.
With reserves likely to remain in the lower part of the Reserve Bank’s comfort
zone, the current cautious monetary policy stance is appropriate. However, should
economic conditions worsen, some monetary policy easing should be considered, providing
the outlook for reserves and inflation remains benign. The banking sector may not respond,
though, given its current caution on lending. Stepped up supervision will need to continue to
guard against a further deterioration in banks’ balance sheets and regulation needs to remain
vigilant to further episodes of surges in high risk lending.
33.
The exchange rate remains consistent with external stability. The projected
external current account deficits are sustainable. However, gradual correction of the
pa’anga’s modest overvaluation by using the adjustment band around the peg could help
safeguard reserve coverage and promote domestic commerce.
34.
Improving GDP growth and raising living standards over the medium term
requires sustained attention to structural reform. Rationalizing public enterprises,
enhancing infrastructure and improving business regulation will help empower the private
sector.
35.
Improving statistical capacity remains a priority, and continued technical
assistance in this area is needed. Improvements in underlying data are needed to take
advantage of recent advances in compilation techniques.
36.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Tonga should take place
on a standard 12-month cycle.

Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis 20091
Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
The International Development Association
Approved by Joshua Felman and Anthony Boote (IMF)
and Vikram Nehru and Carlos Primo Braga (IDA)
August 14, 2009
The Low Income Country Debt Sustainability Analysis (LIC DSA) indicates that Tonga
remains at a high risk of debt distress. Under the baseline scenario, the NPV-of-debt to GDP
as well as the NPV-of-debt to export ratios remain above the country-specific indicative
thresholds for a prolonged period. At the same time, Tonga benefits from very high
remittance inflows (over 30 percent of GDP), which are by far the largest source of foreign
exchange earnings and help mitigate liquidity risks. Tonga’s overall public sector debt
indicators, while elevated over the short term, show a decreasing trend over the longer run.
Taking into account the cushion provided to the economy by the large workers’ remittances,
the projected debt profile is consistent with manageable—if high risk—debt dynamics.
The results of the debt sustainability analysis underscore the importance of maintaining
broadly balanced budgets following the completion of reconstruction borrowing and
sustaining growth near historical averages. Both are key to maintaining stable debt levels in
the medium term and declining debt levels in the long term.
I. BACKGROUND
1.
The external and public debt sustainability analyses are based on the standard
LIC DSA framework.2 The DSA presents the projected path of Tonga’s external and public

This DSA was prepared jointly with the World Bank in accordance with the Debt Sustainability Framework for
low-income countries approved by the Executive Boards of the IMF and IDA. The debt data underlying this

sector debt burden indicators, and draws some conclusions on the forward-looking
sustainability of debt.
2.
Tonga’s total public sector debt stock (including publicly guaranteed debt)
declined to 34 percent of GDP in FY07/08 from 40 percent of GDP in 2005/06. External
debt to GDP fell as donor financing declined in real terms, while fiscal consolidation to limit
domestic budget financing also contributed to a downward trend in domestic public debt to
GDP.
3.
Following the civil unrest in November of 2006, the government made a
significant effort toward securing financing for the reconstruction of the capital city of
Nuku’alofa. This includes donor grants of about US$15 million, to be channeled through
designated banks to business entities affected by the riots in the form of off-budget, low
interest rate loans in the second half of 2007/08. The government also signed a long-term
reconstruction loan from the EXIM Bank of China in November 2007. Disbursements of this
loan were postponed, as the government sought to ensure it was used productively and
negotiated for use of local inputs. The first drawdown was made in April 2009. Loan
proceeds will be used in broadly equal measure to finance public works in the capital and to
lend to the private sector for office and retail construction. The loan, which bears a 2 percent
interest rate will be repaid over 20 years with a 5 year grace period.
4.
The 2009 DSA reinforces the findings of the previous analysis. The main changes
from the 2008 DSA are the lower short-term growth outlook as a result of the global
economic crisis and more rapid assumed drawdowns of the EXIM Bank loan. In addition, the
DSA incorporates the authorities’ new GDP statistics. The new series has improved coverage
and , includes estimates of the informal sector. This increases the level of GDP by
15–20 percent and causes some changes to historic growth rates. While the increase in the
level of GDP reduces historic debt ratios, it has not led to a change in the assessment of
Tonga’s risk of debt distress.

II. BASELINE
5.
Tonga’s DSA builds on the baseline scenario assumptions presented in Box 1. It
assumes that the real GDP growth rate will revert close to its historical average following a
slowdown in 2008/09 and 2009/10. The reconstruction loan will be drawn down over four

3
years. Excluding reconstruction spending, public spending will be broadly limited to
projected revenues and grants over the medium term, and will, thus, minimize additional
external borrowing. Although exports are expected to remain constrained, remittances,
which are the largest source of foreign exchange earnings (one half of Tongans live abroad,
mostly in Australia, New Zealand, and United States), are expected to remain an important
external cushion over the medium term.
Box 1: Key Assumptions


Real GDP growth is projected to average 1.2 percent over the period 2009/10–2014/15,
reflecting a slowdown from the global financial crisis in the first two years and an
average of 1¾ percent thereafter. This modest long-run growth outlook is in line with
Tonga’s historic growth rates, reflecting structural impediments, which will continue to
constrain growth potential.



Inflation as measured by the GDP deflator is projected to average 5 percent over the
projection period 2009/10–2014/15.



The non-reconstruction public sector budget is projected to remain broadly balanced.
Fiscal revenue is projected to grow steadily before it stabilizes at around 26 percent of
GDP, as improvements in tax administration bed in and compliance improves.



Grants are projected to decline from current high levels, but remain significant at around
2 percent of GDP over the medium term. This reflects the importance of donor
commitments given the relatively small size of the Tongan economy. The EXIM Bank
reconstruction loan is assumed to be fully drawn down by 2012/13 and no major further
infrastructure lending is assumed.



Total expenditure is projected to remain below revenues and grants, yielding primary
surpluses of around 1 percent of GDP, somewhat smaller than recent outturns.



The external current account balance is projected to decline this year to 7.9 percent of
GDP from 10 percent of GDP in 2007/08 driven largely by the drop in food and fuel
prices. Over the medium term, the deficit should stabilize around 6 percent of GDP.



FDI is projected to stabilize below recent levels at around 6–7 percent of GDP.



The export base is projected to remain narrow and relatively undiversified, while
remittances have recently dropped as a result of the decline in economic activity in the
United States and New Zealand, from which the greater part of remittances emanate.
They are, however, expected to recover as these economies rebound from the impact of
the global economic slowdown, including seasonal worker programs in Australia and
New Zealand.

4
III. EXTERNAL DSA
Baseline
6.
Under the baseline, the external debt trajectory breaches the policy-dependent
threshold in 2009/10 before receding to below the threshold in 2018/19. Public and
publicly guaranteed (PPG) external debt averaged over 30 percent of GDP from 1998 to
2006, the indicative threshold level, but has decreased in recent years reflecting growth in
nominal GDP and fiscal prudence. However, with the drawdown of the reconstruction loan
the PV of PPG external debt is projected to increase to about 42 percent of GDP by 2012/13,
12 percent above the threshold, before dropping under the threshold in 2017 and declining to
11 percent of GDP by the end of the projection period.
7.
External debt remains well above the PV of debt-to-export distress threshold.
Reflecting Tonga’s low exports, the NPV of PPG external debt-to-exports ratio is
243 percent, well above the indicative threshold of 100 percent, and is projected to remain
above the threshold for an extended period. However, this is mitigated in part by the large
remittances, which are the largest source of foreign exchange earnings (one half of Tongans
live abroad, mostly in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States) and which have a
countervailing effect by helping to reduce liquidity risks.

8.
Debt and debt service are expected to stay above the exports threshold for the
majority of the projection period. The impact of the global economic crisis will make it
harder for Tonga to expand its very narrow export base in the short term, aggravating
solvency and liquidity risks. Remittances will decline in the short term, but they are expected
to recover and stabilize at around 25 percent of GDP over the medium term, considerably
below historical highs, but still providing a vital cushion against external debt distress and
liquidity risks. Moreover, the ratio of debt and debt service to revenue remain well below the

5
thresholds of 200 percent and 25 percent, respectively, throughout the projection period
(Figure 1a), albeit with a deterioration in the short- to medium term.
Alternative scenario and stress tests
9.
Stress tests show the vulnerability of the debt position to a slowdown in exports
or a significant depreciation. The export shock stress test causes the present value of debt to
reach 600 percent of exports and remain above the 100 percent threshold for the entire
projection period. Similarly debt service to exports ratios rise even further above the
15 percent threshold, reaching over 40 percent in 2015. A one time depreciation causes the
present value of debt to rise to 60 percent of GDP and remain above the 30 percent threshold
until 2022. It also causes the present value of debt to revenue ratio to briefly breach
threshold. Similarly public sector borrowing on less favorable terms would see debt levels
remain above the indicative GDP threshold for a prolonged period and approach the revenue
threshold.
IV. PUBLIC SECTOR DSA
Baseline
10.
The public sector DSA reinforces the conclusions of the external DSA. In the last
two fiscal years, Tonga's public debt to GDP ratio has declined to around 34 percent of GDP.
However, the resumption of large scale public sector borrowing for reconstruction of the
capital reversed the trend, with debt building up to 44 percent of GDP in 2010/11 before
declining steadily thereafter under the baseline scenario. This reflects the importance of fiscal
prudence, and a continued commitment to limit new public borrowing.
Alternative scenario and stress tests
11.
Stress tests reflect that vulnerabilities remain throughout the projection period,
particularly to low GDP growth. Among the stress tests performed, the permanent decline
in GDP growth and a one-standard deviation decline in GDP growth show the strongest
deterioration, with the PV of debt to GDP ratio rising above 50 percent of GDP in both cases.
Further, the alternative scenario in the public sector DSA shows that the additional large
public sector borrowing for infrastructure currently being envisaged causes prolonged
increases in debt levels.
V. STAFF ASSESSMENT
12.
Tonga remains at a high risk of external debt distress. At the same time, Tonga
benefits from very high remittance inflows, which are the largest source of foreign exchange
earnings and have a countervailing effect by helping to mitigate liquidity risks. Moreover,
Tonga’s overall public sector debt dynamics, while elevated over the short term, shows a

6
decreasing trend over the longer run, suggesting that debt dynamics are manageable, but at
high risk.
13.
Stress tests highlight key vulnerabilities to debt sustainability over the medium
term, including lower GDP growth, major external shocks, and borrowing on less
concessional terms. This underscores the importance of sound macroeconomic policies to
improve growth potential on a sustainable basis, export diversification, and continued efforts
in fiscal consolidation. Moreover, increased utilization of donor grants and limiting recourse
to concessional financing is necessary to maintain manageable public debt dynamics and
reduce the risk of external debt distress. Sound public debt management, anchored in a
medium-term debt management strategy (MTDS) and in line with the medium-term fiscal
framework, is also essential to guide future development financing in Tonga. Priority should
be given to projects, which would help generate high growth and employment to help ensure
debt service capacity in the future.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and r = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Source: Staff projections and simulations.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
Since February 11, 1991, the value of the pa’anga is determined based on a weighted
basket of currencies comprising the United States, Australian, and New Zealand
dollars, with the U.S. dollar as the intervention currency. In July 2000, the Japanese
yen was added to the basket, and the monthly maximum adjustment limit was raised
to 5 percent from 2 percent that had prevailed since March 1998, when the
allowance for adjustment was introduced. Tonga has accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4.
Tonga presently imposes an exchange restriction subject to approval under
Article VIII, Section 2 (a). Board approval expired in June, 2008. This restriction
consists of the tax certification requirement imposed by the authorities on the
making of payments and transfers for certain current international transactions:
(i) payments for oil imports; (ii) airline ticket sales; (iii) payments for specified
charges/fees/services; (iv) insurance payments; (v) lease payments; (vi) payments
for medical expenses incurred by residents; (vii) transfers by nonresidents of profits
and dividends abroad; (viii) external loan payments; and (xi) maintenance payments
including remittances for family living expenses.

ANNEX II. TONGA: RELATIONS WITH THE
PACIFIC FINANCIAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTRE (PFTAC)1
(As of June 2009)
Assistance to Tonga since 2006 included 23 advisory missions, mostly on all technical
assistance (TA) sectors. During 2006–June 2009, Tonga has sent 50 officials to the Centre’s
regional seminars, workshops and training courses, and six attachments were organized.
Public Financial Management
Since 2003, PFTAC's missions have focused on complementing the considerable assistance
provided by other TA agencies, including through the introduction of a midyear economic
review and fiscal update, reconciliation of monetary and fiscal data, and changes in budget
documentation. For the 2003/04 and 2004/05 budgets, assistance was provided in presenting
the final aggregate budget figures on a GFSM 2001 basis. In 2004, PFTAC arranged for a
Tongan official to participate on a delegation of Pacific Island officials to the Australian
Commonwealth Ministry of Finance. During 2005, the PFTAC PFM Advisor participated in
a joint donor/government Feasibility Study related to a proposed long-term Financial and
Economic Management Program (FEMP), as well as worked with the Ministry of Finance on
assessing the financial implications of the proposed civil service wage increase. Since then
assistance in the form of a peripatetic advisor has been provided in 2006, and again in 2007,
to assist in revenue estimation work. The PFM Advisor has also delivered lectures on PFM to
all CEOs, in late April 2007. A joint PFTAC mission on revenue estimation visited Tonga in
mid-March 2008 to further assist in these areas. A PFTAC mission on decentralization also
visited Tonga in May 2008 and made several recommendations in this area.
Tax Administration and Policy
Tonga has improved revenue policy and administration over the last three years. Key
outcomes are: the passing of new Income tax and Customs Acts, both self assessed; a post
implementation review of the value-added tax (VAT) and substantial change to the tax
administration principally with the introduction of self assessment. This progress has
complemented the introduction of the consumption tax in 2005 and has seen tax revenues
increase steadily to GDP in recent years. Ongoing assistance has been given through PFTAC,
NZAID and AusAID, and the ADB.

The Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) in Suva, Fiji is a regional technical assistance
institution operated by the IMF with financial support of the Asian Development Bank, Australia, Japan, Korea
and New Zealand. The Centre's aim is to build skills and institutional capacity for effective economic and
financial management that can be sustained at the national level. Member countries are: Cook Islands,
Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa,
Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.

5

An IMF/PFTAC Tax Policy and Administration mission in March 2008 had the objective of
reviewing tax policy issues in small Pacific island countries and in particular to consider the
fiscal challenges posed by prospective trade liberalization and assess the experience with the
VAT. The mission visited Fiji, Kiribati, Samoa, Solomon Islands, and Tonga. In Tonga, the
mission found that the consumption tax was catalytic to the improvement of revenues
collected in an environment of the political will to reform of the public sector and also
dissatisfaction with the performance of some existing taxes.
Revenue losses arising from trade liberalization through the Pacific Island Countries Trade
Agreement (PICTA) and Pacific Agreement for Closer Economic Relations (PACER) have
been estimated as high as 27 percent of total revenue by external research.2 This presents an
issue for Tonga to deal with in the immediate future to replace those lost revenues.
Informal discussions between PFTAC and Tongan revenue officials regarding the
modernizing of stamp duties also Customs administration and processes where improvements
to trade revenues can be made.
Banking Sector Regulation and Supervision
An assessment to determine compliance with the Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking
Supervision (BCP) was conducted in 2002. It identified some shortcomings in Tonga’s legal
framework and resulted in a review of the Financial Institutions Act (FIA). The enhanced
FIA was enacted in late 2004. A TA mission provided assistance with drafting regulations
and guidelines, and establishing procedures for their implementation in April 2005. Further
assistance in supervision was provided in late 2005 and again in February 2006, as the on-site
examination process has been regularized with PFTAC assistance. Amendments to the
NRBT Act, which will strengthen the central bank’s enforcement capacity, are still awaiting
Parliament’s enactment. PFTAC also arranged, through funding provided in late 2005 by
NZAID, for the renewal of the secondment of a central banking manager from the Reserve
Bank of Fiji to serve as the Deputy Governor of the National Reserve Bank of Tonga.
Peripatetic advisors for bank supevision are being provided by Monetary and Capital Markets
Department (MCM). No visits have been conducted by the Advisor with the NRBT
authorities. Recently, authorities have requested PFTAC to conduct research regarding
interest and exchange rate spreads across the Pacific in comparison to those experienced in
Tonga. The results of the requested research project will be presented to the 2009 South
Pacific Reserve Bank Governor’s meeting in December 2009.

Economic and Financial Statistics
In 2002, two reviews were undertaken in accordance with the GDDS and the Data Quality
Assessment Framework; one on BOP statistics and the other on the wider statistical system.
Subsequent missions in 2004 finalized GDDS metadata, provided training in BOP concepts
and practices, developed a new BOP business survey, and reviewed national accounts data.
In September 2005 a partial update of the 2002 statistical system review was done, focused
on outputs of the Statistics Division of the Ministry of Finance. Further assistance was
provided to peer review GDP and BOP estimates prior to publication. GDDS metadata was
approved and published in 2006 on the Data Dissemination Bulletin Board. A TA mission in
April 2007 provided further assistance with reviewing BOP statistics. Follow-up missions on
BOP statistics were undertaken in April 2008 and March 2009, resulting in revised BOP
estimates based on the Balance of Payments Manual, 6th edition standards being compiled. In
addition to the an advisory mission on revenue estimation and review of National Accounts
Statistics (NAS) in mid-March 2008, a further TA advisory mission on NAS in March 2009
implemented significant improvements in methodology and use of source data, resulting in
substantial improvements in the estimates and dissemination of an expanded rnge on NAS
estimates. TA expert missions to develop producer price indexes were also undertaken in
July 2008 and March 2009.

ANNEX III. TONGA: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(as of July 10, 2009)
Tonga became a member of the World Bank Group in 1985. Since that time, the World bank
has approved six IDA credits and grants worth a total of SDR 18.6 million (equivalent to
approximately USD 28 million based on exchange rates at the time of each loan approval).
Given Tonga’s debt position, all new IDA support for Tonga is provided on grant terms.
Tonga has an indicative IDA-15 (FY09–FY11) envelope of SDR 4.9 million (approximately
USD 7.5 million), none of which has yet been committed.
In addition to the IDA-15 envelope, the World Bank is in FY10 anticipating committing
approximately AUD 3 million in funds for Tonga provided through the Pacific Regional
Infrastructure facility (PRIF), financed predominantly by Australia and New Zealand.
Key components of the World Bank’s current engagement include:


Health: The Tonga Health Sector Support Project (an IDA credit of USD
10.9 million equivalent approved in 2003) has successfully supported Tongan
Government efforts to improve the performance of the health sector, particularly the
functioning of Vaiola hospital in Nuku’alofa, as well as reforms to Tonga’s health
financing system. Health sector investments by the Bank has supported Tonga’s own
progress toward the MDGs of reducing child mortality and improving maternal
health, both of which are likely to be achieved. The project is scheduled to finish
shortly, and will be fully disbursed.



Education: The Tonga Education Support Project (an IDA credit of U.S. dollars
1 million equivalent approved in 2005 in conjunction with a New Zealand grant of
USD 4.1 million) has introduced a successful schools grants program. School grants,
allocated on a capitation formula, have ensured funding has been allocated equitably
and able to be used flexibly by schools for maintenance and educational materials.
This program has supported Tonga’s own progress toward universal primary
education, where the country remains broadly on track.



Transport: The Tonga Transport Sector Consolidation Project (an IDA grant of
USD 5.4 million equivalent approved in July 2008) aims to assist the government to
unify transport sector-policy, planning and regulation in the newly established
Ministry of Transport. This is intended to improve civil aviation and maritime safety
and security. With anticipated grant support through PRIF, the TSCP will also assist
the government to directly contract local firms to undertake urgent and necessary road
maintenance in a manner which ensures local participation and strengthening of the
local industry as well as support maritime and air transport investments.

8



Private sector development: The World Bank Group (including IFC and IDA) are
collaborating to support the efforts of the Tongan government to streamline business
enabling environment legislation and regulation and remove regulatory impediments
to private sector growth.



Energy: The Bank is currently working with the Tongan government and other
development partners to develop a Tonga Energy Roadmap, as a series of integrated
investments and reforms required to improve access and reduce the cost of electricity
supply in Tonga, and minimize Tonga’s vulnerability to oil price shocks, including by
making greater use of renewable sources of energy. Leadership by the Tonga
Government has ensured that this process has been a strong example of development
coordination in the Pacific region. It is anticipated that the Bank will be able to
support the final roadmap – with other development partners and potentially private
sector investors – with current unallocated IDA resources, as well as with support
through PRIF.

ANNEX IV. TONGA: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK3
(As of June 2009)
The Asian Development Bank (AsDB) strategy for Tonga supported the Government’s
Strategic Development Plan Eight 2006/07–2008/09 (SDP-8) in alignment with the
objectives of the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. The Country Partnership
Strategy 2007–12 (CPS) focuses on poverty reduction by means of three intervention
pillars—pro-poor, environmentally sustainable integrated urban infrastructure development;
financing of pro-poor policies through effective, prudent macroeconomic and fiscal
management; and private sector development—that address binding constraints on growth.
Capacity strengthening and institution building will be among the key outcomes of the
results-based CPS. The CPS outcomes expected are (i) improved fiscal governance, (ii)
improved social services delivery in urban areas, and (iii) an improved private sectorenabling environment.
The SDP8 ended in June 2009 and Cabinet has endorsed a new National Strategic Planning
Framework (NSPF), which takes a longer term strategic approach and focuses on a limited
number of uniquely national or whole of government priorities – with the implementation
details to be contained in the corporate plans of ministries and departments. The NSPF
identified seven outcomes fundamental to producing sustained and more equitable economic
growth – (i) community development, (ii) private sector growth, (iii) constitutional reform,
(iv) improved provision and maintenance of infrastructure, (v) increased performance of
technical and vocational training, (vi) improved health, and (vii) environmental sustainability
and climate change. The three pillars of the AsDB's strategy for Tonga remain valid in light
of the outcome objectives highlighted under NSPF.
AsDB has approved 15 loans and one grant totaling $69.1 million from the Asian
Development Fund (ADF) to Tonga since it joined AsDB in 1972. Fifty-six technical
assistance (TA) projects with a value of $16.5 million were also provided to improve
capacity and strengthen institutional development in various sectors. Past AsDB investments
have focused on finance development and infrastructure development in transport, power,
agriculture, and fisheries.
Active projects include one grant-financed project and four TA projects in the country
portfolio. The grant-financed project supports enhancing living standards by improving urban
infrastructure. The four ongoing TA projects focus on public enterprise reforms, youth
micro-enterprise development, support for the implementation of SDP-8, and urban planning
and management system. Tonga also benefits from a number of regional technical assistance
projects in private sector development, economic management, infrastructure-related
activities, public financial management, statistics and HIV/Aids prevention and capacity
development.

ANNEX V. TONGA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
While economic statistics are broadly adequate for surveillance, data deficiencies continue to
complicate the monitoring of economic conditions and policy formulation. The Statistics
Department (SD) and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) have received, on a regular basis,
technical assistance in national accounts, government finance, and balance of payments
(BOP) statistics from STA as well as the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre
(PFTAC); nevertheless, data provision to the Fund continues with long delays.
The two main sources of statistical information are the Quarterly Bulletin of the National
Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT), and the annual and semi-annual budget reports from the
MOF. The country has been participating in the GDDS since May 30, 2006. The metadata
are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
(http://dsbb.imf.org/Applications/web/gdds/gddscountrycategorylist/?strcode=TON ).
Real Sector Statistics
Following PFTAC assistance in 2008 and 2009 a new series of national accounts was
released in June 2009. The new series retains a 2000/01 base year but has been revised to
improve coverage and estimation techniques. However, source data remains weak and needs
to be improved to allow a long overdue rebase of the national accounts.
The Consumer Price Index is based on a basket of goods and services from the 2000/01
Household Income and Expenditure Survey. Technical assistance was provided in 2008 on
the development of an import price index.
Labor market statistics are weak: employment statistics have not been compiled since 2003;
and average earnings statistics are not available.
Government Finance Statistics
The FY 2002/03 Budget Statement introduced a presentation of fiscal data compiled
according to the methodology of the 2001 Government Finance Statistics Manual. However,
improvements are still needed to ensure accurate and reliable fiscal data. Proper classification
of transactions is needed to permit reconciliation with monetary financing data. Lags in
updating the accounting system should be shortened. Published data are often subject to
significant revisions. No data are reported for publication in the IFS or GFS Yearbook.
External Sector Statistics
Official BOP statistics are compiled annually by the SD with long lags. Monthly trade
figures, derived from customs data, are available with a three-month lag. Unofficially, the
NRBT compiles monthly balance of payments statistics based on the Overseas Exchange
Transactions records of the banking system with a six-week lag. There are significant

12

differences between the BOP estimates compiled by the two agencies. Moreover, large errors
and omissions point to possible under recording of imports.
With PFTAC assistance in March 2009 the Statistics Department developed revised draft
BoP statistics and methodology and made recommendations for further improvements in
compilation techniques and source data. The MOF has put in place a system that provides
detailed information on official sector external disbursements and debt service.
Monetary and Financial Statistics
NRBT reports data for the central bank, other depository corporations, and monetary
aggregates using the standardized report forms (SRFs). These data were published for the
first time in the March 2008 issue of IFS and IFS Supplement on Monetary and Financial
Statistics. The NRBT will have to allocate resources to improve the quality of MFS by
obtaining source data suitable for compilation of the SRFs in line with the recommendations
of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual.

Statement by Mr. Matthew Davies, Staff Representative on Tonga
Executive Board Meeting 09/92
September 4, 2009

1.
This statement provides additional information that has become available since the
circulation of the staff report. The information does not change the
thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Monetary policy has recently been eased. The change follows discussions between
the National Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT) and the banking association concerning the
effect of worsening economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to continue servicing
their bank loans. As a result, the NRBT announced that with effect from August 4, 2009, the
Statutory Reserve Deposit (SRD) ratio would be reduced from 10 to 5 percent in order to
reduce lending rates and ease the financial difficulties of borrowers. The change was also
accompanied by agreement that the banks would voluntarily disclose the effective interest
rate on their loans and reduce exchange rate spreads on telegraphic transfers.
3.
The authorities have recently announced agreement on the further large
infrastructure loan. The Prime Minister recently announced that in principle agreement had
been reached with China on the US$45 million infrastructure loan from China (referenced in
paragraph 10 of the staff report). When finalized the loan is expected to be on similar terms
to the US$60 million loan for the reconstruction of Nuku’alofa.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with
Tonga
On September, 4, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Tonga.1
Background
Tonga’s recovery from the economic contraction and domestic political disturbance of
2006/072 has been halted by the global economic slowdown. Following a contraction of
1¾ percent in 2006/07, the economy rebounded by 2½ percent the following year,
leading up to the coronation of a new king in August 2008. However, high international
food and fuel prices followed by the global slowdown and tightening domestic financial
conditions slowed growth and put pressure on international reserves.
Growth is estimated to have been less than ½ percent in 2008/09. Solid growth in the
service and construction sectors was largely offset continued poor performance in
manufacturing and agriculture sectors. Inflation, which reached 12 percent in mid-2008
as the economy struggled with high international prices, has moderated to around
2 percent.
Remittances fell by around 15 percent in 2008/09, reflecting the recessions in the two
main source economies—the United States and New Zealand. The associated decline
in import demand and declines in import prices reduced external pressures while
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return
to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities.

Fiscal year begins in July.

2
unusually strong investment and capital flows in the latter half of 2008, both private and
official, allowed reserves to increase slightly to over 4 months of import cover.
Fiscal revenue fell considerably below budget targets in 2008/09 as a result of
reductions in tax rates, slowing growth and declines in imports. Tight expenditure control
and significant increases in grants, however, enabled the government to deliver a fiscal
surplus that will be used to establish a disaster and natural emergency fund. The
2009/10 budget aims to again achieve a surplus, excluding reconstruction borrowing, by
improving revenue performance while raising public sector pay and increasing
expenditure on infrastructure and social services. Loan-financed reconstruction of the
central business district will, however, lead to an overall deficit of around 3 percent of
GDP.
External debt declined to around 29 percent of GDP in 2007/08 as a result of fiscal
consolidation and reduced donor disbursements. Initial drawdowns of a large
reconstruction loan saw debt increase to around 31 percent of GDP at the end of
2008/09. Further loan utilization will see debt levels rise further in coming years.
2008/09 was a turbulent year for the financial sector. Following a period of rapid lending
growth and tight liquidity, broad money began contracting in 2009 as deposits were
withdrawn in response to worsening economic conditions. Credit growth halted as the
Reserve Bank tightened monetary policy and commercial banks increased their lending
requirements in response to an increase in bad loans. Interest rates have declined from
their mid-2008 highs, but remain high. The exchange rate, which is a trade-weighted
peg, appreciated around 6 percent in real effective terms during 2008.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors observed that Tonga’s recovery from the 2006 disturbances has
been hampered by global and domestic economic conditions. Remittances are declining
in the wake of the global downturn and domestic banks are curtailing credit in response
to a build-up of bad loans. Downward risks arise from the probability of a sharper-thanprojected decline in remittances.
Directors noted that the authorities’ ability to respond to the downturn is limited. Fiscal
policy is constrained by high public debt, while the scope for monetary expansion is
circumscribed by relatively low international reserves. Against this background, Directors
endorsed the authorities’ strategy of pursuing reconstruction while aiming for a small
surplus in the non-reconstruction budget, and relaxing reserve requirements to ease
pressures on domestic borrowers. Continued donor support will be important to help the
authorities address the difficult challenges ahead.
Directors cautioned that revenue shortfalls may compromise the planned stimulus
spending. They encouraged the authorities to devote greater attention to improving
revenue enforcement, especially customs collections. The government should also
prioritize expenditures carefully, and consider a more gradual implementation of the

3
planned public wage increases. Directors welcomed the authorities’ contingency plan, in
the event that revenues are lower than budgeted.
Directors noted that the large reconstruction loan will place a heavy debt burden on the
country, which could be shouldered only if the loan-financed expenditure proves
productive; GDP continues to grow over the medium term; and the budget remains
balanced. Directors urged the authorities to vet proposed reconstruction projects
carefully, approving only economically viable ventures. Financing for future infrastructure
investments should rely as much as possible on domestic revenues and grants.
With reserves likely to remain in the lower part of the Reserve Bank’s comfort zone,
Directors encouraged the authorities to maintain a cautious monetary policy stance and
to stand ready to tighten should credit growth re-accelerate and the outlook for reserves
and inflation deteriorate. Directors noted the staff’s assessment that the exchange rate
remains consistent with external stability and that projected external current account
deficits are sustainable. They welcomed the authorities’ intention to use the adjustment
band within the current exchange rate peg if needed to safeguard reserve coverage.
Directors encouraged the authorities to make further efforts to enhance banking
supervision to prevent a further deterioration in banks’ balance sheets. Regulation will
need to remain vigilant to prevent further surges in high-risk lending.
Directors underscored the importance of structural reform for improving growth and
raising living standards, guided by the authorities’ Strategic Planning Framework. They
congratulated the authorities on the recent steps to rationalize public enterprises, and
encouraged them to make further progress in this area and to sustain efforts to improve
the business climate.
Directors recommended strengthening the statistical framework, noting that the recent
advances in compilation need to be matched by improvements in the underlying data.

and Mr. Dicky Kartikoyono, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
Executive Board Meeting 09/92
September 4, 2009

Introduction
On behalf of our Tongan authorities, we would like to express our gratitude to the mission
team for the useful and constructive policy advice during their recent visit. Our Tongan
authorities value this year’s Article IV consultation during a time when the global economy
is undergoing a severe economic strain. They broadly agree with the staff’s assessment and
appreciate its useful recommendations. The candid informative discussion has provided a
clear perspective and policies’ direction to the authorities to boost the Tongan economic
performance over the medium term. Like other economies, Tonga has been suffering from
the global turmoil as has been elaborated well by the staff report.
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
Before the global economic crisis had sparked in the last quarter of 2008, Tonga’s economy
has just started its buoyant economic activities and been on a path of recovery. The main
drivers of resurgence in the aftermath of November 2006 riots have been tourism and
construction. Tourist numbers have shown strong growth over the last two years, and up until
the first quarter of 2009, accounted for nearly five times the export revenue for merchandise
imports. The construction activity, particularly in the tourism related sector has restored
swiftly, which associated with increased construction for the retail, financial services and
infrastructure sectors should provide the catalyst for growth in the future. While less obvious
in terms of measurable growth, the benefits of domestic agriculture products as import
substitution have also started to gain much wider recognition.
By having the above factors in perspective, the Ministry of Finance projection suggests the
GDP will recover as much as 1.3 percent, from around 0.4 percent in 2008/09 to 1.7 percent
in 2009/10. Not only would continued tourism growth underpin these dynamics, but also
donor supported government reconstruction loans and increased government spending would
be expected to contribute largely in fueling further momentum to boost growth.
Notwithstanding, the authorities realized that the fallout of global economic crisis on the
Tongan economy has been unpreventable, albeit of its less reliance on global capital. As
pointed out evidently by staff, the first and the foremost channel of external disruptions is
through remittances income. With half of the population living and having worked outside
the country, chiefly in United States, New Zealand and Australia, our authorities have been

2

cognizant that the decline in remittances will pose significant challenges for Tonga. On the
other hand, expansions of seasonal workers’ scheme to Australia and in New Zealand could
provide some support.
Inflation, as in many economies, has been volatile over the past year, heavily influenced by
international food and fuel prices. Tonga’s high dependence on fuel and food imports, which
dominate the CPI basket, has contributed significantly to the large movement in inflation. At
the end of June 2009, annual headline inflation fell significantly to 1.2 percent from
12 percent in mid 2008. Annual average inflation has been dropping fast to below 6% in June
2009, the lowest level since October 2007. A weakening New Zealand dollar against Tongan
Pa’anga (TOP) contributed to restrain the surge of imported products, particularly food, and a
rapid fall in the global oil prices brought domestic fuel prices down remarkably. Higher food
and fuel prices also contributed to a widening current account deficit in 2008, though the
sales of government assets, private capital and donor inflows have provided sufficient
financing to enable foreign reserves to remain at a comfortable level (above 4 months of
import cover).
Meanwhile, the government fiscal position for 2008/2009 was originally framed to provide
an appropriate balance of budget spending and revenue to boost the economic performance.
In this connection, our Tongan authorities have showed their strong determination to
facilitate reconstruction and conduct structural reforms, particularly in the area of budget
policy to restore business confidence and promote macro stability. On the other hand, they
realized that the country’s remittance income and imports have significantly lowered in the
last quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009, thus these factors have driven trade and
consumption taxes down below the target. In respond to this unfavorable development, the
Tongan government has been ready to dampen the 2008/09 expenditures by around
30 percent, mainly by cutting down less prioritized government expenses and purchases as
well as rescheduling the payments. This policy response is expected to result a minor overall
deficit of around 1.25 percent of GDP.
Fiscal Policy
While Tonga’s economic outlook has been clouded by high uncertainties, it is also
anticipated in a contingency plan that revenue collection could be lower than the proposed
budget, due to significant shortfalls on sales and trade taxes from the slowdown of economic
and trade activity. Hence, the authorities increased focus on continuing structural reforms is
key to strengthen the country's budget position. These include simplifying procedures for
starting business and investment, improving certainty in land ownership and leasing,
intensifying further transparency of the newly completed fiscal revenue reforms, and
privatizing an adequate amount of the government shares in the designated public

3

enterprises. Should revenues prove stronger than staff’s estimates, then this would provide
greater fiscal space to adopt additional and well-targeted measures.
Our authorities' are also cognizant that their economic programs which have already been in
place since the beginning of this year to facilitate an orderly rebalancing of the economy to
the adverse external environment, mitigating negative effects on growth and strengthening
social safety net to the poor need to be implemented effectively to resist further GDP
contraction in coming years. Hence, the government assumes the real GDP growth will fall
slightly from 2.6 percent in 2008 to 1.7 percent in 2009, and rebound thereafter by an
average of around 2%, though staff report suggests the risks of this forecast are slightly tilted
to the downside.
Despite the financial pressure from the global economy which has affected the government’s
revenue collection capacity, the government designed a fiscal stimulus package which will be
implemented in the 2009/10 financial year to counter any adverse impacts of the global
downturn. Accordingly, the budget that was submitted to Parliament at the end of June 2009
envisaged an estimated surplus of 17.4 million pa’anga in 2009/10 resulting from total
revenues and grants of 220.1 million pa’anga compared to 202.7 million in expenditure. This
surplus will be utilized to pay off external debts of 12.3 million pa’anga, leaving a balance of
5.1 million pa’anga for infrastructure projects that are under construction.
To finance this estimated outturn, the government has lined up funding from extra external
grants and concessional loans, amounted to 47.9 million pa’anga in cash and 39.4 million
pa’anga in kind, which reflect continued donors’ support for Tonga development program.
Australia, New Zealand, European Union and the Asian Development Bank are Tonga’s
major donor partners. The Tongan authorities are also grateful and fortunate to receive
assistance from the People’s Republic of China including the concessional loan for the
reconstruction of Nuku’alofa Central Business District (CBD). Other projects such as roads
and drainage project are seen as projects that require a high local labor component leading to
job creation and generating further economic activities in the Tongan economy.
Implementation of the 2009/10 budget spending therefore will be prudent, and the authorities
stand ready to consider additional measures if needed to achieve the budgetary objectives. In
its fiscal strategy of 2009/10, the government will focus and fortify their efforts in creating a
wider fiscal space by intensifying collection of reformed revenue bills which include the
Customs, Excise and Income Tax, reducing government purchases of goods and services and
improving further the effectiveness of public expenditure reforms. These measures would be
imperative to finance the increase in spending on wages and salaries that has been approved
last year, as well as much needed higher capital expenditures.

4

Monetary Policy
As prices of major components of CPI, oil and food products, remain relatively below the
level of 2008, the core and headline inflation will likely decelerate in 2009. The National
Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT) has started to ease monetary policy in mid-2009 by ceasing
the issue of NRBT notes and reducing Statutory Required Reserves to 5 percent from
10 percent. This easing move was mainly based on the outlook for the level of foreign
reserves as well as the benign environment of inflation. However, they are aware that they
would have to closely monitor credit growth to avoid the credit blow out that occurred in
previous years and to protect the external balance.
External Sector
Despite the vain performance in the main export products of Tonga – squash and fish,
attributed to limited market access, volatile market prices, lack of new technology, lack of
cargo space in the airlines, and harsh weather condition, new initiatives are undertaken by the
government to boost this sector including export diversification and gradual development of
new markets.
Historically there has been a strong correlation between the level of remittances and the level
of imports. The slowdown in remittances has resulted in a lower consumer import.
Normally, remittances have represented 85% of imports, but it has been declining since last
year. Moreover, there are likely to be substitution effects with Australian and New Zealand
tourists switching from long-haul to short-haul destinations that would favor the Pacific
region. Tonga may also benefit from a redirection of tourists, given the recent political
disruptions and adverse weather conditions in some of Tonga’s key competitor markets. To
date, tourist arrivals have held up well. These factors may put downward pressure on the
current account and narrow the deficit of Tongan balance of payments during these times of
low remittances.
At the current juncture, foreign reserves have accumulated significantly equivalent to
5.4 months of imports at the end of July 2009, owing mainly to private capital inflow from
the sales of government assets and capital injection into the banking system. The import
payments were also in downward trend and are expected to remain at lower level as long as
oil and food prices remain constant at the current level. Despite the threats of lower
remittances, the NRBT has committed to maintain foreign reserves at an adequate level.
Meanwhile, Nominal Effective Exchange Rate has appreciated this year, mostly due to the
pa'anga significant appreciation against NZD and AUD, as these two currencies depreciated
swiftly when the global financial market has deleveraged its position to safe haven
instruments. In its policy framework, the authorities aim to maintain the exchange rate

5

flexibility around +/- 5% band supported by monetary operation to secure its
competitiveness, sustainable macro stability and economic growth. The authorities broadly
agree with the staff’s assessment on the exchange rate and assure the Board members that the
existing adjustment band would be used to maintain external stability. The authorities would
also appreciate the Fund’s assistance on reviewing the exchange rate basket.
Financial Sector
The authorities welcome staff’s finding that the banking system remain struggling to
consolidate their financial position after the sharp increase of impaired loans last year, while
the NRBT will seek to further enhance its supervisory framework. Maintaining banking
system stability remains a key priority and the NRBT will closely monitor bank balance
sheets for signs of deteriorating asset quality in the wake of the reinforced loan assessment
criteria during the last two years.
As a result, significant amount of bad debts were mandated to be charged in their provisions
and their profit has dropped quite substantially. Two out of three commercial banks, which
are foreign owned, currently, are running on reasonable amount of losses in their book, while
the level of their capital remains sufficient. This prudential measure on account of the
credibility of foreign banks is key to promote the financial stability and to ensure healthy
lending process going forward. Meanwhile, the only domestic owned bank, Tonga
Development Bank, is quite successful in managing its operation and merit a commendation
since it has been able to maintain its profitable position for quite some time with a lesser
support from the government.
On the supervision side, the NRBT has enhanced its banking supervision framework by
issuing six new prudential statements to ensure strong risk management. In addition, banks
compliance will be monitored offsite and more frequent onsite visits are planned to monitor
the build up of bad loans. The authorities are cognizant of the need to build capacity in the
banking supervision department. As most of the bank supervision staff are all new with less
than 1 year experience, the authorities would continue to require technical assistance for
capacity building.
Other developments
The China reconstruction program, which has already been delayed since the last couple of
years, is projected to ramp up this year. At this point, the authorities have already been able
to disburse quite a significant amount of loan from this program and to secure additional
concessional loan amounted of USD 45 millions for infrastructure development recently.
However, given the unprecedented postponement in the recent past, it is realized that the
disbursement schedule needs to be modified to avoid the increase in risk of debt distress.

6

Correspondingly, the Chinese government has always been supportive and vigilant to discuss
and renegotiate the term of loan as the economic condition remains challenged by growing
uncertainties.
This program will apparently become the main inducement of economic growth, while the
development in infrastructure and the enhancement of facilities would always be imperative
to facilitate new investment and business in Tonga. However, as the materials and services
related to this activity are ostensible to be mostly imported from China, there is such a risk
that growth effect will be fairly limited in the short-term perspective. The authorities are
mindful that this increasing tendency of import due to this reconstruction program will also
influence the Tongan foreign reserves, especially in term of the months of import ratio, as the
trade account will ramp up. Looking forward, it is acknowledged that the Tongan authorities
need to improve their debt and reserves management capabilities in managing such a longterm program loan.
Final Remark
In conclusion, the authorities are aware of the challenges and the significant risks under the
current global economic crisis. The road ahead will be challenging but with strong political
will, and assistance from other countries, and multilateral institutions, the authorities are
hopeful of addressing some of Tonga’s challenges and moving the economy forward.
Finally, our Tongan authorities express their sincere gratitude to the Pacific Financial
Technical Assistance Center (PFTAC), the Fund and the Bank more generally, for the
technical guidance received over the years.
