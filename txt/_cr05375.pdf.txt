EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Recent developments and prospects
Portugal confronts a difficult economic environment. Domestic demand is weak, external
competitiveness has been eroded, and the fiscal deficit needs to be reduced substantially over
the next four years. High levels of private indebtedness also cast a shadow over medium-term
prospects. Growth is unlikely to exceed ½–¾ percent this year and 1¼–1½ percent in 2006.
The authorities saw scope for a more robust medium-term recovery than did the staff, though
it was agreed that recovery would be gradual.
Key policy requirements
There was broad agreement between the authorities and the staff on the need for deficit
reduction based on credible expenditure control measures, and for structural reforms to
unlock Portugal’s growth potential.
Securing fiscal consolidation. The authorities plan to reduce the fiscal deficit from a
baseline of about 6½ percent of GDP this year (before recent measures) to 3 percent by 2008.
Medium-term adjustment would be based on three main pillars: (i) pension reform,
including a convergence of the rules governing public sector pensions to those prevailing for
private sector workers, which are less generous; (ii) further reforms to the pension system for
private sector workers; and (iii) reforms to modify the career path for civil servants and to
enhance public sector efficiency. Key elements of the strategy remain to be defined,
however, and the staff stressed the need to resolve these uncertainties as soon as possible.
Staff saw the overall pace of deficit reduction as being appropriate but argued for greater
expenditure containment measures this year. The authorities’ medium-term growth
projections appear optimistic, and the staff therefore noted that additional measures may be
needed to achieve the deficit targets in later years.
Strengthening competitiveness. Initiatives in this area include steps to improve general
education and vocational training; encourage research and development; strengthen
competition in product markets; and reduce red-tape and bureaucratic impediments to doing
business. Staff and the authorities disagreed on the priority to be accorded further labor
market reform, with the authorities arguing that in practice, labor markets were more flexible
than standardized measures would suggest.
Safeguarding the financial sector. Available indicators suggest that the financial sector has
been resilient during the slowdown. However, high indebtedness and risk concentrations,
especially to the real estate sector, are potential vulnerabilities. A more in-depth financial
sector review is expected under the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), to be
initiated in 2005.

I. OVERVIEW AND KEY ISSUES
1.
Portugal has yet to emerge from the slump that followed the bursting of the
euro-adoption bubble (Box 1). The euro-related drop in interest rates led to substantial
increases in consumption and investment, fueled by bank credit. A rise in primary fiscal
spending further fanned the flames of the expansion, and the current account deficit
ballooned, reaching 10 percent of GDP in 2000–01. Domestic demand growth slowed in
2001 and turned negative in 2002–03, as firms and households sought to work off the
imbalances of the boom years. The resulting sharp increase in the fiscal deficit led to a
violation of the SGP ceiling in 2001 that precluded a subsequent countercyclical fiscal policy
response. Cyclical difficulties have been compounded by worrying medium-term
developments, as productivity and competitiveness—whose weakness was masked by the
boom—have continued to slide. Per capita GDP relative to the euro-area average stands
barely above its level a decade earlier.
2.
The policy strategy to respond to the slowdown did not resolve underlying
macroeconomic imbalances (Box 2). Substantial one-off fiscal measures were to bring the
deficit within SGP limits while buying time for longer-term reforms to pay dividends.
However, the measures adopted—chiefly, an increase in the VAT rate and a freeze in public
sector wage increases—did not address in a sustainable manner the source of fiscal
problems: the 6 percent of GDP rise in current spending, especially social transfers and
wages, over the last 10 years. In addition, progress in the structural reform agenda has been
slow. As a result, Portugal confronts a difficult environment, with sizable fiscal and external
imbalances; a weak competitive position, especially within an enlarged EU; and high private
indebtedness that clouds macroeconomic prospects.
3.
Early elections in February 2005 led to the formation of the first single-party
majority government in a decade. The government’s reform proposals have engendered
strong opposition from some affected parties, however (particularly civil servants), and local
elections in October will provide a test of its support. Shortly after the conclusion of the
Article IV mission, Finance Minister Campos e Cunha resigned, and was replaced by
Fernando Teixeira dos Santos.
II. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
4.
A gradual domestic-demand driven recovery started last year, but was
reversed during the second half of 2004 amid ongoing concerns about competitiveness.
•

Real GDP rose 1.2 percent last year, but contracted in Q3 and Q4 on a quarterly
basis. Preliminary data show year-on-year GDP growth of 0.3 percent in the first half
of 2005.

-5-

Box 1. What Accounts for the Boom and Bust?
To some extent, the adjustment witnessed in Portugal can be interpreted as an
equilibrium phenomenon: a falling risk premium leads to an increase in investment and
wealth, an immediate jump in consumption, and a corresponding decline in savings.
The ensuing demand boom is met by higher imports and, because of rigidities and lags
in the domestic economy, a widening of the current account deficit. Self-correcting
forces would drive the subsequent adjustment, with domestic demand slowing and
domestic supply expanding as new investments come on-line.
However, other mechanisms were also at play that aggravated the boom and bust
pattern. Specifically, fiscal policy was mostly pro-cyclical in Portugal during the
upswing and relative unit labor cost growth was above the euro area average. Fagan
and Gaspar (2005) 1 point to other factors that could be at work, including
indivisibilities in investment and consumer durables that can make the initial burst in
demand especially front-loaded, and rigidities in labor and product markets that can
hinder the necessary adjustments of the real exchange rate and of real wages needed
later in the transition process, making the “slow down” phase of the transition longer
and more painful than otherwise.
In drawing lessons for new member states, Fagan and Gaspar (2005) and Constâncio
(2005)2 point to the need to ensure that fiscal policy follows a counter-cyclical path
during the upswing. While multipliers in a small open economy like Portugal are too
small to fully smooth the cyclical path, fiscal policy should (as, for example, in Spain)
at least avoid exacerbating upswings and downswings. Both studies also highlight the
need for strong banking system oversight, to ensure that rising private indebtedness
does not lead to financial sector weakness, and for sensible wage policies.

Box 2. Fund Policy Recommendations and Implementation
Fiscal policy. The Fund has called for fiscal consolidation through structural
expenditure measures, including civil service reform. While the fiscal deficit was held
below 3 percent of GDP in 2002–04, this was largely through one-off measures, and
the underlying deficit remained large. The Fund has also called for strengthening
budget planning and control and moving toward comprehensive multi-year budget
targets. Implementation has been delayed, but the authorities plan to make progress in
this area (¶16).
Population aging. The Fund has emphasized the need to proceed with further reforms
of aging-related spending with a view to securing fiscal solvency. Recent reforms to
health care and pensions have not prevented a steady build-up of aging-related
spending.
Structural policy. The Fund has called for steps to improve general education and
vocational training, and to encourage R&D. It has also stressed the need to strengthen
competition and flexibility in labor markets. A fully-independent competition authority
was established, but red-tape and bureaucratic impediments continue to hamper
investment. Reforms have improved labor market flexibility, though there is room for
progress (¶23 and ¶36).
Financial sector. The Fund has supported continued supervisory vigilance in light of
historically high private indebtedness and risk concentrations. The Fund has suggested
a review under the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), expected to be
initiated in 2005.
•

Private consumption has proven resilient, reflecting low interest rates and
lengthening tenors on bank lending, while investment and export growth remained
weak.

•

A variety of indicators point to continued erosion of Portugal’s competitive
position: the ULC- and CPI-based REER have appreciated steadily, the former owing
both to wage growth and stagnant productivity; export shares have fallen; FDI has
contracted; and employment has shifted from tradables to nontradables production. In
these circumstances, the current account deficit (excluding capital transfers) widened
to 7.2 percent of GDP last year.

•

The unemployment rate reached a seven-year high of 7.5 percent in 2005:Q1, falling
to 7.2 percent in 2005:Q2. Due to the widening output gap—estimated by staff at

about 2 percent of GDP—inflation moderated to just over 2 percent in the first half
of 2005.
5.
Short-term growth prospects were viewed as poor. Weak domestic demand and
continuing problems in the external sector meant that growth was unlikely to exceed
½–¾ percent this year and 1¼–1½ percent in 2006. Private consumption growth looked set
to slow as households worked off high indebtedness in the period ahead: at end-2004,
household debt stood at 118 percent of disposable income, about double its level of seven
years ago and well above the EU average (80 percent). Fiscal adjustment measures were also
likely to weigh on domestic demand growth. In addition, poor external competitiveness,
concerns about the domestic economy, and a desire by firms to continue strengthening their
balance sheets—indebtedness of the private nonfinancial corporate sector had largely
stabilized as a percentage of GDP since 2001—would constrain investment growth.
Meanwhile, the external sector would continue to contribute negatively to activity, with
export growth remaining sluggish in the near term, given the extent of recent competitiveness
losses.
6.
Inflation in 2005–06 was expected to remain moderate. Despite an increase in
the VAT rate that had come into effect on July 1―expected to increase inflation by about
¼ percentage point this year and slightly more in 2006—inflation was projected at about
2½ percent over the coming year and half, held down both by the large output gap and by
the increased penetration of imports.
7.
The external deficit was expected to widen this year. Excluding capital transfers,
staff projected the deficit would reach just over 8 percent of GDP in 2005, reflecting lower
real export growth, a terms-of-trade loss from oil prices, and still-high imports. The deficit
would continue to be financed by medium- and long-term bank borrowing.
8.
Staff and the authorities differed on the medium-term outlook. The authorities
saw output growth accelerating relatively rapidly over the medium term, rising to 2½ percent
by 2008, a full percentage point above estimated potential, and 3 percent by 2009. Staff took
a more cautious line, forecasting growth at around 2 percent in 2008–09, noting that—as
shown by experience elsewhere—reducing indebtedness and resolving competitiveness
problems could be a lengthy process, and that fiscal adjustment would weigh on growth (see
¶14). Moderate investment growth and budget consolidation should lead to a narrowing of
the current account deficit over the medium-term. Staff projections indicate, however, that
these developments alone would be insufficient to stabilize the external debt to GDP ratio
over next few years (Table 4). In addition to successful implementation of the deficit
reduction program, therefore, some increase in private savings—which both the staff and the
authorities anticipated—and an improvement in competitiveness will be necessary to prevent
substantial rises in external indebtedness. Fiscal adjustment and productivity-enhancing
structural reforms are therefore critical to ensuring long-term fiscal and external
sustainability.

III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
9.
Discussions focused on measures to ensure the sustainability of the fiscal
accounts and improve competitiveness. There was broad agreement on the need for deficit
reduction based on credible expenditure control measures, and for structural reforms to
unlock Portugal’s growth potential.
A. Fiscal Policy
10.
A mid-year audit commissioned by the new government projected a 2005 fiscal
deficit of about 6½ percent of GDP, absent new measures. The significant increase in the
forecast—the budget had called for a deficit of 2.8 percent—resulted in part from slowerthan-budgeted growth and from the exclusion of all one-off measures (which equaled nearly
1½ percent of GDP in the budget). However, the increase also reflected more realistic
estimates for certain expenditures (including health care, pensions and personnel) and nontax revenues than in the original budget, implying an increase in the structural deficit (net of
one-offs) of about 1¾ percent of GDP relative to the original budget and about 1¼ percent of
GDP relative to the 2004 outturn.
11.
In response, the authorities had announced a series of measures, mostly on the
revenue side, that are intended to reduce the deficit to 6.0 percent of GDP this year. In
July, the authorities increased the top VAT rate by 2 percentage points (to 21 percent), which
was expected to increase revenues by about 0.3 percent of GDP this year. Measures to reduce
tax evasion were also forecast to yield revenues of about 0.3 percent of GDP this year. The
authorities have also announced plans to introduce a new income tax bracket on annual
incomes exceeding €60,000 (bringing the top marginal rate to 42 percent) and increase fuel
and tobacco taxes, all with effect from 2006.
12.
The authorities and staff agreed that these measures would not address the
roots of Portugal’s fiscal difficulties. The authorities believed that previous consolidation
efforts had failed because they had not targeted the underlying causes of fiscal weakness:
persistent increases in spending on wages, pensions, and health care. Even when measures
had focused on these spending items, they had generally been ineffective. The authorities
pointed, for example, to recent public sector wage freezes, which had not prevented wage
drift arising from the system of automatic promotions in force in the civil service and—
because they did not apply to lower-paid workers—had contributed to increased compression
of the wage scale. Similarly, past pension reforms have had limited impact on the budget
because of generous grandfathering. Given the need for measures to ensure early progress in
reducing the deficit and limiting the growth of the debt stock, and the fact that expenditure
control measures would take time to yield benefits, the balance of adjustment measures in the
short term would tilt toward the revenue side. However, these measures were not intended to
substitute for more fundamental reforms on the spending side.

pensions and wages—would over

•

A convergence of the rules governing public sector pensions to those for private
sector workers, which are less generous. The system for public workers has been
closed to new entrants, and the retirement age for public employees would be raised
by six months annually over the next decade until it reached 65, the age for private
workers. Pension benefits for civil servants hired before 1993, which had been
exempted from a previous reform, would also be reduced.

•

Further reforms to the pension system for private sector workers to reduce costs and
ensure its long-run viability. A working group had been formed to evaluate options,
and its report is to be issued before end-year.

•

Reforms to enhance public sector efficiency and to modify the career path for civil
servants. As a temporary measure, the authorities had frozen the system of automatic
promotions, with the expectation that by end-2006 new rules would be in place that
would streamline career paths, allow for greater flexibility in allocating staff, and link
pay and promotions to performance. In addition, a policy of replacing only half of
departing civil servants would gradually reduce the size of the workforce. The
authorities were also planning to conduct ministry-level audits over the coming
months that would identify measures to enhance efficiency and reduce costs.

14.
The staff saw the overall pace of adjustment as broadly appropriate, but argued
for greater spending restraint in 2005 and noted that additional measures might be
needed in later years. Based on staff analytical work,1 deficit reductions of 1 percent of
GDP annually could reduce short-term growth by as much as ¾ percent. However, staff and
the authorities agreed that a rapid pace of deficit reduction would still have lower output

costs than a more protracted adjustment, including through credibility effects (Box 3). Staff
also concurred that the proposed adjustment path, and the front-loading of revenue measures,
was a reasonable compromise between more rapid deficit reduction and the fact that pension
and civil service reforms would take time to yield significant savings. The staff noted,
however, that the structural deficit net of one-off measures would still increase by about
¾ percent of GDP this year, and that the authorities’ revenue projections were based on a
relatively optimistic growth forecast (0.8 percent) and assume significant returns from tax
administration measures whose yield is difficult to predict. The mission therefore called for
greater expenditure control efforts this year, to contain the deterioration in the deficit and/or
provide a cushion against possible revenue shortfalls. From a medium-term perspective, the
staff argued that the program’s growth forecasts could prove optimistic, and that additional
measures (of up to ¾ percent of GDP by 2008) could therefore be needed to achieve the
deficit targets in later years.
15.
The authorities doubted there was scope for further expenditure containment in
2005, but were prepared to take additional measures as needed to achieve their deficit
targets. They believed that the expenditure ceilings in this year’s revised budget were
already quite tight, limiting the room for additional spending cuts. In any case, they thought
the main risk to the 2005 outcome came neither from central government spending nor from
lower revenues but from higher spending by regional and local governments, particularly in
light of elections scheduled for later this year. Reforming the system of local government
finances—which currently relieved local governments of the political burden associated with
increasing taxes and thus contained a significant inducement to spend—was therefore a high
priority, although changes would not be implemented this year. Staff noted that the
introduction of binding expenditure limits on local governments could be a viable reform
option. The authorities agreed with the mission that achieving the program’s headline
nominal deficit targets was critical to maximizing credibility, and they were therefore
prepared to take additional measures should they prove necessary.
16.
The mission also underscored the need to move quickly to clarify the unspecified
expenditure measures needed to achieve the 2006 deficit target to enhance the
credibility of the adjustment effort. About 0.9 percentage points of the targeted 1.5 percent
of GDP in deficit reduction will come from revenue measures already implemented or
announced, but spending cuts totaling about 0.6 percent of GDP are also called for in the
program, including from the pension and public administration reforms currently under
study. The authorities agreed that progress in these studies sufficient to ensure that the
impact of the reforms was incorporated in the 2006 budget would be critical. They also
agreed that anchoring the deficit targets in a multiyear budget framework would help

Box 3. Minimizing the Output Costs of Fiscal Adjustment
A number of studies have examined the link between the structure of fiscal adjustment
and its short-term impact on growth (see WP/02/208 and the Selected Issues paper).
These studies have found that so-called expansionary contractions have some common
characteristics:
•

Initial conditions matter. These include a large and persistent fiscal deficit,
high public debt, and difficult economic circumstances.

•

The pace and balance of measures also matter. Large and front-loaded
contractions and expenditure-based adjustments are less damaging to growth
than are backloaded, protracted, or revenue-based ones, as the former are more
effective in altering agents’ expectations.

•

Not all spending measures have the same impact. Cuts in current spending are
less damaging to growth than those to investment, in general. In particular, cuts
in the public wage bill—through wage restraint or reductions in employment—
can enhance external competitiveness by putting downward pressure on private
sector wages.

What does this literature tell us about the likely output costs of Portugal’s fiscal
adjustment? First, Portugal shares some initial conditions with countries that have
experienced expansionary contractions. However, Portugal’s participation in monetary
union means that two important

order to maximize any
confidence effects, however, it is critical that the remaining elements of the adjustment
package be clarified as rapidly as possible. Finally, the argument that plans to address
the public sector wage bill could have a positive impact on competitiveness is supported
by the strong correlation between public and private wages in Portugal.

strengthen fiscal discipline. As a first move, they planned to introduce with the 2006 budget
spending goals for the remainder of the legislature. To protect investment in public
infrastructure, they were seeking ways to increase Public-Private Partnerships in some
projects. The authorities were hesitant to prejudge the findings of the pension reform
commission, but the staff noted there could be scope to further reduce options for early
retirement and to limit the indexation of pension benefits.
17.
The authorities recognized that planned fiscal adjustments would be only the
first stage of a longer process to ensure sustainability. In particular, they agreed that over
the medium term a position of near budget balance was needed to create a cushion to absorb
the costs associated with population aging: staff simulations show that without additional
deficit reduction beyond 2009, the public debt would rise sharply over the medium term
(Box 4). An additional 3 percentage points of GDP of fiscal adjustment would therefore be
needed after 2008. The authorities noted, however, that some of this adjustment could come
from pension reforms to be undertaken as part of their current program, reducing the need for
new measures.
B. Enhancing Growth and Competitiveness
18.
The authorities and mission agreed that increasing labor productivity was key to
resuming income convergence and improving competitiveness. Labor utilization is
relatively high, as the employment rate and hours per worker are above the euro-area
average, but labor productivity has fallen to only 55 percent of that of the euro area over the
last few years. Some of the decline in labor productivity growth could reflect sectoral shifts
in the economy, a slowdown in capital deepening, or cyclical factors. Nonetheless, structural
reforms to correct deficiencies in product markets and the business environment were
recognized as being critical to restart the convergence process (Box 5).
19.
The promotion of R&D and IT was the centerpiece of the authorities’ program
to boost growth, but the need for more fundamental reforms was recognized. The
authorities noted that spending on R&D and IT was well below European averages and
believed that greater private investment in these areas could therefore stimulate growth. Staff
saw more fundamental reforms to enhance human capital and the returns to innovation as a
greater priority. Staff and the authorities agreed, however, that initiatives to promote
technological development were in any case unlikely to yield the maximum benefits without
measures to improve education, training, and the business environment.

Box 4. Fiscal Sustainability
By the staff’s estimate, even if the authorities’ current deficit-reduction targets are
realized, reforms equivalent to an additional 3 percent of GDP in budgetary savings
after 2008—enough to return the budget to structural balance before age-related
spending begins to accelerate rapidly early in the next decade—will be required to
ensure debt sustainability.
Under a baseline scenario in which the deficit is reduced to 3 percent of GDP by 2008,
but with no subsequent fiscal adjustment, simulations show the debt ratio more than
doubling to 140 percent of GDP over the next two decades and continuing to rise
thereafter. In an alternative scenario where structural balance is achieved by 2012,
following which non-age related spending is kept constant as a percentage of GDP, the
debt ratio declines steadily over the next four decades before beginning to rise modestly
near the end of the projection period. These scenarios do not, however, include the
impact of any pension reforms to be introduced as part of the authorities’ current
adjustment program.

growth—the annual increase in

trended downward. Part of this
decline reflects sectoral shifts in
the economy: the weight of the
services sector—where
productivity growth has been
relatively low—has increased in
recent years at the expense of the
manufacturing sector, where
productivity growth has been
more rapid. In addition, some of
the decline in labor productivity
growth during the second half of
the 1990s can be traced to a
slowdown in capital deepening.
Nevertheless, TFP growth has
also slowed, eventually turning
negative since 2000. The very
poor productivity performance of
the last few years could reflect
cyclical factors, but also possibly
a decline in the efficiency of
investment, particularly given
the rising share that has been
dedicated to real estate.

new curricula, increased emphasis on technical training, and closed (and consolidated) very
small schools. Reforms were also planned to increase teachers’ classroom time and to reduce
teacher rotation across schools. In addition, the authorities planned to increase incentives for
worker training, which is low by OECD standards.
21.
A number of initiatives were also underway to enhance competition, as high
costs in some key sectors were seen as a significant drain on the economy. The new
competition authority, created in March 2003, has begun operations, although its
effectiveness was constrained by Portugal’s slow legal system (see below). Introduction of
the unified electricity market with Spain had been delayed, but the authorities remained
committed to the project. Over time, this was expected to lead to a significant reduction in

- 22 -

electricity costs. Portugal was granted a derogation until 2007 to implement EU directives for
liberalizing the natural gas market, but the government has pledged to complete the process
before this deadline. Following the substantial privatization efforts over the last two decade,
the authorities saw limited room for further progress in this area.
22.
Problems with Portugal’s business environment were also seen as a major
impediment to investment. The World Bank’s Doing Business Indicators point to a number
of shortcomings, and the Bank’s recent review of governance ranked Portugal in the bottom
third of the EU in terms of both the market-friendliness of its regulatory environment and the
efficiency of its public service. The authorities pointed to a number of measures that had
been introduced to reduce bureaucratic impediments to investment, making it now possible to
create a new firm in only one day. In addition, the costs of compliance with the corporate tax
system had been reduced, including through enhanced use of the internet. Nevertheless,
investors continue to report concerns about considerable delays in the granting of permits
and licenses for new plants and products. The authorities acknowledged that the slow pace of
Portugal’s legal system was a concern, and they were working to address this issue.

23.
The authorities disputed international indicators pointing to high labor market
rigidities, arguing that markets displayed considerable de facto flexibility. A new labor
code adopted at end-2003 allowed for more flexible working hours, facilitated the
reallocation by firms of labor across regions, and revised collective bargaining procedures
(with the introduction of expiry clauses, and more flexibility at the firm level with respect to
rules for fixed-term contracting and dismissal). Experience with the new code was, however,
too limited to allow definitive statements about its effectiveness. They stressed that while
legal restrictions on individual dismissals might be relatively strict, restrictions on collective
dismissals—which they felt were more important for facilitating the flow of workers to more
productive sectors and achieving a restructuring of the economy—were less burdensome
(though, the staff noted, still above average). Moreover, extensive use of fixed-term contracts
and self-employment allowed firms to adjust employment in response to economic
developments. Accordingly, further labor market flexibilization was not a priority. The staff
argued, however, that fixed-term contracts and questionable self-employment were poor
substitutes for fundamental reform, creating a segmented labor market and likely
contributing to the low level of on-the-job training.

C. Financial Sector Issues
24.
Private sector loan growth continued to outpace income growth in 2004. While
growth of bank credit to enterprises slowed, loans to households continued to expand at a
rapid pace, with mortgage lending rising at double-digit rates. As a result, the private sector
credit-to-GDP ratio continued to increase, reaching about 144 percent―the highest value in
the EU.2 The authorities noted, however, that owing to low interest rates and the extension of
tenors by banks, the debt service burden for households had remained moderate. They also
emphasized that the increase in indebtedness reflected in large part improved access to
mortgage credit for a growing number of households, particularly younger ones and those
with lower levels of formal education.
25.
The financial sector has proven resilient to the economic downturn. Bank
profitability has remained solid, as the declining contribution of net interest income has been
partially offset by other sources of income (such as fees and commissions) and cost-cutting.
Capitalization has improved, reflecting higher growth of own funds, although the Tier I ratio
is lower than elsewhere in the euro area. Liquidity has improved, with assets exceeding
liabilities at tenors up to three months (on a remaining maturity basis) and gaps narrowing at
other short-term maturities, owing to securitization transactions and greater reliance on
international capital markets, instead of the interbank market, for funding. Despite the
economic slowdown, NPLs (both as a percentage of gross loans and in levels) have remained
low, due to favorable interest rates, significant write-offs, and improved risk management.
Notwithstanding significant consolidation over the last decade, competition remains strong
(Box 6). The financial soundness of the insurance sector has strengthened, owing to a
combination of higher premiums in some categories, positive investment yields, slower
growth in claims, and rationalization of personnel costs.
26.
The authorities nevertheless recognized vulnerabilities arising from the high
levels of corporate and household debt. In addition, a high share of loans was at floating
interest rates, and loans were concentrated across sectors (real estate loans account for about
60 percent of banks’ total loan portfolio) and enterprises (about 6 percent of borrowers holds
about 80 percent of bank credit). Therefore, a sharp drop in growth or rise in unemployment
or interest rates could impair loan quality and hamper bank profitability.
27.
Progress has been achieved in preparing the financial system for changes in
accounting and prudential frameworks. The impact of the application of IFRS standards
will be significant but smoothed over time. According to preliminary estimates by the Bank
of Portugal, unrealized losses in the investment portfolio of the four largest banking groups,
calculated by applying the IFRS rules, amounted to €445 million in 2004 (2.9 percent of their
2

At end-2004, household debt was 118 percent of disposable income, well above the EU
average of 80 percent, and non-financial enterprises’ debt was 98 percent of GDP.

own funds). These losses, however, can in some cases be recognized for prudential purposes
over a period up to 2010. In preparation for Basle II, the central bank has intensified its
oversight of risk management practices by banks.
Box 6. The Portuguese Banking Sector
Portugal experienced significant bank consolidation over the last decade. Between
1995 and 2004, the number of credit institutions declined from 233 to 197, mainly due
to mergers and acquisitions. 1 Typical market structure indicators, such as the market
share of the largest institutions or the Herfindhal-Hirshman index suggest a
concentrated market structure for the Portuguese banking industry.
Yet, as discussed in a Selected Issues
paper, competitive conditions in the
Portugal: H-statistics
banking sector do not seem to have
been adversely affected. The Panzar
and Rosse H statistic, which relates
changes in a firm’s revenues to
changes in input costs—shows that,
although conditions of monopolistic
competition prevail, there is some
evidence that competition improved
over 1998–2003 period. In particular,
competition seems to be more intense
among larger banks, as smaller ones may have been able to carve out niches for
themselves. Cross-country studies suggest bank competition in Portugal compares
favorably with other euro-area countries.

D. Other Issues
28.
As a relatively small, open economy, trade issues are of considerable
importance to Portugal. The textile sector has been significantly affected by the
elimination of quotas under the Multi Fiber Agreement. The authorities noted, however, that
liberalization had occurred in a context of a significant restructuring of the textile industry
that had been ongoing for some time: between 2000 and 2004 employment in the industry
had already fallen by about 70,000. The authorities stressed that putting the Doha round of
trade negotiations firmly on track remained a high priority. Portugal’s official development
assistance as a percentage of GNI has remained lower than in the majority of advanced
economies.

- 28 -

29.
According to the authorities, the AML/CFT legislation is consistent with EU
directives and FATF recommendations. A mutual evaluation by FATF will take place in
January 2006.
30.
A number of innovations are underway to improve the quality of statistical
data (Appendix II). Revisions of quarterly employment data are being undertaken that will
facilitate the assessment of productivity developments. In addition, the authorities were in the
process of rebasing the national accounts data to 2000. Improvements were also underway in
the series on industrial production prices and import prices.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
In an unfavorable context marked by large fiscal and external imbalances,
slow growth, and a weak competitive position, the challenge is to create the conditions
to restart Portugal’s per capita income convergence as soon as possible. Doing so will
require sustainable fiscal adjustment and measures to improve product and labor markets,
enhance the business environment, and strengthen human capital development. The
authorities’ policy outlines in these areas point in the right direction, but early action in
implementing them will be key to building confidence and credibility.
32.
The authorities’ fiscal strategy correctly emphasizes medium-term expenditure
containment and sets an appropriate pace of adjustment. Steady rises in the public wage
bill and in pension spending in recent years are at the heart of current fiscal difficulties, and
the authorities’ intention to focus on these items is well-founded. The decision largely to
abandon one-off measures is also appropriate, as they have tended to obscure the true state of
the public finances and to add to budget pressure in subsequent years. The planned pace of
adjustment, with the deficit falling to 3 percent of GDP by 2008, strikes a balance between
the need to make rapid progress in reducing the deficit and the focus on longer-term reforms.
However, the authorities should seek to contain spending in 2005, both to limit the
deterioration in the fiscal balance this year and to provide a cushion should revenues fall
short of projected levels. Over the medium term, the growth forecasts underlying the
authorities’ plans may be optimistic. The authorities’ willingness to take additional
measures—ideally on the expenditure side—if needed to achieve the deficit targets,
including the objective of observing the Maastricht deficit criterion by 2008, is therefore
welcome.
33.
Nevertheless, one consequence of the focus on medium-term measures is that
adjustment in 2005 has come from revenue measures, while expenditure consolidation
has yet to commence. This is true in part because a number of key elements of the
authorities’ program are still being defined, including reforms of the public administration
and of the retirement system for private sector workers. The definition and implementation of
these bedrock spending reforms is essential to distinguish the current adjustment effort from
previous, unsuccessful attempts at durable fiscal consolidation, and to maximize the
credibility of the government’s program. Progress in these areas sufficient to allow them to
be reflected in the 2006 budget will therefore be critical.

- 29 -

34.
The fiscal adjustment planned for the next four years is but the first—albeit
critical—stage of a longer process of deficit reduction. The looming rise in pension and
health care spending from population aging underscores the need to find durable measures to
improve the quality and efficiency of public expenditure. Greater use of Public-Private
Partnerships could help raise spending efficiency, but care will be needed to ensure that these
transactions involve an appropriate transfer of risk to the private sector, that contracts and
associated liabilities are recorded transparently (including in budget documents), and that
commitments to make payments over time to private partners do not unduly constrain future
budget flexibility. Reforms to local government financing arrangements—possibly including
binding expenditure limits—could also help reduce medium-term fiscal pressures.
35.
Planned structural reforms to improve labor productivity are essential to
income convergence. The impact of initiatives to promote R&D and IT spending is likely to
be enhanced by ongoing and planned reforms to the education and training system, to the
business environment, and to the competitive environment. In this regard, recent measures to
reduce the time required to open a new business are welcome, but reducing delays in the
legal system and accelerating the process of granting licenses and permits should be a high
priority. There is also a need to enhance competition in key sectors like telecommunications
and transportation, where relatively high costs undermine competitiveness.
36.
Additional steps to raise labor market flexibility are also needed. Restrictions
on collective dismissals exceed the EU average, and those on individual dismissals are the
tightest in the OECD. Extensive use of temporary contracts and dubious self-employment to
evade the restrictions creates a segmented labor market, with one class of workers enjoying
strong employment protection and a second subject to considerable job instability. Not only
do such conditions raise equity concerns, they also hamper productivity growth by slowing
the movement of protected workers from low-growth sectors to higher-growth ones. They
may also contribute to the low level of on-the-job training.
37.
The financial sector has proven resilient to the slowdown, but high debt levels
and concentrated bank lending remain a risk. Banks have remained adequately
capitalized and liquid, profitability has been solid, and the quality of banks’ loan portfolios
has remained broadly stable. Potential vulnerabilities arise mainly from high household and
corporate debt and the concentration of loans across sectors and enterprises. The authorities
should continue to monitor developments carefully. The authorities’ decision to undertake a
Financial Sector Assessment Program this year is welcome, as it will afford an opportunity
for a more detailed review of the financial sector.
38.
Portugal is encouraged to actively support progress under the Doha round and to
increase its ODA toward the UN target level.
39.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12month cycle.

1/ Refers to gross external debt and assumes growth at historical (2000-2005) average.
2/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms,
g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
3/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0)
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Assuming no improvements in external competitiveness and priviate savings over the projection period.
7/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and both noninterest current account and
nondebt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels of the last projection year.

Real GDP growth (in percent)

1/ The public sector refers to general government. Uses the Staff's growth scenario for 2005-10.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of
foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.

Real GDP growth (in percent)
Average nominal interest rate on public debt (in percent) 8/
Average real interest rate (nominal rate minus change in GDP deflator, in percent)

APPENDIX II

Portugal: Statistical Issues
1.
Data provision to the Fund is adequate for surveillance purposes. Portugal
subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS), and the relevant metadata
have been posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. Portugal has taken a
flexibility option regarding the timeliness of reporting wages. Portugal’s publication policy is
characterized by a high degree of openness and with extensive use of the Internet. The Bank
of Portugal, Ministry of Finance, and National Statistics Office (INE) have several websites
with long- and short-term economic indicators and data.
2.
Notwithstanding some recent improvements, considerable statistical weaknesses
continue to hamper an assessment of economic developments.
3.
Real sector statistics were improved in the fall of 2000, when INE published a full
set of national accounts based on ESA95 methodology, including quarterly GDP estimates.
The authorities are in the process of rebasing national account statistics to 2000. However,
statistical weaknesses remain and the Bank of Portugal continues to produce separate
estimates of the annual national accounts. Shortcomings in timely and high quality monthly
and quarterly data on output, employment, and total wage compensation hamper the
monitoring of within-year developments in the labor market. Unemployment data also suffer
from statistical problems caused, inter alia, by frequent revisions to the measurement of
unemployment and sampling rotations.
4.
Fiscal sector data have undergone a number of revisions during the transition to
ESA95, sizably altering revenues and expenditures and hampering comparisons across years.
Some progress was made and the 2001–04 budgets were presented fully consistent with
recent changes in national and fiscal accounting methodology. Intra-year budget data is
available only on a cash basis. In 2002 INE started to publish data for the Social Security
Fund on a monthly basis with 45 days delay and in 2003 for Autonomous Funds on a
quarterly basis with 75 days delay. Except for the local and general government, data broadly
meet the SDDS timeliness standards. A project is underway concerning quarterly general
government statistics on an accrual basis, but no firm timetable is in place for publication of
the data.
5.
Trade and balance of payments data are provided according to the IMF’s Fifth
Edition of the Balance of Payments Manual. Although the external trade data meet the
timeliness standards, frequent and sizeable revisions hamper their usefulness. The portfolio
investment collection system has a simplified threshold of €500 million, which is relatively
high in comparison with many EU countries. The authorities estimate however, that only
about 2 percent of transactions are not captured on a monthly basis by this threshold, and that
this reporting simplification does not significantly hamper the quality of the monthly balance
of payments. Moreover, they indicated that all transactions below this threshold are included
in the first release of the annual balance of payments data, and the monthly numbers are
revised accordingly.

Portugal: Table of Common Indicators Required for Surveillance

- 39 APPENDIX II

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
October 14, 2005
1.
This statement provides information that has become available since the
issuance of the Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation. The new information
does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Short-term indicators are mixed, but give no indication that a sustained recovery
is in the works. Consumer confidence posted its fourth consecutive monthly decline in
September, although confidence indicators for the manufacturing industry and the services
sector were stable (albeit at low levels). Industial production rose a surprising 1.9 percent in
August (month-on-month, seasonally adjusted), but the Bank of Portugal’s coincident
indicator of economic activity for that month deteriorated slightly.
3.
According to preliminary estimates, harmonized consumer prices rose
2.5 percent year-on-year in August. Core inflation, which excludes energy components and
fresh unprocessed food products, was 1.8 percent. The gap between the Portuguese and the
euro-zone annual inflation rates was 0.3 percentage points in August.
4.
Portugal's governing Socialist party was defeated in countrywide local elections
held October 8. The opposition Social Democrats won a majority of municipalities (158)
compared to 109 won by the Socialists, and 41 won by other parties. The government has
pledged to continue with its reform program despite the setback.

Statement by Arrigo Sadun, Executive Director for Portugal
and Luis Saramago, Advisor to Executive Director
October 14, 2005
We would like to start by thanking staff, on behalf of the authorities, for their comprehensive
analysis and constructive attitude during these consultations. The well-balanced report stands
broadly in line with the authorities’ own views and priorities, while the Selected Issues paper
is always welcome as a thought-provoking exercise.
Key points
•

The Portuguese economy has been going through a period of slower growth and
higher unemployment for the last few years, as it adjusts to the aftermath of a boom
induced by first-wave EMU accession and to enhanced external competition.

•

Recovering the growth momentum and thus advancing the long-term goal of real
convergence towards the EU average will critically hinge on two major challenges:
sustained fiscal consolidation and increased competitiveness.

•

The new government, backed in Parliament by a strong single-party majority, stated
its commitment to address those issues, through an appropriate medium-term fiscal
strategy and a vast array of structural measures, already taken or under preparation.

•

Fiscal policy, put forward in the Stability and Growth Program recently endorsed by
the EU Council, aims for a deficit below 3 percent of GDP in 2008 and further less
beyond, focusing on expenditure restraint and refraining from one-off measures.

•

Structural action on several fronts – from the business environment to education and
IT use – will seek to improve the country’s competitive position, building on pillars
such as the robust banking system, further strengthened in recent years.

Overview
After a recession in 2003, the Portuguese economy recovered somewhat in 2004, although
with declining impetus from mid-year onwards. Accordingly, unemployment rose further,
while inflation abated and macroeconomic imbalances intensified. Indeed, the contribution of
net external demand to growth was negative, reversing the favorable trend of previous years
and leading to an increase of external indebtedness. The recovery was therefore based on
domestic demand, particularly private consumption, fueled by an increase of disposable
income and a rise in private indebtedness, as real interest rates remained very low.
Developments in 2005 confirm a pattern of slow expansion, with subdued export growth, in a
context of enhanced competition from inside the enlarged EU and other emerging countries.
Such a pattern tends to be reinforced by the rise and increased volatility of world oil prices,
as well as by the need for fiscal consolidation. This latter, together with wage moderation, is

-2critical to lay the foundations for future sustained growth, which hinges also on structural
reforms to enhance productivity and potential output – thus further allowing for the
correction of imbalances.
Turning to staff’s assessment of the current slowdown as “the slump that followed the
bursting of the euro-adoption bubble”, it does not seem to be appropriate. In fact, the idea of
“bubble bursting” applies to very steep corrections, typically in asset prices, which occur in a
short period of time and lead also to sharp adjustments to the real side of the economy. No
such events have occurred in Portugal. Moreover, given the current economic regime shaped
by monetary union, the correction of past excesses is likely to be rather prolonged.
Going for sound public finances
Rapid expansion over an extended period pushed current primary expenditures from 28.1
percent of GDP in 1990 to 39.4 percent in 20041. As the EMU-induced effect of falling
interest payments tended to wear-off, while that expansionary trend kept going, a sizeable
deficit became apparent in 2001 (4.2 percent of GDP). In subsequent years, weakening
economic activity weighed on revenues, prompting the authorities to use one-off measures of
significant magnitude in order to keep the deficit below 3 percent of GDP, as required by the
Stability and Growth Pact.
After taking office, last March, the new single-party majority government appointed an
independent commission, headed by the Governor of the Bank of Portugal, to estimate the
likely fiscal outcome for 2005. This commission concluded that, without policy changes, the
deficit would reach 6.5 percent of GDP. That assessment reflected several corrections to the
original budget, including more realistic assumptions and the rejection of one-off measures.
These latter are perceived by the authorities as a palliative that masks the true dimension of
problems, promoting a misguided sense that the worst has been overcome.
The authorities are determined to address the root causes of fiscal imbalances and have
accordingly committed to refrain from one-off measures and to address the unsustainable
level of current primary expenditures. However, in view of their high rigidity – about 87
percent of such expenditures could not be tackled without cumbersome changes to the legal
framework – action on the revenue side became inevitable to get immediate results, as
deemed imperative. Several measures were thus introduced – including a rise of the top VAT
rate and a freezing of automatic civil service promotions – in order to bring the deficit down
to 6 percent of GDP. According to available figures, this goal is within reach, benefiting
among other factors from the significantly increased efficiency of tax administration.
Looking ahead, the authorities have pledged to reduce the deficit below 3 percent of GDP in
three years, taking it further to 1.5 percent by 2009, as stated in the revised Stability and

As part of regular methodological reviews at the European level, the Portuguese Statistics
Office recently issued a new series for the country’s National Accounts. Ratios presented in
this statement are based on the higher GDP figures resulting` from that review.

-3Growth Program endorsed by the EU Council on September 20. Fiscal targets for 2006 will
benefit from the full effect of the VAT rate rise – together with a new income tax top rate and
increases in fuel and tobacco taxes. Efforts will nevertheless focus on expenditures,
particularly as regards social transfers and the wage bill, which accounted for most of past
expenditure increases.
Measures in this context include, among others, an alignment of the social security regime
for public servants with the general regime, a review of this latter, an audit-based reform of
public administration, several efficiency-enhancing measures directed to the National Health
System, a reform of local finances, preparation of a multi-year budget framework and
heightened efficiency criteria for public investment, which is to be preserved. Finally, the
authorities stand ready to take additional measures as necessary to abide by the deficit targets
in case macroeconomic assumptions embedded in the Program do not materialize – as
regards for instance GDP projections over the medium term.
Tackling structural risks and weaknesses
Developments in the Portuguese economy since EMU was launched in 1999 illustrate the
importance, for countries participating in a monetary union, of ensuring that fiscal policy is
consistently able to play a counter-cyclical role. Such developments further demonstrate the
cost, in terms of lost competitiveness and thus eventually output loss and unemployment, if
wage increases are too much out-of-line with developments in other monetary union
members. Indeed, that can only be sustained if productivity grows at a sufficiently strong
pace to compensate for the wage differential, which is why the agenda for structural reforms
currently envisaged by the authorities turns out to be so critical.
Although quite diverse in nature, as they encompass a vast array of relevant subjects, those
reforms share a common focus on fostering productivity and potential output, by removing
undue barriers to business, fostering capabilities and providing appropriate incentives to
private agents. They touch upon education, the legal system, the energy sector, R&D, ICT
use and the broad business environment, among other areas. Several specific measures have
already been implemented, including the possibility of creating a firm in one hour, an
increase in classroom time for teachers, enhanced competition to promote broadband internet
use and simplified legal proceedings for low-value debt claims.
Staff rightfully points to inefficiencies in the business environment identified by the World
Bank’s Doing Business Indicators and its recent review of governance. That analysis is
valued by the authorities but it should be seen together with other appraisals, such as for
instance the Global Competitiveness Index recently published by the World Economic Forum
for 2005. This ranked Portugal 22nd among 117 countries, up two places from last year and
well positioned within the EU context.
Current levels of indebtedness in the Portuguese economy are a concern taken very seriously
by the authorities, either in their capacity as policymakers or as financial regulators.
Nevertheless, the issue must be put into perspective, on several grounds. Public debt rose
from 51.2 percent of GDP in 2000 to 59.4 percent in 2004 and is only expected to start

500 percent of the same disposable
income and there is no evidence of
significant asset price overvaluation. Credit growth slowed down markedly since 2001 and is
overwhelmingly long-term and housing-related. Moreover, reflecting historically low rates,
the interest burden is now about as heavy as it was a decade ago (see chart). External debt
also rose steadily in the last few years, standing above 150 percent of GDP since 2004, in
gross terms. Still, it is overwhelmingly expressed in euros, the Portuguese currency, and does
not go beyond 40 percent of GDP in net terms.
Indeed, it should be stressed that participation in the euro area represented a fundamental
regime change for the Portuguese economy regarding its external constraint and financing
channels. The external imbalance is now financed in the common currency and therefore not
constrained by the possibility of an exchange rate crisis. However, the solvency conditions
arising from intertemporal budget constraints faced by individual agents remain as valid as
before euro adoption. Thus, a persistent gap between the growth of domestic expenditure and
that of income, financed by ever rising external indebtedness, is obviously unsustainable.
This said, the unwinding of existing imbalances may take quite some time under the current
regime. If the appropriate structural reforms are implemented and succeed in increasing the
economy’s growth potential, external imbalances may essentially be corrected through rising
exports. Otherwise, the domestic savings rate will inevitably have to rise and domestic
expenditure will need to be curbed, so as to serve a growing stock of external debt.
The above considerations suggest two additional remarks regarding the staff report. First, we
believe that the exercises on external and public debt sustainability (Tables 4 and 5 of the
report) are complementary and so should share the same baseline assumptions – which is not
the case for GDP growth. Second, we further believe that several conventional indicators of
external and financial vulnerability, adequate for small open economies with monetary
sovereignty, become irrelevant or misleading for EMU members like Portugal. This is
notably the case for such indicators as official reserves and external liabilities of the central
bank, presented in Table 6 – one which would be better excluded from the report.
The Bank of Portugal remains alert, in the context of its responsibilities as supervisor of the
banking system, to issues such as the concentration of credit risk in the housing sector. Yet, it
should be stressed, as staff acknowledges, that broad developments in the banking sector
continued to be rather positive. Indicators of solvability, liquidity and credit quality improved

-5again in 2004, while profitability remained comfortable, amid an environment of strong
competition. A similarly favorable pattern could be observed as regards the insurance sector,
where cost-cutting, an improved balance of premiums to risk and the recovery of capital
markets allowed for enhanced profitability. As the overall financial system stands solid, and
preparations for regulatory changes such as the new IFRS and Basle II are on-track, the
authorities look forward to receiving the first FSAP mission by year-end.
Portugal has endured sizeable shocks over the last decades, and yet managed to develop at a
pace matched by few other countries in the world. There certainly seems to be no reason to
think it will be different this time.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation
with Portugal
On October 14, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Portugal.1
Background
Portugal has yet to emerge from the downturn that followed the bursting of the euro adoption
bubble. A gradual domestic demand-driven recovery started in 2004, but activity weakened
during the second half of last year amid ongoing concerns about competitiveness. Preliminary
data show year-on-year GDP growth of 0.3 percent in the first half of 2005. Private consumption
has proven resilient, reflecting low interest rates and lengthening tenors on bank lending, while
investment and export growth remained weak. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate reached a
seven-year high of 7.5 percent in the first quarter of 2005, before moderating slightly to
7.2 percent in the second quarter. Due in part to weak demand, inflation fell to just over
2 percent in the first half of 2005. Poor productivity growth has weakened external
competitiveness. As a result, export shares shrank and the current account deficit (excluding
capital transfers) widened to 7.2 percent of GDP last year.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.

High private indebtedness, especially among households, weak competitiveness, and planned
significant fiscal consolidation are expected to constrain growth in the near future. Real GDP is
projected to grow by about ½ percent in 2005 and 1¼ percent in 2006.
Extensive use of one-off measures kept the budget deficit within the SGP ceiling of 3 percent
of GDP over the last few years. These measures, however, did not address the underlying
source of fiscal problems: the steady rise in current expenditure over the last decade. After an
independent audit forecasted a deficit of about 6½ percent of GDP this year without one-off
measures, the authorities announced their intention to reduce the deficit below 3 percent of
GDP without one-off measures by 2008. In July, a series of revenue measures—including an
increase in the VAT rate—were introduced, with a view to reducing the 2005 deficit to 6
percent of GDP. Over time, expenditure measures, especially pension and civil service
reforms, are expected to constitute the bulk of the adjustment effort. Some key elements of the
consolidation effort remain to be defined, however.
Strong growth of bank lending to households, especially for mortgages, led to a continued
increase in the private sector credit-to-GDP ratio, which reached about 144 percent by the end
of 2004 (well above the EU average). The banking sector has, however, proven resilient to the
economic downturn: indicators point to improved capitalization, solid profitability and low levels
of Non-Performing Loans.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors concurred that in an unfavorable context marked by large fiscal and
external imbalances, slow growth, and a weak competitive position, the challenge confronting
the Portuguese government is to create the conditions to restart Portugal’s per capita income
convergence toward the euro area average as soon as possible. Accordingly, Directors
underscored the need to pursue sustainable fiscal adjustment and measures to improve
product and labor markets, enhance the business environment, and strengthen human capital
development. Directors welcomed the authorities’ policy outlines in these areas, but called for
early action in implementing them to build confidence and credibility.
Directors agreed that short-term growth prospects are not auspicious, owing to weak
competitiveness, high private debt ratios, and the need for significant fiscal adjustment to
reduce the public sector deficit. Most Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to
proceed with fiscal adjustment despite the weak economic outlook, agreeing that a determined
consolidation effort is essential to lay the foundation for a resumption of growth and a
reduction of the current account deficit.
Directors therefore commended the authorities’ fiscal strategy, which emphasizes mediumterm expenditure containment and sets an appropriately ambitious pace of adjustment.
Directors noted that steady rises in the public wage bill and in pension spending in recent
years have been at the heart of current fiscal difficulties; they thus supported the authorities’
intention to focus measures on these items. Directors also supported the decision to largely

-3abandon one-off measures, which they agreed have tended to create uncertainty about the
true state of the public finances and to complicate future budget execution. They underscored
that bringing the deficit below 3 percent of GDP by 2008 would strike an appropriate balance
between the need to make rapid progress in reducing the deficit and the focus on longer-term
reforms. Directors were encouraged by the authorities’ willingness to take additional
measures—ideally on the expenditure side—if needed to achieve the deficit targets.
Directors noted, however, that adjustment in 2005 has come primarily from revenue measures.
They recognized that this is true in part because a number of key expenditure-side elements of
the authorities’ program are still being defined, including reforms of the public administration
and of the retirement system for private sector workers. They stressed, however, that early
definition and implementation of these bedrock spending reforms will be essential to
distinguish the current adjustment effort from previous fiscal consolidation efforts, which had
failed to produce durable gains. They considered that sufficient progress to allow these
reforms to be reflected in the 2006 budget will be critical for the credibility of the consolidation
effort.
Directors cautioned that the fiscal adjustment planned for the next four years is but the first
stage of a longer process of deficit reduction that should aim at achieving overall budget
balance. They noted that the looming rise in pension and health care spending from population
aging underscores the need to find durable measures to improve the quality and efficiency of
public expenditure. Directors agreed that greater use of Public-Private Partnerships could help
raise spending efficiency, but cautioned that care will be needed to ensure that these
transactions involve an appropriate transfer of risk to the private sector, that contracts and
associated liabilities are recorded transparently (including in budget documents), and that
commitments to make payments over time to private partners do not unduly constrain future
budget flexibility. Directors supported the government’s intention to consider reforms to local
government financing arrangements—including possible binding expenditure limits—as these
could help reduce medium-term fiscal pressures.
Directors stressed the need to pursue structural reforms that improve labor productivity and
enhance competitiveness, and, ultimately, speed income convergence. In this respect, while
recognizing that initiatives to promote research and development and information technology
spending could play an important role in stimulating growth, they also praised ongoing and
planned reforms to the education and training system and to the business environment.
Directors stressed the important complementarities among these reforms. They were
encouraged by recent measures to reduce the time required to open a new business, while
noting that reducing delays in the legal system and accelerating the process of granting
licenses and permits should remain a high priority. Directors stressed the need to enhance
competition in key sectors like telecommunications and transportation, where relatively high
costs undermine competitiveness.
Directors called on the authorities to pursue additional steps to raise labor market flexibility and
improve the responsiveness of wages to productivity and skill differentials. They observed that
restrictions on collective dismissals exceed the EU average, and those on individual dismissals
are the tightest in the OECD. While recognizing that these restrictions are less binding in

-4practice because of extensive use of temporary contracts and self-employment, Directors
cautioned that such mechanisms can create a segmented labor market, with strong protection
for some workers and considerable job instability for others. They noted that such conditions
raise equity concerns and can hamper productivity growth by slowing the movement of
protected workers from low-growth sectors to higher-growth ones.
Directors’ welcomed the resiliency of the financial sector to the economic slowdown.
They noted that banks have remained adequately capitalized and liquid, that profitability has
been solid, and that the quality of banks’ loan portfolios has remained broadly stable.
Directors cautioned, however, about potential vulnerabilities arising from high household and
corporate debt and the concentration of loans across sectors and enterprises. They therefore
welcomed the authorities’ commitment to continue to monitor developments carefully,
to intensify oversight of risk management practices, and to undertake a Financial Sector
Assessment Program this year.
Directors encouraged the authorities to actively support progress in multilateral trade
liberalization under the Doha round, and to increase Portugal’s overseas development
assistance toward the UN target level of 0.7 percent of gross national income.
