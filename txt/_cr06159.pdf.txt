Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2005 Consultation with
The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia
Approved by Siddharth Tiwari and Carlo Cottarelli
March 6, 2006
•

Discussions for the 2005 Article IV consultation were held in Addis Ababa from
October 11-24, 2005, and in Washington DC on December 20-22, 2005. The
mission met with Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, Minister of Finance Sufian Ahmed
Governor Teklewold Atnafu, other senior government officials, and representatives of
the private sector, civil society and the donor community.

•

The staff team comprised of Messrs. Andrews (Head), Gilmour and Erasmus (all
AFR), Mr. Mattina (FAD), Mr. Hallaert (PDR), and Ms. Mitchell Casselle (MFD).

•

Key issues discussed during the consultation included: emerging risks to
macroeconomic-stability, in particular pressures on the balance of payments; the need
to anchor fiscal policy on maintaining debt sustainability; the importance of
monitoring the operations of public enterprises; and the risks posed by a sustained
rapid increase in domestic credit growth. The mission also discussed an Millennium
Development Goal scenario, drawing on the results of the MDG Needs Assessment
prepared by the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MOFED), and the
policies to support higher inflows and raise growth.

•

Ethiopia’s statistical base is broadly adequate to conduct effective surveillance,
but shortcomings affect the analysis of key areas. Given the increasing role of key
public enterprises in infrastructure investment, it is recommended that their activities
be closely monitored and, ideally, consolidated in fiscal reporting.

•

The authorities have indicated their willingness to accept the obligations under
Article VIII, but this will require elimination of four exchange restrictions.

•

The political scene remains unsettled following disputed national election results and
violent protests. The main opposition leaders have been imprisoned, and donors have
suspended budget support. Tensions have also risen over the disputed border with
Eritrea.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
•

Violent unrest broke out during November over the disputed May 2005 national
election results, and the leaders of the main opposition party have been arrested.
Donors are re-evaluating their engagement with Ethiopia, and all of their direct
budget support has been suspended.

•

Economic growth remained strong in 2004/05 at 8.8 percent, driven by another
increase in agricultural production. Staff expects growth to moderate to around 5
percent per annum this year. Inflationary pressures are rising, driven by both demand
pressures and higher import costs. The real effective exchange rate has appreciated
moderately.

•

Domestic credit growth has accelerated, driven by strong demand from the
government, public enterprises and the private sector. A high import content,
particularly from public infrastructure investments, together with higher oil imports,
has translated into widening trade and current account deficits, and emerging
pressures on international reserves.

Key issues and staff recommendations
•

Staff and the authorities noted an urgent need to tighten the stance of
macroeconomic policies to alleviate pressures on the balance of payments. Staff
recommended scaling back domestically financed infrastructure spending in the
budget, and curbing domestic credit expansion through imposing ceilings on the
credit operations of the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia. The authorities preferred to
focus their response on delaying planned imports from public enterprise investments,
both on and off budget.

•

The activities of major public enterprises, especially those involved in large
infrastructure investment, should be included in regular fiscal reporting.
Strengthening public expenditure management is also key. Tax policy should be
reviewed to ensure that its structure is conducive to expanding the tax base as the
economy grows, and to cut distortionary exemptions.

•

The pace of structural reforms to support rural and private sector development,
including in the financial sector, should be accelerated to support faster economic
growth and meeting the MDGs. This will also require higher donor assistance.

Ethiopia’s largely
agricultural economy remains
vulnerable to climatic shocks,
which have resulted in wide swings
in output, with severe adverse effects
for the poor (Box 1). Average
growth over the five years to
2004/05 of 4.6 percent has not been
fast enough to significantly reduce
poverty. World Bank reports suggest
that the incidence of consumption
poverty has not declined between
1990 and 2004.1

Box 1. Food Security
While major crop producing areas are expected to see improvements in food security in 2006,
pastoral areas of southern and southeastern Ethiopia are suffering from the effects of drought.
The 2006 Humanitarian Appeal is seeking emergency assistance for 2.6 million people. After
two successive years of good harvests, and favorable prospects for 2005/06, the number of
people requiring emergency assistance is the lowest in over a decade. However, the Food
Security Coordination Bureau has indicated that the total number of people needing
humanitarian assistance will rise from 9 million in 2005 to 11 million in 2006, or around
15 percent of the population. In addition to those requiring emergency assistance, this includes
8.3 million people who are now considered chronically food insecure and are expected to
receive assistance through the Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP). The PSNP—a multisectoral and multi-year program which implements intensive public works schemes using both
cash and food for work mechanisms—has undergone a retargeting exercise that has raised the
number of beneficiaries from 4.8 million in 2005.

3.
In the last two years, growth has been strong but there are emerging pressures
on prices and, more acutely, the balance of payments.
•

In 2004/05, the economy
Nonfood inflation
grew by 8.8 percent, the
second year of rapid
expansion after the recent
drought.2 At the same time,
inflationary pressures have
risen. Although domestic
petroleum prices were last
adjusted in December 2004,
non-food inflation rose to a
12-month average of 7.9
percent in December 2005.
Special factors explain some
of this increase, including higher imported and domestic prices for construction
materials, but underlying demand pressures appear to be contributing to the highest
nonfood inflation rate in a decade.

The national accounts data have been revised and rebased, resulting in an upward revision to
nominal GDP of over 20 percent in the new base year (1999/00). The Fund reviewed the sources and
methodology for the revision, and concluded that the revised data better reflect the structure of
production in Ethiopia.

-7-

•

Government’s domestic borrowing rose to 3.5 percent of GDP in 2004/05—2 percent
of GDP higher than budgeted—as a result of shortfalls in revenues and aid inflows,
and the stock of government’s domestic debt remained high at 35 percent of GDP.
Capital spending rose sharply as the government began to scale up domesticallyfinanced spending on infrastructure, which was also reflected in an increase in overall
poverty spending.

•

During 2004/05, broad money grew more or less in line with nominal GDP. However,
this growth was entirely due to an expansion of net domestic assets (NDA), including
sharp increases in credit to the private sector and public enterprises. At the same time,
commercial banks’ excess reserves rose to over 30 percent of deposits as the National
Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) met government’s domestic financing needs, and the
dominant Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE) sharply reduced its holdings of
treasury bills.

... reflecting in particular a rapid increase in credit to public
enterprises.

Broad money growth has been driven by rising net domestic
assets...

Ethiopia’s terms of trade improved by 11 percent in 2004/05, reflecting surging
coffee prices. However, the external current account deficit (after official transfers)
widened by 4 percent of GDP, in spite of export growth of 36 percent. Imports—
which are now almost four times larger than exports—rose by 40 percent or about
US$1 billion, but only about a third of this increase reflected higher fuel costs. The
overall balance moved into deficit, as reflected by the decline in net foreign assets of
the banking system.

Although the birr continued to depreciate gradually against the US dollar, the recent
trend of real depreciation reversed during 2004/05, reflecting a relative strengthening
of the US dollar and the pick up in Ethiopia’s inflation.

-9-

•

Following four years of reserve accumulation through 2004/05, NBE has begun to
draw down its foreign reserves, and import cover has dropped to around 3 months
during the first half of 2005/06.

4.
The mission took place against a tense political background. The results of the
May 2005 election remain in dispute. The main opposition party, the Coalition for Unity and
Democracy (CUD), which officially won 109 of the 547 seats, boycotted the new parliament
that was sworn in on October 10, 2005, although some opposition parliamentarians have
since taken their seats. In November, violent unrest erupted again and the leaders of the CUD
were jailed, and face charges that include treason. Donors have reacted by suspending their
budget support. Future disbursements and aid modalities are under review;3 donors have
stressed that governance and human rights issues will be central to Ethiopia’s future
partnership with the international community. They have also expressed concerns that a
prolonged period of political uncertainty could have adverse consequences for the business
climate, investment, and private sector development. Tension has also mounted on the
disputed border with Eritrea.
5.
The authorities place a high priority on maintaining macroeconomic stability
and have welcomed past Fund advice in this area. However, they have consistently argued
for higher revenue projections and greater domestic financing, arguing that the latter would
not jeopardize macroeconomic stability. The authorities are, for the most part, following
Fund advice in strengthening revenue and customs administration, and expenditure
management. The authorities remain unconvinced by the Fund’s policy advice on the need
for greater financial sector liberalization.
II. PROSPECTS AND THE POLICY STANCE FOR 2005/06
6.
After two years of strong agricultural expansion, the staff expects the overall
growth rate to ease to just over 5 percent. This mainly reflects an expected slowdown in
crop production growth to 6.8 percent, and the likely adverse impact of recent political
unrest. The agricultural assessment assumes modest growth in area under cultivation, and
yield growth in line with the average rate seen in the last 14 years. However, the authorities
considered that agricultural production would be stronger, noting the recent rapid increase in
fertilizer imports and early crop forecasts for the main season harvest, and projected GDP
growth of 7 percent for 2005/06.

3

Donors are working to develop new modalities under which assistance would be targeted to
support regional social service delivery.

- 10 -

7.
Food prices are expected to decline during 2005/06 from the high levels that
prevailed in 2004/05 despite good harvests. However, taking into account the impact of the
expected phased pass through of world market petroleum prices, the non-food index is
projected to remain higher, bringing the average increase in consumer prices to 10.8 percent
in 2005/06. The authorities noted that they were projecting an average inflation rate of
9.5 percent.
8.
The initial focus of discussions was on the policy response to emerging pressures
on the balance of payments. The authorities agreed that such pressures reflected a higher oil
bill, large public infrastructure investments and, since November 2005, lower donor support.
Initial projections in October suggested that full implementation of the budget—including an
increase in capital spending of over 4 percent of GDP—and the investment programs of
public enterprises, would contribute to import growth of at least 24 percent in 2005/06.
Although export growth was expected to remain strong, given the small size of the export
base, export receipts would finance only a small proportion of this import growth and the
trade deficit would widen by around US$630 million (4.9 percent of GDP). Staff initially
identified a financing gap of around US$390 million (3 percent of GDP), assuming import
cover was maintained at 3 months. This was later revised up to US$600 million (4.6 percent
of GDP) to reflect lower donor support.
9.
Against this background the
mission saw an urgent need to
tighten the policy stance, while
protecting basic services. The
authorities confirmed their intention
to pass on higher oil prices to
consumers during 2005/06 although
the timing would depend on the
availability of external support for a
targeted social safety net (Box 2).
The focus of discussions was on
containing import growth stemming
from public infrastructure
investments. In December 2005, the
authorities indicated that for 2005/06 public enterprise imports would be lower by
US$240 million (2 percent of GDP) than initially envisaged, as a result of agreed cuts in the
investment programs of the electricity and telecommunications corporations (EEPCo, ETC)
which could be made without breaking contractual obligations (Box 3). Consistent with these
steps, planned domestic bank financing of these public enterprises would be correspondingly
reduced.

Box 2. Poverty and Social Impact Assessment (PSIA) of Removing Fuel Price
Subsidies
Work undertaken by the World Bank, and supported by the Fund’s PSIA Unit, has
concluded that there is a strong case for removing fuel subsidies as they are not propoor, and tie up funds which could be used for other purposes. Analysis has shown that
petroleum product subsidies, including kerosene, are captured disproportionately by the
rich. The lowest income quintile receives less than 10 percent of total subsidies, while
the top (richest) quintile receives about 44 percent.
Retail prices for petroleum products have not been adjusted since December 2004,
leading to an increasing subsidy during 2005. Removing this subsidy would not
immediately affect the budget, as it is currently financed from domestic bank
borrowing by the Ethiopian Petroleum Enterprise (EPE) following the depletion of the
Fuel Stabilization Fund in 2004/05. Nonetheless, this debt will have to be paid out of
government funds, reducing that available for other purposes.

Note: The annual cost of the subsidy is running at around 2 percent of GDP. This is currently being financed by EPE domestic
borrowing, incuring a large contingent liability for the government.
Annualized, the estimated amount of subsidies currently going to the top quintile is Birr 760 million. This amount could fund
an additional 2.1 million people under the Safety Net Program, or 50,000 additional nurses, 3.5 times the current total.

Box 3. Public Investment Program
A key element of Ethiopia’s medium-term growth strategy is to rapidly scale up infrastructure
investment. This involves substantially higher on-budget capital spending for roads, food security and
rural electrification. In addition, the power and telecom companies (EEPCo and ETC) have embarked on
ambitious programs to expand access to basic services. Table 1 illustrates that on-budget capital spending
is increasing sharply across a range of sectors. Moreover, the domestically-financed share of capital
outlays has increased significantly since 2002/03.

Financing (as a share of total capital spending)

Fiscal and macro policy risks are mounting as the main public utilities domestically finance large
infrastructure investments. The increase in import demand fueled by these investments has contributed
to significant pressure on the balance of payments. The government has also guaranteed bonds in 2004/05
issued by ETC and EEPCo totaling 3.1 percent of GDP, exposing the budget to potentially large
contingent liabilities. Even after agreed cuts in 2005/06, planned large recourse to domestic financing
could squeeze private sector credit and stoke inflationary pressures.

Most of these cutbacks would take place off-budget. However, staff also identified
a financing gap of 4.5 percent of GDP in the 2005/06 budget. The authorities intend to cover
this through cutting federally financed capital spending on rural electrification in the budget
by Birr 1.25 billion (1.1 percent of GDP); a budgeted one-off transfer of accumulated profits
from the NBE totaling 2.2 percent of GDP, and increased recourse to domestic financing to
4 percent of GDP. However, after including MDRI relief from the Fund, which was not
approved when discussions concluded, domestic financing would be held to just over
3 percent of GDP.4 In addition, they noted that any shortfall in regional revenue collection
would lead to an equivalent cut in their expenditure. Staff welcomed the decision to contain
capital spending, and recognized that raising domestic financing was, in principle, an
appropriate response, provided the decline in aid flows was temporary. However, staff noted
that higher domestic financing from the NBE and the profit transfer would involve issuing
base money. To address this concern, as well as to help reduce excess reserves in the banking
system, the authorities indicated that they would rely predominantly on issuing treasury bills
to commercial banks to fund the budget deficit.

US$700 million. This reflects an exceptional increase in oil import volumes in 2004/05, and
results in projected oil imports which are around 5 percent higher than the previous threeyear average. Taking all these elements into account, they considered that reserves would be
held at over 3 months of import cover, and macroeconomic stability maintained.
12.
Staff was of the view that the authorities’ revised scenario still involved
significant risks for the balance of payments. Oil imports may be higher than projected,
particularly if fuel prices are not raised. In addition, despite the proposed cuts in public
enterprise spending, sustained rapid domestic credit growth could have adverse implications
for the balance of payments, prices and public domestic debt levels. In this connection, staff
noted the combination of higher domestic financing of the budget deficit, the planned
recourse to domestic bank credit by public enterprises in 2005/06, and continued strong
growth in credit to the private sector credit. Moreover, without the assumed pass through of
higher oil prices, credit to the EPE to fund the subsidy would crowd-out financing for the
private sector.
13.
The authorities stressed that they would take additional measures as necessary
to defend the reserve position at 3 months, and noted their success in doing so during past
difficult times. Staff welcomed this commitment, but cautioned that recourse to
administrative controls should be avoided to prevent any adverse impact on the private
sector.
III. BASELINE MEDIUM TERM SCENARIO
14.
Discussions on medium term prospects and policies took place around two
scenarios, which were drawn from the preliminary frameworks presented in the authorities’
draft Plan for Accelerated and Sustained Development to End Poverty (PASDEP).5 6
•

Staff’s baseline scenario, which is not explicitly geared to attaining the MDG,
assumes that growth averages just over 5 percent, consistent with the low case
scenario in the PASDEP, and slightly above the trend rate in the last ten years; an
annual average inflation of 6 percent, and the restoration of reserve cover to around
3.4 months of imports. While prospects for aid flows remain highly uncertain, the
baseline scenario assumes that aid flows begin to rise again in 2006/07, and return to

5

The PASDEP, the second generation PRSP, will replace the Sustainable Development and Poverty
Reduction Program which covered the three years to 2003/04.
6

During the October mission both a baseline and an MDG scenario were discussed based on the then
existing Macroeconomic and Fiscal Framework (MEFF), and the draft MDG Needs Assessment
Synthesis Report. Subsequently the draft PASDEP was issued with a revised MEFF drawn from the
Needs Assessment and showing financing gaps. In December, the authorities agreed that the two
frameworks needed to be updated; discussions on the medium term scenarios were concluded in
February through the Fund’s resident representative in Addis Ababa.

- 15 -

the levels originally budgeted for in 2005/06. Thus, the baseline implicitly assumes
sufficient progress is made in addressing donors’ concerns to allow such a resumption
in aid flows.
•

The MDG scenario draws upon the Needs Assessment, which estimated the costs of
reaching the MDGs. In addition to incorporating faster growth of 7 percent on
average—required to halve poverty by 2015—the scenario includes a large expansion
in spending on key services and infrastructure, and a corresponding increase in aid.
The key elements of this scenario, and the policy framework to support it, are
summarized in Box 4.7
A. Fiscal Policy

15.
Staff noted that the baseline scenario in the PASDEP entailed significant
financing risks. These stemmed from planned increases in expenditure, especially capital
spending (by nearly 9 percent of GDP between 2004/05-06/07) and very ambitious revenue
projections, which entailed risk that recourse to domestic financing would increase over the
already high levels planned (as occurred in 2004/05).
16.
Staff recommend that the authorities develop a fiscal framework which shows
how expenditure will be prioritized on the basis of likely resource availability and in
line with the growth strategy. Although such a prioritization is not yet available, staff’s
baseline scenario presented here assumes lower expenditure than in the PASDEP to produce
a fully financed medium-term fiscal framework that allows for increased pro-poor spending,
and is consistent with declining domestic debt levels. Thus, while the PASDEP shows
financing gaps needed to be filled to support planned expenditures (Tables 2, 3, 4), staff’s
baseline scenario8 reflects the authorities’ commitment to cut nonpriority spending (and
maintain reserve cover). The path of domestically financed capital spending thus reflects the
available fiscal space, including shifts in NBE profit transfers and assumed increases in tax
revenues. The latter reflects buoyant international taxes, a recovery in business income taxes,
and expected administrative improvements.

Box 4. An MDG Scenario
Discussions on strategies for achieving the MDGs formed an integral part of the
2005 Article IV consultation, and served to update work started on an MDG
scenario during the 2004 consultation. The updated scenario incorporates the lower
bound estimate of total public sector costs (US$58 billion), presented in the MDG
Needs Assessment Synthesis Report prepared by MOFED, and an annual expenditure
framework guided by simulations produced by the World Banks’ MAMS model, which
provides for a front-loading of infrastructure investments in line with the authorities
strategy.
Discussions with the authorities focused on the policies and macroeconomic
framework to accommodate higher aid inflows and promote faster growth. Key
challenges identified included:
•

increasing agricultural productivity, and ensuring that supporting policies are in
place to achieve the expected private sector productivity response to improved
infrastructure provision, necessary to raise GDP growth rates;

•

raising fiscal revenues by over 5 percentage points of GDP in order to cover the
recurrent costs of higher spending, and allow for an exit strategy from high aid
dependence;

•

strengthening public expenditure management and capacity building to ensure
the effective implementation of expenditure plans, including infrastructure
investments of public enterprises;

•

addressing potential labor market constraints through appropriate investment
and training in order to ease pressures on wages;

•

managing the sequence of spending to mitigate potential pressures on the real
exchange rate through an initial focus on import heavy infrastructure
investment which results in productivity gains, and eases labor constraints at a
later date when the emphasis shifts to recurrent spending.

Box 5. UN and World Bank Assessment of Progress Towards the MDGs
An assessment by the government, United Nations Country Team, and World Bank considers that a
sub-set of the MDG Goals 1, 3 and 7 are likely to be achieved under current trends, while Goal 2 could
be achieved even before 2015. Achievement of all MDGs by 2015 will require improved policies to
strengthen institutions and support efforts to raise real GDP growth in a sustainable manner, as well as
significantly higher aid flows.

17.
The mission argued that the medium-term fiscal projections, including under the
MDG scenario, should be anchored by the need to ensure domestic debt sustainability.
Ethiopia’s domestic debt is high compared with other countries in sub-Saharan Africa
although, as a result of very high levels of excess reserves in the banking system, interest
rates are negative in real terms, and therefore servicing this debt does not place a heavy
burden on the budget. However, over the medium term, it would be prudent to expect interest
rates on government debt to become positive in real terms as excess reserves decline and
competition in the financial sector increases. In addition, targeting a gradual reduction in the
domestic debt stock is important to provide the flexibility to respond to unforeseen shocks,

- 18 -

particularly climatic shocks that call for additional expenditures and adversely affect revenue
performance.9 The baseline thus projects a decline in domestic financing of the budget from
4 percent of GDP in 2005/06 to 3 percent by 2008/09, allowing a small reduction in the debt
stock to about 32 percent of GDP by 2009/10.

18.
The mission and authorities agreed that the lower tax ratio resulting from the
upward revision to GDP provides a more realistic picture of Ethiopia’s revenue effort.
This underlined the need to improve the buoyancy of the tax regime, both through
strengthening tax administration, and a review of tax policy. In addition, large revenue
increases will be required to match increases in recurrent spending on infrastructure, as well
as a potential increase in service delivery related to the MDGs, in order to provide for an
orderly exit from potentially higher aid inflows. In this context, the authorities have
requested technical assistance from the Fund to review tax policy.
19.
Regarding tax administration, the mission recommended a focus on the
following areas:
•

strengthening the functional organization and capacity of revenue administration;

•

encouraging regions to centralize revenue administration;

•

further strengthening of customs administration; and

•

avoiding future tax amnesties to avoid undermining taxpayer compliance, and
maintain equitable burden sharing across taxpayers.

B. Monitoring Public Enterprises
20.
The mission noted that fiscal reporting should include the activities of major
public enterprises. The budget has on-lent significant external financing to key public
enterprises, and has guaranteed substantial new domestic financing from the banking system.
To account for these heightened fiscal risks, and to better measure the impact of public
investment on the broader economy, key public enterprises could be consolidated into fiscal
reporting and the budget. Alternatively, the budget could include a detailed annex outlining
the activities of the largest public enterprises, including an overview treatment of new
borrowing guaranteed by the government.
21.
The authorities did not support the proposal of consolidating public enterprises
into the budget. They agreed that monitoring public enterprises was important and noted
that this was already undertaken by various government agencies, principally on the basis of
audited reports. In response, staff stressed that what was needed was more than just
monitoring individual enterprises. Their operations need to be pulled together and placed
within a broader macroeconomic context so as to allow for an assessment of their
macroeconomic consequences – the recent import pressure stemming from the operations of
EEPCo and ETC attested to the importance of such work.
C. Strengthening Public Expenditure Management
22.
The mission reiterated the importance of reforms to strengthen public
expenditure management and reporting.10 Key steps include:
•

rolling-out the budget disbursement and accounting system;

•

implementing performance-based budgeting, and undertaking regular and timely
reconciliation of the fiscal and monetary accounts.

23.
In addition, the Fiscal Decentralization Strategy poses particular challenges, in
that subnational governments are responsible for executing the bulk of social spending.
Given their key role in providing essential services, the adequacy of federal transfers should
be carefully assessed to avoid any unfunded mandates in pro-poor sectors.
24.
The mission stressed that timely fiscal reporting is essential for fiscal and macro
policy management, and to enable budget appropriations to be linked to past
performance. Priority measures include:
•
10

Prompt dissemination of quarterly budget execution reports, and clearing the backlog
of federal fiscal accounts to be finalized and audited by end-2005/06.

Ethiopia has met only 7 out of the 16 benchmarks under the 2004 Assessment and Action
Plan framework, although staff consider there has been some improvements since then.

- 20 -

•

Strengthening assistance to regional governments in order to expedite the clearing of
the average 2-year backlog of sub national accounts.

•

The regular inclusion in fiscal reports of all the extra budgetary funds, and more
timely consolidation of budget reporting by woredas and regions.

The authorities concurred on the importance of strengthening PEM, and have requested
technical assistance from the Fund.

low, reflecting excess bank liquidity.

26.
Against this background,
the mission proposed that,
despite the risks that it could give
rise to distortions, imposing a
direct ceiling on the credit
operations of CBE provided the
most reliable means of guarding
against excessive credit
expansion. At the same time, staff
recommended that government’s
domestic borrowing requirement be
met principally through recourse to
commercial bank financing, rather
than the NBE, to avoid adding to
excess reserves. The large
infrastructure financing plans of
public enterprises also argued for a

2004/05

- 21 -

closer coordination and monitoring of such activities with fiscal and monetary policy to
ensure monetary stability. In this context the staff recommended that adoption of the
Integrated Monetary Data Base (IMD)11 should be a priority.
27.
The authorities acknowledged the emerging pressures in the economy, and
agreed with the proposed shift to commercial bank financing of the budget. However,
they felt that the proposed cuts in public infrastructure investments were sufficient, and that
there was no need to introduce credit ceilings at CBE. Further they stressed that they would
use all applicable measures to maintain monetary stability and reserve targets, if and when
necessary.
28.
The recent modest appreciation of the real exchange rate does not appear to be
affecting competitiveness. Annual export volume growth averaged close to 20 percent
during 2003/04-04/05, and is projected at 16 percent in 2005/06. The authorities are actively
pursing a policy of export diversification which is yielding results, and of strengthening
infrastructural support for industry and agriculture in general. In addition, Ethiopia’s terms of
trade have improved. While rising imports are a concern, they currently mainly reflect the
activities of public enterprises and higher oil prices.
29.
The mission noted 9.5

did involve considerable risks for the balance of payments in a forward looking perspective.
Staff argued that greater flexibility was therefore needed to allow the exchange rate to reflect
balance of payments developments, and avoid the risk of an unsustainable real appreciation.
The authorities agreed that greater exchange rate flexibility could play a role in responding to
balance of payments developments, and indicated that the exchange rate would be allowed to
adjust during 2005/06 as part of a coordinated response to any additional balance of
payments pressures that may emerge.

E. Financial Sector
31.
The authorities confirmed that they are continuing to implement the financial
sector strategy as outlined in 1998. This aims to direct resources through the state
dominated banking system to priority sectors, primarily through the Development Bank of
Ethiopia; to link the financial sector to the strategy of Agricultural Development Led
Industrialization—principally through development of the MFI sector—and to develop a
sound financial system that can sustain liberalization in due course. In the meantime, market
forces will play a limited role in setting interest and exchange rates, and foreign bank entry
will not be allowed. The authorities also confirmed that they view excess reserves of
commercial banks as “savings” which can, and should, be mobilized in support of public
infrastructure development.

- 23 -

Box 6. Banking Sector Soundness
The banking sector continued to show signs of improvements during 2004/05. Reported NPLs
showed a steady decline as a percentage of total loans, and all banks reported capital
adequacy ratios (CAR) above the minimum required ten percent, except the state owned
Construction and Business Bank (CBB) at 9.7 percent. The authorities indicated that a
decision was pending as to how to deal with CBB’s capital shortfall, including a possible sale
of the bank.

The CBE continued to implement its financial restructuring program and met the plan’s NPL
and CAR targets for 2004/05. The plan aims to reduce the NPL ratio to 15.6 percent by end
2006/07 through a combination of cash collection, rescheduling/renewals and foreclosures,
and to maintain a CAR above 10 percent.

While welcoming the encouraging performance, the mission cautioned that the rate of
increase in bank credit to the non-government sector raises some concerns, particularly if
sustained. Although the NPL ratio has declined, there has been some increase in the nominal
stock of NPLs of private banks. Efforts are needed to preserve bank’s asset quality, and NBE
should look to undertake comprehensive examinations for loan quality and risk management
practices at all banks on a more timely basis.

32.
The mission recommended that further financial sector reform be considered
over the medium term, and reiterated that increasing competition in the banking system,
along with a reduction in the relative size of CBE, remains central to improving the
environment for the implementation of monetary policy. Further, without a clear strategy,
there is a risk that the gains from a potential scaling up of expenditure will not translate into a
sustained private sector response. The forthcoming World Bank Financial Sector Capacity
Building Project,12 will help prepare the ground for broader policy reform in due course, and
in support of this, the Fund is providing technical assistance in the areas of bank supervision
and payment systems.
F. Infrastructure Spending, Productivity, and Private Sector Development
33.
The mission agreed with the authorities that improving Ethiopia’s infrastructure
was essential to enhance growth prospects. Substantial investments would be required to
bring key indicators of Ethiopia’s infrastructure even to average levels seen in sub-Saharan
Africa. However, the beneficial effects of such investment—including the “crowding-in” of
private investment and a lagged improvement in total factor productivity consistent with
higher growth performance—would depend on the choice and quality of the investments, as
well as a policy environment conducive to private sector development.

The authorities confirmed that support for the newly formed Financial Public Enterprise
Agency would center on corporate governance, and that the agency would not be taking over
supervisory responsibility for state owned public financial institutions from the NBE.

34.
The mission also noted that the economic contribution of the private sector
remains limited. Recent positive developments, such as the resumption of the privatization
program, an easing the regulatory burden, and the introduction of a competition policy, are
welcome, but further reforms are needed. A comparison of the business climate in Ethiopia
with that in Vietnam (see Box 7)—which shares some elements of the growth strategy that
Ethiopia is following— confirms that the business environment remains difficult. In addition,
there is a risk that recent political developments may impede private sector development, and
adversely affect private investment, including foreign direct investment (FDI).
Box 7. Investment Climate: Ethiopia and Vietnam: A Comparison
A comparison of the two countries’ business
environments reveals some significant
differences. Ethiopia is rated 106th out of
117 countries by the World Economic
Forum’s 2004/05 Global Competitiveness
Report; Vietnam is rated 81st. While Ethiopia
compares relatively well in terms of
providing a supportive regulatory
environment, it is much more costly to start a
business, and gain access to credit than in
Vietnam. Ethiopia also compares
unfavorably on most governance indicators,
and in the supply of skilled labor and
infrastructure services. These factors may
help explain why FDI in Vietnam – typically
in the form of a joint venture between foreign
partners and a state owned enterprise - has
played a larger role than in Ethiopia.

35.
While admiring of Vietnam’s performance, the authorities indicated that their
interventionist strategy was guided more by the East Asian experience of the 1970s,13
and noted that this involved less liberalization than currently pursued by Vietnam. They
restated their view that the export sector would not develop without state intervention, and
noted priority sectors — horticulture, floriculture, textiles, garments and leather. Support for
these sectors is being provided through the establishment of training institutes, access to land
at reduced prices, long term credit, tariff exemptions, and tax holidays. However, the
authorities also stressed that work was underway, supported by the World Bank, to improve
private sector development, including efforts to improve government service delivery, and
address issues around access to credit.
36.
Staff noted that historically, growth in agricultural production has been driven
by increases in cultivated land, rather than improvements in productivity. Given
pressures on land, sustaining higher rates of growth in agriculture production will require
substantial improvements in productivity.
G. Trade Policy
37.
Trade policy discussions focused on tariff structure and exemptions. Ethiopia’s
average tariff rate of 17 percent is just above the average for sub-Saharan Africa. However,
the top bands of 30 and 35 percent apply to about half of all imports and provide higher rates
of protection to the manufacturing sector. In addition, a “second schedule” grants almost
700 partial or full exemptions to selected industries. Staff recommended that the authorities
consider lowering, or merging at a lower level, the top two tariff bands, noting that the
resulting revenue losses could be significantly reduced by removing the exemptions covered
by the second schedule which gives rise to widespread distortions. The authorities recognized
the importance of such issues, and confirmed their willingness to review such trade policy,
while noting their desire to use trade instruments to achieve industrial policy objectives.
38.
The mission noted that a tariff reduction would also ease the move towards the
COMESA FTA. However, the authorities indicated that they are not yet ready to join due to
concerns over the impact on revenue and competitiveness. They also expressed a reluctance
to alter the trade regime just as the Memorandum on the Foreign Trade regime is about to be
sent to the WTO.

13

The growth strategies in South Korea and Taiwan Province of China during this period were seen
as including a heavy reliance on public enterprises, an extensive set of industrial policies that took the
form of directed credit, trade protection, export subsidization, tax incentives, and other interventions,
with neither country undertaking significant deregulation or liberalization of their trade and financial
systems until well in the 1980s.

H. External Outlook and Debt Sustainability
39.
Prospects for the balance of payments depend crucially on levels of external
assistance and timely policy responses to any pressures. While export prospects are
positive, they remain vulnerable to exogenous shocks. In addition, managing a timely
slowdown in import growth commensurate with available foreign exchange may be a
challenge, putting the projected level of reserve cover at risk.
40.
Staff updated the joint Fund-Bank debt sustainability analysis (see Annex 1), and
included Fund14 debt relief under the MDRI.While the external ratios have improved with the
delivery of debt relief—and will do so further once MDRI relief from the World Bank and
African Development Fund is approved—the analysis implies a moderate risk of debt
distress, and highlights the necessity of securing grant financing and containing domestic
borrowing. In this context, staff stressed that development of a comprehensive public debt
management strategy, to specifically include public enterprise debt and contingent liabilities,
remains a priority.

14

This amounts to approximately US$114 million.

IV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, DATA ISSUES, AND ARTICLE VIII
41.
Recent assistance has focused on fiscal and monetary policy formulation,
strengthening bank supervision, and improvements in the quality and timeliness of core
data that are considered key for surveillance purposes. As well as previously mentioned
requests in the fiscal area, the authorities expressed interest in technical assistance in the
areas of the consumer prices index15 and measurement of FDI. The authorities indicated that
the IMD will be adopted during 2006, and the move to the balance of payments manual five
reporting finalized.
42.
The mission enquired about the status of remaining current account exchange
restrictions which the Fund considers to be inconsistent with Article VIII, Section 2(a) of
the IMF’s Articles of Agreement (see Appendix I, IX). The authorities maintained their
position that these measures did not, in their view, constitute current account restrictions, and
expressed interest in further discussion and clarification of these issues between NBE and the
Fund’s legal department.
V. FUTURE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE FUND
43.
The authorities expressed their desire to maintain a close dialogue and
relationship with the Fund. They noted that access to Fund financing was not the main
consideration, but that they needed the Fund’s signal to donors on the suitability of their
macro-framework for an effective use of a scaling up of aid. In this context they considered
the Fund as a partner in their efforts to reach the MDG’s with donor support. The authorities
indicated that they would consider the various options open in terms of future relations with
the Fund, including the new Policy Support Instrument.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
44.
Ethiopia’s recent growth performance has been encouraging, but sustaining this
at levels needed to meet the MDGs will be difficult without an acceleration of reforms.
In particular, agricultural growth has been driven by increases in area under cultivation, not
yields, highlighting the need address constraints to productivity gains. In addition, the focus
on public enterprises and state determined priority sectors, risks thwarting the emergence of a
dynamic private sector needed to provide incomes and boost growth.
45.
Achieving the MDGs will require significantly higher levels of external
assistance. Such inflows could be facilitated by a resolution of both the current domestic
political tensions, and the border dispute with Eritrea, as well accelerated structural reforms
and strengthened public expenditure management. Introducing timely fiscal reporting is
15

The authorities indicated that they thought the Addis Ababa CPI provided a better
reflection of price developments.

- 29 -

particularly important ahead of scaling up public spending. External support should also
largely be in the form of grants to ensure debt sustainability is maintained.
46.
The current strategy of scaling up domestically financed infrastructure,
including through drawing on CBE’s excess reserves, risks jeopardizing macro
economic stability, and in particular the balance of payments position. The authorities
should thus look to manage the pace and level of such domestically financed spending within
a broader macroeconomic and fiscal framework that ensures stability. In the current context,
this requires some initial scaling back, as well as greater recourse to external funding.
47.
Even with proposed cuts in infrastructure imports, pressures on official reserves
could remain high. While the authorities commitment to take remedial measures is
welcome, it would be preferable to act sooner rather than later to forestall any drop below
3 months import cover. If a large rebuilding of reserves becomes necessary, this will squeeze
the room for non-inflationary domestic bank credit growth, dampening growth prospects.
48.
Fiscal policy should be anchored by the need to avoid adverse macroeconomic
consequences from large recourse to domestic bank finance, and to ensure debt
sustainability. The adjustment measures introduced this year are welcome, but the resulting
policy stance still involves significant risks for the balance of payments. Beyond 2005/06,
planned recourse to domestic borrowing should be reduced to contain debt levels and provide
room to respond to shocks, as well as mitigate any pressures on reserves. At the same time
efforts are needed to improve the buoyancy of the tax regime to ensure revenue growth keeps
up with recurrent expenditures. Staff thus welcome the authorities’ request for technical
assistance from the Fund in the area of tax and customs policy, including on the structure and
level of tariff exemptions. Staff also highly recommend that the activities of key public
enterprises be closely monitored, and ideally consolidated into fiscal reporting.
49.
The proposal to pass through higher oil prices is welcome, and staff recommend
that this be implemented as a priority during 2005/06, followed by the reintroduction of the
automatic pricing mechanism. Given the limited impact on the poor and the mounting costs,
delays in securing additional external support should not detract from moving ahead with
domestic price increases.
50.
Monetary and exchange rate policy will need to be geared to preserving
international reserves and containing inflationary pressures. In the absence of effective
indirect instruments, direct controls on the operations of CBE may be the most effective way
to curb excessive credit growth. Staff consider that external competitiveness does not seem to
be an immediate problem. However, looking forward, greater flexibility is needed to allow
the exchange rate to reflect balance of payments developments and avoid the risk of an
unsustainable real appreciation. Moreover, the authorities should follow through on the
option of allowing greater flexibility as part of a timely and coordinated response to
additional balance of payments pressures that may emerge.

- 30 -

51.
Differences of view remain over financial sector reforms. The authorities’ MDG
scenarios entail a significant private sector response to reforms and infrastructure
development, which staff consider will need to be supported by a more dynamic and market
orientated financial sector than currently envisaged. In the meantime, the Fund will
collaborate with the forthcoming World Bank Financial Sector Capacity Building project and
will provide targeted technical assistance consistent with the aim of advancing broader policy
reforms in due course.
52.
Data provision to the Fund remains adequate for surveillance purposes, but
shortcomings affect the analysis of key areas. In particular, in light of their increasing role
in infrastructure investment, the authorities are encouraged to consolidate key public
enterprises in fiscal reporting and the budget. The adoption of the IMD is also a priority.
53.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Ethiopia take place
on the standard 12-month cycle.

Sources: Ethiopian authorities; and Fund staff estimates and projections. The Ethiopian fiscal year ends July 7.
1/ The fiscal accounts include municipal spending by Addis Ababa beginning from 2003/04.
2/ Excluding special programs (demobilization and reconstruction).
3/ Demobilization and reconstruction.
4/ The consolidated budget column presents an estimate based on the actual federal budget and projections for subnational governments.
5/ The domestic debt series has been revised starting from 2000/01 to reflect gross rather than net debt. The non-interest bearing component is approximately
Birr 9.4 billion, of which Birr 8.7 billion reflects NBE advances maturing in 2030 to finance expenditures in connection with the Eritrea conflict.
6/ Poverty-reducing spending is defined consistently with the SDPRP to include total spending on health, education, agriculture, roads and food security.
7/ External interest and amortization are presented before HIPC debt relief from the World Bank and African Development Bank up to 2007/08 for comparability with the authorities'
medium-term fiscal framework.
8/ Debt relief from the IMF under the MDRI is recorded in 2005/06. Pending discussion with the authorities, additional MDRI-funded expenditures are not included in the baseline projections.

Sources: Ethiopian authorities; and Fund staff estimates and projections. The Ethiopian fiscal year ends July 7.
1/ The fiscal accounts include municipal spending by Addis Ababa beginning from 2003/04.
2/ Excluding special programs (demobilization and reconstruction).
3/ Demobilization and reconstruction.
4/ The consolidated budget column presents an estimate based on the actual federal budget and projections for subnational governments.
5/ The domestic debt series has been revised starting from 2000/01 to reflect gross rather than net debt. The non-interest bearing component is approximately
Birr 9.4 billion, of which Birr 8.7 billion reflects NBE advances maturing in 2030 to finance expenditures in connection with the Eritrea conflict.
6/ Poverty-reducing spending is defined consistently with the SDPRP to include total spending on health, education, agriculture, roads and food security.
7/ External interest and amortization are presented before HIPC debt relief from the World Bank and African Development Bank up to 2007/08 for comparability with the authorities'
medium-term fiscal framework.
8/ Debt relief from the IMF under the MDRI is recorded in 2005/06. Pending discussion with the authorities, additional MDRI-funded expenditures are not included in the baseline projections.

ANNEX

The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia--Joint Fund-World Bank Debt
Sustainability Analysis
1.
Ethiopia’s risk of debt distress is moderate. Ethiopia’s external debt burden
indicators under the baseline scenario remain below the relevant policy-dependent indicative
thresholds. However, as illustrated by the “historic scenario”, the favorable evolution of the
debt indicators under the baseline is contingent on a strong performance compared to the
country’s historic track-record. Furthermore, stress tests reveal that the favorable outlook
under the baseline does not provide sufficient comfort against adverse developments, in
particular to less favorable terms for external financing and to exports shocks. This
assessment remains valid when domestic debt is incorporated in the analysis.
2.
This Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) has been prepared jointly by IDA and
IMF staff using the debt sustainability framework for low income countries approved
by the Boards of both institutions.1 The framework takes into account revised data for
2004/05, along with new information received in the context of the 2005 Article IV
consultation discussions, including revised GDP data, strong exports growth, and information
received from donors. As noted in the staff report, political tensions have introduced a greater
than usual degree of uncertainty to current projections, including for donor support levels.
The macroeconomic scenario underlying this DSA is the baseline scenario discussed in the
main body of the staff report and outlined in the supporting tables. Estimated debt
outstanding and disbursed as of end-FY2004/05, provides the basis for debt projections.2 The
DSA assumes full delivery of debt relief under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative, including
topping up, and takes into account IMF debt relief to Ethiopia under the MDRI.3 The
baseline does not incorporate debt relief under the MDRI by IDA and AfDF as the Boards of
both institutions have yet to approve its implementation. However, an alternative baseline
explores the impact of the delivery of MDRI debt relief by the three institutions. The results
of the alternative baseline suggest that the MDRI debt relief from IDA and the AfDB would
lead to a sharp reduction of Ethiopia’s debt burden indicators which may warrant a
reassessment of Ethiopia’s risk of debt distress once the Boards of these institutions approve
the delivery of MDRI.
3.
The salient features of the revised macro framework are the revision of the GDP
series as described in the staff report as well as a strong growth in exports revenue.

1

A debt sustainability analysis for Ethiopia using the LIC DSA template was presented in the context of the
2004 Article IV consultation (IMF Country Report No. 05/27).
2

For IDA and the IMF, actual end-FY2004/05 debt figures were used. For all other creditors, end-FY2004/05
estimates are based on the end-FY2002/03 debt outstanding and disbursed –which was reconciled at the time of
the completion point– updated for actual disbursements and repayments over FY2003/04 – FY2004/05.
3

IMF debt relief to Ethiopia under the MDRI amounts to US$114 million excluding remaining assistance under
the Enhanced HIPC Initiative.

External Debt Sustainability Analysis4

I.

4.
Ethiopia’s NPV of debt-to-exports ratio as of end-2004/05 is estimated at 108
percent. This represents a reduction of 45 percentage points compared to projections made
for the 2004 Article IV Consultation (Table 1). Most of the decrease (about 37 percentage
points) is due to higher growth in exports (exports of goods and services increased by
31 percent in 2003-04 compared to 20 percent estimated in the staff report for the 2004
Article IV Consultation and grew by 22 percent in 2004-05 while the 2004 Article IV
projected a decline of about ½ percent). This increase in exports is due to both a rebound in
export prices (Ethiopian export prices increased by 25 percent in 2004/05 driven largely by a
46 percent increase in coffee prices) coupled by a pick up in exports volume thanks to a good
performance of agricultural production in both 2003/04 and 2004/05. Debt relief provided by
the IMF under the MDRI is estimated to have reduced the ratio of about 7 percentage points.
On the other hand, unanticipated new borrowing would have increased the ratio by about
8 percentage points, most of this was due to higher than expected disbursements.

ANNEX

Although lower than projected during the 2004 Article IV Consultation,
the NPV of debt-to-GDP and the NPV of debt-to-exports ratios are
expected to rise somewhat in the initial years. They would reach 29 percent
and 144 percent in 2012/13, respectively; and are then projected to gradually
decline. External debt service absorbs on average about 6 percent of export
revenues over the next 20 years. It increases from 5 percent to about 8 percent
in 2011/12 – 2013-14 before declining to 5 percent at the end of the projection
period. This patterns is largely driven by the impact on the debt service of the
USD 1.2 billion loan contracted by Ethiopian Airlines for the purchase of
aircrafts and by the significant “front-loading” of the debt service reduction to
Ethiopia under different debt relief initiatives (Enhanced HIPC, topping-up,
and IMF relief under the MDRI).

The favorable evolution of Ethiopia’s debt indicators under the baseline
scenario is contingent upon a relatively ambitious macroeconomic
performance. Under the “historic scenario”, all debt indicators show a
significant deterioration compared to the baseline. Despite the significant debt
reduction achieved in recent years, the NPV of debt-to-exports ratios would
breach its indicative threshold within the next five years and w remain above

According to the latest World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), Ethiopia ranks as
a “medium performer”. The relevant indicative thresholds for this category are: 40 percent for the NPV of debtto-GDP ratio, 150 percent for the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio, 250 percent for the NPV of debt-to-revenue
ratio, 20 percent for the debt service-to-exports ratio and 30 percent for the debt service-to-revenue ratio. These
thresholds are applicable to public and publicly guaranteed external debt.

- 44 -

ANNEX

that level thereafter. Although rising quickly, the ratio of NPV of debt-to-GDP
would only breach its indicative threshold in 2014/15.
•

The stress tests also reveal that Ethiopia’s external debt indicators are
particularly sensitive to the terms of new borrowing6 and negative export
shocks.7 Although the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio deteriorates under most
stress tests, it is when new borrowing is assumed to be contracted on less
favorable terms and under the simulated export shock that the adverse impact
is most significant. Under the less favorable financing scenario, the NPV of
debt-to-exports ratio increases rapidly by as much as 55-60 percentage points
compared to the baseline and is above the appropriate indicative benchmark
within the next five years. A shock to exports, whereby exports would grow
one standard deviation below its historical average during 2006/07 and
2007/08, could result in a NPV of debt-to-exports ratio above 200 percent by
2014/15. Given Ethiopia’s historical vulnerability, such a shock has a nonnegligible probability of occurrence.8

6.
These results underscore the importance Ethiopia to follow a comprehensive
debt management strategy and a prudent borrowing policies. New borrowing should be
on highly concessional terms and with an increased reliance on grant financing. This will be
crucial to keep Ethiopia’s risk of debt distress within acceptable levels. In that regard, it will
be important to monitor closely the evolution of Ethiopia’s debt burden indicators to ensure
that the terms of external financing are consistent with the country’s repayment capacity and
take into consideration its vulnerability to external shocks. Additionally, achieving debt
sustainability will require a continued focus on a prioritization of public investment, and
fostering growth and diversified exports.

6

Under this scenario, external financing is assumed to be provided in less concessional terms than in the
baseline. This scenario could also be assimilated to a sharp decline in grant financing that is compensated by
loans.
7

The standard stress tests performed under the framework for low income countries consider only a first order
impact on macroeconomic variables. Therefore, the projected path of the debt burden indicators under the tests
do not reflect a fully consistent macroeconomic scenario.
8

The standard stress tests performed under the framework for low-income countries have been calibrated to
represent a 20 percent of occurrence 10 years after the period where the shocks are assumed.

ANNEX

Box 1. Ethiopia: Macroeconomic Assumptions Underlying the DSA
Real GDP growth is projected to average about 5.4 percent during 2005/06-2024/25. This is higher than the
historical average of 4.1 percent during 1991/92-2004/05.
• The baseline projection assumes that implementation of the authorities’ PRSP (policies to raise
agriculture productivity; improve the environment for private sector participation, and build physical
infrastructure) succeeds in raising real output growth. Consequently, real output growth in agriculture
production is projected to rise from 2.9 percent (1991/92-2004/05) to 3.9 percent during 2005/06-2024/25,
while growth in non-agriculture GDP is projected to rise from 5.1 percent to 6.4 percent.
• From a growth accounting framework perspective, the emphasis on improving Ethiopia’s physical
infrastructure, particularly electricity generation, roads and telecommunications, raises the ratio of public
investment to GDP by more than 6 percentage points. The contribution by investment to growth is thus
projected to rise to 2.2 percentage points from 1.5 percentage points during 1991/92-2004/05. Total factor
productivity growth is projected to contribute 1.0 percentage point, compared with 0.5 percent historically.
Given already significant achievements in the past, the contribution by labor to growth is projected to
remain around 2.2 percentage points.
Inflation is projected to rise to 10.8 percent in 2005/06, driven by both higher increases in food and nonfood
inflation, the latter partly on account of higher petroleum prices. Consistent with the authorities’ PRSP, inflation
is then projected to decline to an average of 6 percent in 2006/07, and remain at that level thereafter. The real
exchange rate, relative to the U.S. dollar is projected to remain broadly unchanged, consistent with the
authorities’ stated policy of allowing the nominal exchange rate to depreciate in line with the expected inflation
differential between Ethiopia and the U.S.
Export (goods and services) growth in 2005-10, is projected to increase by 12 percent which is 2 points higher
than the average growth registered during the past 10 years. This marks a decline from an average growth of
27 percent growth per year in 2003/04-2004/05.However, caution is needed in comparing averages due to the
very large volatility experienced in the past due in part to the impact of droughts and the war with Eritrea.
Thereafter, exports is expected to increase on average at 10 percent annually, which is slightly higher than the
increase in nominal GDP growth reflecting the impact of government policies in particular the effort to diversify
export bases and improving infrastructures.
The external current account deficit is expected to continue its decrease from its peak level of 2004/05
(9 percent of GDP) to an average of 4 ½ percent of GDP in 2005/06 - 2009/10 and 2 percent in 2005/06 2025/26. The reduction in the deficit is due to the increase in services balance surplus and in transfers (private
and public) despite the growing trade deficit.
External financing. After a decline in aid flows in 2005-06, the baseline assumes that sufficient progress is
made in addressing donors’ concerns to allow a resumption in aid flows in 2006/07 and a return to the levels
originally budgeted for in 2005-06. Despite the increasing share of grants in total external financing,
disbursements are projected to account for 4.0 percent to GDP over 2006/07 – 2015-26 compared to 3.9 in the
past 10 years.
Fiscal policy. The primary deficit (including debt relief from the IMF under the MDRI) is projected to decline
from 4.9 to 1.5 percent of GDP between 2005/06 and 2025/26. The lower primary deficit is driven by higher
revenue and grants totaling 1.1 percent of GDP and lower primary spending by about 1½ percent of GDP. The
increase in revenue and grants reflects a projected increase in grants by 1.7 percent of GDP (including MDRI
from the IMF) as higher tax revenue is more than offset by a decline in nontax revenue. Lower primary spending
is achieved by a continued adjustment in defense and non-priority outlays as a share of GDP to safeguard propoor recurrent expenditures, and adjusting public investment in line with available resources. The interest bill
also remains well contained given the gradual increase in projected real borrowing rates.

ANNEX

Public Debt Sustainability Analysis

7.
The baseline fiscal framework is consistent with lower total public debt and
comfortable debt-service ratios. The NPV of the public debt falls from 51.1 to 39.2 percent
of GDP over the twenty-year projection horizon. A decline in the domestic debt by
15.4 percent of GDP is partly offset by an increase in the NPV of external liabilities by about
3.5 percent of GDP. Debt-service ratios absorb an increasing share of revenue in line with the
gradual increase in projected real borrowing rates, and the high initial level of domestic debt
at 33 percent of GDP. However, debt service remains at manageable levels.
8.
The public debt DSA demonstrates that the principal risks to the scenario
include lower average growth and elevated primary deficits as described below:
•

The main risk to public debt sustainability is permanently lower GDP growth by
one standard deviation relative to the baseline path. This alternative scenario would
result in a higher NPV of public debt by about 25 percent of GDP compared to
2005/06. Moreover, debt service would also reach 13 percent of revenue in 2025/26
compared to just 8 percent in the baseline.

•

Debt sustainability prospects would also be adversely affected if average growth
and the primary deficit remain at historical levels. In this scenario, the NPV of the
public debt increases by 7 percent of GDP compared to 2005/06, and debt service
reaches 11 percent of revenue.

•

The bound tests confirm the sensitivity of public debt sustainability to lower
growth. The NPV of public debt as a share of GDP decreases by 2025/26 in each
bound test except the case of a transitory shock in real GDP growth during 2006/07
and 2007/08 .9 In this case, the NPV of public debt as a share of GDP peaks at
75 percent in 2015/16 after increasing 24 percent of GDP, and debt service reaches
13 percent of revenue compared to 8 percent in the baseline. This example highlights
the challenge of maintaining a sustainable public debt given Ethiopia’s vulnerability
to severe climatic shocks that result in volatile growth swings.

9.
The results of the public DSA reiterate the importance of developing an
comprehensive public debt strategy. The strategy should develop separate targets and
adjustment paths for the domestic and external debt based on a range of fiscal indicators. In
this manner, medium-term budget planning should be anchored by the public debt strategy.
Contingency plans should play an integral role in the strategy to ensure that the public debt
remains sustainable following severe shocks. In this context, lowering the domestic debt
should be a priority to provide scope for higher borrowing to absorb the fiscal impact of
macroeconomic shocks.

9

The bound test for lower real GDP growth is calculated by reducing projected growth by one standard
deviation in 2006/07 and 2007/08. This corresponds to a contraction in real GDP by 0.9 percent compared to the
baseline growth projection of 5.7 percent.

- 47 -

ANNEX

III. Impact of the full delivery of debt relief under the MDRI
10.
Delivery of MDRI debt relief from IDA and the AfDB would improve Ethiopia’s
debt sustainability outlook by leading to a sharp reduction of Ethiopia’s debt burden
indicators (text table).10 The NPV of debt-to export ratio would decrease by about
50 percentage points in the initial year compared to the baseline, and would remain
comfortably below the indicative threshold throughout the projection period. Similarly, the
NPV of debt-to-GDP would decrease by 6 percentage points on average compared to the
baseline. Under the full MDRI scenario, the debt service would average 5.3 percent,
increasing from 3.9 percent in 2006/07 to 7.7 percent in 2012/13 to then decline to about
4.0 percent by the end of the projection period. Albeit the sharp initial impact of MDRI debt
relief, all debt burden indicators converge over time to the pre-MDRI situation, with the NPV
of debt-to-GDP ratio at the end of the projection period above its initial levels.

11.
Under the current CPIA classification, and contingent on a strong economic
performance, a reassessment of Ethiopia’s risk of debt distress could be needed once
MDRI from IDA and the AfDB is approved.
10

This alternative baseline assumes that MDRI debt relief from IDA is implemented starting in July 2006
through the forgiveness of the debt service payments on the debt outstanding and disbursed (DOD) as of endDecember 2003. As for the African Development Fund, it is assumed that debt service payments on the DOD as
of end-December 2004 with retroactive application to January-2006. Under those assumptions, IDA and the
AfDB would deliver MDRI debt relief in the amount of approximately SDR1.6 billion (equivalent to
US$2.3 billion at the exchange rate prevailing at end-December 2005) and US$0.9 billion, respectively.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that NPV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments devided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

1/ Public sector debt corresponds to the general government gross debt, including publicly guaranteed debt to the public enterprises and the external debt of Ethiopia Airlines. The fiscal year ends on July 7.
2/ Gross financing need is defined as the primary deficit plus debt service plus the stock of short-term debt at the end of the last period.
3/ Revenues including grants.
4/ Debt service is defined as the sum of interest and amortization of medium and long-term debt.
5/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
6/ External debt service is presented before debt relief until 2007 for comparability with the authorities' medium-term fiscal framework.

VIII. Safeguards Assessment
Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, an assessment of the National Bank of
Ethiopia (NBE) was completed on September 12, 2001 with respect to the Poverty Reduction
and Growth Facility arrangement approved on March 22, 2001. The NBE made progress in
implementing the recommendations of the safeguards assessment.
IX.

Exchange Rate Arrangement

Effective October 24, 2001, NBE terminated the weekly wholesale foreign exchange
auctions for the birr (Br) and moved all foreign exchange operations to the interbank market.
The current exchange rate regime is classified as managed floating. The transaction-weighted
average interbank market exchange rate on December 31, 2005 was Br 8.681 = US$1.
In March 2004, the authorities eliminated the previous limit of US$1,200 on foreign
exchange purchases for holiday travelers, and in May 2004, allowed nonresident Ethiopians
and nonresident foreign nationals of Ethiopian origin to open current and fixed deposit
1

NPV terms at the decision point under the enhanced framework.

2

Excludes commitment of additional enhanced HIPC assistance of SDR 18.19 million
subject to receipt of satisfactory financial assurances from other creditors.
3

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point
corresponding to interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point, but
not disbursed during the interim period.

accounts in foreign currency. Since March 2001, exporters are allowed to retain 10 percent of
their export proceeds in foreign exchange for an indefinite period. The rest may be retained
for a period of 28 days, after which it has to be converted into local currency by the
customer’s bank using the prevailing transaction rate, unless an exporter spends it on eligible
imports within 28 days. Effective March 2004, the NBE transferred to commercial banks the
responsibility for determining compliance with import and export licensing requirements and
foreign exchange regulations. The multiple currency practice that might have arisen from the
NBE’s weekly foreign exchange auction was lifted with the replacement of the auction by the
interbank foreign exchange market. Remaining current account exchange restrictions relate
to (a) the tax certification requirement for repatriation of investment income; (b) restrictions
on repayment of legally entered into external loans and supplies and foreign partner’s credits;
(c) rules for issuance of import permits; and (d) the requirement to provide a clearance
certificate from NBE to obtain import permits. These restrictions are inconsistent with
Article VIII, Section 2(a) of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement.

APPENDIX II

Ethiopia: Relations with the World Bank
(As of January 2006)1
A.

Partnership in Ethiopia’s Development Strategy

1.
In July 2002, the Government of Ethiopia finalized its full Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (PRSP), known as the Sustainable Development and Poverty Reduction Program
(SDPRP). This was discussed in September 2002 by the Boards of the World Bank and the
Fund, along with a Joint Staff Assessment (JSA). The first Annual Progress Report (APR)
was sent to the Board in February 2004, followed in July 2005 by the second APR. In
December 2005, the Government presented a draft of the second PRSP, an ambitious strategy
called the Plan for Accelerated and Sustained Development to End Poverty (PASDEP), to
cover FY06-FY10. The World Bank, together with the donor community, is providing
feedback for the finalization of the document.
B.

Key Areas of Common Interest to Bank and Fund

2.
Preparation and Implementation of the PRSP. Staff of the Bank and the Fund shared
information and collaborated in providing advice related to the SDPRP, and in supporting the
implementation of SDPRP’s policy reforms. The Bank and the Fund have also collaborated
in providing support in the formulation of the policy and reform agenda needed to support
the Government’s strategy over the next 5 years, the PASDEP. Currently, the Bank and the
IMF are separately reviewing the draft PASDEP, but will start collaborating in the
preparation of the Joint Staff Advisory Note as soon as the final version is received.
3. The Bank and Fund share joint responsibility in supporting financial sector, taxation,
decentralization, and public expenditure reforms. The Bank leads the policy dialogue on
structural reforms relevant to economic growth and poverty reduction, including rural
development, infrastructure, private sector development (PSD), human development,
governance, and vulnerability. Such dialogue is supported by an extensive agenda for
analytical work.
4.
Macroeconomic policy, private sector development, and the financial sector. There
is close cooperation between the World Bank and the IMF in discussing macroeconomic
policy with the Government, particularly in relation to the impact of the current
macroeconomic situation and its implications for an eventual scaling up to achieve the
MDGs. Initial work was undertaken in the joint Pilot Case Study on Public Investment and
Fiscal Policy (presented to the IMF board). A close dialogue has characterized the period of
intensive consultations with the Government following the suspension of direct budget
support. In the context of Ethiopia’s banking sector reforms (including restructuring the
1

APPENDIX II

Commercial Bank of Ethiopia), staff are working together to encourage the Government to
allow the entry of foreign banks into the sector over time, initially by encouraging
international management contracts for domestic banks.
5.
Public sector reforms. The Bank and Fund have been supporting the Government’s
decentralization program with a view to improving the working of the civil service and
improving service delivery at the local level, particularly in terms of improving the incentives
for regional and local level performance in the formula for sub-national transfers of public
resources. In addition, the Bank is providing assistance for civil service reform, tax and
customs administration reform, legal and judicial reforms and urban management, through
the Public Sector Capacity Building Project (US$100 million), approved by the Board in
May 2004, and currently under implementation.
6.
Public expenditure management. Traditionally, the Fund has been an active
participant in Bank-coordinated annual public expenditure reviews (PERs). In FY05, the
Government, together with the Bank, Fund, and Joint Budget Support (JBS) donors,
introduced the first annual Joint Budget and Aid Review (JBAR) as part of a new dialogue
framework around the Government’s own planning and budgeting cycle. This instrument,
together with the Fiduciary Assessment replaces the previous series of PERs. The JBAR’s
primary objective is to review budget allocations – at the sectoral, sub-sectoral, regional and
local levels – in terms of the links to national growth, poverty and human development
outcomes as laid out in the SDPRP. Additionally, in the context of HIPC, the Government,
IDA and the IMF have been tracking the use of savings arising from debt relief. Furthermore,
in the present context in which Ethiopia does not have a PRGF agreement, JBAR discussions
have acquired additional value as an important channel for macroeconomic discussion.
7.
Fiduciary assessments. The Ministry of Finance and Economic Development
(MOFED) conducted a joint fiduciary assessment in FY05 with JBS donors and the Bank.
This represented the first of a series of annual Fiduciary Assessments (FAs). Like the Public
Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) initiative, FAs are intended to consolidate
and replace the various reviews of expenditure management systems in Ethiopia. Aspects of
the PER related to institutional and inter-governmental fiscal design issues, as well as the
Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) and Country Procurement
Assessment Report (CPAR) will now be reflected in the FAs. The Bank is expected to work
closely with the IMF’s AFRITAC on the FAs.
8.
Millennium Development Goals. The Bank and Fund have been closely coordinating
on issues related to scaling up to meet the MDGs, particularly the assessment of the
Government's macroeconomic analysis and development of a financing strategy. The Bank,
together with UN agencies in Ethiopia and the U.N. Millennium Project, has supported the
Government in undertaking sectoral needs assessments to estimate the cost of the
investments required to put Ethiopia on a path to meet the MDGs. A Synthesis report was
issued in December 2005. The Government has grounded its macro-scenarios for the
PASDEP in the planning done for the whole of the MDG period in the Synthesis report with
support from the World Bank. Further support to the Government is expected to take place

- 61 -

APPENDIX II

before the PASDEP is finalized to adapt the PASDEP to the current macroeconomic
environment.
9.
Debt sustainability analysis and the Enhanced HIPC Initiative. The Boards of the
Bank and the Fund agreed on April 20, 2004 that Ethiopia had taken the necessary steps to
reach its HIPC completion point, thereby making irrevocable the US$1.3 billion of NPV debt
relief envisaged at Decision Point in November 2001. The Boards approved also an
exceptional topping-up of debt relief by an additional US$0.7 billion in NPV terms on
account of exogenous factors – particularly changes in the discount rate and exchange rate
since the decision point – that had fundamentally changed Ethiopia's economic circumstances
and thereby adversely affected its debt sustainability. In preparation for the Board
discussions, Bank and Fund staff had jointly monitored progress in meeting the HIPC
triggers necessary to reach Completion Point. The staff jointly updated the debt sustainability
analysis (DSA) prior to Completion Point and for the present paper. Additional debt relief
with an NPV of approximately US$1.5 billion, was announced at the G-8 Summit at
Gleneagles in July 2005.
10. Statistical issues. Both institutions have been providing technical assistance to the
Government on data and statistics, with the Fund focusing on the macroeconomic side and
the Bank supporting the improvement of data on poverty and social indicators, and on the
monitoring of output and outcomes of SDPRP/PASDEP programs. Further work related to
increasing accountability and transparency and to foster structured learning through
appropriate evaluation is currently being planned.
C.

Bank Group Strategy

11.
The Bank’s last Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Ethiopia covered FY03FY05. A Progress Report presented to the Bank’s Board in August 2004 outlined the
progress achieved to date, and recommended a continuation of the existing strategy until a
new CAS was finalized. Preparation for a three-year CAS based on the new PASDEP was
stopped due to recent political developments. An Interim Country Assistance Strategy
(ICAS) covering the next 15 months is currently under preparation and is expected to be
discussed at the Bank’s Board in late March.
12.
The Bank’s proposed ICAS will aim to support Government in developing, achieving
consensus with citizens on, and implementing a strengthened program of institution building
and governance reform that will help in its efforts to accelerate pro-poor growth. This
strategy will also recognize the importance of continued efforts to promote long-term
economic growth, and reflects the need for good governance in supporting economic growth
by raising investor confidence, building infrastructure rapidly, improving the provision of
critical basic services for poor people, managing vulnerabilities and preserving the potential
for an eventual return to a scaling-up by protecting institutional capital.
13.
As of January 20, 2006, Ethiopia’s portfolio of IDA operations comprised 22 active
projects, with total net commitments of US$1,614 million and an undisbursed balance of

- 62 -

APPENDIX II

US$912.3 million. This compares with 18 projects, commitments of US$1,795 million, and
an undisbursed amount of US$835 million in March, 2003 when the current CAS was
discussed by the Board. Total disbursements to Ethiopia in FY05 amounted to US$373
million (of which US$195 million of grants), compared to US$422 million (US$179 million
in grants) in FY04 andUS$362 million (with no grants) in FY03.

Ethiopia: Statistical Issues
General
1.
The statistical base is broadly adequate to conduct effective surveillance, despite
shortcomings in certain areas. Recognizing the importance of accurate and timely data for
macroeconomic policy formulation and monitoring progress with implementation of the
PRSP, the authorities have developed a comprehensive Medium-Term National Statistical
Program. The program, which will be implemented over a period of five years, addresses
data deficiencies in each of the major socio-economic sectors and has been identified as an
essential element of the authorities’ efforts to strengthen the Monitoring and Evaluation
System of the PRSP. Ethiopia is a participant in the General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS) and its metadata were initially posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards
Bulletin Board (DSBB) in November 2002. These metadata were last updated in September
2004. Ethiopia also participates in the GDDS project for Anglophone Africa and had been
receiving technical assistance in the fiscal and external sectors under this project.
Real sector
2.
The authorities have improved the timeliness and coverage of national accounts,
economic surveys, and price data since 1993. Preliminary national accounts are available
through 2003/04 (July 8-July 7). A new series of GDP estimates, updating the base year from
1980/81 to 1999/2000, is under construction and is expected to be released shortly.
Additionally, with technical assistance from AFRITAC East, the authorities have been
developing an Establishment Census designed to collect data on a range of economic
indicators (e.g. employment, capital stock, inputs and outputs) for all business
establishments. The first census was conducted during March 2004. Following the successful
completion of the program to amend the methodological framework of the consumer price
index, the authorities have been working on a production price index with technical
assistance from AFRITAC East. In February 2005, the authorities revised the nonfood index
of the CPI by imposing a constant value on the charges for money transfers. Fund staff is
working with the authorities to review regional reporting of data to the Central Statistical
Authority (CSA) to ensure data integrity.
Public finances
3.
Monthly federal government accounts are reported with a six- to eight-week lag.
Under the PRGF arrangement, progress was made in 2002/03 in improving the quality and
coverage of reporting on the consolidated general government and consolidating federal and
regional budgets, inclusive of all extra budgetary funds and accounts. However, with the
ongoing decentralization of fiscal powers to woredas (districts), ensuring the integrity of the
consolidated budget reporting will be an ongoing task. Progress was also made in 2002/03 in
eliminating discrepancies between data on the domestic and foreign financing of the budget
deficit and the monetary accounts. With the assistance of a STA mission which visited Addis
Ababa in 2003, the joint reconciliation committee, composed by the Ministry of Finance and

- 64 -

APPENDIX III

Economic Development (MOFED) and the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE), established a
short-term work program to achieve the reconciliation of provisional quarterly fiscal and
monetary data for 2001/02 and 2002/03. This action was also a performance criterion under
the Third Annual Program of the PRGF and a trigger for the completion point under the
HIPC Initiative. The second assessment of the public expenditure management systems,
which was conducted by FAD in 2004, identified a lack of timely fiscal reporting as a key
concern, particularly as it hampers the management of fiscal policy within the year. As a
result, a detailed action plan for improving the public expenditure management system has
been developed.
Monetary accounts
4.
The monetary survey is reported with a six-week lag to AFR and with a three-month
lag to STA. Two STA technical assistance missions in 2004 found that the quality of
monetary and financial statistics was compromised by various methodological problems. The
missions recommended correcting a number of instances of misclassification of accounting
data, assisted the central bank in compiling the standardized report forms (SRFs) for
reporting monetary statistics to STA, and worked with the authorities and AFR to establish
an Integrated Monetary Database (IMD). The follow-up mission in September 2004 finalized
the IMD. Thereafter, the authorities started providing SRF-based data for the National Bank
of Ethiopia (NBE) and the other depository corporations to STA on a regular basis, until
December 2004. At present, there is a need for the NBE to resume data submissions based on
the SRF and IMD framework.
Balance of payments
5.
Balance of payments data still require improvements in the coverage, valuation,
timing, and classification of transactions. Between April 2004 and March 2006, a total of five
balance of payments statistics missions will be completed in the context of the GDDS project
for Anglophone Africa. With assistance from the expert, the authorities plan to publish data
consistent with the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual later this year. Under the
project, improvements have been developed in questionnaire design and data collection
procedures. Also, improved methods were introduced for cif/fob valuation adjustments for
imports, external aid, trade credit, and financial account transactions of the banks.
Social indicators
6.
Data on poverty exist in the form of several household surveys regularly conducted
by the Central Statistical Authority (CSA).1 In addition, the World Bank has produced
1

Examples of existing surveys include the Household Income, Consumption, and
Expenditure Survey (1995/96, 1999/2000, and 2004/05) and the Welfare Monitoring Survey
(1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2004). Additional household and consumption surveys were
carried out by the University of Addis Ababa in collaboration with Oxford University.

- 65 -

APPENDIX III

reports on Education and Health Sector Development Programs, as well as the Poverty and
Policies for the New Millennium Report (1999), which contain data on the poverty situation.
On the basis of this information, the government, with assistance from the World Bank, has
constructed welfare indicators for measuring poverty reduction, including income and
expenditure per capita, income inequality, literacy, malnutrition, and infant/child mortality
measures. During 2004/05 the authorities conducted a number of surveys aimed at measuring
household welfare, including: (i) a Participatory Poverty Assessment; (ii) the Household
Income, Consumption and Expenditure Survey (HICES); and (iii) a Welfare Monitoring
Survey. Data from surveys are currently being processed. Adequate data do not exist on
prevalence rates of HIV/AIDS, especially among the rural population, and it is not clear
whether there is sufficient monitoring of food consumption among people living in droughtprone areas. The Welfare Monitoring Survey, conducted in 2004/05, is expected to include a
number of indicators relating to HIV/AIDS.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
March 15, 2006

This statement provides additional information that has become available since the
issuance of the staff report for Ethiopia. This information does not alter the thrust of the staff’s
assessment.
•

The crop forecast for the main 2005/06 Meher harvest issued by the Central Statistical
Agency projects a 15 percent increase in grain production, driven mainly by a 10 percent
increase in yields. If confirmed this would suggest an annual real GDP growth rate closer to
the authorities’ projection of 7 percent. Crop estimates to be released in April/May will
provide firmer indications of whether grain yields are indeed set to record their highest
levels on record.

•

January inflation was in line with staff’s projections with the general year-on-year CPI rate
declining to 11.5 percent, reflecting lower food and non-food inflation rates.

•

Preliminary federal revenue and expenditure data for the first half of 2005/06 are also
consistent with meeting staff’s annual projections. During this period the federal deficit
reached 2.6 percent of full-year GDP. This was largely financed by an increase in domestic
financing, which offset lower external support.

•

Annualized export growth of 21 percent in the first half of 2005/06 was broadly in line with
staff projections, while import growth of 26 percent was somewhat faster. Fuel imports of
US$300 million were consistent with the end-year projection of US$700 million. As noted
in the staff report, through end-December, net international reserves fell by US$323 million
to around 3 months of imports. This is in line with the full-year projection, which took into
account expected donor disbursements targeted to support regional social service delivery.
No additional data on international reserves have been released to Fund staff.

•

Broad money growth slowed to 17.2 percent (year-on-year) in December 2005 reflecting the
decline in net foreign assets. While domestic credit growth remained strong, rising by
34 percent year-on-year, and higher than staff’s end-year projection of 20.6 percent. Net
bank borrowing by the government reached 1.3 percent of GDP in the first half of the year.
This was entirely financed by the National Bank of Ethiopia. However, consistent with the
government’s commitments in December to shift financing away from the central bank,
treasury bill issuance has subsequently risen, and data through March 1, 2006, show a Birr
1.4 billion (1.2 percent of GDP) increase in commercial bank treasury bill holdings.

•

As of March 10, 2006, there has been no adjustment in domestic fuel prices, although the
authorities have reiterated their commitment to implementing this during the 2005/06 fiscal
year.

•

•

- 68 Reports have emerged of an outbreak of Avian flu in a poultry farm in the south of the
country. These have yet to be officially confirmed and staff will continue to monitor
developments.
To date, 90 of the 109 elected opposition parliamentarians have taken their seats. UN reports
indicate that tension on the Eritrean border has decreased. Ethiopia’s main donors have
reconfirmed that they are continuing to provide project aid, while reiterating that a
resumption of direct budget support will require progress in addressing concerns over
political governance and human rights.

No further information has been received regarding the remaining current account restrictions
inconsistent with Article VIII section 2(a) and staff are not recommending approval of such
restrictions at this time.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with the
Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia
On March 17, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia.1
Background
Ethiopia continues to pursue its development strategy aimed at achieving the Millennium
Development Goals. However, it faces political uncertainties, both from unresolved tensions
stemming from the May 2005 national elections, and over the border demarcation with Eritrea,
which are impacting donor support. Ethiopia’s largely agricultural economy also remains
vulnerable to climatic shocks, which have resulted in wide swings in output with severe effects
for the poor. Even after two successive years of good harvests, and favorable prospects for
2005/06, the total number of people identified as requiring humanitarian assistance in 2006 is
estimated at 11 million.
In 2004/05, the economy grew by 8.8 percent, the second year of rapid expansion after the
recent drought. The average annual consumer price inflation rate declined to 6.8 percent in
2004/05, from 8.6 percent in 2003/04, although the year-end rate rose to 13 percent. While the
nominal exchange rate against the US dollar remains highly stable, the trend of real
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.
1

-2–
depreciation experienced in 2004/05 reversed during early 2005/06, reflecting a relative
strengthening of the US dollar, and a pick up in Ethiopia’s inflation. The National Bank of
Ethiopia’s (NBE) gross reserves rose during 2004/05 to the equivalent of 3.9 months import
cover, but have declined in the first 5 months of 2005/06.
The government’s domestic borrowing rose to 3.5 percent of GDP in 2004/05—2 percent of
GDP higher than budgeted—as a result of shortfall in revenues and aid inflows, and the stock of
government’s domestic debt remained high at 35 percent of GDP. Capital spending rose
sharply as the government began to scale-up domestically-financed spending on infrastructure,
which was reflected in an increase in overall poverty spending.
Broad money growth in 2004/05 and through November 2005, was entirely due to an expansion
of net domestic assets, including sharp increases in credit to the private sector and public
enterprises. At the same time, commercial bank’s excess reserves rose to over 30 percent of
deposits as the NBE met government financing needs, and the dominant Commercial Bank of
Ethiopia (CBE) sharply reduced its holdings of treasury bills. The external current account deficit
(after official transfers) widened to 9.1 percent of GDP in 2004/05, in spite of export growth of
36 percent. Imports rose by 40 percent, or about US$1 billion. About a third of this increase
reflected higher fuel costs.
Ethiopia has continued to implement its financial restructuring program, and met the plan’s
2004/05 non performing loan and capital adequacy ratio targets for the CBE. Progress has also
been made on strengthening public expenditure management. Ethiopia secured debt relief from
the IMF under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative in December 2005. It reached the completion
point under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative in April 2004.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the recent strong growth performance, led by an improvement in
the agricultural sector. However, they emphasized the need to maintain a stable
macroeconomic framework, and in that regard, noted the importance of containing inflation and
emerging pressures on the balance of payments. Looking ahead, the main challenge will be to
sustain strong growth to meet the development objectives and to reduce poverty. Directors
recommended that the authorities begin to set the stage for the evolution of a vibrant private
sector that will complement the state’s own economic development efforts. They stressed the
importance of accelerating the structural reform agenda, in particular in order to raise
agricultural productivity and boost private sector growth. The resumption of the privatization
program and introduction of a competition policy are steps in the right direction in this regard,
but they need to be supported by a strengthened legal and regulatory framework.
Directors considered that significantly higher levels of external assistance will be required to
sustain growth at levels that would reduce poverty—which remains widespread—and meet the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). They welcomed the presentation of a scenario laying
out the financing requirements as well as the policy challenges for meeting the MDGs.
They stressed that, in line with the Monterey Consensus, donor efforts will need to be
complemented by a sound development strategy and strong governance systems.
Directors encouraged the authorities to engage in a constructive dialogue with all concerned

-3–
parties to resolve outstanding political issues and generate the conditions for a resumption of
donor budget support. They also stressed the need to strengthen public expenditure
management and ensure that aid and resources set free by the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
are used in an efficient and macroeconomically sound manner.
Directors agreed that improving Ethiopia’s infrastructure will be essential to enhancing its
growth prospects. However, scaling up domestically financed investments by public enterprises
risks jeopardizing the balance of payments position and macroeconomic stability. Against this
background, Directors welcomed the authorities’ decision to postpone some public enterprise
infrastructure imports and their commitment to take additional measures, as necessary,
to ensure an adequate level of international reserves. At the same time, administrative controls
should be avoided as they could have an adverse impact on the private sector.
Directors recommended that fiscal policy should support monetary policy in containing inflation
and be focused on limiting domestic bank financing and ensuring debt sustainability.
They welcomed the expenditure cuts introduced this year, as well as the proposal to pass
through higher oil prices to consumers by reducing the domestic fuel subsidy—stressing the
need to implement this promptly. Nevertheless, a tighter fiscal stance might be required to
contain demand and to stabilize the balance of payments. Directors also saw a need to better
prioritize expenditures, with the objective of strengthening pro-poor spending and establishing
an effective social safety net, while improving public expenditure management. Looking further
ahead, domestic borrowing should be reduced in order to contain debt levels and provide room
to respond to unexpected shocks. Efforts are also needed to improve the buoyancy of the tax
regime to ensure that revenue growth keeps up with the growth of recurrent expenditures.
Directors supported the authorities’ request for technical assistance from the Fund in the area of
tax and customs policy, including on the structure and level of tariff exemptions. They noted the
importance of ensuring a non-discriminatory tax and tariff structure to encourage private sector
development and foreign direct investment.
Directors called for the close monitoring of large public enterprises, and urged the authorities to
move in the direction of incorporating the activities of these enterprises into the consolidated
fiscal accounts to help illuminate the fiscal risks stemming from the government’s on-lending of
external financing to public enterprises and its guarantees on domestic borrowing by public
enterprises. Directors stressed that the debt of public enterprises and the government’s
contingent liabilities should be fully taken into account in a comprehensive debt management
strategy.
Directors called for a tightening of monetary policy. They observed that the high level of
commercial bank excess reserves—most of which are held by the state-owned Commercial
Bank of Ethiopia (CBE)—constrains the use of indirect monetary instruments. In this context,
Directors agreed that, at the current stage of development of the monetary system, imposing a
direct ceiling on the CBE’s credit operations would be the most reliable means of guarding
against excessive credit expansion without compromising credit extension to the private sector,
which remains at a relatively low level.

-4–
Directors agreed that external competitiveness is adequate, and that the current managed
floating exchange rate system has served Ethiopia well. At the same time, they saw scope for
increased flexibility to allow the exchange rate to reflect balance of payments developments
going forward.
Directors welcomed the signs of improvement in the financial sector, with a steady decline in
nonperforming loans and a general strengthening of capital adequacy ratios. At the same time,
prudential supervision of the banking system needs to be strengthened. Directors called for
further financial sector reforms over the medium term, aimed in particular at increasing banking
sector competition, in order to support the efficient allocation of financial resources in the
economy, encourage the development of the private sector, and boost long-term growth
prospects.
Directors commended the authorities for their commitment to maintain a close relationship with
the Fund. They looked forward to further discussions of how the Fund could best contribute to
the achievement of the authorities’ economic objectives in the period ahead.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Peter Gakunu, Alternate Executive Dicrector
for The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and
Gualberto Campos, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
March 17, 2006
1.
The Ethiopian authorities thank staff and Fund management for the constructive
engagement with Ethiopia. The authorities view the set of papers produced by staff as fair
and balanced and as providing helpful policy advice on the way going forward. The
authorities also thank the Executive Board for its continued support. They are particularly
grateful for the Board’s approval of Ethiopia’s qualification for debt relief under the MDRI
in December 2005 and they take this opportunity to reassure the Board of their commitment
to prudent macroeconomic policies and poverty reduction objectives. These additional
resources will allow the authorities to substantially increase spending in priority areas to
reduce poverty, promote growth, and to make genuine progress towards achieving the
MDGs. They are, however, fully aware that many challenges still lie ahead, especially to
overcome the deep-rooted poverty prevailing in the country. They will, therefore, continue to
count on the Fund and the donor community for assistance.
2.
Democratic elections were held in May 2005. The elections were characterized by
high voter turnout, open debate and greater political participation. Regrettably tensions
emerged in the post election period, leading to violence, detentions and boycott of the new
parliament by the main opposition party. Following these developments, donors switched
their assistance from general budgetary support to targeted regional social services and the
authorities had to scale back their public sector investment program.
3.
Meanwhile, the independent Boundary Commission that drew up the frontier in the
border dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea held a meeting recently with representatives
from both countries. The meeting was characterized as constructive by the UN SecretaryGeneral. Negotiations continue, aimed at reducing border tensions and finding a peaceful and
lasting solution to the dispute by agreeing to a permanent demarcation of the border.
Recent Economic Developments
4.
Ethiopia’s economy continued to expand solidly for the second consecutive year.
Real GDP in 2004/2005 grew by 8.8 percent following the impressive growth rate of 11.6
percent attained in 2003/04. Instrumental to this good performance were the structural
reforms implemented in previous years under the PRGF-supported program. Agricultural
output was strong, led by export crops. However, drought and starvation continue to plague
the country. Indeed, although agro-food production has been steadily increasing, the
Ethiopian population keeps growing at a higher rate, which in practice leads to a chronically
structural food deficit. The authorities are aware of this dilemma and continue to make all
efforts to improve food security and assist the populations in need, particularly through the
Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP), which is essentially a multi-sector program that
remunerates the poor with cash and food for their contribution in specific public work
projects.

-25.
During the last two years, the authorities started implementing a vast program of
infrastructure upgrading with the view to strengthening the business environment and
improving economic competitiveness. The program includes rehabilitation and construction
of roads, reinforcement of power capacity and rural electrification and improvement of
telecommunication systems. As a result, in 2004/05 fiscal capital spending rose significantly,
while aid inflows decreased substantially. Due to the persistence of drought, the authorities
also increased poverty-alleviating spending. Consequently, the fiscal deficit jumped to 6
percent of GDP, while government’s domestic borrowing was 2 percent higher than planned.
In addition, annual inflation increased, reflecting in large part aggregate demand pressures
associated with the implementation of various infrastructure projects.
6.
Broad money in 2004/05 grew in line with the expansion of net domestic assets
linked to increases in credit to the private sector and public enterprises. At the same time,
imports rose by 40 percent, while exports were also on the rise, particularly coffee and nontraditional exports, including flowers and spices, and non-factor services. The birr continued
to depreciate gradually against the US dollar, but has slightly appreciated in recent times in
line with the pick up in inflation. Gross official reserves rose to 3.9 months of imports in
2004/05 but dropped to 3 months in the first half of 2005/06 reflecting higher fuel prices and
increased imports of capital goods in line with infrastructure upgrading.
Medium-Term Strategy and Economic Program for 2005/06
7.
The Ethiopian authorities are determined to maintain macroeconomic stability and
continue to monitor closely all macro indicators. They are fully committed to implementing
appropriate fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies and continue to place high priority in
the creation of a sustainable macroeconomic environment, which is essential to enhance
growth performance and address the widespread prevalence of poverty.
8.
The medium-term strategy is embedded in the authorities’ Plan for Accelerated and
Sustained Development to End Poverty (PASDEP), which was recently updated according to
the MDG Needs Assessment Synthesis Report. It aims at bolstering the conditions for
sustained high levels of economic growth needed to reduce poverty and achieve the MDGs,
including halving poverty by 2015. Key macroeconomic objectives include annual real
growth rate of GDP and of GDP per capita of about 7 percent and 4.7 percent respectively. In
support of growth projections for achieving the MDGs, the authorities have estimated the
total costs at US$101 billion with an upper and a lower bound cost of US$58 billion and
US$76 billion respectively. Such scenario will require current aid flows to double as a
percentage of GDP. The spending will be largely directed to construction and upgrading of
infrastructure, improvement of agriculture performance and institutional capacity building.
9.
In accordance with the medium term scenario, the economic policy agenda for
2005/06 estimated a real GDP growth of 7 percent, which would be supported by strong
agricultural production and large public infrastructure investments. Inflation was projected at
9.5 percent, tanking into account that the authorities plan to adjust fuel prices substantially.
However, as aid flows have drastically decreased since November 2005, the authorities had
to opt for radical cuts in the investment programs of the power and telecommunication

-3sectors in order to ease pressures on the balance of payments, while they look for alternative
external sources of financing.
10.
The authorities are committed to reducing government domestic borrowing over the
medium-term. They are also determined to enhance the effectiveness of public spending,
while promoting strong economic growth and meeting poverty reduction goals. In this
connection, the authorities intend to go ahead with reforms aimed at strengthening public
expenditure management, for which they have requested technical assistance from the Fund.
The authorities intend also to take measures to improve tax administration, focused
particularly at strengthening revenue, customs and regional tax administrations. They plan to
adjust retail prices for petroleum products with a view to removing subsidies, which are
currently being financed from domestic bank borrowing by the Ethiopian Petroleum
Enterprise. The authorities are aware that these price subsidies on fuels contribute to
crowding out financing for the private sector, while they will affect the budget at a later
stage.
11.
Monetary and exchange rate policies will be geared towards achieving inflation
objectives and defending the reserve position of at least 3 months of imports. The authorities
will also continue to monitor closely the evolution of the real exchange rate with a view to
taking appropriate measures to discourage any strong appreciation that would affect
economic competitiveness and threaten the current policy of export diversification. In case
additional balance of payments pressures emerge, the authorities are also ready to take
measures that will promote greater exchange rate flexibility.
12.
The authorities will continue to implement the financial sector strategy initiated some
years ago, while the Central Bank of Ethiopia (CBE) will continue to implement its financial
restructuring program. Overall, the banking sector continued to show signs of improvement
in 2004/05, as all but one commercial bank reported capital ratios above the minimum
required. Nevertheless, the authorities are determined to take further financial sector reforms
in the medium term if needed to increase competition in the banking system. The Fund is
currently assisting the authorities with technical assistance in the areas of bank supervision
and payment systems, while the Bank is preparing a Financial Sector Capacity Building
Project, which will prepare the ground for broader policy reform.
13.
Despite a wide-range of structural reforms implemented over the years, the authorities
acknowledge that Ethiopia needs to firmly pursue the reform agenda to underpin increased
efficiency in the economy. Hence, they intend to accelerate the pace of reforms to further
encourage rural and private sector development to support faster growth and employment
creation and achieving the MDGs. In this connection, work is underway with the support of
the Bank, to improve government service delivery to the private sector, including credit
access.
14.
Nevertheless, the authorities are of the view that their growth strategy will also
continue to rely on state intervention to support economic diversification and exports,
particularly in the sectors of horticulture, floriculture, textiles, garment and leather. The
support includes the establishment of training institutes and a variety of incentives to

-4companies. The authorities’ growth strategy is modeled on that followed by many East Asian
countries, which proved to be successful. They recognize, nonetheless, the distortions that
some policies may entail and acknowledge their willingness to review some aspects of trade
policy.
Conclusion
15.
The Ethiopian authorities look forward to maintaining the excellent and productive
relations and the support they have enjoyed from the Fund and the international community,
which they consider pivotal in assisting Ethiopia to meet the many challenges that still lie
ahead. Indeed, achieving the MDGs will require high levels of external assistance. Although
the authorities are not looking for a financial arrangement with the Fund at this time, they see
the Fund’s signaling to donors as instrumental for a scaling up of aid and are willing to
consider any viable option in their future relations with the Fund, including through a Policy
Support Instrument.
