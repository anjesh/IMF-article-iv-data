•

While macroeconomic performance remains relatively strong, a number of slippages have
occurred under the program. The mission reached agreement on a package of front-loaded
measures to address these slippages, at a time of growing budgetary pressures related to the
forthcoming presidential elections in early 2006.

•

Discussions for the 2004 Article IV consultation and the fourth review under the Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement were held in Kampala during October
13-27, 2004 by a staff team comprising Messrs. Clément (head), Mikkelsen, and Peiris (all
AFR), Mr. Espejo (PDR), Ms. Gonzalez (FAD), and Ms. Rondon (assistant, AFR). The team
was assisted by Mr. Allum, the Senior Resident Representative in Uganda. The mission met
with President Museveni; the then Minister of Finance, Planning, and Economic
Development, Mr. Gerald Ssendaula; the Vice-Governor of the Bank of Uganda; and other
senior government officials. The staff also met with representatives of the civil society,
including members of parliament, nongovernmental organizations, the private sector, and the
international community. The mission coordinated its work with an overlapping World Bank
mission.

•

The attached letter of intent from the Minister of Finance (Appendix I) reviews the
performance under the PRGF arrangement during April-September 2004 and sets out
program targets through June 2005. The authorities are requesting waivers for four
quantitative performance criteria.

•

At the conclusion of the 2002 Article IV consultation on February 12, 2003, Executive
Directors commended the authorities for their sustained pursuit of sound financial policies.
They also noted the consistent implementation of a comprehensive country-owned poverty
reduction strategy. In this respect, however, they suggested that achieving the long-term
goals for poverty reduction would require higher growth rates, underpinned by higher
private investment, enhanced mobilization of domestic resources, improved governance and
budget management, and strengthened financial intermediation.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

The performance under the program supported by the Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF) was mixed. Four quantitative performance criteria for end-June 2004
were missed. While the two structural performance criteria for June and September were
met, eight out of ten benchmarks were missed. The authorities are requesting waivers for
nonobservance of the four performance criteria based on corrective actions, including
eight prior actions.

•

Uganda is at a crossroad. The impressive economic recovery over the past decade, driven
by a first wave of reforms, has tapered off. Now, Uganda needs to launch a second wave
of reforms to sustain high economic growth and poverty reduction.

•

In 2003/04, real GDP grew by an estimated 5.9 percent, while population grew by
3.4 percent—one of the highest in the world. Inflation remained low, although prices
have picked up recently because of higher food prices. Strong growth in noncoffee
exports contributed to a decline in the external current account deficit, while aid inflows
were greater than anticipated and private capital inflows held steady. International
reserves grew faster than envisaged to the equivalent of about 6½ months of imports. The
Uganda shilling has appreciated by about 10 percent in real effective terms since
December 2003.

•

The fiscal consolidation envisaged in the program for 2003/04 was not achieved. This
reflected a combination of excess spending, covering public administration and net
lending operations to private enterprises, and low tax revenues. While base money
slightly missed the program target for 2003/04, it was in line with the program in
September 2004.

•

The outlook for the economy in 2004/05 remains favorable, although real GDP growth is
projected to decline due to the ongoing drought. The program envisages fiscal
consolidation of about 1 percent of GDP through strengthened revenue mobilization and
expenditure management. At the same time, the government will strengthen policies to
monitor and reduce domestic arrears and implement a comprehensive restructuring
program of the Uganda Revenue Authority (URA). The authorities are also determined to
revive public administration reforms. The monetary program aims to maintain low
inflation. The Bank of Uganda (BOU) will continue to pursue a flexible exchange rate
policy and sterilize liquidity injections through a combination of foreign exchange sales
and issuance of treasury bills. To foster private investment, the authorities will continue
to implement measures to deepen the financial system, including by selling a minority
share and management responsibilities of the Uganda Development Bank Limited
(UDBL) and reforming of the pension system. Moreover, they will adopt an anti-money
laundering law that conforms with international standards.

•

The government intends to complete the privatization program within the next couple of
years, and it is seeking an agreement with private investors to launch a major hydropower
project. As part of the government’s anti-corruption policy, constitutional reforms are
under way to strengthen the powers of the Inspector General of Government (IGG).

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Uganda, a post-conflict and landlocked country, is at a crossroad. The impressive
economic growth and poverty reduction achieved over the past decade—through a first wave
of far-reaching political, institutional, and economic reforms—have tapered off in recent
years. Uganda now needs to launch a second wave of reforms to achieve higher export-led
growth, reduce poverty, and decrease aid dependency. Moreover, the reinforcement of the
ongoing democratization process and a return to peace in northern Uganda and in the Great
Lakes region would support this process. Against this background, the government is
revising its Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP).
2.
The government has pledged that
presidential and parliamentary elections in
2006 will be contested on a multi-party basis.
This issue is currently subject to a constitutional
review process together with the possibility of
lifting the two-term presidential limit. The
government plans to put these issues to a
referendum in 2005.

where 63 percent of the population lives below the poverty line. About 80 percent of the
LRA fighters are reported to be children. This situation has led to continued pressures on
defense expenditures.

The Article IV discussions on key lessons from the past decade and medium-term
challenges for the future are presented in Section II. Recent economic developments and
performance under the program are presented in Section III, and policy discussions on the
medium-term framework and the program for 2004/05 are in Section IV. Program
monitoring and risks are discussed in Section V. The staff appraisal is in Section VI.
II. KEY LESSONS AND MEDIUM-TERM CHALLENGES
5.
In the context of the Article IV discussions, the staff has looked backward, with the
authorities and representatives of the civil society and the international community, to assess
the positive aspects of, and the difficulties encountered in, Uganda’s implementation of its
economic reform agenda in the past decade. From this analysis, key lessons have been drawn
and future challenges discussed for the government’s poverty reduction and growth strategy,
as formulated in the forthcoming revised PEAP.

-6-

Key lessons
6.
After more than a decade of declining per capita income, Uganda has
experienced an impressive post-conflict recovery since the mid-1980s. Initially, the
improved security situation stimulated economic growth, but inflation remained high and
investments were still sluggish. However, economic performance gained momentum in the
1990s with the implementation of a strong macroeconomic stabilization program and
extensive liberalization (see table below).1 As a result, real GDP per capita grew by
3.5 percent a year in the decade from 1992/93, more than offsetting the losses of the 1970s2
and supporting a remarkable reduction in poverty.

7.
However, the authorities expressed concern about the slower pace of economic
growth in recent years. Combined with rising population growth, real GDP per capita
growth fell to about 2 percent while the declining trend in poverty started to be reversed.
These developments suggest a number of weaknesses that will need to be addressed if
sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction are to be achieved.3 Regarding economic
growth, two main issues arise:

1

With an overall IMF trade restrictiveness rating of 2 (with 10 being the most restrictive) Uganda’s trade
regime is among the most liberal in Africa.
2

3

Real GDP per capita declined by about 35 percent in the 1970s.

With a 2 percent GDP per capita growth rate, it will take about 35 years to double GDP per capita. A
1 percentage point increase in the growth rate will reduce the required time by about 10 years.

-7•

Evidence suggests that the contribution to real GDP growth from total factor
productivity (TFP) growth has been minor, while the accumulation of capital has
been the main contributor since the mid-1980s.4 This raises the concern that it may be
difficult to sustain growth beyond the catching-up effects from the conflict years.

•

The high population growth has levied a burden on economic development.
Despite slower growth in the mid-1990s due to the increasing prevalence of
HIV/AIDS, the population grew on average by 3.2 percent during 1985-2003.
Together with very low TFP growth, this significantly limits Uganda’s ability to
rapidly boost living standards.

8.
Although macroeconomic stability was achieved, the fiscal deficit, excluding
grants, increased markedly since the mid-1990s, led by a donor-supported expansion in
poverty-reducing spending. The deficit averaged about 9 percent of GDP in the decade
since 1992/93 and has since risen further. The authorities agreed with staff that the
sterilization needs resulting from the liquidity injection have caused currency appreciation
pressure and domestic interest rates to rise. Moreover, given that tax revenues have stagnated
at 11-12 percent of GDP since the mid-1990s, the large donor inflows (about 50 percent of
total government expenditures) have made the budget vulnerable to uncertain aid
disbursements. At the same time, public expenditure management needs to be strengthened
(Box 1), although Uganda’s public expenditure management systems perform relatively well
compared with those of other African countries (Appendix VI).
9.
Although Uganda has made remarkable progress in establishing the basis for a
sound and profitable financial system, financial intermediation remains low.5 The health
of the banking system improved substantially following the closure of several distressed
banks and the privatization of the Uganda Commercial Bank in September 2002. However,
the authorities noted that the bank’s balance sheets still reflect their preference for liquid and
low-risk assets related to a number of structural impediments (including contract
enforcement problems, poor credit discipline, and limited use of collateral). By regional
standards, interest spreads are also high because operating costs and credit risk are high, and
competition is weak. Despite growing micro finance institutions (MFIs), gaps remain in the
provision of financial services to agriculture, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs),
and infrastructure.
10.
The authorities concurred that the flexible exchange rate regime has served
Uganda well, helping to cushion the impact of exogenous shocks while maintaining external
competitiveness.6

See Uganda—Selected Issues and Statistical Appendix (1/31/05). In Chapter 1, total factor productivity is
estimated to have contributed to economic growth by only 0.3 percent annually.

Box 1. Efficiency of Public Expenditures
Raising the efficiency of public expenditure is a crucial step in the strive for fiscal consolidation while achieving
poverty reduction. A concerted effort is required to overcome problems that have undermined the efficiency of
public spending in recent years:
•

The public service reform and pay reform have stalled. The growing public administration has become
fragmented, with a significant duplication of functions, and pay scales are inadequate. Efforts to streamline
the public administration have faced repeated delays because some reforms require passing constitutional
amendments.

•

Intra-year budget reallocations have become widespread, because of under-budgeting in some areas and
pressures from certain powerful spending units, including the State House. Reallocations have normally been
implemented through supplementary budgets with prior approval from parliament, but ex-post approvals are
becoming more frequent. Overruns in some areas are mostly financed by cuts in others, which distorts the
original budget intentions, weakens the public expenditure management systems, and causes an irregular cash
flow to spending units, generating domestic arrears. These irregularities have also undermined the execution
of external development projects by reducing funds for counterpart financing.

•

Management of arrears remains weak. Mechanisms for controlling arrears have limited coverage and are
ineffective. The Commitment Control System (CCS) does not cover wages, pensions, or statutory and local
government expenditure. There is no systematic tracking and reporting of the overall stock of arrears, and
accounting officers who do not comply with CCS requirements are not sanctioned.

•

Local governments’ administration capacity are weak. They have significant capacity constraints in
budget formulation, execution, and reporting, and internal and external auditing procedures are weak.

Critical steps are needed to address these challenges, including
•

revitalizing the public service reform and the pay reform;

•

improving budget formulation and management, and minimizing intra-year budget reallocations;

•

integrating donor-funded projects into the budget ceilings to enhance efficiency;

•

strengthening planning capacity through the rollout of the integrated financial management system (IFMS) to
the central government and the largest districts;

•

adopting a comprehensive approach to the control of arrears, including reducing the outstanding stock; and

•

strengthening administrative capacity at the local government level.

Medium-term challenges
11.
The authorities noted that the main challenge facing Uganda is to sustain
poverty reduction by maintaining strong economic growth. To meet this challenge, the
authorities agreed with the staff on a need to strengthen policies that stimulate higher
productivity growth and private investment, including through:
•

Gradual fiscal consolidation without jeopardizing poverty reduction. This should
be achieved primarily by collecting more domestic revenue while improving the
allocation and effectiveness of government spending. There is ample room for raising

-9revenue through tax administration reform and a well-designed tax policy, including
the abolition of ad hoc tax exemptions.
•

Supporting measures to boost investments and productivity, particularly in the
agricultural sector. These include: (i) fiscal consolidation to help reduce financing
costs; (ii) improvements in the transportation network and power generation; and
(iii) more effective policies to reduce corruption. There is a need to accelerate
agricultural reforms, including land reform, and improve marketing networks and
rural roads.7 Moreover, the restoration of security in the North is essential to improve
agricultural output from that region and, in turn, the livelihood of the people affected
by the conflict.

•

Maintaining stable monetary conditions, in the face of continued large inflows of
foreign aid. While keeping base money as the nominal anchor, this would require a
judicious mix of monetary policy instruments, primarily between issuances of
treasury bills and foreign exchange sales, in sterilizing excess liquidity to avoid
excessive interest rate volatility.

•

Fostering a more efficient and deeper financial system by ameliorating the
structural impediments to lending, promoting competition, and minimizing distortions
in the form of subsidized and/or directed lending while maintaining an effective
supervisory regime. Key longer-term challenges are to restructure the pension system,
promote long-term financing through nondistortionary channels, and develop capital
markets.

•

Strengthening regional cooperation and integration. Broader regional economic
integration and openness to markets are important for attracting foreign direct
investment (FDI), increasing competition, and promoting export diversification. In
this respect, the establishment of the East African Community (EAC) customs union,
with about 90 million consumers, will be an important step. Initially, the
implementation of the Common External Tariff (CET) will raise Uganda’s average
tariff. Uganda will need to continue to pursue a reduction in the CET schedule.8

12.
In the light of the challenges set out above, the authorities are completing a
revision of the PEAP, and a group of major donors are streamlining their support to
help increase aid efficiency (Box 2). Moreover, the authorities are eager to meet these
challenges, but at the same time reduce their dependence on aid (including, in time, from the
Fund), through fiscal consolidation and measures to increase efficiency of donor support.

7

See Chapter 1 in Uganda—Selected Issues and Statistical Appendix (1/31/05) for an analysis of the scope for
raising productivity in agriculture and promoting growth in agro-processing. Also, the challenges of raising
agriculture output are spelled out in the government’s Plan for Modernization of Agriculture (PMA).

Box 2. The Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP) and Donor Assistance
The government is revising its PEAP to reinforce policies for poverty reduction and meeting the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The four core challenges of the PEAP are to (i) restore
security, (ii) restore sustainable growth in the incomes of the poor, (iii) promote human development,
and (iv) use public resources transparently and efficiently to eradicate poverty. The polices of the
PEAP are grouped under five pillars:

•

Economic management—with the focus on maintaining macroeconomic stability and domestic
resource mobilization, including by reducing the fiscal deficit, and promoting private sector
growth.

•

Production, competitiveness, and income—with the focus on modernizing agriculture and
implementing the Medium-Term Competitiveness Strategy (MTCS).

•

Security, conflict resolution, and disaster management—with the focus on defense and
security reforms, disarmament, and rehabilitation and reconstruction of conflict areas.

•

Governance—with the focus on human rights, judicial reforms, public service reform, and
decentralization.

•

Human development—with the focus on health, education, and social protection.

In a collaborative effort, the World Bank Group, the African Development Bank, and five major
bilateral donors have for the first time prepared the Uganda Joint Assistance Strategy (UJAS). The
UJAS will replace the World Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) as its core strategic
document. It is designed to increase donor efficiency in supporting the implementation of the policies
outlined in the forthcoming PEAP.
The UJAS partners and other major donors have subscribed support for implementation of the PEAP
through 2005/06, though with overwhelming presence in the governance and human development
pillars, while the economic management and security and conflict resolution pillars have received
limited attention. On a preliminary basis, the projected base case financial support from the UJAS
partners amounts to US$800 million (about 9 percent of GDP) a year during 2005/06-2008/09, while
a low case could entail support of about US$550 million (about 6.5 percent of GDP) a year.
Donors broadly agree on the key risks to PEAP implementation:
•

A difficult political transition around the 2006 elections could lead to a period of instability
with policy slippages and lower investor confidence.

•

Continuing insecurity could lead to increased inequality and high poverty, particularly in the
North.

•

Escalating corruption would constrain investments and jeopardize efforts to improve public
sector efficiency.

•

Continued rapid population growth would make it difficult to achieve the goals for GDP per
capita and poverty reduction.

•

Exogenous shocks, including adverse weather and a terms of trade deterioration, could derail the
macroeconomic objectives.

III. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PROGRAM
13.
Although the economy performed better in 2003/04, there were several slippages
Inflation, Monetary Base, and Interest Rates, June 2002-September 2004
under the program. Overall, four
quantitative performance criteria for
end-June 2004 were missed
(Memorandum of Economic and
Financial Policies (MEFP), Table 2,
Appendix I). Real GDP grew by an
estimated 5.9 percent. The economic
expansion was led by strong growth in
construction and communication, and
better weather contributed to a rebound
in agriculture (Table 1 and Figure 1).
After peaking at 10.2 percent by the
end of 2002/03, annual headline
inflation fell sharply during 2003/04 to 5.1 percent through September 2004, driven by
restrained money growth and lower food prices. The easing of inflationary expectations also
contributed to a reduction of interest rates.

Strong growth in noncoffee export volumes and improved terms of trade helped
narrow the external current account deficit,
excluding grants, to 11.8 percent of GDP in
2003/04. Greater-than-anticipated donor support and
private capital inflows more than covered the deficit,
allowing international reserves to build up faster than
envisaged, to about 6½ months of imports. Following

has appreciated in real effective terms by about

- 12 As a result, the quantitative performance criterion on net credit to the government for endJune 2004 was missed by nearly 0.8 percent of GDP. The indicative ceiling on public
administration spending and the performance criterion on domestic arrears accumulated
under the Commitment Control System (CCS) were also missed.9 However, the core povertyreducing outlays of the Poverty Action Fund (PAF) remained above their indicative floor.
16.
Based on preliminary information, the overall central government deficit,
excluding grants, was slightly smaller than projected during the first quarter of
2004/05. Although revenue collection remained in line with the program, development
expenditures were lower than envisaged. However, at the same time, it seems that further
accumulation of arrears occurred under the CCS.
17.
The program ceiling for base money growth was slightly missed for end-June
2004, but broad money growth and excess reserves have declined as programmed
(Table 3 and Figure 3). Domestic credit to the private sector maintained its robust growth at

The banking sector remains sound (Table 4). The banking system’s profitability
and capital base has remained high with a very low level of nonperforming loans, as
highlighted by the recent Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) update mission.
Stress tests confirm that the banking system can weather plausible macroeconomic shocks.
19.
The nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) show strong growth, but are more
vulnerable. Recent trends in the insurance industry raise concerns about the adequacy of
reserves, given the robust growth of policy liabilities and large share of illiquid investments
in real estate. The performance and governance of the National Social Security Fund have

being licensed under the Micro-Finance Deposit-Taking Institutions Act 2003.
20.
Uganda has made progress in obtaining debt relief. Thirty-one creditors have
agreed to provide debt relief to Uganda accounting for 96 percent of total assistance under
the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. The authorities will continue to
engage the remaining creditors, particularly Libya and India, to provide debt relief under the
HIPC Initiative (Table 7).

IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
22.
In addition to examining Uganda’s medium-term challenges (Section II), the
policy discussions focused on the 2004/05 program. The government acknowledged the
seriousness of the slippages and agreed to a number of corrective front-loaded measures,
including eight prior actions (MEFP, Table 3). These measures aim particularly at
strengthening revenue mobilization, notably through a restructuring of the URA (Box 3), and
enhancing expenditure management (Box 1). Moreover, the government recognized the need
to strengthen the monitoring of its program. To this effect, the inter-ministerial program
monitoring committee has been strengthened and will meet on a monthly basis.

- 14 -

Box 3. Reforming the Uganda Revenue Authority (URA)
The URA was established in 1992 as one of the first semiautonomous revenue authorities. The main
purpose for granting URA semiautonomy was to create a more effective and professional institution.
After impressive growth in the early years of the URA, revenue collection decelerated. Revenues rose from
about 6½ percent of GDP in 1991/92 to 10½ percent by 1996/97. Tax revenues continued to increase, albeit at a
slower pace, to about 11-12 percent of GDP in recent years.
The URA has undergone several attempts of reform since its inception. In the late 1990s, technical
assistance (TA) from the Fund identified a need for modernization, including an enhanced audit program and the
establishment of a large taxpayer unit. Some of these recommendations were initially implemented, but were
subsequently reversed and a different structure was established in 2001.
In recent years, the URA has experienced severe problems, including corruption. In addition, the
organization is highly fragmented, resulting in a duplication of functions and a lack of accountability.
The authorities have now agreed to implement the recommendations of a recent IMF TA mission,
including:
•

Undertake measures to minimize opportunities for corruption, including (i) designing a clear, wellunderstood policy framework; (ii) establishing simple and transparent procedures; (iii) improving the design
of performance standards; (iv) finishing and widely disseminating a code of conduct; and (v) establishing an
effective internal audit function.

•

Amend the URA Act, focusing the Board’s role on strategic issues while leaving the Commissioner
General (CG) to manage operations.

•

Reorganize the URA to provide a platform for modernizing the revenue administration. The new
structure would be based on five main reports to the CG: (i) domestic taxes; (ii) customs; (iii) corporate
services; (iv) litigation management, policy and rulings, and taxpayer appeals; and (v) internal audit
functions.

•

Consolidate all tax administration within a domestic tax department and all customs operational
activities within the customs department, to eliminate the existing fragmentation. In particular, the
domestic tax department should fully integrate the collection of direct and indirect taxes.

•

Establish a large taxpayer office within the domestic tax department, to strengthen control over
70-80 percent of tax revenue generated by the largest 300-350 taxpayers, identified by turnover. Also, over
the medium term, strengthen control over the medium-sized taxpayers by establishing taxpayer offices.

•

Improve tax administration operations by (i) preparing to introduce a new tax identification number
(TIN) as part of a new integrated tax administration system (ITAS); (ii) strengthening enforcement against
corporate nonfilers; (iii) improving return and payment procedures; and (iv) strengthening VAT refund
procedures through a risk-based approach for review of refund claims.

•

Strengthen customs operations by (i) implementing changes to the customs organization, including of the
revenue protection service units; (ii) eliminate blockages to further deployment of ASYCUDA++; and
(iii) ensure that transit is adequately covered.

•

Approve the new information technology strategy, and (i) fully deploy ASYCUDA++; (ii) acquire and
customize ITAS; and (iii) build a robust data network to link critical sites.

A. The Medium-Term Framework
23.
Over the medium term, annual real GDP growth is expected to increase to
6-6½ percent, while inflation will be kept below 5 percent (Table 1). The macroeconomic
policy strategy hinges on a more ambitious fiscal consolidation path than previously
envisaged to free up resources for the private sector. Measured by the domestic balance, a

- 15 fiscal consolidation of about 2 percentage points of GDP is projected over the next three
years resulting from a combination of (i) stronger revenue collections in line with the
implementation of the URA reform and a broadening of the tax base, and (ii) a modest
increase in nominal spending. The projected annual revenue effort will be 0.5 percent of
GDP, though this amount will be partly offset by the revenue losses stemming from the EAC
customs union, which will become effective in January 2005.
24.
The external current account deficit, excluding grants, is projected to narrow
gradually over time (Table 5). Exports will strengthen, reflecting an expansion of
nontraditional exports, while nonproject-related imports will increase in line with GDP. Net
disbursements of donor loans and grants are projected to remain steady in nominal terms, but
will decline gradually in percent of GDP. FDI inflows are projected to remain at 3.5 percent
of GDP. Official international reserves would be kept above six months of imports of goods
and services.
25.
To lower the external debt burden, the authorities will continue to exercise
prudent debt management and will seek to replace loans with more grant financing.
The NPV of debt to exports is projected to decline to 217 percent in 2007/08 (still above the
HIPC threshold).11 However, the NPV of debt to GDP and the debt service-to-exports ratio
will decline to 26 percent and 9 percent, respectively, by 2007/08, well within the HIPC
Initiative threshold (Appendix V).
B. Macroeconomic Outlook and Policies for 2004/05
26.
Real GDP growth is expected to decline slightly to 5½ percent, reflecting lower
growth in agriculture because of the current drought, as well as the adverse effects of
reduced hydroelectric output. Underlying inflation is projected to remain at about
4 percent, although higher food prices are expected to increase headline inflation to about
6 percent. Despite continued export growth, the external current account deficit, excluding
grants, is projected to widen to about 12 percent of GDP, reflecting a strong increase in
project-related imports.
Fiscal policies and reform
27.
The fiscal targets for 2004/05 are unchanged. Therefore, discussions focused on
fiscal measures to ensure their achievement. For the remainder of this fiscal year, the
government identified the following key priorities: (i) reinvigorating revenue mobilization
through reforms of the URA; (ii) identifying expenditure cuts to accommodate additional
spending on arrears clearance and wage adjustments; and (iii) strengthening policies to
monitor and reduce domestic arrears.

11

This ratio has risen substantially in recent years (Table 6), largely on account of a lower discount rate and the
depreciation of the U.S. dollar.

- 16 -

28.
Despite mounting spending pressures, the government emphasized its
commitment to control the fiscal deficit to maintain macroeconomic stability. With
revenue collections projected to remain in line with the program, the overall fiscal deficit,
excluding grants, is targeted at 10 percent of GDP, consistent with a domestic deficit of
4 percent of GDP. Nonpriority expenditures will be cut by about 0.5 percent of GDP (MEFP,
paragraph 11) to finance (i) a 13 percent increase in the minimum wage of primary school
teachers, and (ii) the clearance of domestic arrears on goods and services under the CCS
through 2004/05. The authorities will communicate to line ministries the related changes on
their spending ceilings.
29.
On the revenue side, measures will be implemented to address the weaknesses of
the URA in line with the recent Fund technical assistance (TA) report. The measures aim
to modernize tax administration, with clear accountability (Box 3). A number of prior actions
have been set, including the appointment of a new management of the URA; and the
adoption of a new organizational structure and a detailed timetable for its implementation
(MEFP, paragraph 15). In addition, the government will submit amendments to the URA Act
to parliament by June 2005. These measures will gradually strengthen revenue collections
and help mitigate revenue losses stemming from the implementation of the EAC customs
union (about 1 percent of GDP in 2005/06).12
30.
On the expenditure side, measures will be implemented to strengthen
expenditure management and prevent an accumulation of arrears (MEFP, paragraphs 12
and 13). These measures will ensure that proper procedures are followed when spending
exceeds budget appropriations, including ex-ante parliamentary approval; integrate donor
projects into the budget; and cease lending and government guarantees to the private sector.
Further, the authorities are committed to improving their control and reporting of domestic
arrears by producing quarterly verified reports of nonwage, nonpension arrears and ensuring
that any arrears accumulated in a given quarter are cleared within the spending ceilings of the
next quarter.
31.
To make public expenditures more efficient, the authorities are determined to
revive public administration reforms. As a first step, they will, in consultation with the
World Bank and other development partners, complete a cabinet paper on civil service pay
reform, seek an agreement between ministries and development partners on a public service
reform program for 2005-09, and develop a program to limit the size of the public
administration (MEFP, paragraph 14). On fiscal decentralization, the authorities will, with
assistance from the Fund, continue to strengthen local government administration (MEFP,
paragraph 18).

12

The revenue loss is explained by a shortfall of customs revenue on trade within the EAC, the elimination of
excises and fees currently charged on imports regardless of origin, and changes in the valuation regulations.

- 17 -

Monetary and financial sector policies
32.
The monetary program for 2004/05 is largely unchanged. With underlying
inflation evolving broadly as programmed, the targeted annual growth rate of broad and
reserve money of about 15 percent and 13 percent, respectively, is retained.
33.
The BOU is committed to continue following a flexible exchange rate policy to
maintain reserves at a healthy level. Interventions in the foreign exchange market will be
conducted only to smooth out short-term fluctuations and will not go against fundamentals.
The staff expressed concern, however, about the BOU’s recent decision to suspend
temporarily foreign exchange sales for sterilization purposes. The authorities noted that, for
the moment, the foreign exchange market was unable to absorb more sales without causing
an excessive appreciation of the exchange rate, which would weaken export competitiveness.
The staff noted that too much reliance on net treasury bill issuance would push up interest
rates and further exacerbate appreciation pressures.13 The liquidity impact of donor inflows
should be sterilized largely, but not exclusively, by foreign exchange sales in order to avoid
undue pressure on real interest rates. The authorities were aware of the situation and
indicated their willingness to resume foreign exchange sales as soon as more opportune
market conditions emerged.
34.
The staff commended the authorities on their progress made in implementing
the recommendations of a recent Fund TA mission on monetary operations and market
development. The management of monetary policy has been enhanced through progress in
developing daily liquidity forecast, changing the computation and level of reserve
requirements, improving the primary market dealership framework, and issuing longer term
treasury bonds.
35.
To facilitate the conduct of monetary policy, the authorities intend to move the
accounts of externally financed government projects from commercial banks to the
BOU in a phased manner (MEFP, paragraph 20). The staff noted that according to the
preliminary analysis of the FSAP update mission, the benefits of short-term liquidity
management are likely to be outweighed by complications in managing liquidity injections in
the long term, the negative balance sheet effects on commercial banks of moving existing
project accounts, and a shallower foreign exchange market.
36.
The staff impressed on the authorities that further deepening of the financial
sector is crucial to foster private investment. In line with the recommendations of the
recent FSAP update mission, the authorities intend to implement a number of measures to
help strengthen the financial sector and mobilize domestic financial resources (MEFP,
paragraphs 21-22), including the sale of a minority share and management responsibilities of
the UDBL.
13

Preliminary analysis by the staff suggests that the optimal mix of sterilization instruments would entail both
foreign exchange sales and treasury bill issuances, while the use of a single instrument is damaging for private
sector growth (see Chapter 2 in Selected Issues and Statistical Appendix, 1/31/05).

- 18 -

Trade policy
37.
The authorities are implementing a comprehensive strategy to increase and
diversify exports aiming at achieving a sound external position over the medium term.
A central element of this strategy is making the EAC customs union fully operational by
January 2005. The authorities believe that creating this extended market and improving
infrastructure will promote Ugandan exports, in particular of food crops.14 Accordingly, the
authorities are increasing micro credit and extension services to small producers as envisaged
in the Strategic Exports Program (SEP) and the PMA. The staff generally supported the
authorities’ efforts to develop an effective regional market, but noted that for implementation
of the CET to succeed the technical specifications of goods under the EAC Protocol must be
finalized; the EAC common customs management law must be completed; and comparability
issues arising between EAC states and other integration blocs must be clarified.
38.
To support export growth and attract FDI, the authorities plan to introduce
export-processing zones (EPZs). The Fund and World Bank staffs stressed that to be
successful the new EPZ law should ensure that the legal and regulatory frameworks are
consistent with international best practices and Uganda’s implementation capacity. The staff
emphasized that to ensure the integrity of these operations, a proper ring fencing of the zones
with strict implementation of customs duties and other taxes on sales to Ugandan residents
are required. To prevent harmful tax competition for investment in the EAC, competitive tax
holidays should be avoided, and the participating countries should agree on a regional code
of conduct for investment incentives.15
Social policies
39.
The human development pillar of the forthcoming PEAP outlines policies to
reinforce recent progress on the social front. Given the impressive achievements in
primary school enrollment (close to 90 percent), the government now faces the challenges of
improving the quality of primary education and providing better opportunities for postprimary education. In the health sector, which is slowly recovering from the decline in
service delivery in the 1970s and 1980s, the priorities include strengthening the
immunization program, controlling malaria, instituting family planning programs, and
preventing HIV/AIDS. Although the prevalence of HIV/AIDS has been reduced significantly
to about 6 percent, the government acknowledges that another round of sustained measures is
necessary to battle new transmissions and further reduce prevalence. Finally, Uganda is
making progress toward meeting several of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)
(Table 9 and Figure 6).

14

15

Ugandan’s trade with Kenya and Tanzania amounted to 42 percent of total trade in 2003/04.

With World Bank financing, efforts are under way to provide more detailed recommendations on the overall
and regulatory framework for EPZs.

- 19 -

Other structural policies
40.
With the majority of public enterprises already privatized, the government
intends to complete the privatization program within a couple of years. Of the remaining
30 public enterprises, only a few are significant in size. Moreover, the Uganda Railway
Corporation is being offered for concession jointly with the Kenya Railway Corporation, and
a transaction could be completed by June 2005. In addition, the government is preparing to
privatize the public water and sewerage enterprise. To increase power generation, the
government intends to seek an agreement with private investors to launch the hydropower
project at the Bujagali Falls.
41.
The authorities intend to renew their efforts to address governance and
corruption problems (MEFP, paragraph 23, and Box 4). In particular, constitutional reforms
currently before parliament would substantially strengthen the powers of the Inspector
General of Government (IGG).
V. OTHER ISSUES
42.
The authorities intend to request technical assistance from the Fund in several
areas. In the fiscal area, the authorities will seek assistance on expenditure management,
including monitoring and controlling domestic arrears, and on the restructuring of the URA.
Technical assistance from the Fund’s AFRITAC East will continue, and the Fund will
undertake a Poverty and Social Impact Analysis of possible tax policies. On statistics, there
are concerns about deterioration of the quality of data provided by Uganda Bureau of
Statistics (UBOS) because of insufficient resources. This concern will be addressed in the
scheduled data module of the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) in
early 2005.
VI. PROGRAM MONITORING AND RISKS
43.
The fifth review will assess Uganda’s performance with respect to quantitative
performance criteria and indicative targets for December 2004 and the structural
performance criteria and benchmarks through March 2005 (MEFP, Tables 2 and 3). The
attached Technical Memorandum of Understanding (Appendix I, Attachment II) details the
design of the program.
44.
Over the medium term, a key risk is that fiscal policies will not be adequately
strengthened to support macroeconomic stability and pro-poor growth. Continued
insecurity in northern Uganda and the Great Lakes region could threaten the overall business
climate and deter private investment. Moreover, insufficient progress in addressing
corruption could also impede private sector growth and investment and lead to a shortfall in
donor support.16

16

An alternative scenario with external budget support declining to 50 percent of current commitments (down
from the 85 percent assumed in the baseline) shows that international reserves could drop by one full month of
imports by 2007/08.

- 20 -

Box 4. Corruption and Governance Issues
Corruption is a serious business impediment in Uganda. It is reported to be the sixth most serious
constraint for Ugandan businesses in the World Bank’s 2003 Investment Climate Assessment; it is
particularly serious for foreign companies and exporters, in which corruption is ranked the second and
third most serious obstacle, respectively. Although the Transparency International survey of global
corruption perceptions shows an improvement in Uganda’s corruption score for the third successive year
in 2004, this is relative to a particularly poor 2001 rating, and Uganda’s current rating is no better than
eight years ago and remains in the category characterized as “rampant corruption.” More broadly, on the
World Bank’s governance indicators, Uganda ranks better than the average for Sub-Sahara Africa in only
two out of six categories (see chart below).
Corruption also poses risks to the budget. Procurement irregularities raise expenditure costs at both the
national and (in particular) local government level. There are reports of inflated expenditures in the
defense and education sectors on account of “ghost” soldiers and students. Large compensation payments
and court awards recently charged against the national budget are suspected to have involved corruption.
And corruption in the tax authorities weakens the business climate and reduces revenue yields.
A number of anti-corruption measures have experienced setbacks. Inquiries into military exploitation
of the Congo and helicopter procurement abuses appear stalled. The powers of the Inspector General of
Government (IGG) to enforce the Leadership Code Act, including compulsory asset declarations by top
officials, have been weakened by an adverse court decision, and an inquiry into corruption in the URA
was struck down by the courts following disagreements among members of the Commission of Inquiry.
Funding for anti-corruption agencies has also been inadequate.
The forthcoming PEAP includes a number of policy measures to strengthen governance. Notably,
the Leadership Code Act will be strengthened, to increase the power and independence of the IGG, and
codes of conduct will be introduced throughout the public sector.

- 21 -

VII. STAFF APPRAISAL
45.
Uganda’s performance under the program was mixed, with several program
slippages in 2003/04. Notably, the fiscal performance diverged from the program, reflecting
strong spending pressures and revenue shortfalls, and new domestic arrears accumulated.
Furthermore, the implementation of structural reforms was slower than envisaged,
particularly the measures to modernize the URA, monitor and clear arrears, and streamline
the public administration. The authorities acknowledge the seriousness of the slippages and
are committed to implementing a strong set of front-loaded measures to bring the program
back on track and enhance monitoring through a strengthening of the inter-ministerial
committee.
46.
Uganda is at a crossroad. The impressive economic growth and poverty reduction it
achieved through a first wave of reforms has started to taper off in recent years. The country
now needs to launch a second wave of reforms and consolidate peace throughout its territory
to (i) increase the rate of growth; (ii) address the challenges stemming from its high
population growth—one of the highest in the world; and (iii) continue to reduce poverty.
Without strong commitment of the authorities to implement the reforms there is a risk that
the appropriate growth will not be achieved, which could lead to social tensions.
47.
The staff concurs that fiscal consolidation will continue to be a cornerstone of
the program. Over the medium term, the government’s fiscal consolidation strategy rests
appropriately on increasing revenue mobilization and enhancing expenditure management,
including at the local government level. In particular, successful implementation of the
restructuring of the URA is key to the program.
48.
The staff appreciates the authorities’ commitment to revive the public
administration reform. This reform should improve efficiency in the public sector,
including in priority sectors, while helping ensure appropriate salaries for public employees.
49.
The authorities intend to attract more FDI and strengthen export performance
by introducing EPZs. While generally supporting this idea, the staff stresses the importance
of ensuring that the legal and regulatory framework meets international standards. In
particular, to avoid undermining fiscal revenue mobilization, the zones should be ring fenced
with strict implementation of customs duties and other taxes on sales to Ugandan residents.
The staff supports the authorities’ plan to work closely with other EAC partners to establish a
common code of conduct for investment incentives.
50.
The staff encourages the authorities to be steadfast in addressing governance
issues. Corruption continues to be a serious constraint for business and poses risks to the
budget, including at the local level. Nevertheless, progress is being made; the authorities’
intention to strengthen the role of the Inspector General of Government and to strictly
implement the code of conduct for all civil servants is particularly welcome.
51.
The staff commends the authorities for pursuing an appropriate monetary policy
stance, which is essential to maintain a stable macroeconomic environment. The staff
agreed that the floating exchange rate regime has served the country well and helped to

- 22 maintain a comfortable level of international reserves. However, the authorities are
encouraged to implement a more balanced mix of foreign exchange sales and issuances of
treasury bills to sterilize excess liquidity to avoid erratic changes in interest rates as observed
in the past.
52.
The staff commends the authorities for maintaining a sound banking system.
The strengthening of the financial sector—including through the implementation of the new
Financial Institutions Act and Anti-Money Laundering Law, liberalization of the pension
system, and sale of minority shares and management responsibilities of the UDBL—should
help mobilize additional domestic resources for productive private sector activity. In
addition, the government should focus its efforts in the MFI sector to capacity building and
the establishment of an appropriate regulatory framework to facilitate the provision of
financial services to rural and urban households that have difficulty accessing commercial
banks.
53.
The staff shares the authorities’ concern about the sustainability of external
debt. In this regard, the staff supports the authorities’ strategy to diversify exports and their
intention to seek more grants while strictly limiting new loans to finance productive projects.
The staff strongly supports the authorities’ efforts to reach agreement with creditors that have
not yet provided debt relief under the HIPC Initiative.
54.
On risks to the program, the staff notes its concern about the unsettled security
situation in the North and expenditure pressures related to the forthcoming elections, which
could jeopardize the government’s fiscal and poverty reduction targets.
55.
The staff recommends completion of the fourth review under the PRGF
arrangement and supports the authorities’ request for waivers for the nonobservance of
four quantitative performance criteria. The staff notes that the authorities recognize that
the performance under the program has weakened, and that they are committed to take strong
corrective actions to address the slippages while pursuing an appropriate overall policy
framework for 2004/05.
56.
The staff welcomes the intention of the authorities to make public the staff
report, the letter of intent, and the MEFP. It is proposed that the next Article IV
consultation be held on the 24-month cycle.

1/ Fiscal year begins in July.
2/ The 2003/04 figure is provisional.
3/ Nominal GDP divided by average of current-year and previous-year end-period money stocks.
4/ Weighted annual average rate on 91-day treasury bills.
5/ The revenue projections are based on a revenue target as a share of GDP and accordingly include unidentified revenue measures.
6/ Ratio of three-year average of exports. Ratios for 2002/03 and thereafter are based on CIRRs and exchange rates at end-June 2003 .
7/ The debt-service ratios reflect actual debt service paid, i.e., after debt relief, including that attributable to the HIPC Initiative; deferment of payments to non-Paris Club
creditors, with whom bilateral agreements have not yet been reached; and the settlement of arrears.

APPENDIX I

Kampala, Uganda
November 10, 2004
Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
U.S.A.
Dear Mr. de Rato:
1.
On behalf of the Government of Uganda, I hereby transmit the attached memorandum
of economic and financial policies (MEFP) that sets out the objectives and policies that the
Government intends to implement in the remainder of the fiscal year 2004/05, as well as the
underlying medium-term macroeconomic policy framework consistent with the forthcoming
revision of the Ugandan Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP). The attached technical
memorandum of understanding (TMU) defines the terms and conditions of the program.
2.
Although the Government of Uganda has made substantial progress in implementing
the 2003/04 program supported by the three-year arrangement under the Poverty Reduction
and Growth Facility (PRGF), which was approved by the Fund’s Executive Board on
September 13, 2002, several program slippages occurred during the current review. Four
quantitative performance criteria for end-June 2004 were breached: (i) the ceiling on the
increase in base money; (ii) the ceiling on the increase in net claims of the central
government by the banking system; (iii) the continuous performance criterion on
accumulation of new domestic arrears on expenditures covered by the commitment control
system (CCS); and (iv) new lending by the Uganda Development Bank Ltd (UDBL). With
respect to the ceiling on base money, the breach was relatively minor, and base money was
below the program ceiling for end-September 2004. The breach of net claims on the central
government by the banking system was primarily caused by one-time expenditures and there
will be no carry-over effect to the 2004/05 budget; also, the Government is implementing
new measures to strengthen expenditure management and limit the use of supplementary
budget expenditures. With respect to the accumulation of new arrears under the CCS, the
arrears will be eliminated by end-June 2005, and the Government will implement a
comprehensive set of measures in the remainder of 2004/05 to strengthen the overall
monitoring and control of domestic arrears. On the new lending by UDBL, although only two
small loans were contracted, the breach reflected poor control by the Government of UDBL
management. In addition, eight of the ten structural benchmarks were not met.
3.
The Government of Uganda recognizes the significance of the program slippages and
is determined to implement a range of far-reaching measures before end-December 2004, as
described in the MEFP, to bring the program back on track.

- 40 -

APPENDIX I

4.
On this basis, the authorities are requesting waivers for the nonobservance of the four
missed quantitative performance criteria for June 2004.
5.
In support of our objectives and policies, the Government of Uganda hereby requests
the disbursement of the fourth loan under the PRGF in the amount of SDR 2 million
(1.1 percent of quota) upon completion of the fourth review.
6.
Looking ahead, the policies set out in the attached memorandum, together with
continuing implementation of the broader policy agenda in the forthcoming revised PEAP,
aim at achieving high sustainable economic growth and reducing poverty. The performance
criteria and benchmarks for the fifth review will be based on end-December 2004 and
end-March 2005 targets as set out in Tables 2 and 3 of the MEFP.
7.
The Government of Uganda will provide the Fund with such information as the Fund
may request in connection with the progress made in implementing the economic and
financial policies and achieving the objectives of the program.
8.
The Government of Uganda believes that the policies and measures set forth in the
MEFP are adequate to achieve the objectives of its economic program for 2004/05 supported
by the PRGF arrangement, but it will take further measures to that end if deemed necessary.
During the implementation of the arrangement, the Government of Uganda will consult with
the Managing Director on the adoption of these measures and in advance of revisions to the
policies contained in the MEFP, at the initiative of the Government or whenever the
Managing Director requests such a consultation.
9.
The Government of Uganda authorizes the publication and distribution of this letter,
the attached MEFP and TMU, and all reports prepared by Fund staff regarding the PRGFsupported program and Article IV consultation.
Sincerely yours,
/s/

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
of the Government of Uganda for 2004/05
1.
The Government of Uganda is committed to achieving sustained economic growth
and poverty reduction through the pursuit of prudent macroeconomic policies and structural
reforms. The strategy to achieve these goals is set out in the forthcoming revision of the
Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP). The Government’s economic program is supported
by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) with a three-year arrangement under the Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF), which was approved in September 2002. This
memorandum of economic and financial policies (MEFP) reviews the performance under the
program (April-September 2004) and describes the policies and targets for the remainder of
the fiscal year 2004/05.
I. RECENT PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PRGF-SUPPORTED PROGRAM
2.
Since the early 1990s, Uganda has implemented sound macroeconomic policies and
an ambitious program of economic reforms, supported by substantial donor assistance. These
efforts have resulted in robust economic growth, accompanied by a significant reduction in
poverty through the 1990s. The incidence of poverty, however, increased to an estimated
38 percent of the population in 2002/03 from 34 percent in 1999/2000. Factors that
contributed to this setback include a slowdown in real GDP growth, a deterioration in the
terms of trade, especially in agriculture, and an increase in average household size and
dependency ratio.
3.
The economy performed well in 2003/04. Real GDP growth is estimated to have
increased by one percentage point to 5.9 percent, inflation fell, and the external position
generally improved. The construction and communications sectors led a broad based
economic expansion, while improved weather conditions contributed to a rebound in
agriculture. Annual headline inflation declined from 10.2 percent in June 2003 to 5.1 percent
in September 2004, as food crop prices fell sharply. Underlying annual inflation, which
excludes food crops, eased from 5.4 percent in June to 3.9 percent in September 2004, in line
with the program target. Strong growth in noncoffee export volumes and improved terms of
trade helped to narrow the external current account deficit, excluding grants, to 11.8 percent
of GDP. Greater-than-anticipated donor support and private capital inflows more than
covered this deficit, allowing international reserves to build up to about 6½ months of
imports. Following the large depreciation in 2002/03, the Ugandan shilling appreciated in
real effective terms by about 10 percent since December 2003. Buoyant export proceeds and
private remittances, demand for domestic currency from donor-funded projects, and
increased sales of foreign exchange by the BOU contributed to the exchange rate
appreciation.
4.
The fiscal consolidation envisaged in the program for 2003/04 was not achieved. The
overall central government deficit, excluding grants, remained at 11.3 percent of GDP in
2003/04, or 0.6 percent higher than programmed. The domestic balance fell short of the
program target by a similar magnitude. While revenue collections were lower than
programmed, reflecting weak VAT and trade tax collections, the higher deficit is primarily

- 42 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

explained by an excess in spending (0.4 percent of GDP), reflecting higher law and order and
public administration needs, including from the State House, together with net lending to
private enterprises. In addition, the composition of expenditures changed, but the core
poverty-reducing outlays of the Poverty Action Fund (PAF) remained above their indicative
floor at end-June 2004. The quantitative performance criterion on net credit to the
government was breached by nearly 0.8 percent of GDP for end-June 2004. Moreover, the
indicative ceiling on public administration spending and the performance criterion on
domestic arrears accumulated under the Commitment Control System (CCS) were also
breached. At end-June 2004, the estimated total stock of outstanding domestic arrears,
including on wages and pensions, amounted to 3.7 percent of GDP.
5.
Base money expanded more rapidly than programmed during the first three quarters
of 2003/04. However, the performance criterion at end-June was breached only by a small
margin, as growth moderated in the last quarter of 2003/04, and base money was in line with
the program at end-September 2004. Credit growth to the private sector remained strong in
2003/04, after the large rebound led by the privatization of the Uganda Commercial Bank
(UCB) to Stanbic. Money market rates have fallen sharply and become less volatile,
declining from over 20 percent in December 2003 to about 7 percent in September 2004 due
to the adoption of an appropriate monetary stance in line with the program, and increased
sales of foreign exchange for sterilization purposes. The introduction of long-term
government bonds deepened the securities market contributing to the sharp decrease in the
91-day treasury bill rate. However, the banks’ lending rates have remained relatively flat. To
improve monetary management, the computation and level of reserve requirements was
changed in July 2004. The cash reserve ratio was unified at 9.5 percent from 9 percent and
10 percent on demand and term deposits, respectively, and the lag between reserve base and
reserve maintenance period was reduced from two weeks to one week.
6.
The banking sector remains sound with a significant decline in the nonperforming
loans ratio in June 2004, although there has been a modest rise in foreign exchange exposure.
The implementation of the newly enacted Financial Institutions Act should help further
strengthen banking operations, particularly by reducing credit exposure concentration.
Moreover, a number of microfinance institutions are in the process of being licensed to take
deposits under the new Micro-Finance Deposit-Taking Institutions Act, which should further
encourage rural financial intermediation. The nascent housing finance sector is recording
strong growth with the entrance of new players and an increase in the capital base of the
Housing Finance Corporation of Uganda (HFCU).
7.
The implementation of structural reforms was much slower than envisaged in the
program through end-September 2004 (Table 1). All the structural performance criteria were
observed, but eight out of the ten structural benchmarks were breached. A number of prior
actions have been set for the completion of the fourth review under the PRGF arrangement to
correct for these slippages (Table 3).
II. THE POLICY AGENDA FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2004/05
8.
The Government acknowledges the seriousness of the program slippages and is ready
to implement corrective measures immediately to bring the program back on track.

- 43 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

Furthermore, the Government intends to strengthen its monitoring of the program and will
report on the progress in achieving the structural performance criteria, benchmarks, and other
measures of the program to the IMF staff on a monthly basis.
9.
Real GDP growth is expected to slow down slightly to 5½ percent in 2004/05,
reflecting lower growth in agriculture related to the current drought. Underlying inflation is
projected to remain low at around 4 percent, while higher food prices due to the drought are
expected to push headline inflation up to about 6 percent. To achieve the inflation objective,
the BOU intends to limit the rate of growth of base money to about 13 percent during the
year. Consistent with the 2004/05 budget, the overall fiscal deficit, excluding grants, is
projected to narrow by 1.3 percentage points to 10.0 percent of GDP. The domestic balance
is projected to narrow by a similar magnitude. Despite continued export growth, the external
current account deficit, excluding transfers, is projected to widen to 12.2 percent of GDP,
reflecting a strong increase in imports. International reserves are expected to remain at a
comfortable level of nearly 6½ months of imports. The flexible exchange rate policy, which
has served Uganda well, will be maintained and, if needed, the BOU will only intervene to
limit short-term exchange rate fluctuations.
10.
For the remainder of 2004/05, emphasis in the fiscal area will be given to the
following priorities: (i) strengthening policies to monitor and reduce domestic arrears;
(ii) identifying expenditure savings to accommodate necessary additional spending in
2004/05 on arrears clearance and priority programs; and (iii) reinvigorating revenue
collection through reforms of the Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) and identifying revenue
measures for the 2005/06 budget.
11.
To achieve the original fiscal consolidation in 2004/05, the Government has decided
to cut nonpriority non-PAF and non-wage expenditures by U Sh 77 billion, or 0.5 percent of
GDP. These cuts will compensate for (i) a package with a net cost of U Sh 5.8 billion in
2004/05 (and of U Sh 9 billion in 2005/06, assuming a budget ceiling of U Sh 241 billion for
District Primary Education), comprising the recruitment of 6,065 new primary school
teachers at a monthly wage of U Sh 140,000 (effective September 2004); the replacement of
5,115 licensed teachers with qualified teachers at a monthly wage of U Sh 130,000 (effective
retroactively from July 2004); and the increase in the minimum primary school teachers’
wages from U Sh 113,000 to U Sh 130,000 a month for 107,835 teachers (to be effective,
non-retroactively, from January 2005); (ii) additional spending pressures for up to U Sh 35
billion; and (iii) clearance of domestic arrears on goods and services accumulated under the
CCS in 2002/03, 2003/04, and 2004/05, currently estimated at U Sh 36 billion. In addition,
the Government will strive to control arrears on membership fees for international and
regional institutions by reviewing the merits of participating in those institutions, and
arranging for a repayment plan with them. An exhaustive list of institutions and
corresponding arrears of member fees will be prepared before end-December 2004. Revenues
are projected to remain in line with the budget, which assumes a revenue loss from the
launch of the EAC customs union by January 1, 2005 amounting to about ½ percent of GDP.
12.
To reinforce public expenditure management practices, the following measures will
be implemented:

- 44 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

•

Cease all operations of all Deferred Accounts at the BOU immediately and submit
the regularization of their closure to parliament before end-March 2005.

•

Submit to parliament a statement of all expenditures to provide financing to specific
private firms in 2003/04 including through the government’s administered fund
accounts at the BOU, by end-December 2004.

•

Amend the regulations of the Public Finance and Accountability Act (PFAA) by
end-December 2004 to: (i) ensure proper ex-ante and ex-post integration of donor
projects into the budget; and (ii) clarify the responsibilities of all departments and
agencies involved in contracting external debt, as well as in the operations of the
broader debt management.

•

Cease immediately lending or issuances of guarantees by the Government to private
individuals or firms.

•

Limit strictly supplementary requests to parliament by the security and public
administration sectors to those that can be accommodated within the resources
appropriated to these sectors, starting in November 2004.

•

Ensure ex-ante parliamentary approval for all future expenditures in excess of the
budget appropriations, starting in November 2004, and ensure that all emergency
expenditures will be accommodated by the MFPED through front-loading of the
quarterly cash ceilings for the same sector, in line with current regulations.

13.
Clearing outstanding domestic arrears and preventing new arrears remains a priority.
The Government intends to request IMF technical assistance in this area. The following steps
will be taken to strengthen the procedures for reducing the existing arrears and prevent
accumulation of domestic arrears:
•

The Internal Auditor of the MFPED will certify and report on a quarterly basis the
arrears for recurrent and development expenditures, starting end-September 2004.
The report will be published within 2½ months of the end of each quarter. The cash
limit for each spending unit will be adjusted to allow for the clearance of these
arrears within the following quarter. The Government is committed to firmly
implement, starting in November 2004, a first call on resources to pay the arrears
out of the cash limits for each quarter.

•

Reporting semi-annually on the implementation of the plan adopted by parliament
to clear the overall stock of arrears certified by the Internal Audit Office at
end-December 2004, with the first report to be issued by end-March 2005. The
report will clearly show the clearance of the stock of arrears according to age
profile and type, verifying consistency with the amounts allocated for arrears
clearance in the annual budget.

- 45 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

•

Starting implementation of the second phase of the Integrated Financial
Management Information System (IFMIS) to the remaining line ministries and
six local governments by end-June 2005.

•

Completing an external audit and verification of the outstanding stock of pension
arrears for all central government level units and the 10 districts for which partial
data is currently available by end-June 2005.

•

Prepayment arrangements for telephone services will be extended to all line
ministries by end-December 2004, and similar arrangements will be implemented
for consumption of electricity by end-March 2005.

•

The MFPED will strictly implement the sanctions against noncomplying accounting
officers, without exceptions, as envisaged in the PFAA.

14.
To strengthen the efficiency of public expenditures and streamline the public
administration, the Government is determined, in consultation with the World Bank and other
development partners, to revive the public administration reform through:
•

Approval by Cabinet of the Pay Policy Paper by end-December 2004 that should
lead to savings in the wage bill.

•

Reaching agreement between MFPED, the Ministry of Public Service and interested
development partners on the priorities and funding modalities for the public service
2005-09 by end-December 2004.

•

Submission of a paper to the Cabinet by the Ministry of Public Service in
collaboration with MFPED on how to control the size of public administration and
ensure cost efficiency by end-March 2005.

15.
The Government will address the weaknesses of the URA by implementing the
recommendations of the recent IMF technical assistance report, which are aimed at
establishing a strong tax administration with clear accountability to eliminate duplication and
fragmentation of functions. More specifically, among the measures to be implemented for the
remainder of 2004/05 are:
•

Appointment of the new Commissioner General of the URA by mid-November
2004.

•

Adoption of the URA new organizational structure by the Government, consistent
with the IMF technical assistance report by end-November 2004.

•

Adoption by the MFPED of a timetable to restructure the URA in line with the
recommendations of the IMF technical assistance report by early January 2005.

- 46 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

•

Finalizing the staff code of conduct and disseminating it widely, requiring all staff
irrespectively of past service to sign an understanding that they are familiar with
their obligations and are bound by them by end-December 2004.

•

Submit to parliament amendments to the URA Act in line with the IMF technical
assistance report by June 2005.

16.
In addition, the Government is committed to continue its fiscal consolidation efforts
and will take appropriate tax measures in the 2005/06 budget to raise revenue equivalent to
cover the expenditure pressures noted above, including any new expenditures adopted in
2004/05.
17.
The Government is committed to avoiding actions that could undermine revenue
collection, such as granting preferential tax treatment to specific investors or firms. In
addition, to achieve greater transparency in the Government’s policy of encouraging
industrial development, the MFPED will submit to Parliament a comprehensive list of
companies that have benefited from tax expenditures, government subsidies, loan guarantees,
and other incentives before end-December 2004. The list would identify the nature of the
benefits received and their costs, and it would be hereafter be submitted on an annual basis.
This measure, which originally was a benchmark for end-September 2004, will be
implemented by end-December 2004. Finally, the Government will strengthen revenue
collections at the local government level given their weak performance, to help compensate
for the expected suspension of the graduated tax. In addition, the coverage of the property tax
will be expanded by end-June 2005.
18.
The Government will continue to implement the fiscal decentralization strategy
(FDS) while strengthening the local government administrative capacity. The latter will be
subject to the new budgeting and planning manuals under the FDS to ensure better reporting
and greater accountability. Technical assistance from the IMF is being provided to facilitate
some of these initiatives and strengthen the public expenditure management systems at the
subnational level, including the implementation of the CCS for local governments and the
development of adequate fiscal reporting and poverty-reducing expenditure tracking under
the FDS. In addition, the government intends to strictly limit the number of districts.
19.
On monetary policy, to maintain low inflation and a stable environment for financial
intermediation and the foreign exchange market, the BOU will continue to target base
money. Broad money (M2), excluding foreign currency deposits, is projected to expand by
15 percent in 2004/05, while bank credit to the private sector is expected to increase
by 16 percent. The BOU will continue to implement a number of recommendations of the
IMF technical assistance mission aimed at strengthening the liquidity management
framework and fostering financial market development, including developing and evaluating
daily liquidity forecast, reviewing the performance of primary dealers, and facilitating
forward foreign exchange transactions.
20.
To facilitate the conduct of monetary policy, accounts for new projects will be opened
at the BOU rather than at commercial banks, and existing projects accounts at commercial

- 47 -

ATTACHMENT I

banks will be transferred to the BOU in a phased manner. The effects of this measure will be
assessed during the next review of the PRGF-arrangement with the IMF.
21.
Mobilizing domestic financial resources for investment is an important element to
enabling stronger economic growth. The Government is preparing with the participation of
all stakeholders—including development partners—a proposal for the liberalization and
reform of the pension system, which could generate substantial long-term savings for private
sector capital formation. The proposal for reforming the public pension system will ensure
that all Government obligations, including contingent liabilities, under the reform would be
incorporated into the budget. As such, excessive guarantees of minimum benefits will be
avoided by switching to a defined contributory system and debts arising from the transition to
this pension system would be explicit. As part of the pension reform, the restructuring of the
National Social Security Fund (NSSF) will be expedited to improve operations, investment
performance, and governance. For this purpose, it is necessary to establish a qualified and
independent regulator for the NSSF as soon as possible. Before end-December 2004, the
Government will place the supervision of the NSSF under the BOU, until such time an
independent pension regulatory authority is set up.
22.
Other measures to facilitate term lending to productive sectors and, more broadly,
financial services to rural areas and small towns will be implemented in 2004/05. To this end,
the Government called for Expressions of Interest (EOI) by a strategic investor interested in a
minority share and management responsibilities of UDBL, including a merger of the credit
operations of the Department for Development Finance (DFD) of the BOU with those of
UDBL. The government will approve the sale of a minority share and management
responsibilities of UDBL to a reputed private investor short-listed by the Privatization
Management Unit (PMU) by end-March 2005. The MFPED has also embarked on an
outreach plan for microfinance institutions (MFIs), with the goal of increasing the capacity of
staff and management of MFIs and encouraging their expansion into areas that presently lack
access to financial services. In order to promote the development of the MFI sector, the
government will limit its involvement in the sector to capacity building and regulation. The
MFIs in the process of being granted licenses by the BOU under the new Microfinance
Deposit Taking Institutions Act will be subject to BOU regulatory supervision and off-site
examinations. In order to further foster financial sector development, the government is
undertaking a diagnostic review of the housing finance sector including the HFCU, with the
intention of increasing private equity participation in the institution. The government also
intends to divest a majority share and management responsibilities of the National Insurance
Corporation to a strategic investor to further fuel growth of the insurance sector. The
regulations of the new Financial Institutions Act, which will help to maintain the soundness
of the financial system, will be issued by end-December 2004. Finally, to further strengthen
the financial sector, an anti-money laundering bill that conforms to international standards
will be approved by the Cabinet by end-December 2004.
23.
As part of the Government’s anti-corruption policy and to strengthen the confidence
in public institutions, the Government is seeking to strengthen the Leadership Code, which
aims at increasing the power and independence of the Inspectorate General of Government
(IGG), either through redrafting the Code, or through a Constitutional amendment. Also,

- 48 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

ministries and public sector agencies will introduce codes of conduct and client charters with
formal complaints procedures.
24.
The Government intends to complete the privatization of the remaining public
enterprises in the coming 1-2 years. Most notably, interested investors have already been
identified for a joint concession contract for the Uganda Railway Corporation and the Kenya
Railway Corporation, with a possible completion of the transaction by June 2005. The
government also intends to sell a majority position in the NIC and is preparing for
privatization of the public water and sewerage enterprise. In addition, to increase the power
supply, the Government intends to seek an agreement with private investors to start the
hydropower project at the Bujagali Falls.
25.
More generally, policies to strengthen the investment climate, increase productivity,
enhance Uganda’s international competitiveness, and achieve a more sustainable and less
vulnerable external position, will be supported by the government’s Medium-Term
Competitiveness Strategy (MTCS) and its Strategic Exports Program (SEP). Although there
have been advancements in the past, there is a need to strengthen agricultural policies, mainly
by re-focusing the sectoral strategy towards improving market access, infrastructure (mainly
roads), and supporting other productivity-enhancing measures. With respect to the Plan for
the Modernization of Agriculture (PMA), the efficiency and staffing needs in the National
Agricultural Research System (NARS) and the National Agriculture Advisory Service
(NAADS) will be reviewed, with the purpose of implementing measures to increase
efficiency in supporting the farmers.
26.
The customs union of the EAC will be effective on January 1, 2005. The tariff rates
agreed for the common external tariff (CET) are higher than Uganda’s current tariff structure.
However, all discriminatory excise taxes and other charges imposed on imports that currently
exist will be removed when the CET comes into effect in line with the Protocol for the EAC,
thus mitigating the negative impact on competitiveness. Business opportunities are expected
to grow under the customs union with its market of 90 million people.
27.
The Government is considering introducing Export Processing Zones (EPZs). In
preparing the draft of the Investment and Free Zones Bill, the Government will take into
consideration comments from the IMF and other stakeholders. To avoid harmful tax
competition for investment, Uganda will work with other EAC partner states to establish a
Code of Conduct to harmonize investment incentives. The Government will ensure that the
bill excludes elements that would erode the tax base and that the free zones are securely
enclosed with strict implementation of customs duties and other taxes on sales to Ugandan
residents.
28.
Notwithstanding the progress made in the past year in obtaining debt relief under the
HIPC Initiative, Uganda still faces a vulnerable external debt situation. The Government is
taking steps to improve this situation not only by encouraging exports, but also by exercising
better debt management. The strategy of borrowing on IDA-equivalent terms or better will be
maintained, while the Government at the same time will strive at increasing the share of
grants in the total donor inflows. Consistent with the amended regulations, the Government

- 49 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

will establish clear monitoring and operational procedures for the contracting of external debt
and debt management by end-June 2005.
III. MEDIUM-TERM MACROECONOMIC POLICY ISSUES
29.
The policy agenda for 2004/05 is consistent with the medium-term goal of sustaining
poverty reduction by maintaining strong economic growth. To address the recent setback in
poverty reduction, the forthcoming revised PEAP will put greater emphasis on: (i) raising
growth in the incomes of the poor, using public resources transparently and efficiently to
eradicate poverty; (ii) human development, including addressing the quality and drop-out
rates in primary schools, improving post-primary education, and population growth issues;
and (iii) restoring security for all regions of the country.
30.
The medium-term economic policies will focus on spurring export-led private sector
growth, while enhancing fiscal and external sustainability. Vital to the fiscal strategy will be
a steady reduction in the fiscal deficit and an increase in government savings. This will limit
fiscal injections of liquidity leading to lower interest rates, which in turn will promote higher
private investment growth. The success of this strategy will depend on stronger annual
increase in government revenues, notably through an improvement in tax administration,
coupled with a better allocation and efficiency of expenditures. Social-related expenditures in
the PEAP will continue to be ring fenced in order to contribute to the achievement of the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT II

Uganda: Technical Memorandum of Understanding
A. Introduction
1.
This memorandum defines the quantitative benchmarks and performance criteria
described in the memorandum of economic and financial policies (MEFP) for the remainder
of the 2004/05 financial program that would be supported by the IMF Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility (PRGF), and sets forth the reporting requirements under the arrangement.
B. Base Money
2.
Base money is defined as the sum of currency issued by Bank of Uganda (BOU) and
the commercial banks’ deposits in the BOU. The commercial bank deposits include the
statutory required reserves and excess reserves held at the BOU and are net of the deposits of
closed banks at the BOU and Development Finance Funds (DFF) contributed by commercial
banks held at the BOU. Under this definition, the daily average of June 2004 base money was
estimated at U Sh 809 billion. The base money limits for the remainder of 2004/05 will be
cumulative changes from the daily average of June 2004 to the daily average of March 2005
and June 2005, and will be monitored by the monetary authority and provided to the IMF by
the BOU.
C. Net Claims on the Central Government by the Banking System
3.
Net claims on the central government (NCG) by the banking system base defined
as the difference between the outstanding amount of bank credits to the central government
and the central government's deposits with the banking system, excluding deposits in project
accounts with the banking system, including the central bank. Credits comprise bank loans
and advances to the government and holdings of government securities and promissory notes.
NCG will be calculated based on data from balance sheets of the monetary authority and
commercial banks as per the monetary survey. The limits on the change in net claims on the
central government by the banking system will be cumulative beginning end-June 2004 for
the 2004/05 program.
D. Net International Reserves of the Bank of Uganda
4.
Net international reserves (NIR) of the BOU are defined for program monitoring
purpose as reserve assets of the BOU net of short-term external liabilities of the BOU.
Reserve assets are defined as external assets readily available to, and controlled by, the BOU
and exclude pledged or otherwise encumbered external assets, including, but not limited to,
assets used as collateral or guarantees for third-party liabilities. Short-term external liabilities
are defined as liabilities to nonresidents, of maturities less than one year, contracted by the
BOU and include outstanding IMF purchases and loans.
5.
For program-monitoring purposes, reserve assets and short-term liabilities (excluding
liabilities to the IMF) at the end of each test period will be calculated by converting reserve

- 55 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT II

assets measured in Uganda shillings as reported by the BOU using the end-month Uganda
shilling per U.S. dollar exchange rate. The U.S. dollar value of outstanding purchases and
loans from the IMF will be calculated by converting the outstanding SDR amount reported
by the Finance Department of the IMF using the U.S. dollar per SDR exchange rate at the
end of each quarter.
E. Expenditures Under the Poverty Action Fund
6.
The expenditures under the Poverty Action Fund (PAF) include both wage and
nonwage current expenditures under the PAF, and domestic development expenditures under
the PAF. The minimum cumulative expenditures under the PAF are defined in Schedule A
below. PAF expenditures will be measured based on checks printed for the central
government spending units and line ministries, and cash releases to local governments.

F. New Domestic Budgetary Arrears of the Central Government
7.
The nonaccumulation of new domestic payment arrears under the Commitment
Controls System (CCS) is an indicative target for March 2005 and a performance criterion
for June 2005. New domestic payments arrears are defined as the sum of all bills that have
been received by a central government spending unit or line ministry from a supplier of
goods and services delivered, and for which payment has not been made within 30 days
under the recurrent expenditure budget or the development expenditure budget. For the
purpose of program monitoring, the quarterly verified reports for nonwage recurrent and
development expenditure prepared by the Internal Audit Office at the Ministry of Finance,
Planning and Economic Development shall be used to determine the new arrears created
during each quarter of the 2004/05 fiscal year. The reports will be available within two and a
half months following the close of the covered period.
G. Ceiling on Public Administration Expenditures
8.
The quarterly expenditure limits for the public administration sector are defined in
Schedule B. For the purpose of program monitoring, the public administration sector includes
all expenditure (excluding that financed by donor projects) of the following votes: Office of
the Prime Minister (003) (excluding development), Foreign Affairs (006), Missions Abroad
(201-223), National Planning Authority (108), URA (008), State House (002), Public Service
(005), Public Service Commission (027), Local Government (011) (excluding development),
Mass Mobilization (135), Office of the President (001) (excluding ISO/ESO and E&I),

Specified Officers’ Salaries (100), Parliamentary Commission (104), Local Government
Finance Commission (147), Uganda Human Rights Commission (106), and Electoral
Commission (102). Any supplementary allocation of votes in the public administration sector
that would exceed program ceilings will be accommodated by cuts in votes belonging to
other categories within this same sector. Public administration expenditures will be measured
by the cash releases to the line ministries and other government units listed above.

H. Promissory Notes
9.
A promissory note is a written promise by the government to pay a debt, where
government is defined as the central government,1 local governments, and autonomous
government agencies. It is an unconditional promise to pay on demand or at a fixed or
determined future time a particular sum of money to, or to the order of, a specified person or
to the bearer. The government will not use promissory notes or any form of a promise to pay
for goods and services at a future date, and all domestic arrears payments will be settled in
cash or by the transfer of immediately available funds.
I. Adjusters
10.
The NIR target is based on assumptions regarding import support, assistance provided
under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, and external debt-service
payments. The NCG target, in addition to being based on the two aforementioned
assumptions, is also based on assumptions regarding domestic nonbank financing of central
government fiscal operations.
11.
The Uganda shilling equivalent of import support (grants and loans) plus HIPC
Initiative assistance in the form of grants on a cumulative basis from July 1, 2004 onward is
presented under Schedule C. The ceiling on the cumulative increase in NCG will be adjusted
downward (upward), and the floor on the cumulative increase in NIR of the BOU will be
adjusted upward (downward) by the amount by which import support, grants and loans, plus
HIPC Initiative assistance, exceeds (falls short of) the projected amounts.

amounted to U Sh 1.77 billion, which have a maximum guarantee period of six months.
These contingent liabilities fall due on the BOU balance sheet, and therefore do not affect the
program targets for the NIR and the NCG.
J. Nonconcessional External Borrowing Contracted or Guaranteed by the Central
Government, Statutory Bodies, or the Bank of Uganda, and Arrears
15.
The program includes a ceiling on new nonconcessional borrowing with maturities
greater than one year contracted or guaranteed by the government, statutory bodies, or the
BOU4. Nonconcessional borrowing is defined as loans with a grant element of less than
35 percent, calculated using average commercial interest rates references (CIRRs) published
by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). In assessing the
level of concessionality, the 10-year average CIRRs should be used to discount loans with
maturities of at least 15 years, while the 6-month average CIRRs should be used for loans
with shorter maturities. To both the 10-year and 6-month averages, the following margins for
differing payment periods should be added: 0.75 percent for repayment periods of less than
15 years; 1 percent for 15–19 years; 1.15 percent for 20–25 years; and 1.25 percent for
30 years or more. The ceiling on nonconcessional external borrowing is set at zero and is to
be observed on a continuous basis. The coverage of borrowing includes financial leases and
other instruments giving rise to external liabilities, contingent or otherwise, on
nonconcessional terms. Excluded from the limits are changes in indebtedness resulting from
refinancing credits and rescheduling operations, and credits extended by the IMF. For the
purposes of the program, arrangements to pay over time obligations arising from judicial
awards to external creditors that have not complied with the HIPC Initiative do not constitute
nonconcessional external borrowing.

Contraction is defined as approval by a resolution of parliament as required in Section 20(3) of the Public
Finance and Accountability Act, 2003.

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT II

16.
The definition of debt, for the purposes of the limit, is set out in point 9 of the
Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to External Debt (Executive Board’s
Decision No. 12274-(00/85), August 24, 2000). It not only applies to the debt as defined in
Point 9 of the Executive Board decision, but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed
for which value has not been received. The definition of debt set forth in No. 9 of the
Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to External Debt in Fund Arrangements
reads as follows:
“(a) For the purpose of this guideline, the term "debt" will be understood to
mean a current, i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual
arrangement through the provision of value in the form of assets (including
currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make one or more
payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at some
future point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or
interest liabilities incurred under the contract. Debts can take a number of
forms, the primary ones being as follows: (i) loans, i.e., advances of money
to the obligor by the lender made on the basis of an undertaking that the
obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits, bonds,
debentures, commercial loans and buyers' credits) and temporary exchanges
of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which the
obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by
repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase
agreements and official swap arrangements); (ii) suppliers' credits, i.e.,
contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer payments until some
time after the date on which the goods are delivered or services are provided;
and (iii) leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which
the lessee has the right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that
are usually shorter than the total expected service life of the property, while
the lessor retains the title to the property. For the purpose of the guideline,
the debt is the present value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease
payments expected to be made during the period of the agreement excluding
those payments that cover the operation, repair, or maintenance of the
property.
(b) Under the definition of debt set out in point 9(a) above, arrears, penalties,
and judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment
under a contractual obligation that constitutes debt. Failure to make payment
on an obligation that is not considered debt under this definition (e.g.,
payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt.”
17.
The ceiling on the accumulation of new external payments arrears is zero. This limit,
which is to be observed on a continuous basis, applies to the change in the stock of overdue
payments on debt contracted or guaranteed by the government, the BOU, and statutory

- 60 -

bodies5 from their level at end-June 2004. It comprises those external arrears reported by the
Trade and External Debt Department of the BOU, the Macro Department of the Ministry
of Finance that cannot be rescheduled because they were disbursed after the Paris Club
cutoff date.
K. Monitoring and Reporting Requirements
18.
The authorities will inform the IMF staff in writing at least ten business days
(excluding legal holidays in Uganda or in the United States) prior to making any changes in
economic and financial policies that could affect the outcome of the financial program. Such
policies include but are not limited to customs and tax laws (including tax rates, exemptions,
allowances, and thresholds), wage policy, and financial support to public and private
enterprises. The authorities will similarly inform the IMF staff of any nonconcessional
external debt contracted or guaranteed by the government, the BOU, or any statutory bodies,
and any accumulation of new external payments arrears on the debt contracted or guaranteed
by these entities.
19.
The information, such as the issuance of treasury bills, the intervention in the foreign
exchange market, daily average exchange rates, and the interest rate on government
securities, will be transmitted to the IMF's resident representative weekly, within five
working days of the end of each week.
20.
The BOU will reconcile the monetary survey data with the financial statements on an
annual basis and with the financial records on a quarterly basis. The Internal Audit
Department (IAD) of the BOU will review the reconciliations of monetary survey data with
the financial records and the audited financial statements. Any revisions to monetary survey
data, in line with the recommendations of the IMF safeguards mission, will be documented
and reconciled with the previous presentation to ensure accurate reporting.
21.
The government will provide the IMF staff with a summary of the fiscal accounts,
both on a monthly and quarterly basis, with a seven-week lag from the end of the reporting
month and quarter. Revenues will be recorded on a cash basis as reported by the Uganda
Revenue Authority and the MFPED. Expenditures shall be recorded when checks are issued,
except for domestic and external debt-service payments, cash transfers to districts, and
externally funded development expenditures. Expenditures on domestic interest will be
recorded on an accrual basis and external debt service will be recorded on a commitment
basis (i.e., when payment is due). Cash transfers to districts will be recorded as expenditures
of the central government when the transfer is effected by the BOU. Expenditures on
externally funded development programs will be recorded as the sum of estimated
5

This definition is consistent with the coverage of public sector borrowing defined by the Fund (includes the
debt of the general government, monetary authorities, and entities that are public corporations which are subject
to the control by government units, defined as the ability to determine general corporate policy or by at least
50 percent government ownership).

- 61 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT II

disbursements of project loans and grants by donors, less the change in the stock of
government project accounts held at commercial banks in Uganda. Information on required
and approved supplementary allocations in each month should be provided to the IMF within
15 days of the end of each month.
22.
The government will provide the IMF staff with a summary of expenditure cash
limits on a quarterly basis with a one-week lag from the date they are provided to ministries,
and no later than two weeks after the beginning of the quarter.
23.
The government will provide the IMF staff with a summary of the contingent
liabilities of the central government on a quarterly basis with a seven-week lag from the end
of the reporting quarter. For the purpose of the program, contingent liabilities include all
borrowings by statutory bodies, loans borrowed by public enterprises or the private sector
and guaranteed by the government, claims against the government in court cases that are
pending, or court awards that the government has appealed.
24.
Final accounts of the local government authorities for fiscal-year 2003/04 will be
consolidated by end-September 2005 by the Ministry of Finance, Macro Department. The
summary Status of Submission of District Monthly Accounts Returns will be provided to the
IMF Resident Representative within 45 days of the end of each month. A report explaining
any noncompliance with the monthly reporting requirement by districts will be provided at
the same time as the summary status report to the IMF. Any noncompliance by 45 days
following the end of a month will result in a reminder letter being sent from the Treasury
Inspectorate Department to the District Chairperson. Any noncompliance for an additional
month will result in a memorandum being sent from the Commissioner of the Treasury
Inspectorate Department to the Budget Director indicating that the monitoring and
accountability grants to the noncompliance districts should be discontinued until compliance
is restored. A memorandum indicating this action will be sent to each noncompliant district.
25.
For the purpose of program monitoring, the quarterly verified reports for non-wage
recurrent and development expenditure prepared by the Internal Audit Office at the Ministry
of Finance, Planning and Economic Development shall be used to determine the new arrears
created during each quarter of the 2004/05 fiscal year. The reports will be available within
two and a half months following the close of the covered period.
26.
As supplementary information, the government will provide the IMF staff on a
monthly basis, with a seven-week lag from the end of the reporting month, a statement of the
following: (i) outstanding stock of checks issued by the Uganda Computer Services of the
MFPED, disaggregated into checks issued for commitments arising during July 1, 2004
through June 30, 2005, and checks issued to settle intraministerial payment obligations; and
(ii) the value of budget support (grants and loans) received by the government, and the value
of projections of donor project support received so far. The government will provide the IMF
forecasts of the value of budget support and project support (grants and loans) expected to be
received for the rest of the current year and the medium term, by donor and sector, by the end
of each reporting quarter.

- 62 -

27.
As supplementary information, the BOU will provide the IMF staff on a monthly
basis, with a seven-week lag from the end of the reporting month, a statement of the
following: (i) cash balances held in project accounts at commercial banks; (ii) total value
(measured at issue price) of outstanding government securities from the Central Depository
System (CDS); and (iii) the stock of government securities (measured at issue price) held by
commercial banks from the CDS.
28.
The government will provide the IMF staff on a quarterly basis, with a seven-week
lag from the end of the reporting quarter the following: (i) a statement on new loans
contracted during the period as per the loan agreement, with additional information on
disbursement provided within six months; and (ii) a statement on creditor participation in the
HIPC Initiative, the status of creditor litigation cases, and cash payments relating to the
settlement of awards.
29.
The BOU will provide the IMF staff on a quarterly basis, with a seven-week lag from
the end of the reporting quarter, (i) monthly commodity and direction of trade statistics;
(ii) the stock of debt, disbursements, principal and interest, flows of debt rescheduling and
debt cancellation, arrears, and committed undisbursed balances—by creditor category; and
(iii) the monthly composition of nominal HIPC Initiative assistance, disaggregated into
grants, flow rescheduling, and stock-of-debt reduction by creditor.
30.
The consumer price index will be transmitted monthly to the IMF with no more than
a two-week lag from the end of the reporting month. The balance sheet of the BOU, the
consolidated accounts of the commercial banks, and the monetary survey will be transmitted
to the IMF on a monthly basis with a lag of no more than seven weeks from the end of the
reporting month.
31.
Standard off-site bank supervision indicators for deposit money banks will be
transmitted to the IMF quarterly and on-site reports transmitted as needed, based on the
findings of the off-site reports.

VIII. Safeguards Assessments:
Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the Bank of Uganda (BOU) is subject to a
full safeguards assessment with respect to the PRGF arrangement, which was approved on
September 13, 2002 and is scheduled to expire on September 12, 2005. The assessment was
completed on April 13, 2003 and concluded that, although the BOU had several strengths,
some vulnerabilities existed. In line with the program, the authorities have been
implementing specific measures proposed by the safeguards assessment to address these
vulnerabilities. The audited financial statements for the years ended June 30, 2002 and
June 30, 2003 have both been completed and laid before the legislature by May 9, 2003 and
September 30, 2003, respectively. Both were published on the BOU website (the end-2003
financial statement was posted on the BOU website in November 2003). The BOU has
provided the Fund copies of the follow-up plan to address the Auditors’ recommendations,
the annual audit work plans for 2003/04 and 2004/05, and the risk-based auditing framework.
The BOU is also in the process of putting into operation a banking application and a new
accounting manual, and considering alternative types of risk management frameworks.

IX. Exchange Rate Arrangement
On November 1, 1993, the BOU stopped the auction of foreign exchange and created an
interbank market for foreign exchange, through which the official exchange rate is
determined. As of October 31, 2004, the official exchange rate was U Sh 1,727 per
U.S. dollar. The exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions.
X. Article IV Consultation
The Executive Board concluded the last Article IV consultation on February 12, 2003. The
next Article IV consultation with Uganda will be held on the 24-month cycle, subject to the
provisions of the decision on consultation cycles approved on July 15, 2002.
In February and April 2001, joint World Bank/Fund missions visited Kampala as part of the
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP). A final report was provided to the authorities
in November 2001, an MFD mission discussed the report with the authorities during the
Article IV consultation discussion in November 2002, and the Financial System Stability
Assessment was prepared for Board discussion in February 2003.
XI. Technical Assistance
Uganda has received extensive technical assistance from the Fund in recent years.3
An FAD mission visited Kampala in April 1998 to advise the authorities on public service
pension reform issues, and another mission visited Kampala in September 1998 to assist the
authorities in improving customs administration procedures. A resident advisor in the area of
local government budgeting began a six-month assignment in August 1998, which was
subsequently extended to October 1999. An FAD resident advisor on budgeting and
commitment control commenced a six-month assignment in November 1998, which was
extended until June 2002. In October 2000, an FAD mission visited Kampala to provide
technical assistance in tax policy and administration. A joint World Bank/Fund TA mission
visited Kampala in October 2003 to help harmonize tax investment incentives among the
member countries of the East African Community (EAC). A FAD TA mission on tax
administration also visited Uganda in October 2004 to develop a comprehensive reform plan
for the Uganda Revenue Authority (URA). Two FAD resident advisors (coordinated through
AFRITAC-East) are currently in the field assisting the implementation of a CCS at the local
government level and the Fiscal Decentralization Strategy.
An STA multisector statistics mission visited Kampala in December 1998 to conduct a
comprehensive assessment of Uganda’s macroeconomic statistics, including data compilation
and dissemination, and to provide recommendations for improvements. Follow-up STA

APPENDIX II

missions in national accounts and money and banking statistics visited Kampala in March–
April 2000 to examine the status of implementation of the previous recommendations. An
STA mission on government financial statistics (GFS) visited Uganda in December 2001 to
assist the authorities in improving fiscal reporting by establishing regular reporting systems
that are aligned with the GFS Manual 2001, as well as ensuring consistency within monetary
sector data for the government. A follow-up mission on GFS visited Uganda in May 2003. A
mission visited Uganda during February–March 2002 to review balance of payments
statistics and the progress in implementing the recommendations of the multisector mission
of 1998 and of the national accounts mission of 2000 with respect to the measurement of
goods imports. A follow-up mission on balance of payments statistics visited Uganda in
August 2003. Uganda is participating in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS)
and its metadata were initially posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
in May 2000
Since the 2001 FSAP, MFD’s TA to Uganda has focused on liquidity management, exchange
rate intervention, central bank accounting and auditing, and banking supervision. The
authorities have effectively used TA advice on these topics, and they have made good use of
an MFD resident advisor, who took up an initial appointment in mid-July 2001. The advisor
was fully integrated into the supervision function and has been involved in all aspects of the
work, including participating in on-site examinations. Her contract was extended through
July 2004, and the authorities are now in the process of selecting a new MFD resident
advisor to follow up on the progress made so far. MFD has fielded two TA missions
(July 2001 and January 2002) to assist the authorities with liquidity management and address
the problems of interest rate volatility and exchange rate interventions. The BOU has started
implementing the recommendations made in the report, and now clearly separates
sterilization operations and liquidity management; however, they are still having problems
with interest rate and exchange rate volatility and have requested a follow-up TA in this area.
In March and September–October 2002, MFD provided TA to improve central bank
accounting and the Bank of Uganda’s accounting manual. A TA evaluation visit was
conducted in June 2003, and an MFD mission following up on monetary and exchange rate
operations, public debt, and liquidity management was conducted in March 2004. Finally, a
FSAP update mission was conducted in November 2004 focused on access, outreach and
stability issues, which also updated progress made since the last FSAP.
XII. Future Technical Assistance Priorities
The priorities for Fund technical assistance in the next few years will be in the areas of tax
administration, public expenditure management, especially control and monitoring of public
arrears at both central and local government levels, monetary and exchange rate
management, bank supervision, national accounts statistics, reporting standards for
government finance statistics, monetary and balance of payments statistical reporting, central
bank accounting, and audit and debt management.
XIII. Resident Representative
The Fund has maintained a resident representative in Uganda since July 1982.

APPENDIX III

Uganda: Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of November 19, 2004)
I. PARTNERSHIP IN UGANDA’S DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY
1.
The development strategy of the government of Uganda is based on the Poverty
Eradication Action Plan (PEAP), a medium-term development framework that guides
government policy and provides a framework for detailed sector and district plans. Because
the PEAP’s objectives are fully consistent with those of the poverty reduction strategy paper
(PRSP) process, a summary of the revised PEAP was used as a basis for Uganda’s PRSP,
which was presented to the Boards of the World Bank and Fund in May 2000. Uganda’s
PEAP/PRSP is based on four pillars: (1) creating an environment for economic growth and
structural transformation; (2) ensuring good governance and security; (3) directly increasing
the ability of the poor to raise incomes; and (4) directly increasing the quality of life of the
poor.
2.
The Bank and Fund support the government’s efforts to implement the strategy in a
complementary fashion. The Fund provides its support through a second three-year
arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF), and continues
concentrating on macroeconomic and financial sector issues, focusing specifically on shortand medium-term macroeconomic stability, which falls under the first PEAP/PRSP pillar.
The structural program of the Fund addresses the areas of tax administration, budget
management, monitoring of local government finances, financial sector regulations and
supervision, and improvement of the national accounts and statistics.
3.
The Bank is supporting the implementation of PEAP/PRSP, specifically focusing on
structural and sectoral reforms to alleviate poverty. The assistance is delivered in the form of
budget and project support, with a heavy focus also on analytic work. The Government is
currently in the process of revising its PEAP/PRSP. The new 2004 PEAP/PRSP has five core
elements: (1) economic management; (2) production, competitiveness and income;
(3) security, conflict-resolution and disaster management; (4) disaster management; and
(5) human development.
II. BANK GROUP STRATEGY
4.
The World Bank Group’s current Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Uganda was
approved by the Board on November 16, 2000.1 The objective of the CAS is to support
Uganda’s economic transformation and poverty reduction strategy. The emphasis on
maintaining macroeconomic stability continues, but the focus is increasingly shifting to
sector-level and cross-cutting public sector management issues.
1

The next CAS is currently being prepared and scheduled to be presented to the Board in fiscal-year 2004/05
(July–June).

- 68 -

APPENDIX III

5.
Consistent with this strategy, the Bank has been increasingly shifting to programmatic
lending through a series of annual Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSC) that support
the implementation of Uganda’s PEAP/PRSP. The first annual single-tranche PRSC
(PRSC1) for Uganda was approved by the Board in May 2001. A subsequent arrangement,
PRSC2, was approved in July 2002, and PRSC3 and PRSC4 were approved by the Board in
September 2003 and 2004, respectively. PRSCs support a medium-term, with each annual
arrangement linked to specific reform actions. The supported by PRSCs aims to improve
public service delivery and agricultural production, since basic services critical to
development is still inadequate in Uganda and about 70 percent of the population derives its
livelihood from agriculture. Services provided, in particular by the public sector, are of poor
quality owing to various governance problems and capacity constraints. Also, the enabling
environment for private sector and civil society involvement is weak, thus further
constraining service delivery and growth.
6.
The World Bank Group’s assistance program is fully consistent with and supports the
four pillars of the PEAP/PRSP through a combination of lending and analytical activities as
follows:
7.
PEAP/PRSP Pillar 1—Creating an Environment for Economic Growth and
Structural Transformation. To promote economic growth and development of the private
sector, the Bank Group supports the development of Uganda’s infrastructure, specifically,
roads, power, and reform of key utilities. Infrastructure, and in particular power availability,
has been identified as one of the key constraints on private sector investments and projects
such as the Fourth Power and Bujagali Hydropower aim to address them. The Bank also
provides support to the government’s ten-year Road Development Program through a series
of road sector projects. The Privatization and Utility Sector Reform Project, in turn, supports
the reform of key utilities and divestiture of the remaining public enterprises. On a regional
basis, the Bank continues to provide advisory support to the Nile Basin Initiative, in which
nine riparian countries of the Nile Basin are cooperating to utilize the resources of the river in
environmentally sustainable ways.
8.
Through the PRSCs, the Bank supports the government’s efforts to strengthen public
expenditure and budgetary management, enhance the results orientation of sector expenditure
programs, rationalize and strengthen monitoring and evaluation systems, and proceed with
gradual fiscal decentralization by streamlining the intergovernmental fiscal transfer system.
PRSCs also support development of the legal and regulatory framework for microfinance,
pension reform, and the strengthening of the insurance sector.
9.
PEAP/PRSP Pillar 2—Ensuring Good Governance and Security. Good
governance is essential for effective public service delivery. The Bank plays a key role in
supporting the government’s efforts to improve governance, including in the areas of
combating corruption and implementing broad-based public sector reform. The Bank
supports through the PRSCs a variety of cross-cutting public sector management reforms to
increase accountability and transparency, and reduce corruption. These include reforms in

- 69 -

APPENDIX III

public procurement, financial management, public sector pay, payroll and personal
management, and anticorruption legislation. Ongoing work on financial accountability
through the Second Economic and Financial Management Project (EFMP II) and Local
Government Development Project (LGDP) complements these efforts.
10.
PEAP/PRSP Pillar 3—Directly Increasing the Ability of the Poor to Raise Their
Incomes. Agriculture dominates Uganda’s economy and the majority of the poor live in rural
areas. The Bank supports several activities that aim to enhance environmentally sustainable
rural development and reduce regional disparities. Support is provided through a demanddriven National Agricultural Services Project and the Second Agricultural Research and
Training Project. Furthermore, the series of PRSCs support the government so that it can
identify ways to promote agricultural diversification and modernization, mainstreaming of
environmental concerns in government programs, land tenure reforms, and expansion of
nonfarm activities in rural areas. The Second Environmental Management and Capacity
Building Project, the Second Protected Areas Management and Sustainable Use Project, and
the second phase of the regional Lake Victoria Project help address the environmental
challenges. To reduce regional disparities, the Second Northern Uganda Social Action Fund
targets the relatively poor districts of northern and eastern Uganda, which have not benefited
proportionately from economic reform and liberalization.
11.
PEAP/PRSP Pillar 4—Directly Increasing the Quality of Life of the Poor. The
delivery of primary education, health care, and potable water has a direct impact on the
quality of life of the poor, and the delivery is at the core of the government’s poverty
reduction strategy. The Bank supports the government’s efforts to improve access to, and
quality of, education, health care, and water and sanitation services, primarily through the
series of PRSCs. The HIV/AIDs Control Project supports Uganda’s effort to fight the
HIV/AIDS epidemic by supporting local initiatives that are providing prevention, treatment,
and care.
III. BANK PORTFOLIO

V. BANK-FUND COLLABORATION IN SPECIFIC AREAS
14.
The IMF and World Bank staffs maintain a close collaborative relationship in
supporting the government’s structural reforms. As part of its overall assistance, the Bank
supports policy reforms in the following areas in collaboration with the Fund:
15.
Poverty reduction strategy paper. The Bank and Fund are assisting the government
in the revision and implementation of its poverty reduction strategy. The staffs of the
two institutions prepare joint assessments of the PRSP or the PRSP progress report on an
annual basis.
16.
Debt sustainability. The staffs of the Bank and Fund continue collaborating on
issues related to the Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC Initiative), and
prepared jointly an updated debt sustainability analysis for Uganda in calendar-year 2002,
which is being currently updated.
17.
Public expenditure management. Strengthening public expenditure management is
the critical first step in improving the efficiency of public service delivery. The Bank, Fund,

- 71 -

APPENDIX III

and other donors are working closely to provide the government the support needed for
institutional and policy reforms. The Fund is leading the dialogue on fiscal policy, while the
Bank is focusing on strategic expenditure allocation and efficiency of public expenditures
through its work on the public expenditure review and PRSC. The staffs of the two
institutions prepare, on an annual basis, a report that tracks HIPC Initiative poverty-reducing
spending, analyzes the quality of public expenditure management in Uganda, and identifies
areas needing strengthening.
18.
Financial sector reform. A joint Bank-Fund Financial Sector Assessment was
conducted in 2001. The assessment indicates that performance of the financial sector has
improved in the past few years, but access to financial services remains a problem, especially
in rural areas, and the range of financial products is limited. The insurance sector has been
liberalized and new companies and brokers have entered the market, but supervision of the
sector is still weak. The pension sector needs urgently to be reformed, as civil service
pension obligations are accounting for an increasing portion of budget resources. Both the
Bank and Fund are supporting the government’s efforts to reform the financial sector. The
Bank supports these efforts through PRSC measures to strengthen the insurance sector,
reform the pension system, and develop the legal and regulatory framework for microfinance.
The work is closely coordinated with a program supported by the Fund’s PRGF arrangement,
which addresses selected aspects of pension reform.
19.
Trade reforms. The Bank and Fund are working closely to assist Uganda in
establishing a pro-growth trade framework. Both institutions are involved in the dialogue on
trade reforms in the context of the East African Community at the regional level.

APPENDIX IV

Uganda: Statistical Issues

Uganda participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS); its metadata were
initially posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board in May 2000.
Real sector
The March–April 2000 STA mission concluded that Uganda’s national accounts were of poor
quality, owing to shortages of experienced compilation staff and equipment and a lack of
reliable source data for several key economic activities. Consequently, an STA-sponsored
long-term national accounts statistics advisor was assigned to the Uganda Bureau of Statistics
in April 2001 to assist in the improvement of the national accounts and in the rebasing of all
economic statistics. By the conclusion of this assignment, in April 2002, balanced production
and expenditure estimates had been prepared, including data from the most recent household
survey, and the constant price estimates had been rebased from 1991 to 1997/98 (July–June).
In addition, the national accounts and balance of payments estimates of imports and exports
were reconciled, and the national accounts methodology improved. In December 2002, an
Africa Regional Technical Assistance Center (AFRITAC) mission to assess the need for a
long-term advisor to the Uganda Bureau of Statistics on national accounts statistics took place.
It was decided that a long-term advisor was not essential, and instead a national accounts
advisor from AFRITAC has fielded missions on a regular basis.
The consumer price index is of sound quality and is reported promptly for publication in
International Financial Statistics (IFS). Neither producer nor wholesale price indices are
produced. Reliable and consistent data are not available on employment, wages, or trade
volumes.
Government finance
The 2001 Government Finance Statistics (GFS) technical assistance mission discussed several
data classification issues with the Ministry of Finance, and proposed a summary framework for
the reporting of GFS according to the GFS Manual 2001 framework. The 2003 GFS technical
assistance mission found that significant progress had been made implementing the
recommendations of the previous mission, identified some weaknesses in the proposed new
chart of accounts, and made further recommendations to improve the quality of GFS.
Monetary accounts
An STA multisector statistics mission to Uganda (December 2–15, 1998) determined that
Uganda's monetary statistics, which had been compiled from a bank reporting system, were
broadly adequate for policy purposes. However, the quality of data is compromised by various
methodological problems, such as an arbitrary application of the residency criterion, an
inadequate disaggregation of the resident sector data, a large discrepancy in the reported
interbank positions, and misclassifications of some accounting data related to monetary

- 73 -

APPENDIX IV

aggregates. To address these issues, the mission recommended that the Bank of Uganda
instruct commercial banks to classify accounts according to their clients' properly determined
residency and use a more detailed scheme for disaggregating the resident sector data. The
mission also recommended a symmetrical treatment of government lending in the central
bank's and commercial banks' data in order to narrow discrepancies in the reported interbank
positions. Reclassification of the accounting data was also recommended in order to facilitate
proper measurement of key monetary aggregates, in particular, domestic money supply, claims
on central government, claims on the private sector, and foreign liabilities. The follow-up STA
mission that visited Uganda during March 29–April 12, 2000 concluded that the Bank of
Uganda had implemented most of these recommendations.
Balance of payments
The December 1998 mission recommended that preshipment inspection of imports be
maintained, and that the automated system for customs data (ASYCUDA) be fully
implemented at the customs posts, where it had been introduced, and extended to major
crossings on the eastern border. When banks are more fully computerized and commercial
bank personnel have been adequately trained in reporting, the monthly bank reporting form
should be revised once more to fully conform to the Balance of Payments Manual (5th ed.).
Surveys should be introduced to supplement customs- and bank-reported data and to derive
more accurate estimates of services and financial transactions. The 2002 mission also noted
that the bank reporting system was still seriously inadequate. Given that Uganda dropped
controls on financial account transactions in 1997 (for current account transactions, in 1994),
major improvements are necessary to deal with weaknesses in the system.
The data presently reported to the Fund for publication are annual and relatively timely. Data
for 2003 were recently submitted and will be published in the 2004 edition of the IFS. Reliable
balance of payments data should also be compiled and reported on a quarterly basis.

APPENDIX V

Uganda: Debt Sustainability Analysis Update
This appendix updates the debt sustainability analysis conducted in the previous staff report
(Country Report No. 04/289). The main conclusions of the preceding exercise remain valid:
(i) Uganda is still prone to potentially serious debt sustainability problems due to its high net
present value (NPV) of external debt-to-export ratios; and (ii) a gradual fiscal consolidation
effort is warranted to maintain a manageable debt service.
The updated Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) incorporates a refinement of debt data
and modifications of some macroeconomic assumptions in line with recent World
Economic Outlook (WEO) projections. Revised debt data includes information on some
creditors that were available after the previous DSA was concluded.1 Based on the good
export performance, especially for nontraditional goods, the annual growth rate of exports
has been revised slightly upwards over the long term. The nominal GDP in U.S. dollars have
been adjusted under the assumption that the real exchange rate will remain constant in the
long term.
Uganda’s debt-service obligations, after HIPC assistance, are manageable, but the
external debt sustainability situation remains difficult over the foreseeable future in the
baseline scenario (Tables 1 and 2). The ratio of debt-service obligations to exports of goods
and services stays at about 8 to 10 percent reflecting external financing based on grants and
concessional loans. The NPV of external debt to exports of goods and services will remain at
210–225 percent over the next ten years, well above the HIPC Initiative threshold of
150 percent, before declining steadily toward a more sustainable level.
Stress tests show that the debt burden would worsen significantly in the event of
adverse macroeconomic shocks, but the ratio of external debt service to exports will not
change notably, even in the worst case scenario. Bound tests show that debt sustainability
is very sensitivity to shocks on export performance and a combination of all macroeconomic
shocks.

1

•

A two-year shock on the export sector (B2), such as terms of trade shock, has a long
lasting effect on debt dynamics reflecting low available external resources. The ratio
of the NPV of external debt to exports would increase by up to 100 percentage points
by 2013/14, compared with the baseline scenario. The export-shock scenario also
shows that Uganda’s debt servicing capacity is affected in the near term as the debt
service-to-exports ratio increases to 15 percent from 10 percent in 2003/04.

•

The debt dynamics would be significantly affected in the near term by a combination
of weaker shocks (B5) causing a greater macroeconomic instability. These combined
shocks would negatively impact debt sustainability by increasing the ratios of NPV of

Debt data related to South Korea, the East African Development Bank, and the Islamic Development Bank.

- 76 -

APPENDIX V

debt to GDP and to exports by up to 13 and 78 percentage points in the near term,
respectively.
The DSA for Uganda suggests that achieving debt sustainability over the long term
depends on implementing a sound export strategy and a gradual fiscal consolidation to
strengthen the macroeconomic situation. The export policy should focus on diversifying
the export base and enhancing export competitiveness, given the risks of relying mainly on
primary exports of agricultural products. Fiscal consolidation combined with a prudent debt
management strategy, including increasing the share of grants in total aid inflows, are
critical, particularly in the event of simultaneous shocks.

Uganda: Tracking Poverty-Reducing Spending—Second Assessment and
Action Plan (AAP)27
A. Background
Fund/World Bank staff carried out a first assessment of public expenditure
management (PEM) systems of Uganda in 2001.28 The objective was to appraise how well
existing systems tracked poverty-reducing spending, and was based on 15 benchmarks
covering budget formulation, execution, and reporting. The assessment concluded that
Uganda met 9 benchmarks—5 on budget formulation, 1 on budget execution, and 3 on
budget reporting. This placed Uganda above 23 other countries included in the exercise.
Uganda was viewed as requiring “some upgrading” in its PEM systems; hence, the AAP
identified a range of actions for implementation in the short and medium terms, to be
supported by the donor community.
A Fund-World Bank mission visited Kampala in February 2004 to conduct a second
assessment, which sought to determine progress made in strengthening the PEM systems
since the first exercise. Staff also developed, in conjunction with the authorities, an action
plan to address any persistent weaknesses in PEM and on the tracking of pro-poor spending.
The 2004 assessment was based on 16 benchmarks. As in the 2001 AAP, seven
benchmarks were designed to evaluate the status of budget formulation systems, four covered
the area of budget execution, and four related to the existing reporting procedures. A new
benchmark was included to assess the existing procurement mechanisms.
B. 2004 Assessment
The 2004 AAP exercise assessed Uganda’s PEM systems both at the central and local
government levels, given the progress achieved by the fiscal decentralization strategy. In
particular, some 40 percent of total government spending and about 70 percent of povertyreducing outlays are now executed at the subnational government level.
Performance in each of the indicators is summarized as follows:
1.

Coverage of the budget or fiscal reporting entity. Uganda does not meet this
benchmark, since the coverage of fiscal information does not fully match the
Government Finance Statistics (GFS) definition of the general government sector
(i.e., including central, regional and local governments, and all government
operations, whether funded through the budget or not). In particular, there are

and Action Plan”, November 2004.

- 80 -

APPENDIX VI

19 central government agencies and 82 extrabudgetary institutions or “autonomous
agencies” that are not fully incorporated into the budget and reporting cycle.
2.

Degree of spending being funded by inadequately reported extrabudgetary sources.
Uganda does not meet this benchmark, since the sources of inadequately reported
revenue are significant (about 3-10 percent of total budgeted expenditure). Notably,
nontax revenue is not fully reported by central government units obliged to remit their
income to the Uganda Consolidated Fund; further, there are autonomous agencies and
extrabudgetary funds which are neither reported in the budget (other than for the
transfers made to them to cover part of their operational needs), nor in the fiscal
accounts.

3.

Reliability of the budget as a guide to the future. Uganda does not meet this
benchmark, since the aggregate budget execution differs significantly from the
original budget appropriations; in particular, central government spending per
administrative sector deviated from the budget by about 22 percent on average
between 2000/01 and 2002/03. While the strong deviation is mostly explained by the
poor reporting on the execution of donor projects, the persistent pressures at the
central government level to approve supplementary budgets have also played a role.
Finally, budget performance at the local government level also suggests a relatively
large degree of budget unpredictability.

4.

Inclusion of donor funds. Uganda does not meet this benchmark, since not all
budgets and/or fiscal reports include, without exception, grants provided by donors
and the capital and current expenditures of all multilaterals and bilateral government
activities. While foreign aid in grants and loans (received both as budget and project
support) are fully accounted for ex ante, information on the execution of project
grants and loans is not available in a systematic and timely basis.

5.

Expenditure classification. Uganda meets this benchmark, as acceptable
administrative, economic and functional/programmatic classifications consistent with
GFS were introduced in the 2003/04 new chart of accounts. Notwithstanding these
achievements, the current functional classification is obtained through a mapping
arrangement between the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) codes and
the COFOG functional classification.29 While this provides a satisfactory interim
arrangement for functional analysis, the authorities should seek to fully incorporate
COFOG into their new chart of accounts.

6.

Identification of poverty-reducing expenditure. Uganda meets this benchmark, as it
was one of the first countries to employ a virtual “Poverty Action Fund” (PAF) for
tracking poverty-reducing expenditures that is clearly identified in the budget. The
PAF allows the authorities to ring-fence priority outlays from potential cuts.

29

Classification of Functions of Government, 1999, developed by OECD and UNDP, which is fully
incorporated into the GFS 2001 framework.

- 81 -

APPENDIX VI

7.

Integration of medium-term forecasts. Uganda meets this benchmark, since multiyear expenditure projections are fully integrated into the central and local budget
process through the MTEF. The MTEF has strengthened significantly since it was
first implemented, specially through the establishment of sectoral working groups
(SWGs) that bring together institutions with complementary activities in certain
sectors to prepare three-year rolling budgets. Challenges ahead include the integration
of all donor aid into the MTEF ceilings, and improving the integration of certain
sectors or types of spending, and further developing the output-oriented budgeting.

8.

Evidence of budget execution problems—Arrears. This benchmark is not met, since
Uganda holds a significant stock of arrears (estimated to be above the threshold of 5
percent of total spending, including both central and local government). In addition,
systematic and comprehensive verified information of arrears in not available at any
government level, especially in the case of wages and pensions in the central
government, and for all types of spending at the local government level.

9.

Effectiveness of the internal control system. Uganda meets this benchmark, since
the internal control (management and audit) is broadly regarded to be effective. In
particular, the internal control regime at the central government level is sound and has
improved steadily, including through the publication of the Public Finance and
Accountability Act (PFAA) 2003. In addition, the core expenditure control
procedures at the higher level of subnational government (districts) are clearly
specified and are also sound.

10.

Tracking surveys are in use. Uganda meets this benchmark, since several Public
Expenditure Tracking Surveys (“PETSs”) have become a regular feature in core
sectors, including education, health, and water and sanitation.

11.

Quality of fiscal information. Uganda meets this benchmark, since processes are in
place requiring reconciliation of both central and local government’s accounts with
corresponding bank accounts. The accounting regulations require that budget
agencies submit their summary monthly accounts within 20 days of the end of the
month, and most agencies comply with this deadline, in some cases including bank
reconciliation statements. Moreover, more detailed financial statements are received
half-yearly; submission of clean reports supported by certificates of bank balances
suggests that these are reconciled on a timely and routine basis.

12.

Regularity of timely internal fiscal reporting. Uganda does not meet this benchmark.
While by and large line ministries and other central agencies submit monthly fiscal
reports to the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development (MFPED)
within four weeks, the reporting on operations of donor-financed projects is irregular
and unsatisfactory. Moreover, self-financing agencies submit only partial monthly
reports to MPFED; at subnational levels, delays in the submission of reports to the
appropriate authorities are not uncommon.

13.

Fiscal reports present spending on a functional basis. This benchmark is not met,
since the central and local government budgets do not reflect COFOG functional
classification in the appropriation structures and the chart of accounts.

- 82 -

APPENDIX VI

14.

Transactions are recorded in the accounts in a timely fashion. Uganda meets this
benchmark. Routine transactions are not entered into the government’s accounts after
the close of the fiscal year, even though the account books of the central government
are kept open for four months, to allow recording of checks issued during the fiscal
year but cleared subsequently.

15.

Timeliness of audited financial information. This benchmark is met, since an
audited record of the central government’s accounts is presented to the legislature
within 12 months of the end of the fiscal year. Audit reports on subnational
government accounts are also presented to the respective local councils within one
year of the end of the fiscal year. The timing of the audit report of individual donorfinanced projects, however, is determined by donor’s requirements to whom copies
are endorsed, while the timing and methodology for audits of statutory bodies have
suffered some delays.

16.

Efficiency and effectiveness of the public procurement system. The benchmark is
not met, since Uganda’s procurement system continues to operate in a weak
governance environment and lacks controls.
C. Conclusions

Uganda’s PEM systems remain relatively strong compared to other HIPCs, and have
improved in several areas highlighted as deficient in 2001. First, the internal control
systems are broadly regarded to be effective; second, a significant number of tracking
surveys on poverty-reducing expenditure has been carried out in a systematic manner; third,
the books are closed in a timely manner at year end and, finally, the audit reports are
presented to the legislature within an acceptable period of time.
The latest assessment revealed three areas of concern in budget execution and
reporting. First, there is a lack of reliable data and control of expenditure arrears. Second,
the absence of a functional classification in the annual budget vote structure and the chart of
accounts make it difficult to transparently track poverty-reducing spending from government
accounts. Third, in-year fiscal reports on budget execution are available with a lag. Finally,
there is no timely reporting of donor-funded projects, and a significant variability of budget
outturns relative to the original budget appropriations. In the aggregate, Uganda meets eight
out of 16 benchmarks—one less than in the previous assessment.
The apparent deterioration in budget reporting relative to the 2001 AAP is attributable
to two factors. First, Fund/World Bank staffs have defined standards for this assessment
more precisely than in 2001. In particular, the benchmark missed on the variability of budget
outturns is due to a tightening of the assessment criterion applying to all countries, rather
than to any regression in practice by the authorities. Second, a large proportion of both
overall government spending and poverty-reducing outlays in Uganda are now devolved to
the local governments. In the present exercise, the mission had more information to assess
PEM systems at subnational levels, where the capacity is weaker.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with
Uganda
On February 23, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Uganda.1
Background
With implementation of sound economic policies and an ambitious program of economic
reforms, Uganda experienced an impressive economic recovery through the 1990s that resulted
in a significant reduction in poverty. However, the pace of economic growth has slowed
somewhat down in recent years and the incidence of poverty increased. Some improvements in
economic performance have been observed in 2003/04 (July–June) relative to 2002/03. Real
GDP grew by an estimated 5.9 percent, led by growth in construction and communication, while
improved weather conditions contributed to a rebound in agriculture. With one of the highest
population growth rates in the world, real GDP per capita only grew by 2.4 percent in 2003/04.
After peaking at 10.2 percent by the end of 2002/03, annual headline inflation fell sharply during
2003/04 to 5.1 percent through September 2004, driven by restrained money growth and lower
food prices. The easing of inflationary expectations also contributed to a reduction of interest
rates. In recent months, headline inflation has been picking up again, as food prices rebounded
due to the current drought.
Strong growth in noncoffee export volumes and improved terms of trade helped to narrow the
external current account deficit, excluding grants, to 11.8 percent of GDP in 2003/04.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2Greater-than-anticipated donor support and private capital inflows more than covered the deficit,
allowing international reserves to build up faster than envisaged to about 6½ months of imports.
Following a large depreciation in 2002/03, the Ugandan shilling appreciated in real effective
terms by about 10 percent since December 2003. Buoyant export proceeds, demand for
domestic currency from donor-funded projects, and increased sales of foreign exchange by the
BOU contributed to this exchange rate appreciation.
There were several slippages under the program. Overall, four quantitative performance criteria
for end-June 2004 were breached. Although the structural performance criteria for June and
September were met, progress in implementing the structural reform program was slower than
envisaged, with eight out of ten structural benchmarks breached.
The fiscal consolidation envisaged in the program for 2003/04 was not achieved. The overall
central government deficit, excluding grants, remained at 11.3 percent of GDP in 2003/04, or
0.6 percent higher than programmed. The domestic deficit, which excludes external interest
payments due and externally financed development expenditures, fell short of the program
target by a similar magnitude. While tax revenues were lower than envisaged, reflecting weak
VAT and trade tax collections, the higher deficit primarily reflected an excess in spending
(0.4 percent of GDP), covering public administration needs, including from the Presidency, and
net lending operations to private enterprises. As a result, the quantitative performance criterion
on net credit to the government for end-June 2004 was breached by nearly 0.8 percent of GDP.
The indicative ceiling on public administration spending and the performance criterion on
domestic arrears accumulated under the Commitment Control System (CCS) were also
breached. However, the core poverty-reducing outlays of the Poverty Action Fund (PAF)
remained above their indicative floor.
Based on preliminary information, the overall central government deficit, excluding grants, was
slightly smaller than projected during the first quarter of 2004/05. While revenues remained in
line with the program, development expenditures were lower than envisaged, as programmed
cash releases were delayed to several ministries and local governments. This, however,
generated further accumulation of arrears under the CCS.
The program ceiling for base money growth was slightly missed for end-June 2004, but broad
money growth and excess reserves have declined as programmed. Domestic credit to the
private sector maintained its robust growth at 17 percent. Large variations in government
liquidity injections, volatile currency demand, and a shifting emphasis by the Bank of Uganda
(BOU) on its sterilization tools led to substantial interest rate volatility. However, treasury bill
rates fell significantly in the third quarter of 2003/04 and remained relatively stable thereafter
due to intensified sterilization through foreign exchange sales, and a steadier execution of the
base money program. As of September, base money was below the targeted ceiling. Recently,
however, the BOU once again shifted away from foreign exchange sales for sterilization
purposes, with a risk of placing an excessive burden on treasury bill issuances to meet
monetary targets.

-3The banking sector remains sound. The profitability and capital base of the banking system has
remained high with a very low level of nonperforming loans, as highlighted by the recent
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) mission. Stress tests confirm that the banking
system can weather plausible macroeconomic shocks. The nonbank financial institutions
(NBFIs) show strong growth, but are more vulnerable.
Uganda has made progress in obtaining debt relief. Thirty-one creditors have agreed to provide
debt relief to Uganda accounting for 96 percent of total HIPC assistance. The authorities will
continue to engage the remaining creditors, particularly Libya and India, to provide debt relief
under the HIPC Initiative.
Executive Board Assessment
The impressive economic performance of recent years based on the first wave of reforms has
tapered off, while the conditions for achieving stronger long-term growth and lasting poverty
reduction have not yet been established. Directors accordingly called on the Ugandan
authorities to launch a second round of reforms aimed at increasing productivity, reducing
poverty, and achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Steadfast implementation
of such reforms within a transparent and predictable policy environment will be key to
strengthening investor and donor confidence. In this context, Directors looked forward to the
implementation of the revised Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP), and they emphasized
that peace and security throughout the country will be needed to achieve sustained economic
development.
Directors noted that performance in 2003/04 under the PRGF-supported program had been
mixed. They welcomed the fall in inflation and the rebound in economic growth. At the same
time, they were concerned about slippages in the fiscal area―reflecting strong spending
pressures and revenue shortfalls―and the accumulation of new domestic payments arrears.
Directors also expressed disappointment that implementation of structural reforms was
significantly weaker than envisaged. Against this background, they welcomed the strong
commitment of the authorities to address the recent slippages through a set of front-loaded
measures to bring the program back on track. Strong political will and follow through will be
essential to achieve program objectives going forward.
Directors stressed that fiscal consolidation will remain a cornerstone of efforts to maintain debt
sustainability, create room for private sector investment, and ensure that adequate resources
are available to achieve a lasting reduction in poverty. They concurred that the authorities’
medium-term fiscal consolidation strategy will need to rest on increasing revenue mobilization
and enhancing expenditure management, including through significantly improved monitoring of
the government’s domestic arrears and the strengthening of administrative capacity at the local
government level.
Directors welcomed the steps taken by the authorities to strengthen the operations and
management of the Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) to raise revenues from the current low
level and enable Uganda to reduce its reliance on external assistance. They emphasized that

-4determined actions to complete the full restructuring of the URA will be critical for meeting these
goals, especially in light of the revenue reduction expected as a result of the implementation of
the East African Community (EAC) customs union. Moreover, Directors noted the importance of
forcefully tackling corruption in the URA as a key part of steps to build confidence in public
institutions. It will also be important to ensure that the legal and regulatory framework of the
envisaged Export Processing Zones meets international standards. In particular, to avoid
undermining fiscal revenue mobilization, Directors recommended that the zones should be ringfenced with the strict application of customs duties and the sales tax to Ugandan residents.
They supported the authorities’ plan to work with the other EAC partners to establish a common
code of conduct for investment incentives.
Directors emphasized the need to adhere strictly to the current budget by avoiding
supplementary appropriations during the fiscal year, especially on defense, public
administration, and bailouts of private firms. They observed that, in the past, such expenditures
had undermined the appropriate execution of the budget and contributed to the accumulation of
domestic arrears.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to revive the public administration reform
program. This will be essential for improving the efficiency of government spending and
ensuring appropriate wages for public employees. In addition, Directors encouraged the
authorities to address governance issues steadfastly, both to ensure budget implementation
and enhance the investment climate. In this connection, crucial steps will be needed to
strengthen the role of the Inspector General of Government and implement a code of conduct
for public servants.
Directors considered that the authorities’ monetary policy stance, as well as the liberalization
and reform of the financial sector, have helped maintain macroeconomic stability and a healthy
financial system. They encouraged the authorities to continue pursuing a prudent monetary
targeting framework, while implementing a more balanced mix of foreign exchange sales and
open market operations to avoid volatile movements in interest rates. Directors encouraged the
authorities to act with caution in moving donor-funded government accounts from commercial
banks to the Bank of Uganda so as to minimize the liquidity impact on the commercial banks.
Directors took note of the recent cabinet approval of anti-money laundering legislation, and
looked forward to its early adoption by parliament. They agreed that the sale of minority shares
and management responsibilities of the Uganda Development Bank (UDBL) could contribute to
enhancing the delivery of credit to productive private sector activities.
Directors welcomed the emphasis given to the reform of the pension system and to the
deepening of the financial system. The development of a sound network of microfinance
institutions will facilitate the provision of the necessary financing to small-scale enterprises and
to the agriculture sector. Directors encouraged the authorities to strengthen the land registry to
promote collateralized lending.
Directors noted that the flexible exchange rate regime has served Uganda well by helping to
cushion the impact of exogenous shocks while maintaining external competitiveness. They

-5encouraged the monetary authorities to ensure that the exchange rate remains broadly in line
with macroeconomic fundamentals.
Directors shared the authorities’ concern about the sustainability of external debt and supported
their intention to seek more grants while limiting new loans on concessional terms. The
authorities’ strategy aimed at expanding and diversifying the export base will also serve to
enhance debt sustainability. Directors called on all creditors to quickly reach agreement with
Uganda on the full delivery of HIPC Initiative assistance.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 24, 2005

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Completes Fourth Review Under Uganda's PRGF Arrangement and
Approves US$3.0 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has completed the fourth review
of Uganda's economic performance under an SDR 13.5 million (about US$20.3 million) threeyear Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement (see Press Release No. 02/41)
and approved a disbursement for an amount equivalent to SDR 2.0 million
(about US$3.0 million). This brings total disbursements under the PRGF arrangement to
SDR 9.5 million (about US$14.3 million).
In completing the fourth review, the Executive Board granted Uganda's request for waivers of
non-observance of four quantitative performance criteria relating to: the ceiling on the increase
in base money liabilities of the Bank of Uganda; the ceiling on the increase in net claims on the
central government by the banking system; the accumulation of new domestic budgetary arrears
under the commitment control system; and new lending by the Ugandan Development Bank
Ltd., pending its divestiture.
Following the Executive Board's discussion on the fourth review on February 23, 2005,
Mr. Takatoshi Kato, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chairman, made the following
statement:
“The impressive economic growth and poverty reduction that was achieved through a first wave
of reforms has started to taper off, while a firm basis for sustained growth and poverty reduction
remains to be established. Therefore, there is a need to launch a second wave of reforms to
(i) increase the rate of growth; (ii) address the challenges stemming from the high population
growth; and (iii) continue to reduce poverty and achieve the Millennium Development Goals.
In this context, the revised Poverty Eradication Action Plan should initiate such a reform process.
Peace and security throughout the country will also be needed to achieve sustained and
broadbased poverty reduction.
“Economic growth rebounded and inflation declined in 2003/04 due to improved agricultural
production.-However, continuing weaknesses in the implementation of fiscal policy and
slippages under the PRGF-supported program in 2003/04 are a concern. The authorities
acknowledge the seriousness of the slippages and are committed to bringing the program back on
track and enhancing its monitoring.

“The authorities plan to sustain a higher rate of growth by pursuing a medium-term fiscal
consolidation strategy to maintain debt sustainability and create more room for the private sector.
This strategy rests appropriately on increasing domestic revenue mobilization and enhancing
expenditure management, including a better monitoring of the government’s domestic arrears
and a strengthening of the administrative capacity at the local government level. In this regard,
the ongoing restructuring of the Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) is welcome, particularly in
light of the revenue loss expected with the implementation of the East African Community
(EAC) customs union. Addressing forcefully corruption in the URA is key to building
confidence in public institutions. The implementation of Export Processing Zones needs to meet
international standards and be tightly ring-fenced to avoid tax evasion.
“The revival of public administration reforms will be important to increase the efficiency of
government expenditure and ensure appropriate wages for public employees. More generally, a
comprehensive strategy to strengthen governance is needed to reduce risks to the budget and
improve the business environment.
“Monetary policy will be aimed at preserving price stability, and the flexible exchange rate
policy will help maintain international reserves at comfortable levels. Early passage of the
Anti-Money Laundering Law by parliament will further build confidence in the financial system.
In addition, divestiture of the Uganda Development Bank Ltd. should enhance credit delivery to
the private sector.
“The rise in the external debt burden is a source of concern. It will be important for the
authorities to tackle this by relying more on grant financing rather than loans, while promoting
export growth and diversification,” Mr. Kato said.
The PRGF is the IMF's concessional facility for low-income countries. PRGF-supported
programs are based on country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted in a participatory
process involving civil society and development partners and articulated in a Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP). This is intended to ensure that PRGF-supported programs are consistent
with a comprehensive framework for macroeconomic, structural and social policies to foster
growth and reduce poverty. PRGF loans carry an annual interest rate of 0.5 percent and are
repayable over 10 years with a 5.5 year grace period on principal payment.

This statement contains information that has become available since the statement by
the staff representative was circulated to the Executive Board on February 10, 2005. This
information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.

The remaining prior action for completion of the fourth review under the PRGF
arrangement relating to the issuance of the implementing regulations for the Financial
Institutions Act has been met. The staff received a letter from the Governor of the Bank of
Uganda on February 17, 2005 confirming that the regulations for the Financial Institutions
Act have been signed and sent for publication in the Uganda Gazette on February 16, 2005.
In the same letter, the Governor confirmed that this completes all the prior actions for the
fourth review under the PRGF arrangement.
3.
The government presented to Parliament on February 15, 2005, a draft Constitution
(amendment) Bill. The bill proposes a broad-ranging revision of the 1995 constitution,
including steps to (a) eliminate the two-term Presidential limit; (b) adopt multi-party
democracy; (c) permit establishment of regional governments for interested districts;
(d) permit dual citizenship; and (e) strengthen the powers of the Inspector General of
Government. The goal is to complete the constitutional reforms by end-June 2005. The
presidential and parliamentary elections will probably be held in March 2006.

Statement by Peter J. Ngumbullu, Executive Director for Uganda
and Joseph L. Masawe, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
February 23, 2005
Introduction
1. The Ugandan authorities express their appreciation for the continuous support they
have received from the Fund and thank management and staff for the close
collaboration and constructive engagement, which has contributed very positively
towards improving the economy of Uganda. The authorities are also grateful for the
assistance they have received from the donor community, in support of the country’s
development agenda.
2. It is noteworthy that, since early 1990s, the Ugandan government has consistently
implemented sound macroeconomic policies coupled with an ambitious reform
agenda. These efforts have resulted in sustained growth and overall reduction in
poverty. During 2003/04, the economy continued to perform well, with real GDP
growth reaching 5.9 percent and inflation declining from 10.2 percent to 5.1 percent
between June 2003 and June 2004. As admitted by staff, Uganda has made
remarkable achievements in establishing the foundation of a sound and profitable
banking system. During the period, the banking sector remained strong, as nonperforming loans continued to decline.
Recent Developments
3. Uganda’s economic achievements have been possible, despite several externally
driven challenges. The Northern part of the country continued to face increased
attacks by insurgents, thus calling for extra efforts to strengthen the security situation
in the area. The defense budget had to be augmented, causing pressure on government
expenditure. As revenue performance was also not very good, the budget deficit
expanded. Moreover, deterioration in terms of trade, temporary slowdown in GDP
growth following a long drought and increase in average household size and
dependency ratio resulted in an increase in the incidence of poverty. The exchange
rate has also recently been under pressure, while interest rates have been rising,
following sterilizations undertaken by the Bank of Uganda to mop up excess liquidity
injected by donor inflows, despite the huge benefits associated with these inflows.
Performance Under the Program
4. The implementation of structural reforms was slower than programmed, due to
unexpected shocks. Although all structural performance criteria were observed, eight
structural benchmarks and four quantitative performance criteria for end June 2004
were not observed. However, remarkable progress has been made in achieving the
missed performance criteria since the last review. The performance criterion on
increase in base money, for example, which was missed by small margin in June
2004, has since been corrected. Base money growth targets for September 2004 and

-2December 2004 were attained with comfortable margins. The performance of the
2004/05 budget was impressive during the first quarter, with revenue and expenditure
targets being within budgeted levels. Moreover, a number of prior actions agreed
between staff and authorities have already been implemented by the authorities.
Government policies for 2005/06 reflect government’s commitment towards
implementing other measures agreed under the program. On this basis, the authorities
are requesting waivers for the non-observance of the four missed quantitative
performance criteria for June 2004.
Macroeconomic Policies and Program for 2004/05
5. Although growth prospects for the Ugandan economy appear to be favorable,
considerable challenges remain. During 2004/05, real GDP growth is projected to
slow down to 5.5 percent following the impact of the current drought on agriculture.
Headline inflation, which is highly influenced by food prices, is therefore estimated to
reach 6 percent, although underlying inflation, which reflects the impact of monetary
policy measures, is expected to be kept low, at around 4 percent. The overall fiscal
deficit excluding grants is projected to narrow down slightly by about 1.3 percentage
points to 10 percent. However, given strong growth in imports, the current account
deficit excluding transfers will widen to around 12.2 percent of GDP. In light of these
challenges, the authorities are determined to take further measures, to ensure that the
economy remains on a high growth path.
Monetary and Financial Policies
6. The Bank of Uganda will continue to exercise prudence in its monetary policy, with
base money as its operating tool. Measures will also be undertaken, to ensure that
sources for liquidity expansion are minimized. The authorities intend to move all
government accounts from commercial banks to the central bank in a phased manner.
Specifically, during 2004/05, the growth of broad money will be limited to around
15 percent while measures will be taken to speed up growth of credit to the private
sector. Priority will be directed towards increasing the flow of credit to microenterprises, while the process of licensing new micro-finance institutions, following
the enactment of the new Micro-Finance Deposit Taking Institutions Act, will be
enhanced. The government has called for expression of interest by strategic investors
interested in minority share and management responsibilities of the Uganda
Development Bank Limited (UDBL).
Fiscal policy
7. The authorities are committed to the fiscal consolidation efforts. For the remainder of
2004/05 emphasis in fiscal policy will be given to strengthening policies for
monitoring and reducing domestic arrears. At the same time, measures will be taken
to identify areas for expenditure saving, to accommodate the required additional
spending on arrears clearance and priority programs, as authorities have decided to
cut non-priority, non-wage spending by about 0.5 percent of GDP to compensate for

-3increases in priority spending and clearance of domestic arrears, during the remaining
part of 2004/05
8. Tax measures will be broadened to ensure that revenue proceeds are adequate to
cover additional expenditures already noted above. The recommendations of a recent
Fund technical assistance mission will be implemented, including reorganizing and
strengthening the Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) and provide a platform for
modernizing revenue administration. In addition, the program on fiscal
decentralization will continue to be implemented, while ensuring that the
administrative capacity of local governments is strengthened. The government intends
to take measures to strengthen the efficiency of public expenditures and streamline
public administration in cooperation with the World Bank and other development
partners.
Structural Measures
9. While the government has gone a long way in reforming the post conflict economy,
more efforts will be undertaken in the coming period to deepen the reforms through a
second generation of reforms. The main objective will be to generate more exports to
facilitate a higher growth, reduce poverty and reduce government’s dependence on
foreign aid. The privatization of remaining public institutions will be pursued
vigorously but carefully to ensure ownership and support of the public. Investors have
already shown interest in participating in a joint concession contract for the Uganda
Railway Corporation and Kenya Railway Corporation. Government’s majority shares
in the National Insurance Corporation (NIC) will be sold and efforts to privatize the
public water and sewerage company will be pursued. Given that most of the
electricity in Uganda is hydro-based, the government will continue with its
negotiations with private investors who have already shown interest in implementing
the hydropower project at the Bujagali Falls.
10. Measures aimed at eradicating poverty, stumping out corruption and improving
governance will be pursued steadfastly under the Poverty Eradication Action Plan
(PEAP). The recent set back in government’s effort to reduce poverty will be
addressed with more emphasis on measures aimed at raising incomes of the poor and
enhancing the quality of human development. Efforts will also be directed towards
increasing transparency and efficiency in the use of public resources to reduce
poverty. Governance will be strengthened, with the Leadership Code being amended
to increase the powers of the Inspector General of Government (IGG).
External Measures
11. The authorities are determined to continue to maintain a flexible exchange rate
regime, given its benefits. The authorities intend to take measures to diversify and
strengthen Uganda exports under the Strategic Exports Program (SEP). Exports to the
East African region will be expanded under the East African Community Customs
Union (EACCU) and export-processing zones (EPZ) will be introduced under the

-4new EPZ Law, to support export growth and attract FDIs. Measures to strengthen the
investment climate, increase productivity and improve Uganda’s external
competitiveness will be implemented. It is expected that these measures will
contribute positively towards improving Uganda’s external position and reduce its
vulnerability to external shocks.
External Debt
12. Uganda’s external debt remains high and unsustainable despite the progress made in
obtaining relief under the HIPC initiative. Steps to improve debt repayment capacity,
through boosting exports and exercising better debt management will be
implemented. It is also the objective of the authorities to ensure that all debts
contracted are on IDA equivalent terms or better and that the proportion of grants to
total donor inflows is higher.
Conclusion
13. The Ugandan authorities have made an impressive record in implementing
macroeconomic reforms as a post conflict country. The reforms have resulted in a
sustained high growth level and considerable reduction in poverty. However, despite
the achievements, there remains daunting challenges that need to be addressed in
order to mitigate external shocks, enhance growth and further reduce poverty.
14. The authorities will build on the achievements made so far, to promote higher future
growth and reduce poverty, while ensuring that good governance is enhanced.
Insecurity in the North remains a major source of risk to government’s effort to
improve the economy and conduct free and fair elections, which are due in 2006.
During 2004/05, security in the North will be strengthened, to ensure that the
18-year-old insurgency by the Lord’s Resistance Army is contained. It is our hope
that the government will continue to receive the support of the international
community, which is very important not only in restoring security in the Northern
region, but also in ensuring that the forthcoming presidential and parliamentary
elections are conducted in a peaceful environment. A constitutional review process is
under way, to consider proposed constitutional changes on the presidential term limit
and ensuring that the 2006 elections are contested on a multiparty basis.
15. Given the good record of the authorities in implementing the reforms and the
intended measures which they intend to take to strengthen the economy, we request
the Board’s waiver of non-observance of the mentioned performance criteria and
completion of the fourth review.
