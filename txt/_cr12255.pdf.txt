STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 9, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context: Since the revolution of early 2011, Tunisia’s political transition is moving
ahead. The new authorities are facing a legacy of social and economic challenges and
increased vulnerabilities. The previous regime’s state-centered development model
delivered for several years high growth and stability but favored a few privileged, and
left unemployment at a high level, substantial economic and social disparities across
regions, and a sense of denied opportunities. In 2011, amid domestic and regional
turmoil, Tunisia experienced a severe recession, its external position deteriorated and
unemployment reached unprecedented levels. The authorities tried to mitigate the
effects of the recession on households and businesses with an increase in current
public spending and a large monetary injection. However, these also led to the buildup
of increased vulnerabilities in the financial sector, some inflationary pressures, and
losses in foreign reserves.
Near-term outlook and risks: Real GDP growth could start recovering in 2012, with a
gradual rebound in tourism and FDI inflows and a sizable growth-supporting fiscal
expansion. However, a deteriorated situation in Europe, Tunisia’s main trading and
investment partner, coupled with ongoing social tensions and political uncertainties,
substantial weaknesses in the financial sector, and a wait-and-see attitude of investors,
will weigh on Tunisia’s near-term growth outlook. Risks to the outlook are large and
tilted to the downside.
Main policy recommendations: A rebalancing of the policy mix is needed to support
Tunisia’s short-term growth while preserving macroeconomic stability. The fiscal
stimulus will have to be better oriented toward public investment, and current
spending will need to be contained. A gradual tightening of the monetary policy stance
will help contain inflationary pressures, while greater exchange rate flexibility could
help to stabilize foreign reserves. Reinforcing banks’ solvency and strengthening
banking supervision are required to preserve financial stability. Finally, fiscal
consolidation will have to be resumed in the medium term to preserve fiscal
sustainability.
Medium-term prospects: Tunisia's medium-term economic growth potential remains
favorable but unleashing it will require a comprehensive package of structural reforms
to foster private investment. Achieving higher and more inclusive growth over the
medium term will be critical to reducing high unemployment, especially among the
youth, and addressing social and regional disparities.

TUNISIA

INTRODUCTION: A NEW HISTORICAL PHASE WITH
PRESSING SOCIAL CHALLENGES
1.
The January 2011 revolution marked the beginning of a historical era for Tunisia.
Following the overthrow of President Ben Ali, Tunisia has moved steadily forward with its political
transition. The successful elections for a Constituent Assembly in October 2011 resulted in a new
coalition government, led by the once-banned Islamic Party (Ennahda) with two secular parties. The
Constituent Assembly is now preparing a new constitution and will exercise legislative power until
new general elections take place in March 2013. While such a progress is remarkable, the political
and institutional framework remains understandably fluid and a source of uncertainty.
2.
The new authorities inherited from the previous regime a state-centered development
model, which favored a privileged few and led to substantial economic and social challenges.
Macroeconomic management relied on extensive state intervention in the economy to foster the
development of export-oriented and low value-added industries, intensive in unskilled labor. It was
based on a dual approach favoring the offshore sector with various incentives while the onshore
sector was under tight control. The economy was characterized by price controls, a tightly managed
exchange rate, capital controls, and interventions in the banking system to channel credit to
strategic sectors, in particular tourism. This model delivered for several years high growth and
stability but also led to the building of substantial challenges, which were at the root of the
revolution. Economic gains were not fairly shared among the population, and there were economic
and social disparities across regions. Insufficiently high growth and labor market impediments kept
unemployment high (13 percent in 2010), especially among the youth (about 30 percent in 2010). In
addition, weak governance and favoritism fueled a sense of denied opportunities and depressed
economic potential.
3.
The economic crisis following the revolution and a variety of external shocks led to
increased vulnerabilities. Domestic social unrest and the conflict in neighboring Libya contributed
to a severe recession, which brought unemployment to unprecedented levels and further weakened
the financial sector. In response, the focus of the authorities has been largely directed toward
appeasing social demands by mitigating the effects of the recession on households and businesses
with expansionary fiscal and monetary policies. However, the fiscal expansion relied too much on
current expenditures which will be difficult to bring back down. The monetary expansion is
postponing the recognition of losses in the financial sector, has likely contributed to an increase in
inflation and, together with the defense of the exchange rate has resulted in a steep decline in
foreign reserves. On the structural side, progress has been made to improve governance, but
revisiting the overall development model still lies ahead.

4.
To address old and newer economic and social challenges, the authorities will need to
establish strong foundations for higher and more inclusive growth. As signs of an economic
rebound emerged, the authorities need to re-instill confidence of the population and investors in
the future of the economy so that they can look beyond short-term difficulties. This will first require
supporting the economic recovery in the short term with an investment-oriented fiscal expansion
while preserving macroeconomic and financial stability against a difficult external environment and a
still-volatile political and social domestic situation. Monetary and financial sector policies should aim
at containing inflation, preserving foreign reserves, and strengthening the banking sector. It will be
equally important for the authorities to develop, early on, a new vision for the Tunisian economy
and to identify priority reforms, which could respond to the great hope brought about by the
revolution for a better economic and social future, with opportunities for all. In particular, concrete
solutions to the underdevelopment of the inner regions and to the high youth unemployment will
be essential.

demand from Libya, constraints in the distribution system, and the possible inflationary impact of
the large liquidity injection. In particular, growth in nonfood and non-administered prices, which is
the most relevant indicator for core inflation, steadily increased in recent months to 5.8 percent in
April (y-o-y), its highest level since 1996.1
6.
Tunisia’s external position weakened significantly. The current account deficit widened
substantially to 7.3 percent of GDP in 2011, because of lower tourism receipts (–33 percent) and
other nonfactor services. The resilience of exports and the drop in demand for imports averted an
even stronger deterioration. FDI inflows also declined sharply (-26 percent) owing to the wait-andsee attitude of foreign investors.2 Despite larger external disbursements, international reserves
declined to US$7.5 billion at end-2011 (equivalent to 3.8 months of imports) from US$9.5 billion at
end-2010. During January-April 2012, despite a significant rebound in tourism (+33 percent), the
current account continued to deteriorate because of strong import growth and slowing exports,
reflecting the negative effects of developments in Europe. Although FDI started to recover
(+28 percent), reserves further declined to US$6.7 billion in end-June (equivalent to 3.1 months of
imports), a level which leaves Tunisia more vulnerable to external shocks (Appendix I).
7.
In the context of the crisis, the authorities raised current budget spending to address
social demands. The overall fiscal deficit widened to 3.5 percent of GDP in 2011 from 1.1 percent in
2010, reflecting a 4 percent of GDP increase in public spending—of which about ¾ was allocated to
current expenditures—partly offset by stronger tax revenues and exceptional nontax revenues. The
wage bill increased significantly, food and energy subsidies almost doubled to offset higher
international prices, and new social measures were implemented, including revamped youth
unemployment programs.3 The public investment program, however, was under-executed because
of capacity constraints. Budget revenue increased by 1.7 percent of GDP in 2011, with larger direct
taxes and increased nontax revenues reflecting the Central Bank of Tunisia’s (CBT) exceptional
transfer of dividends for 2008–10 and higher oil revenues. After having declined over the past
decade through 2010 to 40 percent of GDP, public debt increased to 44.4 percent of GDP at end2011. In the first quarter of 2012, the overall fiscal balance was in small surplus, reflecting strong tax
revenues and new delays in the execution of the 2012 public investment plan.

Administered prices represent about 30 percent of Tunisia’s CPI basket.

2

Net FDI declined by 69 percent in 2011, also reflecting TND 840 million outflows due to the purchase by a member
of President Ben Ali’s family of shares in the Telecom company Tunisiana, from a foreign stakeholder.
3

The public-sector wage bill increased by 14 percent in 2011 due to the recruitment of 20,000 new employees (on a
net basis), a 4.7 percent average wage increase, and additional benefits provided to security forces. New social
measures included broadened coverage of social transfers to disadvantaged families, compensation to households
affected by the turmoil, and allowances to the families of the martyrs of the revolution. Spending for the revamped
youth employment programs was classified under capital transfers.

Sources: Tunisian authorities; and IMF staff estimates.

9.
The quality of the banks’ portfolio deteriorated in 2011 because of losses from the
economic downturn, and banks liquidity became tight. The economic downturn, particularly in
the tourism sector, deteriorated banks’ portfolio. The CBT relaxed its regulatory requirements,
authorizing banks to reschedule loans falling due in 2011 for companies affected by the economic
downturn and lifting banks’ obligation to reclassify rescheduled loans.4 As those loans have not
been classified so far, reported nonperforming loans (NPLs) remained stable at 13 percent in 2011.
Significant provision needs may emerge in 2012 depending on the performance of the rescheduled
loans. Liquidity in the banking system deteriorated, with the regulatory liquidity ratio declining to
89 percent. Most banks became heavily dependent on CBT refinancing.
10.
With a sizable deterioration in the
current account, the CBT supported the
exchange rate through substantial foreign
exchange interventions. The CBT sold
US$2 billion in 2011 and US$700 million during
January–April 2012. The real effective exchange
rate was relatively stable and broadly in line with
fundamentals (Appendix II), with a 3 percent
nominal depreciation through March 2012
(y-o-y) offsetting the inflation differential with
partners.

B. Near-term Outlook: A Gradual Recovery with Large Downside Risks
11.
Tunisia’s growth outlook for 2012 will depend in part on developments in Europe, the
domestic social and political situation, and actions by the government. An anticipated recession
in Europe, coupled with a wait-and-see attitude of investors, will weigh on Tunisia’s near-term
prospects. Nevertheless, real GDP growth could reach 2.7 percent in 2012, thanks to a gradual
rebound in tourism and FDI inflows, as observed in the first quarter of the year, and a sizable
growth-supporting fiscal expansion tilted toward public investment. Nevertheless, the output gap
would widen slightly further. Unemployment would remain high, with new job creation only partially
absorbing new labor market entrants. Inflation would increase to 5 percent, reflecting the factors at
play since late 2011 and the expected adjustment in petroleum products prices. Credit to the
economy would decelerate as banks strive to improve their liquidity. Tunisia’s external position
would remain weak, with the current account deficit at 7 percent of GDP in 2012. With about US$3.2
billion of expected external budget support, reserves would increase slightly to US$8.2 billion at
end-2012 (equivalent to 4.1 months of imports).
12.
Risks to Tunisia’s near-term outlook are large and tilted to the downside
(Appendix III). A worse-than-anticipated recession in Europe would hurt Tunisia’s short-term
growth prospects by further depressing exports and hampering the rebound in tourism and FDI
inflows. An escalation of domestic social tensions along with still-evolving institutions and political
uncertainties could hamper foreign and domestic investment. Capacity constraints and delays in
identified financing could curb the envisaged growth-supporting fiscal stimulus. Investors sentiment
may be affected by downgrades of Tunisia’s sovereign ratings, such as the one issued by Standard
& Poor’s in May 2012. In addition, inflationary pressures may rise in the event of large wage
increases in the public sector, a substantial depreciation of the exchange rate, or increasing
monetary injection. On the upside, a rapid stabilization of the situation in Libya could bolster
bilateral trade and investors’ confidence. Under a pessimistic scenario with a ½ percent deeper
recession in Europe and a smaller fiscal expansion due to the under-execution of public investment,
the recovery would be weaker, with real growth at about 1 percent in 2012.
13.
Risks arising from weaknesses in the financial sector could undermine macrofinancial
stability. Continued liquidity injection to compensate for banks’ weakening asset performances
would put further pressure on foreign reserves and inflation. In this event, given recent large losses
in foreign reserves, a further decline in reserves could ultimately force a large exchange rate
adjustment or substantial monetary policy tightening, potentially resulting in either additional
inflationary pressures or a credit crunch. Moreover, if banks’ solvency issues are not addressed
rapidly and adequately, the banking sector’s contribution to medium-term growth would be
undermined, and needs for bank recapitalization could become much larger down the road, with a
negative impact on public debt beyond what is expected under the baseline scenario. Mitigating
these risks requires restraining CBT refinancing to banks and early actions to address underprovisioning and capital shortfall in parts of the banking system.

14.
The authorities expect a rebound in 2012 stronger than projected by staff. They project
GDP growth to reach 3.5 percent in 2012, on the back of a sizable growth-supporting fiscal stimulus
and a rebound in private investment thanks to the improved security situation. They are
nevertheless concerned by the important downside risks from a possible further deterioration in
Europe.

Box 1. Possible Spillovers from the Debt Crisis in Europe into Tunisia
Tunisia's banking sector is relatively well insulated against a deterioration in the
international financial environment. Tunisian banks are mostly financed on the local market
in nonconvertible dinars. Foreign exchange regulations substantially limit the exchange rate risk
that residents may take.
However, Tunisia’s exposure to Europe through real channels is significant. France is the
most important partner, with 29 percent of exports, 26 percent of tourism receipts, and
47 percent of remittances. Among Southern European countries, the main export destination is
Italy.
A slowdown in Europe would affect Tunisia substantially through real channels. A more
pronounced deterioration in growth in Europe will have negative consequences on economic
growth in Tunisia. Empirical estimates, based on vector autoregressive models, suggest that a
1 percentage point change in real GDP in the European Union could lead to a 0.6 percentage
point change in Tunisia’s real GDP in the short term, and a change of nearly 2 points in the long
term. Moreover, empirical estimates based on short-term growth models suggest that the
external variables (particularly trade) explain approximately 30 percent of the deviation between
Tunisia's real and potential GDP levels. The impact on trade could be more muted as a drop in
exports to the euro area would be mitigated by a significant drop in imports (given that a large
share of imports is used in the production of export goods). Previous episodes of crisis in
Europe, in particular in 200809, have resulted only in a modest increase in the current account
deficit.

THEME 1: REBALANCING THE POLICY MIX TO
SUPPORT SHORT-TERM ECONOMIC GROWTH WHILE
PRESERVING MACROECONOMIC STABILITY
15.
Rebalancing the policy mix is needed to support Tunisia’s short-term growth while
preserving macroeconomic stability. In light of a difficult international environment and wait-andsee attitude of investors, a better-targeted countercyclical fiscal expansion, more tilted toward
public investment than in 2011, will be necessary to support short-term growth and job creation.
With fiscal policy playing the key role in supporting growth, a gradual tightening of the monetary
policy stance will help contain inflationary pressures. Furthermore, greater exchange rate flexibility
will be necessary to stabilize international reserves.
Fiscal policy
16.
The authorities envisage a large growth-supporting fiscal expansion which would
substantially widen the fiscal deficit in 2012. On the basis of the supplementary budget law
adopted in May 2012, staff expects the overall fiscal deficit (before grants and privatization receipts)
to widen from 3.5 percent of GDP in 2011 to 7.0 percent in 2012. Current expenditure would
increase by 1.6 points of GDP, owing to a 14 percent increase in the wage bill, larger social transfers
to households and to the regions, and other expenditures not yet identified (“unallocated”
spending).5 Energy subsidies would be contained with increases in domestic prices of some
petroleum products and electricity which are expected in the second half of 2012. Public direct
investment would increase by 1 percent of GDP in 2012 to support economic growth and job
creation, in particular in the disadvantaged regions, to the extent that execution of investment
projects picks up strongly. Revenues would decline due to a base effect which included exceptional
nontax revenue in 2011 and the lag effect of last year’s recession. Receipts from past privatization
(TDN 900 million) and sales of confiscated assets would help cover about one quarter of the deficit.6
Nevertheless, public debt would increase again, to 45½ percent of GDP by end-2012.

5

The public-sector wage bill will increase in 2012 owing to the recruitment of about 12,000 new employees (on a net
basis), and the full-year impact of the recruitments and wage increases which took place in 2011.
6

The sale of the assets confiscated from the previous regime will likely face substantial legal hurdles and may take
time. Staff expects revenues from these sales of only TND 300 million in 2012, out of the TDN 1.2 billion envelope
included in the Supplementary Budget Law. Staff anticipates the remaining TDN 900 million to be recovered during
2013–15.

public debt would remain around a sustainable level, but the public debt dynamics would
deteriorate significantly in the event of lower real growth or lack of fiscal consolidation
(Appendix VIII).

18.
Implementing a well-targeted fiscal expansion will be crucial to support short-term
growth and job creation. A countercyclical fiscal expansion, relying more on a pick-up in public
investment than on public consumption in contrast to what was done in 2011, will be needed to
mitigate the negative repercussions on the Tunisian economy of a deteriorated external
environment. Staff estimates that the anticipated fiscal stimulus of about 1.7 percent of GDP would
contribute to about 1 percent of real growth in 2012 (Appendix IV).
19.
Executing the envisaged public investment plan and adopting measures to contain
current expenditures are key. Significant delays were recorded in the first quarter of 2012 in the

need to control the increase in the wage bill through wage moderation to avoid an increase in
permanent expenditure which would weigh on the medium-term fiscal position, and to adjust
energy prices upwards, as envisaged, to contain subsidies. In the absence of the anticipated energy
prices increase, the overall fiscal deficit could reach about 7½ percent of GDP in 2012.

Large external financing will be needed to implement the growth-supporting fiscal
expansion without crowding out domestic banks’ financing. Tunisia’s gross budgetary financing
needs would reach about US$4.2 billion in 2012. The authorities indicated that about US$3.2 billion
of external budget support was secured but with about half of it expected to be disbursed only
toward the end of 2012.7 Staff highlighted that the magnitude of the fiscal stimulus is predicated on
external financing being mobilized and disbursed in a timely manner, and that fixed investment
should be preserved by limiting the execution of unallocated current expenditure in case of an
external financing shortfall.
21.
The effective implementation of a sizable fiscal stimulus, with the full execution of the
public investment plan envisaged in the Supplementary Budget Law, is a priority for the
authorities. They are focusing their efforts to move rapidly ahead with the execution of the planned
public investment projects; these efforts include streamlining public procurement rules and
implementing budgetary reforms to reduce redundant controls that have hampered spending
execution in the past. The authorities also indicated that they did not consider financing constraints
as a risk for budget execution, but were nevertheless ready to use the amount of unallocated current
expenditures included in the supplementary budget law (about TDN 700 million, or 1 percent of
GDP) as a buffer in order to preserve public investment, in the event of a shortfall or delays in
external financing.
22.
The authorities recognized the need to contain current expenditures. They agreed that
the recent increase in the wage bill, if sustained, would result in substantially higher permanent
expenditures that would weigh on medium-term fiscal sustainability. Thus, they indicated their
intention to limit the increase in public-sector wages in 2012 to contain the wage bill within the
envelope presented in the supplementary budget law. However, they argued that the exceptional
recruitment in the public sector during 2011–12 was a necessary measure to contain unemployment
at a very difficult moment for the Tunisian population. The authorities also indicated their intention
to adjust the energy prices upwards, without which subsidies could be higher than anticipated in the
supplementary budget law, but would take into account the social environment when deciding
about the magnitude and timing of this measure.
Monetary and exchange rate policy
23.
In view of current inflationary pressures, staff welcomed the CBT’s recent move to
start tightening monetary policy. Since January 2012, the CBT has changed its interventions in the
interbank money market to allow the monthly average interbank rate to increase by about
0.5 percent. The increase in the monthly average interbank rate should help to reduce inflationary
7

Tunisia has already received in 2012 a US$500 million loan from Qatar, a US$130 million loan from the French
Development Agency, and US$100 million grant from the United States. In addition, the authorities expect to receive
a US$200 million grant from the EU, are negotiating a new reform support loan of US$500 million from the World
Bank and US$350–500 million from the African Development Bank, and expect to borrow about US$850 million on
the international capital markets with guarantees from the U.S. Treasury and the World Bank. Tunisia would also
receive about US$500 million of project aid.

pressures, including those possibly arising in the context of a more flexible exchange rate regime.
Furthermore, it should also encourage the mobilization of banks’ deposits and moderate credit
growth, thus reducing the banking sector’s financing needs. Staff encouraged the authorities to
enshrine its recent actions in an increase in its policy rate, to continue to closely monitor inflation
developments, and to stand ready for further tightening in case inflationary pressures do not
subside.
24.
The institutional framework for formulating monetary policy needs to be
strengthened. Currently, the Central Bank Board decides on the policy rate based on fairly general
and backward-looking indicators. Establishing a monetary policy committee would help filling a gap
with regard to critically assessing forward-looking inflationary pressures based on a wider set of
data, including monetary aggregates and inflation in non-administered and non-food prices. The
committee would formulate more explicitly the desired monetary policy stance for the Board’s
consideration, and improve the communication on monetary policy decisions. Finally, it could also
contribute to improving the coordination between monetary and exchange rate policies.
25.
The CBT recently changed its exchange rate policy operational framework to make the
rate more flexible. Since April 2012, the CBT has computed its reference exchange rate based on
the average exchange rate on the interbank market instead of a fixed currency basket, and
intervened in the foreign exchange market through bilateral transactions when market quotations
deviate substantially from the fixing rate of the day. Staff welcomed these changes, in line with
recent Fund TA recommendations, as a more flexible exchange rate management will help preserve
the CBT’s foreign reserves and support demand for money by reducing liquidity absorption due to
foreign exchange interventions. Staff noted that the exchange rate was broadly in line with mediumterm fundamentals projected in staff’s baseline scenario, albeit slightly overvalued based on CGER
methodologies. In the context of greater exchange rate flexibility, monetary and exchange rate
policy will need to be closely coordinated.
26.
The monetary authorities indicated their readiness to tighten monetary policy further
if inflationary pressures were to persist. However, they expect inflation to stabilize and do not see
the inflationary pressures as stemming mainly from the expansionary stance of monetary policy
since 2011. If needed, a monetary policy tightening would be gradual since the authorities are
concerned about the repercussions on NPLs due to the indexation of credit interest rates to the
interbank rate. The authorities were also willing to consider creating a monetary policy committee to
enhance the monetary policy institutional framework.
27.
While allowing more exchange rate flexibility, the authorities remain cautious in view
of the inherent risks involved. The authorities believe that moving toward more exchange rate
flexibility will help to stabilize the CBT’s foreign reserves and improve the liquidity of the financial
sector. However, they expressed concerns about the repercussions on inflation of a possible
depreciation of the exchange rate. Furthermore, the authorities doubt that the response of the
current account to changes in the exchange rate could be large in Tunisia.

THEME 2: URGENT NEED FOR REFORMS IN THE
FINANCIAL SECTOR
28.
The financial sector reforms undertaken during the decade prior to the revolution
were not sufficient to modernize and strengthen the banking system. Overall, the ratio of NPLs
(13 percent of total loans) remained high and capital buffers were inadequate at end-2010. To
maintain profitability in the face of weak asset performance, some banks provisioned less than
recommended by international standards and invested less than necessary for modern banking
operations, especially with regard to information systems. Moreover, access to finance remains
limited, representing a major constraint in several regions and for some categories of the
population.
29.
Adding to these weaknesses, banking supervision was not developed adequately and
fell short of international standards. As identified in the most recent Financial System Stability
Assessment (FSSA), important supervision shortfalls concern loan classification, collateral valuation,
and provisioning, which make the emergence of additional provisioning needs likely when practices
will meet international standards. Banking sector data management has deficiencies which
undermine the accuracy of financial sector indicators. Onsite inspections were also insufficient and
banks’ internal controls were poor. Finally, the CBT needs to amend the CBT Act in order to establish
an effective framework for its autonomy and accountability, including transparent hiring and
dismissal rules for the governor and board members.
30.
The authorities recently made commendable strides in strengthening banking
supervision and improving banks’ solvency, but further significant efforts are needed. Staff
welcomed the measures taken by the authorities in early 2012 to introduce generic provisioning,
enhance the corporate governance regime for commercial banks, improve banks’ compliance with
prudential regulations, and reinforce CBT’s banking supervision capacity. In addition, the authorities
started the recapitalization of a major public bank representing about 14 percent of total bank
assets and intend to conduct an audit which will serve as a basis for completing this bank’s
restructuring. Staff encouraged the authorities to strengthen the reforms until banking supervision
fully meets international standards, which could take several years (Appendix V). Long-term IMF
technical assistance in banking supervision, as requested by the authorities, together with training of
professional staff, will help to achieve this key objective.
31.
The significant challenges facing the banking sector in terms of potentially large
recapitalization needs and the tight liquidity situation will need to be addressed forcefully. As
the overall banking sector recapitalization needs could reach 3-7 percent of GDP (3.2–7½ percent of
total banks assets) after two years under various scenarios, banks should take pre-emptive action

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

TUNISIA

and begin setting aside additional capital.8 A large state-owned bank, with large unrealized loan
losses, has started to be recapitalized and will need to be restructured, based on a separation of
good from bad assets followed by state recapitalization to cover any balance sheet shortfall. The
CBT will need to develop an exit strategy for gradually unwinding its large liquidity support to banks,
which has increased risk to the central bank and contributed to a substantial decline in reserves. In
doing so, while continuing to meet banks' liquidity needs, the CBT should align its collateral
requirements to international practices to preserve its balance sheet and introduce a “lender of last
resort” facility to manage banks with insufficient eligible collateral. At the same time, corporate
insolvency and vulnerabilities will need to be addressed in order to minimize fiscal costs of banks
resolution later.
32.
The authorities were confident that vulnerabilities in the banking sector could be
addressed quickly. They are of the view that solvency problems are confined to one large public
bank. They also consider that most of the loans rescheduled in 2011 will be performing because the
beneficiary companies were assessed as solvent, although their remaining so will depend on the
economic recovery in 2012, particularly in the tourism sector. In addition, the authorities highlighted
the significant improvements in banking supervision which are under way and which should allow
adequate standards to be met fairly quickly.
33.
In the medium term, state intervention in the financial sector should be streamlined to
promote financial development. The government directly controls three major public banks and
several small mixed banks, whose contribution to financial development is questionable. The major
public banks have mobilized local savings to finance specific sectors—tourism, agriculture, and
housing—based on political rather than economic motives. To these direct interventions, numerous
indirect interventions have been added, such as interest rate controls, guarantees, and special funds,
without a consolidated and transparent strategy for the sector. Several reforms should be
implemented to support financial development (Box 2). Removing distortions in the financial sector
will also help to enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy.
34.
Measures are needed to develop capital markets. Funds raised on the capital markets are
about 2 percent of GDP, stock issuances are not frequently used for long-term investments, and
stock exchange listings, dominated by banks, do not reflect the structure of the Tunisian economy.
The establishment of a credible yield curve, and improving banks’ risk management, would
contribute to further developing the capital markets. This would require more regular issuances of
reference maturities by the Treasury and some degree of liberalization in exchange rates and the
regulatory framework for derivatives.9 A reform of the pension system would also contribute to
building a long-term investment demand.
8

Possible recapitalization needs were estimated with stress tests under various scenarios, assuming potential
negative growth shock and a downward revision in the value of collateral assigned to NPLs and provisioning. Data
gaps, classification issues, and rescheduling may mask further needs. Separately increasing the capital adequacy ratio
from 8 to 10 percent would require 1.3 percent of GDP of additional recapitalization needs.

9

The Treasury should manage its liquidity actively on the market to reduce the opportunity cost of regular issuances.

35.
The authorities consider that the state has a key role to play in the financial sector.
They acknowledged the need to further improve the governance of public financial institutions, but
they do not envisage reducing the state’s stake in the banking sector. The authorities have recently
established the Caisse des depots, a new public financial institution, with the aim of addressing
market failures and supporting investments, following the examples of other countries.

Box 2. Reform Strategy for Development of the Financial Market
 Competition should be guaranteed: Effective banking supervision must ensure uniform
application of prudential rules and prompt resolution of solvency problems to promote fair
competition and market contestability. Interventions that potentially involve financial repression
or market distortion, such as interest rate ceilings or floors, should be avoided.
 Market failures need to be addressed: Public intervention may be necessary to facilitate
access to credit for small enterprises and individuals. However, it is essential that public
institutions have complete management independence and a clear, limited, and exclusive
mandate (governance). Against this backdrop, postal banks, for example, can help in mobilizing
deposits and in providing a limited range of financing services in rural or remote areas. The
Caisse de dépôts, emulating practices in France, Italy, or Morocco, might help in financing certain
strategic sectors (high value-added industries, for example) or participate in regional and
municipal project financing. In doing so, proper risk management should be ensured for all
institutions under the same regulatory norms.
 Preference should be given to indirect targeted interventions: Funds that intervene
through commercial banks by subsidizing certain types of instruments or by providing partial
guarantees should be favored, rather than direct financing through public institutions.
 Access to finance should be improved: The microfinance law passed in October 2011
constitutes a major step forward. Microfinance activities should be broadened and their
supervision transferred to the banking supervision authority. Improvements in tools for credit risk
assessment are essential. The potential for better using the Post Office capacity to extend the
range of financial services in remote regions should be explored.

making employment more responsive to

unemployment rate to 13 percent over the next five years (Appendix VI). For this, early adoption of
reforms to increase labor market flexibility will be needed.
Source: Tunisian authorities; and IMF staff estimates.

37.
Tunisia could achieve a higher and more inclusive medium-term growth if obstacles to
private investment are eliminated and external financing is mobilized. Real growth could reach
6 percent in 2017 despite the envisaged medium-term fiscal consolidation, if structural reforms to
foster private investment are implemented, and about US$5 billion (including FDI inflows, borrowing
by the government and the nongovernment corporate sector) is mobilized every year. Maintaining
macroeconomic stability, improving governance and the business environment, ensuring a more
balanced playing field for companies, and reforming the labor market and education system, in
addition to reforming the banking system will be needed to foster domestic investment and attract
foreign investments.

B. Resuming Fiscal Consolidation to Preserve Medium-Term Sustainability
38.

Fiscal consolidation will need to be resumed over the medium term to preserve fiscal
sustainability. As the Tunisian economy recovers over the medium term, the need for a growthsupporting fiscal stimulus will wane, allowing fiscal consolidation. In addition, Tunisia will need to
maintain fiscal space to face potential contingent liabilities including deficits of pension funds, and

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TUNISIA

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

lower external financing. Staff stressed the need to implement a gradual fiscal consolidation
bringing the fiscal deficit to about 2 percent of GDP by 2017 to maintain public debt below
50 percent of GDP. Without fiscal consolidation, public debt would increase to more than
60 percent over the medium term (Appendix VIII).
39.
Containing public expenditures will be a key component of a medium-term fiscal
consolidation plan. Controlling the public-sector wage bill through wage moderation and limiting
new recruitments to replace retiring civil servants will be needed. Furthermore, a gradual reduction
of food and energy subsidies, while putting in place appropriate social safety nets to protect the
poor, would be necessary from a budget perspective. It will also be desirable from a social equity
perspective because food and energy subsidies benefit more the richest segments of the population
(Appendix VII). In this context, staff welcomes the authorities' intention to adjust energy prices
upwards in 2012 and gradually reintroduce the automatic price adjustment mechanism for
petroleum product prices that was suspended in early 2011.

40.

Tax reforms would strengthen Tunisia’s budgetary revenues over the medium term.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ plan to implement a comprehensive program of tax reforms to
mobilize larger revenues, improve the equity and transparency of the tax system, foster investments
in high-value-added sectors, and encourage job creation. This would include reducing tax benefits
for exporting companies, rationalizing tax incentives in line with a revision of the investment code,
enlarging the tax base, and strengthening tax administration.
41.
Furthermore, reforming the social security system will help to contain expenditure
pressures over the medium term. The two main pension funds in Tunisia, the CNRPS and CNSS,
have recently started to record deficits while their reserves have decreased. In particular, the
authorities indicated that the CNRPS (the pension fund for public employees) has depleted its
reserves. In view of the demographic developments, the key parameters of the Tunisian pension
system—retirement age, contributions rates, and retirement benefits—will need to be adjusted to
maintain the financial viability of the funds and avoid transfers from the central government budget.
42.
The authorities are committed to preserving medium-term fiscal sustainability and
concurred broadly with staff analysis. They expressed their commitment to resuming a gradual
fiscal consolidation as soon as the economy is on a sustained recovery path, with the objective of
reducing public debt back to 40 percent of GDP over the medium term. Their consolidation strategy
would entail containing the wage bill, better targeting food and energy subsidies, and tax reforms.
The authorities have started to review existing social transfers to limit benefits leakages and to
prepare the ground for introducing additional social safety nets to compensate for the impact of
subsidy reform on the poor. Work on tax reform is being initiated, with the objectives of
strengthening revenue, making the tax system more equitable and transparent, and supporting
investment and growth. Finally, the authorities have started consultations to reform the Tunisian
pension system to preserve its financial viability. However, most of these important but socially
sensitive reforms will not be launched before the general elections in early 2013.

C. Structural Reforms
43.
Tunisia’s development model will need to be revisited to achieve higher and more
inclusive growth. Exports are an important source of growth; preserving export competitiveness
and diversifying Tunisia’s export markets will be essential. However, Tunisia’s development model
was based on low-value-added industries, intensive in unskilled labor. Labor costs were kept low by
means of the authorities’ tight control over wage negotiations, extensive price controls, and
occasional adjustments in the exchange rate. As a result, Tunisia’s economy became excessively
exposed to the tourism sector and economic conditions in Europe. The development model will
have to be revisited to improve the value-added content of Tunisia’s exports and support growth of
higher-value-added industries to absorb skilled labor.
44.
The authorities will need to reassess their intervention in the economy to improve the
investment climate. Dual economic management contributed to exacerbating regional disparities.
The offshore sector, concentrated in the coastal area, benefitted from fiscal and regulatory
incentives that allowed the sector to attract substantial foreign investments and operate mostly free
of state intervention. On the other hand, the onshore sector was subject to pervasive government
intervention, excessive regulation, and limited competition. Government interventions were
particularly pervasive in the financial and distribution sectors (price, market, and distribution
controls), and likely contributed to the current difficulties in both sectors. A more balanced
approach, including a gradual reduction of fiscal incentives for the offshore sector, would ensure a
level playing field for all companies, allow the onshore sector to catch up, and contribute to
reducing regional disparities.
45.
There is a need for more attention to the skills mismatches in the labor market. The
authorities have invested significant resources in the education system and have managed to
significantly increase the share of the

46.
Addressing pockets of poverty and implementing targeted policies to protect the most
vulnerable groups in the population will be needed. Revised poverty estimates indicate that
poverty rates and inequality are higher than previously stated, in particular in the underdeveloped
regions of the interior. Reducing unemployment and regional disparities would also contribute to
mitigate against poverty. In addition, targeted policies, including strengthening social safety nets,
will be needed to protect the most vulnerable segments of the population through the economic
transformation process.
47.
The authorities consider a new development model necessary to tackle high
unemployment and regional disparities. They have developed an ambitious reform program. The
authorities have started discussing the reform of the investment code and the streamlining of fiscal
and regulatory incentives to create a more level playing field. In addition, they plan to use publicprivate partnerships to foster investments, especially in the underdeveloped regions, and develop
high-value-added industries. They also aim to improve the business climate by greater transparency
and better governance in the economy.

STAFF APPRAISAL
48.
As Tunisia undergoes its historical transition since the January 2011 revolution, it is
facing even more pressing economic and social challenges. While the political transition has
moved ahead relatively well so far, Tunisia experienced a severe economic recession in 2011, which
brought the already high unemployment to a record level, especially for the youth. The authorities
tried to mitigate the recession with large monetary and fiscal expansions, but these led to the
buildup of vulnerabilities in the financial sector, inflationary pressures, and losses in foreign reserves.
The authorities’ challenge is to deal with persistent social tensions and spillovers from a possible
worsening of the recession in Europe in the short term while preserving macroeconomic stability
and enhancing potential for inclusive and higher growth in the medium term. A rebalancing of the
policy mix is called for in the short term, with fiscal policy as the main policy tool to support
economic growth, monetary policy directed toward containing inflationary pressures, and greater
exchange rate flexibility helping to stabilize international reserves. Moreover, a new vision for the
Tunisian economy and priority reforms will need to be identified early on so that the population and
investors can regain confidence in the economic future and look beyond the short-term difficulties.
49.
Staff supports a well-targeted fiscal expansion to support short-term growth, to the
extent that medium-term fiscal sustainability can be preserved. Given a deteriorated
environment in Europe, Tunisia’s main trading partner, and the lingering wait-and see attitude of
investors, a well-targeted countercyclical fiscal expansion, built on a pickup in public investment, will
be necessary to support short-term economic growth and job creation. The still-reasonable level of
public debt, together with the large external financing identified by the authorities for 2012, allow
for such a fiscal stimulus this year. To that effect, staff urges the authorities to overcome execution
capacity constraints and start effectively implementing their ambitious public investment plan,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

TUNISIA

particularly in favor of disadvantaged regions. At the same time, following a large increase in 2011,
and in order to preserve medium-term fiscal sustainability, current spending should be contained
through wage bill moderation and increases in energy prices to cap subsidies.
50.
It is important for the authorities to firm up their plans for gradual fiscal consolidation
over the medium term as growth picks up. The authorities’ strategy appropriately aims at
containing medium-term public expenditures and implementing tax reforms to strengthen
budgetary revenues and make the tax system more equitable and growth-supportive. In particular,
staff urges the authorities to take steps to control the wage bill by containing wage increases and
new recruitment. Staff also encourages the authorities to develop a clear subsidy reform strategy, in
consultation with stakeholders, and to move ahead with the reform of the pension system to ensure
its medium-term financial viability.
51.
There is a need for monetary policy tightening to contain inflationary pressures. While
the accommodative stance of monetary policy implemented since 2011 has supported bank credit
to the economy, inflationary pressures have been building up. The recent increase in the money
market rate induced by the authorities’ liquidity management will need to be accompanied by an
increase in the policy rate if inflation does not subside. Staff also encourages the authorities to
strengthen the institutional framework for formulating monetary policy by creating a monetary
policy committee, with a view to enhancing a forward-looking focus on the inflation objective and
improving the coordination between monetary and exchange rate policies.
52.
Staff supports the introduction of a more flexible foreign exchange arrangement.
Greater exchange rate flexibility will help to preserve CBT’s foreign exchange reserves and increase
the scope for monetary policy. Staff welcomes CBT’s recent changes in its exchange rate policy
operational framework. However, it will be essential that the CBT formalize the rules for its
intervention in the foreign exchange market to allow the exchange rate to reflect market forces.
Transparency could also be improved with the publication of the average exchange rates and the
amount of interventions of the CBT in the foreign exchange market.
53.
Staff urges moving forcefully ahead in addressing the vulnerabilities of the banking
sector to safeguard financial stability. Recent measures to strengthen the very weak banking
supervision and improve banks’ solvency will need to be broadened and reinforced. Staff
encourages the authorities to conduct audits of all public banks, define a calendar to discontinue
regulatory forbearance, align banking supervision with international standards, and address
decisively the resolution of high NPLs and banks’ solvency issues. The CBT should develop an exit
strategy to unwind gradually its large liquidity support to banks, which raises risks for the central
bank balance sheet, while continuing to meet banks' liquidity needs. In doing so, the CBT should
align its collateral requirements to international practices to protect its balance sheet, and should
introduce a “lender of last resort” facility to deal with banks with insufficient eligible collateral.

It is necessary that the authorities lay the ground for a comprehensive set of reforms

Fostering private investment is needed to put Tunisia on a higher medium-term growth path.
Improving governance and the business environment, reforming the labor market and education
system, and a comprehensive reform of the financial system are key. Furthermore, setting a more
level playing field for all sectors, and targeting state intervention to develop high-value-added
sectors, would strengthen domestic sources of growth and help to absorb skilled labor.

2/ Privatization receipts from Tunisie Telecom (TT) in 2006 were about TD 3000 millions. Only about TD 430 millions have been used in 2006 and about TD 336 millions
in 2007, with about TD 2500 millions remaining available at end-2011. IMF-staff projections for privatization receipts in 2012 include TD 300 million from the sale of confiscated
assets while the authorities' projections include TD 1200 million.
3/ Gross debt: includes debt held by social security funds (CSS); excludes debt of public enterprises.
4/ Contingent liabilities in 2013 refer to the expected recapitalization of public banks. This preliminary estimate could be revised upwards.

APPENDIX I. TUNISIA: RESERVE ADEQUACY
While the level of reserves at end-2011 remains adequate based on traditional metrics, it has
been declining rapidly over the past two years (a cumulative 30 percent decline). Using standard
rules of thumb, it appears that the current reserve level can provide a sufficient buffer against risks
emanating from current account shocks (three-month import coverage), short-term liabilities
(100 percent cover of short-term debt), and risks of capital flight (20 percent of broad money).1
However, a broader-based measure of reserve adequacy suggests that the recent decline in
reserves has left Tunisia more vulnerable to shocks. Looking at a composite reserve adequacy
(RA) metric that combines risks based on short-term debt, other portfolio liabilities, broad money
and export earnings, it appears that the current level of reserves has fallen below the range
considered safe from a precautionary perspective. Specifically, a recent IMF study suggests that a
level of reserves covering between 100 and 150 percent of the RA metric provides adequate buffers
for crisis prevention or for mitigating the effects of a crisis.2 In the case of Tunisia, the coverage was
only around 77 percent at end-2011. Comparatively, Tunisia’s level of reserves in percent of the RA
metric is lower than those of other Arab countries in transition (see figure below).

APPENDIX II. TUNISIA: EXCHANGE RATE AND EXTERNAL STABILITY ASSESSMENT
Tunisia’s equilibrium real effective exchange rate has been following a decreasing trend, reflecting
an increase in openness and a deterioration in the terms of trade which have more than offset gains
in productivity relative to trading partners.
Staff analysis points to the Tunisian dinar being slightly overvalued but broadly in line with mediumterm fundamentals. These results are based on the three CGER methods, namely the
macroeconomic balance (MB), the equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER), and the external
sustainability (ES) approaches. They take into account medium-term projections under staff’s
baseline scenario, which assumes a gradual but steady improvement in the external and fiscal
positions. This analysis, therefore, does not preclude possible pressures on the exchange rate in the
short term which could stem from a deterioration in the external environment.
The MB approach implies a current account (CA) norm that is lower than staff’s projected mediumterm CA balance (-2.2 vs. -4.2 percent of

APPENDIX IV. TUNISIA: FISCAL IMPULSE AND ITS EFFECT ON GROWTH
The 2012 budget law envisages a continuation of the fiscal expansion adopted during 2011 to
support economic activity in the aftermath of the crisis. In 2011, the authorities implemented a
large fiscal expansion to support private income and public investment; this expansion resulted in a
primary fiscal deficit of 1.7 percent of GDP (excluding privatization proceeds and grants) from a
primary surplus of 0.8 percent of GDP in 2010. For 2012, the budget law envisages a further
expansion in capital spending that adds to a projected primary fiscal deficit of 5.2 percent of GDP.
It is important to quantify the underlying fiscal impulse based on estimation of the structural
budget position. Estimation of structural budget balances involves three steps: (i) estimation of
underlying potential output and the associated output gap, (ii) identification and quantification of
one-off revenue (and expenditure) sources and of

gradually starting in 2013, reflecting a gradual fiscal consolidation over the medium term to reduce
the overall fiscal deficit to about 2 percent in 2017. In particular, the public sector wage bill is
expected to be contained, and food and energy subsidies gradually reduced over the medium term.
Also highly relevant in the current environment is the short-term impact of fiscal policy on
economic activity. One possible way to quantify the impact is the fiscal multiplier, typically defined
as the ratio of a change in output to an exogenous change in fiscal deficit with respect to their
respective baselines.3 While recent literature suggests average first-year fiscal multipliers of about
0.6 for advanced economies in events of fiscal expansion, this may be closer to unity in times of
fiscal consolidation. Also multipliers may differ depending on the nature of fiscal policies adopted.
First-year multipliers are found to be about 0.8 for spending and 0.3 for revenue measures.4
The envisaged fiscal stimulus in Tunisia should thus contribute significantly to economic
activity in the short term. Based on previous estimates of multipliers,5 the fiscal impulse adopted
during the period 2011 may have contributed to GDP growth by 0.5 to 0.7 percent in 2011. Similarly,
the envisaged fiscal stimulus for 2012 could contribute to GDP growth by up to 1 percent, thereby
helping narrow the projected output gap

The fiscal stimulus should prioritize
capital spending as its multiplier on
economic activity appears to be larger
than those on other spending and
revenue components. Preliminary
estimates for Tunisia find a multiplier on
capital spending of about 0.3, while that
on current spending is about half of that.
The multiplier on tax revenue is found to
be close to 0.2.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

APPENDIX V. TUNISIA: STRENGTHENING THE REFORMS UNDERTAKEN IN THE BANKING SECTOR
The authorities took the following measures to better align practices with international standards,
strengthen supervision, and to phase out regulatory tolerance:
Provisioning. A circular from the CBT assigns banks responsibility for placing collective provisions in
2011 on performing claims and to subjecting outstanding interest on consolidated claims to
reserves. The CBT intends to perpetuate collective provisions so that the provisioning rate, which is
below international standards, can be improved in the long term.
Governance. The CBT called upon banks to appoint at least two independent directors in respect of
the shareholders, to create a decentralized management unit to monitor risks, and to improve
transparency in financial information.
Solvency. The authorities undertook the recapitalization of a major public bank to bring its capital
up to the minimum regulatory level by the end of the year (not including revaluation of collateral).
The authorities are planning an audit during the latter half of 2012 to serve as a basis for completing
the final restructuring activities. The other public banks will also be subject to institutional and
financial audits at a later date. Last, a steering committee for the CBT, the finance ministry, and the
proprietary banks was established to devise a resolution strategy for a small insolvent bank under
temporary administration.
Prudential rules. Banks and banking supervision authorities agreed on a schedule for making banks
compliant with prudential regulations governing liquidity and risk concentration. The CBT also plans
to increase the CBT debt-to-equity ratio to 10 percent, to expand the concept of related companies,
and to reduce the limits exposure rates and the deduction of banks' holdings in capital and reserves
in other financial institutions.
Strengthening of supervision personnel. The CBT plans to hire 23 professional staff, including
seven inspectors, in July 2012.
These reforms undertaken in the banking sector should be strengthened:


The audit of other banks should be undertaken as soon as possible, and safeguard supervision
measures should be formally introduced, such as a limit to credit growth, a limit to network
expansion, and close supervision for banks subject to recapitalization pending final
restructuring, potentially entailing substantial recapitalization requirements.



A schedule should be implemented, using a gradual but expeditious approach to align the
prudential regulations with international standards, and to apply new rules, including increasing
the core capital ratio from 4 to 7 percent and the solvency ratio from 8 to 10 percent, and
strengthening the rules for classification of NPLs, assessment of collateral, and provisioning for
restructured loans. The current shortcomings, which have been tolerated to date, including

elimination of regulatory privileges granted to certain banks in difficulty, should be eliminated to
ensure fair competition between the market players.


Senior supervisors with international experience should be hired, and information systems for
bank supervision should be improved. Long-term technical assistance in banking supervision,
which the authorities have requested from IMF staff, along with training for CBT professional
staff, should be helpful in this area.



Cases of insolvency should be settled quickly and effectively to show the authorities'
commitment and capacity to finding an effective solution to bank insolvency.



The problem of NPLs in the tourism sector could be addressed through an asset management
structure having extended powers, specifically for the stock of old nonperforming claims.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

FSSA’s Findings and Recommendations
The banking sector faces significant challenges owing to a weak domestic economy, and from the legacy
of some policies of the previous regime. Banks’ financial statements point to deteriorating loan quality,
solvency, and profitability, and vulnerabilities could be much higher than reported. The supervisory framework
suffers from deficiencies and weak reporting practices; reported figures are not compiled in line with
international best practices, suffer from gaps, and exhibit inconsistencies. The mission urged the authorities to
address the serious weaknesses in data management, including by creating a uniform database and standardized
template to allow frequent and broad bank-by-bank performance monitoring.
The banking sector may face large recapitalization needs. These stem from existing weaknesses in loan
quality, which appear to be under-estimated, and from potential future losses. Therefore, banks should
immediately begin setting aside additional capital, since recapitalization needs could exceed 5 percent of GDP
after two years. Thus, a core conclusion of the assessment is the need for pre-emptive action by all banks to raise
capital. To assist in this process, the authorities are encouraged to increase the minimum capital adequacy ratio
(CAR) from 8 percent to 10 percent by 2013, and impose higher solvency requirements on individual banks with
higher risk profile.
Starting from an extremely weak position, the Central Bank of Tunisia (CBT) has made commendable
strides in strengthening banking supervision. A medium-term plan to build effective banking supervision was
initiated in February 2012, including a new organization, and reassignment and recruitment of staff. The CBT also
adopted a new corporate governance regime for commercial banks to increase the role and independence of
their boards.
Nonetheless, bank supervision and regulation need significant further strengthening. Banks must apply
international best practices for loss reporting, collateral valuation and classification, and provisioning of
nonperforming loans (NPLs).
The current circumstances provide an opportunity to revisit the rationale for and the modes of state
intervention. Public banks have been used to support nonviable state-owned enterprises and activities, their
governance arrangements have been weak and sometimes contradictory, and they have been staffed mainly with
civil servants with no banking experience. In addition to addressing these issues, the major state-owned banks
should be subject to in-depth audits by international firms, including assessments of their viability if
recapitalization needs are identified.
Crisis management arrangements need to be developed. In the past, distressed institutions have been
accommodated rather than being required to exit the market or restructure. Going forward, a special bank
resolution regime and preparation for an eventual deposit insurance scheme are needed in order to facilitate the
inevitable structural change in the sector.
The CBT should develop an exit strategy to unwind gradually its large liquidity support to banks. Liquidity
injections in 2011 supported strong credit growth but significantly increased credit risk exposure of the central
bank and led to a significant decline of foreign reserves. This strategy should be implemented gradually in order
to allow banks time to adjust their funding needs and enhance the functioning of the interbank market.
A comprehensive capital market reform is needed to support long-term investment. The Capital Market
Authority needs to strengthen its oversight of investment markets. A reliable yield curve should be developed,
and the confiscated assets of the old regime could be sold to jumpstart markets.
Banking sector reform should improve access to finance for individuals, and small and medium-sized
enterprises. This should be supplemented by swift implementation of the 2011 microfinance law.
The CBT has established an FSAP working group to monitor the implementation of the FSAP
recommendations. The working group includes key financial sector stakeholders and would meet quarterly.

APPENDIX VI. TUNISIA: IMPACT OF REFORM ON UNEMPLOYMENT OVER THE MEDIUM TERM
Due to the recent crisis, unemployment has increased drastically in Tunisia. Total
unemployment increased from 13 percent in 2010 to almost 19 percent at the end of 2011.
Unemployment among the youth (42½ percent) deteriorated even more and remains at extremely
high levels (see Table below). While the number of youth entering the labor force has been
shrinking, on average by 0.7 percent a year during 2000–10, the economy has eliminated youth
employment at a faster pace (–1.5 percent), contributing to a steady increase in youth
unemployment. In 2011, the crisis led to a 17 percent decline in youth employment, while the youth
labor force declined by 2 percent owing to a lower participation rate. Also unemployment among
females (28 percent) has increased, and unemployment among people with high education
(30.5 percent) remains significantly higher than unemployment among people without education
(9.3 percent).

Tunisia needs stronger growth to absorb new entrants into the labor force. The unemployment
rate would increase further, remaining above 19 percent in the medium term under a growth
scenario in which Tunisia maintains the same average real GDP growth that it had during the period
2001–10 (about 4.4 percent)1 (Figure 1). Based on staff projections, Tunisia would need an average
annual GDP growth rate of 4.7 percent only to absorb new entrants into the labor force.
The adoption of reforms aimed at increasing labor and product market flexibility can help
reduce unemployment in the medium term. Recent literature argues that increasing labor and
product market flexibility has a significant impact on employment intensity of growth,2 contributing
to more rapid growth in employment for a given growth in economic activity. Increased labor
market flexibility includes among others, efforts in reducing the cost of hiring and dismissal,
reduction of minimum wages, and facilitating recruitment. Product market flexibility is achieved by

reducing bureaucracy costs, eliminating price controls, facilitating business activity, limiting licensing
restrictions, and reducing the cost of tax compliance.
Labor and product market reform could indeed contribute to a significant dent in
unemployment in Tunisia. In addition, Tunisia could benefit from the normalization of
economic activity in Libya. Assuming labor and product market flexibility increase the employment
elasticity by 30 percent (from 0.45 to 0.6), and taking baseline annual real GDP growth projections of
about 5 percent, on average, the unemployment problem in Tunisia could improve over the medium
term, to reach 13 percent in 2017 (its precrisis level) (Figure 1). Additionally, reconstruction work in
Libya could allow a gradual return of Tunisians who used to work in Libya in the past.3 All in all,
higher growth, implementation of reforms, and the improvement in the economic situation in Libya
could contribute to a reduction in unemployment to as low as 11½ percent in 2017.

APPENDIX VII. TUNISIA: THE ROLE AND IMPLICATIONS OF SUBSIDIES1
The structure of subsidies in Tunisia
Significant price subsidies on food and energy products are provided in Tunisia. Indirect price
subsidies are provided for several staple foods and energy products, including refined petroleum
products, natural gas, and electricity.2 Price subsidies in Tunisia are universal, i.e. they are provided
on an unrestricted basis to all consumers. In particular, staple foods and energy products are
provided to consumers at an administered price set by the Tunisian government at a level below
their actual costs of production or importing.
The Tunisian government started to implement a universal food subsidies scheme in 1970 and
reformed it in the early 1990s to improve the targeting of subsidies to the poor. The food
subsidies scheme implemented in the early 1970s had extensive coverage. In the early 1990s food
subsidies were narrowed to products mostly consumed by lower-income groups. Staple foods
included in the current subsidies scheme cover cereals—durum wheat, bread wheat, barley, and
corn—and milk, sugar, tomato sauce, and cooking oils (excluding olive oil).
The Caisse Generale de Compensation (CGC), a governmental agency, has the primary
responsibility to administer food subsidies.3 Staple goods, either produced locally or imported,
are sold at an administered price set below production or importing costs so that food subsidies are
provided as a direct price reduction to consumers. The CGC pays to the operators the difference
between the actual costs of producing or importing and below-market price to consumers. In turn,
the CGC receives direct budget transfers from the government.
Furthermore, energy prices are administered by the Tunisian government. Energy prices are set
at all levels of the energy market, including transactions among public enterprises, margins of
private operators, and final prices to consumers. End-consumer prices of all petroleum products and
natural gas are set by the government, independently of the prices on the international markets.
Furthermore, electricity tariffs are below the overall costs of recovery.

Giorgia Albertin and Ernesto Crivelli.

Government price subsidies are also provided for school transportation. The government compensates the
difference between the actual costs incurred by the transportation company and the price paid for transport by the
beneficiary.
3

The CGC also provides subsidies on other nonfood items, school supplies, and fertilizers.

The impact of subsidies in Tunisia
Food and energy price subsidies have contained inflationary pressures in Tunisia. The presence
of price subsidies has contained inflationary pressures in Tunisia by limiting the pass-through from
international commodity prices to domestic consumer prices. Tunisia presents a very low oil prices
pass-through effect compared to both developed and emerging economies.

However, subsidies have a significant impact
on the government budget. Food and energy
subsidies in Tunisia doubled to 4 percent of
GDP in 2011, from 2 percent of GDP in 2010,
reflecting the authorities’ decision to delink
domestic prices from international food and oil
prices hikes. Furthermore, some staple foods—
milk and sugar—were re-introduced in the
scheme in the aftermath of the revolution.

Food and energy subsidies in Tunisia are
regressive, benefiting more the richest segments of the population. In particular, the highestincome households benefit almost four times more from food subsidies than do the lowest-income
ones. Similarly the highest-income households would benefit almost 40 times more from energy
products subsidies than the lowest-income ones.4
Reforming the subsidies system in Tunisia would reduce budgetary costs and better protect
the poor. Progressively removing current generalized price subsidies and implementing appropriate
social safety nets—such as a system of price subsidies targeted to the most vulnerable segments of
the population or direct cash transfers to poor households or individuals—would provide better
protection for those in need. Furthermore, it would reduce budgetary costs and free additional fiscal
resources which could be used for priority spending—i.e., infrastructure, health, and education—
thereby better addressing social demands.
4

Data from the 2005 Household Survey in Tunisia indicate that expenditure of the households in the lowest income
decile is less than 5 percent of the overall food expenditures and about 20 percent for the highest income
households. Transport expenditures of the households in the lowest income decile is 1 percent of the overall
transport expenditures while the share of the highest income households is more than 40 percent.

APPENDIX VIII. PUBLIC AND EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Public debt
Tunisia’s public debt declined significantly in recent years but it increased in 2011, in the
aftermath of the revolution. Reflecting the authorities’ prudent fiscal policies and consolidation
efforts, public debt declined from over 67 percent of GDP in 2001 to 40½ percent of GDP at end2010. However, public debt increased in 2011 as a result of the expansionary fiscal policy in 2011 (an
overall fiscal deficit reaching 3.7 percent of GDP) implemented in the aftermath of the revolution to
support economic growth and address social demands as well as the contraction in real growth. At
end-2011, public debt stood at 44½percent of GDP, still a relatively comfortable level.
Under a baseline scenario, public debt is expected to increase considerably in the short term
but then progressively decline over the medium term. Public debt would significantly increase in
the short term, peaking at about 51 percent of GDP in 2014, as a result of the sizable fiscal stimulus
(an overall fiscal deficit of about 7 percent in 2012) and the anticipated recapitalization of public
banks (3½ percent of GDP). However, the debt to GDP ratio is expected to then gradually decline in
the medium term, reaching about 46½ percent by end-2017. This favorable debt dynamic reflects
the fiscal consolidation envisaged by the authorities (an overall fiscal deficit declining to about
2 percent of GDP in 2017) and higher medium-term growth (5 percent on average during 2012–17).
However, the public debt ratio would remain well above its end-2010 level (40 percent of GDP).
The public debt dynamics are very vulnerable to adverse shocks and could deteriorate
significantly compared to the baseline, remaining close to or above 60 percent of GDP. Under
an alternative scenario in which the medium-term fiscal consolidation is not implemented, public
debt would be on an increasing path and would reach about 62 percent of GDP in 2017. In addition,
the public debt dynamic would worsen under most of the bound tests. Under a permanent negative
shock to real growth (3 percent during 2012–17, on average), public debt would remain on an
increasing path, reaching about 59 percent of GDP by end-2017. In addition, public debt would
reach about 60½ percent as a result of a one-off 10 percent of GDP shock to contingent liabilities,
slightly declining to about 55½ percent of GDP by 2017.1 Finally, as almost 60 percent of public debt
is denominated in foreign currency, a one-time 30 percent depreciation would increase public debt
to about 63½ percent and then decline to 58½ percent of GDP at end-2017. On the other hand, the
public debt dynamics would be relatively resilient to an interest rate shock, reaching around
49 percent over the medium term.

1

The one-off 10 percent of GDP shock to contingent liabilities reflects about 3½ percent of GDP expected
recapitalization of public banks and the realization of about 6½ of GDP of government’s contingent liabilities from
public enterprises (about 70 percent of existing government’s contingent liabilities from public enterprises).

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

External Debt
After a decade of steady decline, external debt (in percent of GDP) is projected to increase moderately
over the next few years as a result of the post-revolution fiscal expansion. Notwithstanding this
increase, external debt will remain sustainable under the baseline and under most shocks although it
would be vulnerable to a large exchange rate shock.
Tunisia’s external debt is relatively low and has been stable in recent years. External debt
declined sharply in recent years from over 65 percent of GDP in 2003 to 48 percent of GDP at end2011, on the back of a strong fiscal adjustment. The authorities have followed prudent borrowing
policies, refraining from accessing international capital markets and opting instead for concessional
resources from multilateral and development banks.2
Under the baseline projections, external debt is projected to moderately increase in the short
term owing to a declining-but-still large current account deficit. The recent slowdown in
economic activity, along with the fiscal expansion in support of the recovery, has led to a worsening
of the debt outlook relative to the previous debt sustainability analysis (which projected an external
debt ratio below 40 percent in the medium term).3 Nevertheless, Tunisia’s external debt
sustainability risks appear contained in the period ahead. The analysis assumes that Tunisia will
implement some fiscal consolidation in the medium term and continue to pursue cautious external
borrowing policies. The external debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to peak at 55 percent in 2015 before
slightly declining to around 53 percent by end-2017.
The external debt ratio is resilient to most types of adverse external shocks (except a large
exchange rate depreciation). The relatively low level of Tunisia’s debt as well as its profile (low
average interest rate and relatively long maturity) makes it robust to most shocks, with the
exception of a large real exchange rate depreciation. The external debt ratio remains below
60 percent of GDP throughout the projection period under all but one alternative scenario and all
bound tests. For example, a permanent negative shock to growth or to the current account would
only raise the debt ratio to 57–58 percent of GDP, while an increase in the average interest rate
would almost have no impact.4 However a sharp real depreciation (one-time 30 percent) of the
exchange rate in 2013 relative to the baseline would raise the debt ratio to almost 80 percent of
GDP.

The last international bond issuance was in 2007. At end-2011, there were nine international bonds outstanding
with remaining maturities ranging from less than one year to 20 years.

CR/10/282 (September 2010).

The size of each shock is half a standard deviation except for the growth rate which is reduced by ¾ of one
standard deviation.

1/ Derived as [r - g - g) + (1+r)]/(1+g++g) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; = change in domestic GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms,
g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-gr1+g++g) times previous period debt stock. increases with an appreciating domestic currency (> 0)
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
4/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
5/ The implied change in other key variables under this scenario is discussed in the text.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain
at the levels of the last projection year.

Safeguards Assessments
Not applicable to the Central Bank of Tunisia (CBT) at this time.
Exchange Rate Arrangement
Tunisia accepted the obligations of Article VIII Sections 2(a), 3, and 4 effective January 6, 1993, and
maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on executing payments and transfers on
current international transactions, except that Tunisia maintains (a) a multiple currency practice
resulting from honoring exchange rate guarantees extended prior to August 1988 to development
banks, which will automatically expire after maturity of existing commitments (total loans covered by
these guarantees amount to about $20 million); and (b) certain restrictions relating to Iraq and the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), pursuant to UN Security Council
Resolutions, which are subject to notification to the Fund in accordance with Decision 144 (52/51).
The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating as indicated on the CBT web site. Effective
April 18, 2012, a fixing (i.e. the average of market participants’ quotes) replaced the currency
composite as the reference exchange rate published by the BCT. Since then, the BCT intervened in
the foreign exchange market through bilateral transactions when market quotes deviated
substantially from the fixing rate of the day. Previously, Central Bank of Tunisia (CBT) intervened in
the foreign exchange market to keep the exchange rate stable vis-à-vis a currency composite using
its own rates in response to requests from banks for quotes. The rates quoted by the CBT were
based on the currency composite and updated continuously to reflect the exchange rates prevailing
in the international foreign exchange market. During the transition to the new operational
framework, since September 2011, the CBT has adjusted the level of the exchange rates vis-à-vis the
currency composite. This resulted in the dinar following a depreciating trend vis-à-vis a currency
composite within a margin of less than 2 percent through end-April 2012. Therefore, the de facto
exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to a crawl-like arrangement from stabilized,
effective September 1, 2011. The CBT posts, effective January 1, 2011, the volume of transactions
between authorized intermediaries, and the volume of its daily interventions in the interbank foreign
exchange market on its website.”
On June 13, 2012, the interbank rate of the dinar vis-à-vis the dollar was $1=TD 1.6046, equivalent
to SDR 1=TD 2.4133.
Article IV Consultation
Tunisia is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation was held in
Tunis from June 2 to June 15, 2010, and it was concluded by the Executive Board on August 27,
2010. There was no Article IV consultation in 2011 because of the not yet stabilized political
situation following the revolution.

FSAP Participation and ROSCS
The last FSAP update was conducted during January 11-25, 2012. Tunisia participated in the
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) in 2002 and an FSAP update was conducted in 2006.
AML/CFT Assessment
Tunisia’s anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) framework
was assessed in 2006 against the AML/CFT standard, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) 40+9
Recommendations. The evaluation was conducted by the World Bank in the context of the FSAP
update. The final report indicated that Tunisia had adopted an AML/CFT law, and the criminalization
of money laundering and the financing of terrorism were broadly in line with international
standards. However, key weaknesses remained, including the absence of a legal basis for freezing
funds in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1267 and 1373, the inability of
the financial sector supervisors to engage in international cooperation, and deficiencies related to
the identification of beneficial owners. Recent political changes in Tunisia and related efforts to trace
and identify stolen assets have highlighted significant challenges in the implementation of the
existing AML/CFT framework. In line with the authorities’ intention to strengthen their AML /CFT
framework, it has been agreed that a new assessment of the AML/CFT regime should be conducted
towards the end of 2012.

ANNEX II. RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(As of June 8, 2012)
Country Partnership Strategy
A new Interim Strategy Note (ISN, FY13-14) outlines the Bank Group support to post-revolution
Tunisia. The new ISN will be discussed by the World Bank Board of Executive Directors on July 3,
2012. The ISN updates a Country Partnership Strategy (CPS, FY10-13) which appeared inadequate to
respond to the new country context. The new ISN has been prepared jointly with the IFC, with
participation from MIGA, and it supports a program that will promote private sector-led recovery
and job creation, with a focus on openness, opportunity and accountability. To achieve its
overarching objective of supporting employment creation, the Bank Group will frame its support
within three Areas of Engagement: i) Laying the Foundation for Renewed Sustainable Growth and
Job Creation; ii) Promoting Social and Economic Inclusion; and iii) Strengthening Governance: Voice,
Transparency and Accountability. The ISN is intended to support Tunisia during the term of the
Constituent Assembly Government, and during the transition to the next elected government. The
IFC has also strengthened its engagement and appointed a staff in Tunis.
Lending Volumes
In FY12 the Bank lent $50 million for a regional Medium and Small and Micro Enterprise loan. In
FY13 the Bank plans to lend up to $1,435, of which $950 million in FY13 in a blend of IBRD
development policy loans, combined with a policy-based guarantee (not included in the total
lending value, it accounts for 25 percent against the IBRD envelope), and investment operations;
Global Environment Facility (GEF) trust funds, and other trust funds administered or funded by the
World Bank, as well as analytic and advisory services. Financing in FY14 would be defined based on
performance of the FY13 program, the Government’s request, IBRD’s capital position and demand
from other borrowers. Given the worsening international and domestic economic outlook, the Bank
expects to commit a large share of Tunisia’s IBRD envelope through budget support using the DPL
instrument, based on program performance and to accelerate implementation of the reform
program. Investment lending, which remains a critical instrument to achieve medium-term
development objectives, is expected to constitute a greater share of lending commitments in FY14,
as the economy recovers.
On-Going Portfolio
The Bank’s portfolio in Tunisia was impacted by the revolution, which slowed implementation of
some activities. The portfolio includes IBRD and trust fund financing for infrastructure and social
services, rural development and natural resources management. Actual commitments are estimated
at $510 million with an undisbursed balance of $337 million as of March, 2012. The investment
lending disbursement ratio of 20 percent in FY11 was higher than the MNA disbursement ratio of

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TUNISIA 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

14 percent but lower than Tunisia’s FY10 ratio of 28 percent. The slower investment lending
disbursement rate, delays in preparation of new small grants and some implementation issues can
be attributed to disruptions caused by the revolution and political transition, including delays with
decentralized entities and with the awarding of contracts for projects that required investor
participation. Following the revolution, the Bank and interim authorities took stock of the ongoing
investment portfolio to ensure their relevance and to examine options for restructuring of
operations and mobilizing small grants. A Portfolio Review is planned for September 2012 to
evaluate the Bank program.

ANNEX III. RELATIONS WITH THE EUROPEAN BANK
FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
(As of June 19, 2012)
Following the Arab Spring, Tunisia and other three countries of the Southern and Eastern
Mediterranean region (Egypt, Morocco and Jordan) have requested country of operation status at
the EBRD in 2011. As a first step Tunisia became a Member of the Bank in December 2011 and
requested to be granted recipient/country of operations country status in June 2012. The EBRD
envisions a three-phase approach in these countries, starting with technical assistance and policy
dialogue, followed by investments through a special investment fund until the legal process of the
country's accession is completed, from which point on it will then conduct regular operations.
In Tunisia the first phase of technical assistance has started with activities focusing on (i) small
business support (SBS) advisory services that provide tailored financial and managerial training for
SMEs; (ii) local capital market development; (iii) food security; and (iv) experience and information
exchange between the existing and the new EBRD region through the “Transition to Transition”
(T2T) initiative. The second phase of investments is expected to start in the fall of 2012 and a special
investment fund of EUR 1 billion has been allocated for the whole region. In the third phase
operations will gradually build up to a full scale operation. The EBRD currently envisages building up
an annual business volume of about EUR 2.5 billion for the whole region.
There are presently 16 donor-funded technical assistance assignments in Tunisia, including
11 regional assignments, about €17.3 million of approved funding. These include the Food Security
Initiative in the region, the implementation of the SBS program in the region, the expansion of the
EBRD/Italy Local Enterprise Facility and the Direct Company Assistance program for agribusiness
companies. The technical assistance assignments also include 5 country-specific assignments: a
Transport Sector Review, an Assessment of the Sub-Sovereign Financing Framework, a Sustainable
Energy Initiative study, an Environmental and Social Assessment, and a Country Law Assessment.
To support Tunisia in tackling its structural reform challenges the EBRD plans to focus its operations
along the following priorities, in coordination with other IFIs and bilateral agencies:


Financial sector. The priority is to help bank restructuring and broadening financial sector
access to support private sector development so as to address a number of structural
deficiencies in the sector, including the prevalence of weak state-owned banks and limited

ANNEX IV. STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of June 12, 2012)

I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance but it should be strengthen in the financial sector.
National Accounts: In December 2010, the National Institute of Statistics (NSI) published a revised national
accounts series covering the period 1997–2009 based on SNA 1993 (instead of, as before, SNA 1968).
Following international guidelines, a chained-index approach is now used to estimating GDP growth. Quarterly
GDP series consistent with this revision have been recently disseminated at constant prices and at current prices
on the NSI website. These improvements are welcome, and should provide a better indication of economic
activity developments and trends in Tunisia. Surveillance would benefit from the collection and dissemination
of higher frequency data on employment, unemployment, and wages. Tunisia utilizes a periodicity and
timeliness flexibility option for the labor market data category under the SDDS. Since end-2011, quarterly
employment and unemployment data are disseminated with a timeline of three months.
Government finance statistics: While Tunisia produces annual general government data and quarterly
budgetary central government cash flow in the GFSM 2001 framework, some areas for improvement remain.
The depth of the budgetary central government should be improved to include one quarter timeliness and
quarterly financial balance sheet information.
Monetary statistics: The Central Bank of Tunisia (CBT) has not yet migrated to the Standardized Report
Forms (SRFs) to report monetary and financial statistics. The CBT has started to develop the SRF 1SR
(Standardized Report Form for the Central Bank) and is planning to request technical assistance from STA for
reviewing and validating the 1SR and to provide recommendations on the migration to the SRF 2SR
(Standardized Report Form for other depository corporations).
Balance of payments: Are generally adequate for surveillance, although greater details on the financial account
would be desirable.
Financial indicators: Financial indicators are available with significant lag and their accuracy is challenged by
problems in the banking supervision information system and data base management

II. Data Standards and Quality
Subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS) June 20, 2001.

A data ROSC was published on the IMF website on
August 9, 2006.

III. Reporting to STA (Optional)
Data are being reported for publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS), Government Finance
Statistics Yearbook, the Direction of Trade Statistics, and the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Tunisia
On July 25, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Tunisia.1
Background
The January 2011 revolution marked the beginning of an historical era for Tunisia. Following
the overthrow of the former President, Tunisia has moved steadily forward with its democratic
transition. The successful elections of a Constituent Assembly in October 2011 were a
milestone. A new coalition government, led by the Islamic Party (Ennahda) with two secular
parties, was formed. The constituent assembly is now preparing a new constitution, on the
basis of which new general elections are scheduled to take place in March 2013.
While the political transition has continued to progress, Tunisia experienced a severe
recession in 2011 amid domestic and regional turmoil. Real GDP contracted by 1.8 percent,
reflecting a sharp decline in tourism and foreign direct inflows. As the result of the economic
downturn and the return of Tunisian workers from Libya, unemployment soared to 19 percent
in 2011, with youth unemployment at 42 percent. Tunisia’s external position weakened, with

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

the current account deficit widening substantially to 7.3 percent of GDP in 2011 and official
reserves declining from US$9.5 billion at end-2010 to US$7.5 billion at end-2011. After
decelerating to 3.5 percent in 2011, inflation accelerated to 5.7 percent in April 2012 (year-onyear).
The authorities implemented an expansionary policy mix to address social demands and
support the economy. With an increase in current budget spending owing to an increase in the
wage bill, larger food and energy subsidies, and new social measures, as well as increased
capital spending, and notwithstanding a significant increase in revenue, the overall fiscal deficit
widened to 3.5 percent of GDP in 2011 from 1.1 percent in 2010. As a result, following a
decline in the last decade to 40 percent of GDP in 2010, the public debt ratio increased to
44.5 percent of GDP at end-2011. Monetary policy has been supportive of bank credit, with
large liquidity injection and a reduction in the policy interest rate.
The economic downturn, particularly in the tourism sector, deteriorated the quality of the
banks’ portfolio. In response, the central bank relaxed its regulatory requirements to allow
banks to reschedule loans for companies affected by the recession and injected large amount
of liquidity in the banking system to help banks in an environment of declining assets
performance. As a result, most banks became heavily dependent on central bank’s
refinancing.
Signs of a rebound have emerged in early 2012, with real GDP increasing by 4.8 percent
(year-on-year) in the first quarter and tourism and FDI picking up. A recovery in real GDP
growth would also be supported by a sizable growth-supporting fiscal expansion. However,
risks to the short-term outlook are large and tilted to the downside, including a worse-thananticipated recession in Europe which would depress exports, an escalation of domestic social
tensions which would hamper foreign and domestic investment, and capacity constraints and
delays in financing which could curb the envisaged growth-supporting fiscal stimulus. On the
upside, a rapid stabilization of the situation in Libya could bolster investors’ confidence.
Tunisia’s medium-term economic growth potential remains favorable, but unleashing it
requires a comprehensive package of structural reforms to foster private investment. Achieving
higher and more inclusive growth over the medium term will be necessary to reduce high
unemployment, especially among the youth, and address social and regional disparities. Real
growth would gradually reach 6 percent by 2017 in a baseline scenario which assumes
continued macroeconomic stability, improvement in governance and the business
environment, reforms of the labor market and education system to address the labor skills
mismatches, and a strengthening of the financial sector. Achieving higher growth will also
require that large external financing, including FDI inflows and borrowing by the government
and corporate sectors, can be mobilized.

3
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that following Tunisia’s political transition, the country faces pressing
economic and social challenges, including elevated unemployment and regional disparities.
Directors stressed the need to lay the ground for transforming the economy and promoting
stronger and more inclusive growth. With the economic recovery facing risks from the
unsettled political situation and the weak global environment, Directors saw a need to support
economic activity while safeguarding macroeconomic stability.
Directors saw room for fiscal policy to support growth and employment in the short term. They
generally considered the planned targeted expansion in public investment—while containing
current spending—to be appropriate. In this regard, they welcomed the authorities’ efforts to
streamline public procurement and improve investment execution. Directors emphasized that
fiscal consolidation should resume over the medium term to preserve fiscal and debt
sustainability, and highlighted the need for a clear consolidation plan. They supported planned
tax reforms to strengthen revenue and make the tax system more equitable and supportive of
growth. They also emphasized the need to control medium-term public expenditures, including
the wage bill, and to reform the subsidy and pension systems.
Directors supported the tightening of monetary policy to contain inflation, and welcomed the
central bank’s readiness to increase the policy rate if inflationary pressures persist. They
underscored the importance of strengthening the institutional framework for monetary policy,
as well as the coordination of monetary and exchange rate policies. Directors noted that
greater exchange rate flexibility can help preserve foreign reserves. Directors emphasized the
need to ensure the central bank’s independence for the conduct of monetary and exchange
rate policies, as well as for banking supervision.
Directors encouraged the authorities to press ahead in addressing the banking sector
vulnerabilities identified in the FSSA. They emphasized the need to decisively address high
NPLs and bank recapitalization issues, as well as improve the governance of public banks.
They also stressed the importance of aligning banking supervision with international
standards. Directors encouraged the central bank to develop an exit strategy to unwind
gradually its large liquidity support to banks while continuing to meet banks’ liquidity needs.
Directors considered that comprehensive structural reforms are needed to reorient the
Tunisian economy and harness its potential for higher and more inclusive growth. With the
need to reduce unemployment, reform of the labor market and the education system will be
key. Improving the business environment and governance will also be important to increase
private sector investment. The development of high-value-added sectors will help absorb
skilled labor. Directors highlighted the need to prioritize reforms while improving
implementation capacity.

Statement by Mr. Mojarrad, Executive Director for Tunisia,
Mr. Daïri, Alternate Executive Director, and Mr. Ben Hassine, Advisor
July 25, 2012
On behalf of our Tunisian authorities, we would like to express our gratitude to staff for
the hard work and constructive dialogue during the 2012 Article IV consultation
discussions and the FSAP. The authorities broadly agree with staff analysis and
assessment and appreciate their useful recommendations.
Since the January 2011 revolution, Tunisia has been undergoing a major political
transition to meet the expectations of its population toward more democracy and fairness,
increased employment opportunities, and improved social conditions. On October 2011,
Tunisia conducted a successful free and peaceful election for a National Constituent
Assembly, and a coalition government was formed. The new constitution under
preparation should strengthen national unity, the rule of law, good governance, human
rights protection, gender and regional equality, and empowerment of the citizens.
Legislative and presidential elections are scheduled for the first half of 2013.
The 2011 revolution was a major wake-up call, not only for Tunisians, but also for
Tunisia’s partners as well. The model followed in the past, which seemed to be successful
and was presented as exemplary, turned out to be economically and socially
unsustainable. This underscores the importance of a broad internal consultative process in
policy making within a democratic and open system of government. It also points to the
large growth potential from a major reorientation of policies toward more inclusiveness
and better governance.
Recent economic developments and outlook
The authorities were confronted with major challenges and uncertainties stemming from
the uprising and social unrest in Tunisia and the events in neighboring Libya, in addition
to the crisis in Europe, amid large and legitimate social demands. They used the policy
space provided by the country’s fiscal and foreign reserve buffers to manage the 2011
economic slowdown and bolster a quick recovery. The authorities have managed to strike
the right balance between supporting economic activity through a measured fiscal
expansion and an accommodative monetary policy, and maintaining macroeconomic and
financial stability in a difficult internal and external environment.
Against this background, real GDP declined by 4.9 percent (q-o-q) during the first quarter
of 2011, at a time when the country was experiencing a major political shock and
widespread social strife. Economic activity recovered, however, starting from the second
quarter, which is significant in view of the circumstances, even though for the year as a
whole, real GDP growth contracted by 1.8 percent. Real GDP growth is expected to reach
3.5 percent in 2012, owing to stronger tourism and FDI inflows, as well as the fiscal

2

stimulus provided under the revised budget law. The current account deficit is expected
to decline slightly to 7 percent of GDP, with close to 40 percent of the deficit being
financed by net FDI (as against 12 percent in 2011). Gross international reserves should
increase to the equivalent of 4.1 months of imports by the end of this year.
The authorities expect the growth rate to pick up in the medium term as a result of
increased social stability and policy credibility, implementation of the planned structural
reforms, and improvement in the economic situation in the Euro-zone and Libya.
Pressures on the balance of payment and the fiscal position are expected to ease.
Fiscal policy
The expansionary fiscal policy in 2012 was broadly appropriate in view of the need to
reinvigorate growth and the very large social demands, but also as a result of available
fiscal space. The planned increase in key infrastructure and social spending and the
moderate wage increase should support domestic demand and accelerate growth and job
creation without undue pressure on the fiscal position. In this regard, the planned control
of subsidy costs, including through increases in energy prices assumed under the revised
budget law for the second half of 2012, will be helpful. In addition to the revenue
measures included in the revised budget, the authorities will strengthen revenue
collection, which should help reduce the deficit. Efforts will be made to strengthen
implementation capacity, streamline budget processes, in particular at the regional level,
while maintaining necessary controls, and mobilize external resources to ensure full
execution of the investment budget. In this regard, the authorities intend to use the
unallocated budget resources, equivalent to some 1 percent of GDP, to help finance
priority investment in case of a shortfall in external resources. With a significant part of
the increased fiscal deficit to be financed from grants, privatization proceeds, and sale of
confiscated assets, the impact on the debt should be manageable. Indeed, public debt
should remain on a sustainable path, with broadly unchanged debt-to-DGP ratio from its
relatively comfortable level of around 45 percent of GDP.
The authorities are cognizant of the need to rebuild fiscal buffers over the medium term.
They have reiterated their commitment to resume fiscal consolidation by reducing the
overall deficit to 2 percent of GDP and the debt-to-GDP ratio to 40 percent over the
medium term, while increasing pro-growth and pro-poor spending, simplifying and
modernizing the tax system and rationalizing exemptions, and further strengthening
public financial management and the budgetary framework to improve governance,
transparency and accountability, and efficiency. A broad consultation process involving
all stakeholders will be launched on priorities for tax reform. Similar consultations will
be carried out to reach a consensus on the needed reform of the pension system in order
to ensure its long-term sustainability. The authorities are also firmly committed to
containing current expenditure, including by limiting future public sector wage increases

3

and reforming the subsidy system in order to achieve better targeting and rationalization,
while reducing its budgetary cost.
Monetary and exchange rate policies
Monetary policy was appropriately accommodative in 2011. The CBT reduced the
reserve requirement progressively from 12.5 to 2 percent and cut its reference interest
rate from 4.5 to 3.5 percent to support banking system liquidity and credit to the
economy. This policy was broadly successful in accommodating viable businesses faced
with short term difficulties stemming from the domestic and external environment.
However, the CBT has started to tighten the monetary stance since January 2012 in order
to contain rising inflationary pressures and the loss in international reserves. Among
other factors explaining higher inflation, staff points to the impact of the unsettled
situation in Libya on food prices in Tunisia. Inflation is expected to slow down during the
second half of the year, under the effect of monetary tightening. The CBT stands ready to
increase its policy rate if inflationary pressures persist.
In a context of uncertainty, central bank intervention was crucial to avoid overshooting of
the exchange rate, which explains in part the decrease in reserves. The real effective
exchange rate has been following a declining trend, and the authorities agree with staff
that the Tunisian dinar is broadly in line with fundamentals. The CBT reaffirms its
commitment to a market-determined exchange rate, which should help soften the impact
of external shocks. In this regard, it has changed its operational framework to reflect the
interbank exchange rates, instead of a fixed currency basket, and to minimize its
intervention in the market. Staff notes that the level of reserves remains comfortable,
based on traditional metrics, but may be below the minimum level under a new recently
developed metric. While the robustness of this new metric has yet to be demonstrated, the
authorities’ intention to implement a more flexible exchange rate policy gives confidence
that the reserves target for end-2012 is adequate.
With regard to the recent voting out of office of the Governor of the Central Bank of
Tunisia, the authorities wish to confirm their commitment to the independence of the
central bank, consistent with the Tunisian law. It is our expectation that the issue will be
appropriately addressed in the context of the ongoing drafting of a new constitution. We
have also been reassured that the views expressed by the former Governor during the
Article IV discussions remain valid, and that the current monetary, exchange rate, and
financial sector policies carried out by the central bank will not be affected by the recent
decision.
Financial stability
The Tunisian authorities broadly agree with the FSSA’s findings and recommendations.
They have prepared a reform program to address financial system weaknesses inherited

4

from the previous regime, including in the area of supervision. The staff report points to
the recent progress in strengthening bank regulation and supervision, including by
requiring banks to place collective provisions on performing claims and subjecting
outstanding interest on consolidated claims to reserves. This requirement will be
maintained for the upcoming years. The minimum capital adequacy ratio will be
increased from 8 to 10 percent by 2014. While the liquidity injection in 2011 helped
maintain availability of financing to the economy and avoid a severe contraction, the
authorities are preparing an exit strategy to unwind the liquidity support to the banking
system.
The authorities are committed to continue their efforts to recapitalize public banks,
starting with those facing major difficulties. An audit of these public banks is scheduled
for this year and is expected to draw the map of restructuring needs for the upcoming
years. With only one public bank facing insolvency, the cost of the restructuring should
be manageable, and the authorities will seek to minimize moral hazard and the cost to
taxpayers. Although the authorities do not see an immediate need to privatize public
banks, they agree on the importance of a more market-oriented and independent
management. In order to improve the transparency and governance of public financial
institutions, the CBT requires the presence of two independent directors in their boards.
The newly created public financial institution (Caisse de depôts et de Consignations CDC) will play an important role in financing strategic and regional investment projects,
including in partnership with the private sector, and in capital market development.
To strengthen capacity in supervision, the CBT is increasing its human resources and
improving training, and the authorities have requested Fund TA to strengthen the
supervision department. Bilateral TA is being provided to the newly-established
Financial Stability and Risk Prevention Department in the central bank to strengthen its
analytical capacity as well as its tools in monitoring developments affecting the long-term
stability of the financial system. In addition, the CBT is planning to modernize its data
management system by introducing a unique dataset and standardized template to
monitor banks situation daily.
Structural reforms
The authorities have prepared an ambitious program of reforms to promote employment
and inclusive growth, including by addressing regional and social disparities. An
infrastructure investment plan was prepared, based on broad consultation with civil
society, to respond to the needs of the different regions. The authorities also aim to use
the leverage effect of public-private partnerships to facilitate development of high valueadded industries. At the same time, attention remains focused on improving the business
environment by reviewing the investment code, improving governance of public
enterprises, and modernizing the judiciary. Current initiatives also include measures to
improve SMEs’ access to finance, address skill mismatch by expanding vocational

training, and improve infrastructure at the regional level. In addition, the authorities are
planning to improve the standard of living of disadvantaged households by providing
them with subsidized low-cost housing units within well-designed urban development
projects. The authorities believe that, with the pursuit of sound policies and broad
structural reforms, restoration of consumer and business confidence, and improvement of
the external environment, Tunisia will enhance its medium-term prospects for higher
growth and job creation.
To conclude, the Tunisian economy is on a recovery path, underpinned by its solid
fundamentals, the new environment of democracy, freedom, and good governance, and
sound economic policies. While Tunisia has a limited endowment of natural resources, its
skilled human capital remains its primary asset. The Tunisian authorities are committed
to continue to pursue prudent macroeconomic policies and implement structural reforms
to address financial system vulnerabilities and promote high and inclusive growth.
