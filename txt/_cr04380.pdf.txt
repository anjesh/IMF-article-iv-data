Mission details
x

A staff team visited Lilongwe during July 21-August 2, 2004 to conduct the 2004 Article IV
consultation discussions, present the ex post assessment (EPA) of Malawi’s long-term
engagement with the Fund, and hold talks on a staff-monitored program (SMP). The mission
held discussions with the Minister of Finance, Mr. Goodall Gondwe; the Governor of the
Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM), Dr. Ellias Ngalande; other senior officials of the
government and public agencies; and donor and business representatives.

x

The team comprised Mr. Green (head), Mr. Alvesson, Mr. Steinberg (all AFR),
Mr. Baunsgaard (Resident Representative), Ms. Kaendera (IMF Office in Lilongwe),
Ms. Mongrut (PDR), and Ms. Roehler (FAD). Mr. Ghosh (PDR) presented the EPA.
Ms. Gesami (OED) participated in the policy discussions. Members of the World Bank and
African Development Bank worked closely with the Fund staff.

Fund relations
x

On December 21, 2000, the Executive Board approved a three-year arrangement under the
PRGF for Malawi for SDR 45.1 million (65 percent of quota). The first review was
completed on October 20, 2003 and the arrangement was extended through December 20,
2004. The second review could not be completed because of fiscal slippages and delays in
completing structural performance criteria. A report for a staff-monitored program was
circulated to the board on September 9, 2004 (Country Report No. 04/295).

x

Malawi has had two ESAF/PRGF arrangements over the last ten years. An ex post
assessment was issued on September 17, 2004 (http://www.imf.org).

x

In concluding the 2002 Article IV consultation, Directors noted the disappointing
implementation of the 2000 PRGF and stressed that the success of the authorities’ program
would heavily depend on high-level commitment to fiscal restraint. They welcomed the
renewed intention of the authorities to bring the program back on track and cautioned them
against any surge in expenditure in the run-up to the 2004 elections. Directors also expressed
concern about the food crisis.

x

Malawi accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Section 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of
Agreement in December 1995. Malawi maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on
the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Recent developments
x

Economic performance since the 2002 Article IV consultation has been
disappointing. Malawi has suffered from adverse weather conditions and large fiscal
policy slippages. But inflation has been reduced to 10 percent in 2003, and the kwachaU.S. dollar exchange rate has been stable for the past 12 months.

x

Malawi’s Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement (approved
in December 2000) has effectively lapsed. The second review could not be completed
because of spending overruns.

x

Dr Bingu wa Mutharika was elected president in May 2004 with 35 percent of the
vote. President wa Mutharika’s commitment to sound fiscal policies and his early actions
on corruption have gained broad support across party lines.

x

A staff-monitored program was launched in July 2004 to enable Malawi’s new
government to establish a strong implementation track record. The 2004/05 budget
was approved in late September and is in line with the SPM. Performance so far has been
satisfactory.

Report on the discussions
x

The medium-term outlook depends on success in restoring fiscal discipline. With
strong up-front adjustment and implementation, the 2004/05 budget would avoid an
unsustainable spiral of higher domestic debt and interest payments. Medium-term
policies aim to provide an environment for private sector growth through a stable
macroeconomic environment and an adequate infrastructure.

x

The authorities will continue to pursue an active role in the prevention of food
shortages through a buildup of maize stocks and introduction of a fertilizer subsidy. The
government has also appealed for assistance from donors to address the expected food
shortage this year.

x

The authorities agreed with the main findings of the Ex Post Assessment of
Malawi’s performance under Fund-supported programs (EPA). However, they felt
that the structural reform agenda had at times been overloaded and program targets
overly ambitious.

x

A new PRGF arrangement could be considered after a six-month track record of
sustained policy implementation and taking into account the Board’s views of the
EPA.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Economic performance in Malawi since the 2002 Article IV consultation has
been disappointing. Fiscal policy slippages over much of the period have resulted in a
precarious domestic debt situation and a high level of public expenditures. Economic activity
picked up from the drought-related contraction in 2001, but the recovery has been muted in
part because very high interest rates have crowded out the private sector.
2.
There have also been some positive developments. Inflation was reduced from
more than 20 percent in early 2002 to less than 10 percent at the end of 2003. Commitment to
the structural agenda strengthened markedly at the end of 2003, and several long-standing
objectives have been completed. The formulation and execution of fiscal policy has also
improved in recent months.
3.
Malawi’s Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement
(approved in December 2000) has effectively lapsed. A staff report for the second PRGF
review was circulated to Directors on April 8, 2004 but was withdrawn from consideration
because of spending overruns.
4.
Dr. Bingu wa Mutharika was elected President in Malawi’s third multiparty
elections. International observers reported the election as being overall free, although they
were marred by many irregularities. The President’s party, the United Democratic Front
(UDF), failed to gain a parliamentary majority, but has formed a coalition with several small
parties and independent members of parliament. President wa Mutharika’s commitment to
sound fiscal policies and his early actions on corruption have gained broad support across
party lines.
5.
A Staff Monitored Program (SMP) was adopted. During the consultation
discussions, the authorities asked Fund staff to monitor a program to establish a track record
that could lead to a new PRGF arrangement. The SMP covers the 2004/05 fiscal year (JulyJune) and will be monitored quarterly. With strong performance over two test dates (six
months), a PRGF could be considered.

industrial activity remained very weak.

Malawi is one of the poorest countries in
southern Africa, with per capita GDP of about
US$160. Approximately two-thirds of the
population was estimated to live on less than one
dollar a day in 1997-98; recent adverse weather
conditions and the high incidence of HIV/AIDS
are likely to have worsened the incidence of
poverty. Since 1990, progress has been made in
improving other social indicators such as literacy
rates and access to better drinking water.

Government domestic debt more than doubled over the past two financial years
to 26 percent of GDP at end-June 2004. The increase was caused by large unbudgeted

Box 1. Fiscal Expenditures in 2002/03-03/04
Domestic primary expenditure exceeded program plans by more than 5 percent of GDP in
each of 2002/03 and 2003/04. Largely unbudgeted expenditure for maize imports of 3.9 percent of
GDP were a major factor in 2002/03, while 2003/04 was impacted by above budget spending in
executive services, national assembly, police, military, arrears repayments, subventions, and costs of
the elections. Moreover, wage overruns occurred in both years.
The PRGF went off track in early 2004. The expenditure program formulated during the first
PRGF review was derailed early in the year because some agreed measures were not implemented
and because of a shortfall in external budget support. A revised program was formulated in March
2004 based on the approved supplementary budget (which included a revised set of measures), but
indications of overspending soon emerged. The authorities were not able to implement the revised
program, and domestic primary expenditure exceeded the revised target by 3½ percent of GDP.

were increased, and an additional tax bracket was introduced for the personal income tax (at
a 40 percent rate). The surtax (a VAT) was extended to the wholesale and retail sector in
November 2002, but the rate was lowered from 20 percent to 17.5 percent in mid-2003. In
addition, the Malawi Revenue Authority became fully operational and tax administration
improved significantly. Nontax revenue benefited from increases in various levies, and in
2003/04 from sales proceeds for the stock of maize.
11.
Reflecting the large liquidity injection from the expansionary fiscal stance and
an easier credit policy, monetary aggregates have grown substantially. Believing that
higher interest rates would not absorb liquidity, the RBM instead lowered the Bank Rate
(discount rate) in three steps to 25 percent,3 and limited foreign exchange sales due to low
reserves. As a result, broad money growth has been consistently near or above 30 percent
since late 2002. An unexplained rise in cash outside the banking system further complicated
sterilization efforts.

The reduction did not appear to affect the RBM’s ability to roll over outstanding treasury or
RBM bills. It is possible that treasury bill yields have not reflected market-clearing
conditions. The RBM places an effective ceiling on yields by rejecting any bid above the

meet monetary targets, and because of the government’s weak fiscal position.

The financial sector continues to benefit from high returns on government
securities.4 Banks remained well capitalized and have minimized the risks associated with a
build up in foreign exchange deposits by a matching rise in foreign currency assets. The ratio
of nonperforming loans declined from 13 percent in June 2003 to 10 percent in March 2004,
but remains an issue for a few banks where on-site examinations have been stepped up.

The structural reform agenda has
1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003
advanced, though unevenly and at a slower than
anticipated pace. Several parastatal corporations were privatized and reforms have been
implemented in the telecommunication, electricity and water sectors. ADMARC’s monopoly
in the marketing of maize has been abolished and the law regulating ADMARC was repealed
in December 2003, paving the way for a separation of the social and commercial activities of
the firm. The Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) was strengthened in early 2004 through an
amendment to the Corrupt Practices Act that requires the cases referred to the Director of
Public Prosecution but not prosecuted be reported to parliament. The new administration has
declared a policy of zero tolerance on corruption and has already taken steps to enforce this
policy. In particular, several high ranking government and parastatal officials have been
arrested for corruption and a special commission has issued a report on the mismanagement
of the Strategic Grain Reserve (SGR) in 2000-01, including specific allegations of financial
improprieties.
16.
The public expenditure management procedures have been strengthened, but
the internal controls remain weak. A new Public Finance Management Act, Public Audit
Act, and Public Procurement Act were passed by parliament in mid-2003, and they are now
being implemented. For the first time in many years, the final public accounts (for the
2002/03 fiscal year) were ready for presentation to parliament within 12 months. A new
Department of Public Procurement under the Office of the President is being funded by its
own budget line for the first time in 2004/05. The first phase of an external audit of domestic
arrears is under way and an interim report has been completed. Numerous donor-assisted
programs to strengthen expenditure procedures are under way, but implementation has been
slow.

Performance under the PRGF arrangement was disappointing. The three year
arrangement was approved in December 2000 and subsequently extended until December
2004. Unfortunately, only two of eight scheduled disbursements were made because of
spending overruns and delays in completing some of the structural objectives. Because the
arrangement is set to expire, the authorities requested assistance in establishing a
performance track record within an SMP. A new PRGF arrangement would take into account
(i) the IMF Executive Board’s views on the EPA, and (ii) strong performance over two test
dates (six months).
III. REPORT ON DISCUSSIONS
The discussions focused on policy actions to strengthen macroeconomic performance and
medium-term policies and prospects and the ex post assessment of Malawi’s longer-term
engagement with the Fund.
18.
Malawi’s overriding economic policy challenge is to establish conditions for
sustained growth and significant poverty reduction. In the near term the authorities need
to address domestic debt by bringing public expenditure under control, further reduce
inflation by reining in monetary growth, and foster private sector development and job
creation through structural reforms and investment in basic infrastructure.
A. Medium-Term Outlook
19.
The outlook for economic growth and poverty reduction will depend on the
success of restoring fiscal discipline in the very near term. To underscore the critical
importance of immediate action against the consequences of adverse debt dynamics, the staff
presented a delayed adjustment scenario in which, government spending was not reined in
until 2005/06 (lower panel of text table). In these hypothetical projections, domestic
borrowing would rise, inflation accelerates, interest rates remain high, and debt increase. The
government would be forced to adjust in 2005/06, but at a significant cost to the economy
including lower growth and fewer resources available for pro-poor programs. The staff
stressed, and the authorities agreed, that delayed policy actions and their consequences were
to be avoided.
20.
The authorities presented a 2004/05 budget framework to the mission that
incorporated significant fiscal adjustment. The resulting budget, which was approved by
parliament in late September, was incorporated into the 2004/05 adjustment scenario
projections (Box 2).

Box 2. Staff-Monitored Program for FY2004/05
The 2004/05 budget limits domestic borrowing to 2 percent of GDP, in line with the SMP. The
budget aims at restraining spending across government while accommodating priority initiatives.
Revenue would increase somewhat owing to tax efficiency gains and increases in nontax user fees.
The fiscal effort measured by the underlying balance is targeted at 2 percent of GDP. A mid-year
review is planned.
Priority expenditure initiatives include civil service wage reform, food security, ADMARC
restructuring, and domestic arrears repayment. The food security policy has two components:
maize imports and a targeted input program that provides subsidized fertilizer and seed maize.
Excluding the wage reform, these initiatives add about 2¼ percent of GDP to expenditures. Wage
reform is expected to hold the wage bill close to 7 percent of GDP and give civil servants the first
general increase in several years. The government may achieve some savings on a net basis because
compensation formerly in the form of allowances will be shifted to taxable money income. High
priority pro-poor expenditures (PPEs) are being protected from budget cuts.
Money will remain the nominal anchor to achieve 10 percent inflation by the end of 2005. The
RBM will need to contain broad money growth and mop up the liquidity overhang that built up at the
end of the 2003/04 fiscal year. The buildup of cash outside the banking system during April-June 2004
has added uncertainty to monetary operations. The exchange rate will continue to be market
determined.
Structural measures focus on financial management. As recommended in the EPA, they will be
limited to areas under the direct control of the authorities. The authorities and staff agreed that
strengthening budget monitoring and control was a critical first step in restoring fiscal discipline.
Specific measures are included in the SMP (Country Report No. 04/295, Table 2 in Appendix I).
Key program risks are budget implementation and inflation. The authorities affirmed their
commitment to budget objectives, but acknowledged that weak expenditure controls could undermine
spending targets. Inflation projections are also uncertain because of the monetary overhang and the
recent divergence in broad money and the price level.

21.
Projections for the remaining years in this scenario were seen as illustrative and
would be refined in the near future. In particular, the projections do not include estimates
of savings or efficiency gains related to the government restructuring that is now under way.
These could be used to achieve the government’s objective of reducing the dependency on
donor assistance and implement a tax reform.
22.
In the adjustment scenario, the underlying fiscal balance would improve by
about 2 percent in 2004/05 through fiscal restraint. Domestic interest payments would fall
compared with 2003/04 because of the reduction in interest rates from 45 to 25 percent

- 14 -

(November 2003 May 2004) and the reduction in the domestic debt ratio.5 The adjustment in
2004/05 creates conditions that would allow the debt ratio and interest rate to decline so that
the government can raise pro-poor spending and the private sector can raise its investment. In
consequence, economic growth would pick up to the 5-6 percent annual rate needed for
significant poverty reduction.
23.
In addition to the debt dynamics highlighted above, the outlook is subject to
several risks. First, the economy remains vulnerable to weather shocks that jeopardize food
security and also export performance. Second is the spread of HIV/AIDS. Unless the
epidemic is contained and the effects are mitigated, the disease could seriously limit the
quality of public sector services (in particular in the health and education sectors) and have a
negative impact on economic growth. Third, the reserve position of the RBM could come
under pressure, for example if external donor support falls off. Fourth, higher energy or
fertilizer prices could cause spending pressures and the balance of payments pressures.
B. Medium-Term Growth Strategy
24.
A new medium-term growth strategy was developed jointly by government
officials and private sector representatives to complement Malawi’s Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (MPRSP). Under the plan, government would facilitate economic growth
and job creation by providing the private sector with a stable macroeconomic environment, a
reliable public infrastructure, and efficient government institutions. Business representatives
emphasized that they face many impediments to production and business development, in
particular transportation bottlenecks, electricity shortages, and very high interest rates.
25.
The authorities indicated that Malawi’s medium-term growth would stem from
the agriculture sector reflecting the dominance of this sector in the economy and
Malawi’s resource endowments. While the medium-term strategy for the sector was under
review, a new land reform policy has already been approved, with enabling legislation
expected sometime in 2005, and the government recently announced a strengthened rural
credit scheme. The authorities also emphasized the need for diversification away from
tobacco, for example, through agro-processing, textiles, and tourism. They assured the staff
that these industries were not being targeted and investment and production decisions would
be left to the private sector. Privatization of remaining government-owned business,
including Air Malawi and the electricity utility, had been put on hold pending a review by the
new government.
C. Fiscal Policy
26.
The immediate fiscal policy objective is to arrest adverse debt dynamics by
limiting spending to high priority areas. The government initially targeted zero domestic
5

The debt ratio would fall because of the primary surplus, lower nominal interest rates for
some of the year, and higher inflation.

- 15 -

borrowing in its draft budget framework, mainly through limits on travel, postponement of
nonessential purchases and new domestically-funded development projects, and buoyant
revenue. However, in order to set realistic targets, the mission indicated that some domestic
borrowing would be consistent with reducing the debt to GDP ratio and would make room
for the government’s new initiatives including wage reform and food security. The
authorities agreed with the analysis, and targeted domestic borrowing of 2 percent of GDP.
They indicated that additional resources, for example from higher tax collections or a lower
debt interest bill, would be earmarked for debt reduction. This would foster lower interest
rates and reduce the interest burden. In the event of unanticipated spending pressures or a
shortfall in resources, spending restraint would be considered.
27.
In the medium term, the authorities intend to reduce the ratio of expenditures to
GDP to lower Malawi’s tax burden and dependence on donor assistance. As a first step,
the government announced a restructuring plan including reductions in the number of cabinet
positions (already accomplished) and in the number of ministries, and the relocation of the
president’s office to Lilongwe where ministries are located (completed). Savings could be in
the range of ½ to 1 percent of GDP a year, but firm savings—and initial cost—estimates are
not yet available. They will depend on how individual ministries can improve efficiency as
they are merged and on the timing of staff reorganization including a reduction in the number
of top civil servants. The authorities and staff agreed that medium-term fiscal policy
initiatives would be reviewed in connection with the midyear budget review when the new
government will have had time to firm its plans. It would also work with Malawi’s
development partners to increase the grant component of external assistance in order to avoid
a buildup in external debt.
28.
Volatile external aid has reflected recurrent slippages in policy implementation
and underscored the importance of sustained policy execution.6 As concluded in the
EPA, the stability of resources available to the government would be increased with more
realistic projections of budget support and assumptions related to the authorities’ ability to
complete structural measures on which some budget support is conditioned. In mid-2003/04,
for example, budget support disbursements equivalent to 4 percent of GDP were delayed
when large fiscal slippages became apparent and when certain structural targets were not
accomplished. Thus, uneven implementation of domestic policies contributed to volatile
donor support that in turn contributed to macroeconomic instability through higher domestic
financing and monetary expansion.
29.
Further progress in strengthening expenditure management and medium-term
budget planning is critical. The authorities agreed with the EPA conclusion that budget

6

Aid inflows averaged 13.7 percent over the past five years and ranged from 17.8 percent in
2000/01 to 10.1 percent in 2001/02. See “Malawi: Volatility and Predictability of External
Aid Inflows” in the selected issues paper.

- 16 -

execution and monitoring capacity needed to be rebuilt and have requested technical
assistance from the IMF and other development partners for this purpose.
30.
The recent rise in world petroleum prices has put pressure on public finances. In
response, the Ministry of Finance informed ministries that budget allocations would not be
increased to accommodate higher fuel and utility prices. In addition, fuel allowances would
be frozen.7 The authorities acknowledged that pump prices had not been adjusted since
March 2004, against recommendations by the Petroleum Pricing Board. Because the
stabilization fund had been exhausted, they said that a price increase was necessary and
might be accomplished in conjunction with the consolidation of fuel taxes and levies into a
single charge. The staff supported the authorities’ view that domestic prices need to be
adjusted as a means of both reducing budget pressure and making local prices consistent with
world markets. This would encourage domestic users to adjust their fuel consumption.
D. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
31.
Money will remain the nominal anchor to achieve 10 percent inflation by end2005, and reduce it further to 5-8 percent range in the medium term. The RBM will need
to mop up the liquidity overhang that built up at the end of the 2003/04 fiscal year and
decided to postpone plans to reduce the liquid reserve requirement until market conditions
permit. The unusual rise in cash outside of the banking system during April-June 2004 has
added uncertainty to monetary operations, but the authorities indicated that they would
monitor bank deposits and credit on a weekly basis to limit the possibility of related
monetary overruns. The authorities further indicated that they would raise the Bank Rate if
necessary to meet the monetary program objectives. In the medium term, control of monetary
aggregates will be simplified with improved fiscal discipline.
32.
The RBM stressed that the exchange rate would continue to be market
determined. Its intervention in the foreign exchange market would be limited to meeting the
net international reserve target and moderating seasonal fluctuations, without attempting to
influence underlying trends. In the near term, intervention will be constrained by current low
reserve levels, but will also be facilitated by the RBM’s decision to maintain the foreign
exchange surrender requirement at 40 percent.8 The authorities were considering formalizing
this approach, perhaps through a target zone formula. However, this would need to wait until
reserves were rebuilt and sustainable fiscal policy restored. The staff agreed that the existing
7

Fuel allowances for most civil servants were eliminated as of October 1, 2004. However,
some contract employees will receive this allowance until their contracts expire.
8

However, the tobacco, sugar, and tea surrender requirement is 60 percent (to commercial
banks), and 100 percent of smallholders’ proceeds from tobacco auctions have to be
converted into kwacha by the RBM.

- 17 -

exchange arrangement was desirable in the current situation where Malawi is dependent on a
single export crop and related seasonal variations in monetary variables. The level of the real
exchange rate was broadly appropriate as witnessed by buoyant tobacco exports in 2004 and
private sector efforts to expand its production. The impact of the exchange rate on plans to
diversify the export base is difficult to determine at this time because of high interest rates
and other impediments to private sector growth.
E. Trade Policies
33.
The trade system is largely free of restrictions. The authorities reported that by
mid-2003 they had removed all licenses and bans imposed on imports from Zimbabwe,
except for the license on cement. The simple average tariff rate has remained at about 14
percent since 2001. The maximum rate in the four tariff bands is 30 percent.9
34.
Regional integration continues to be framed by SADC and the Common Market
for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA). Malawi is ahead of other members of
COMESA in tariff reduction and, following World Bank advice, plans to press the case for a
common external tariff that is in line with their tariff structure, instead of the 30 percent that
is proposed.
F. Ex Post Assessment of Malawi’s Performance Under Fund-Supported Programs
35.
The mission explained that future Fund involvement would be guided by the
Board’s evaluation of the EPA report. The main findings were that:
x
Performance under Fund-supported programs had generally fallen short of
expectations because of a lack of ownership, weak planning, insufficient monitoring, and lax
enforcement of regulations.
x
External resources had not always been put to good use because of limited
implementation capacity and governance issues; and
x
The periods of fastest growth in Malawi had coincided with implementation of
relatively prudent fiscal and monetary policies.
36.
The authorities agreed with these findings, but emphasized some shortcomings
in past program design (Appendix I). Specifically, while they did not dispute the need for
macroeconomic stabilization, they felt that the structural reform agenda has at times been
overloaded and program targets have been overly ambitious; they strongly concurred with the
view expressed in the EPA report that the fiscal targets set at the time of the first review of
the PRGF were, with the benefit of hindsight, too demanding, especially given the shortfall
of donor support.
9

The Fund index of trade restrictiveness is estimated at 2, unchanged from 2001.

- 18 -

37.
The authorities wondered whether their poor implementation record also
reflected a lack of ownership stemming from key reform measures often being
identified by Fund missions, rather than by the authorities themselves. Missions had not
always demonstrated sufficient flexibility in program discussions or taken into consideration
capacity constraints. They also observed that some delays in observing structural
performance criteria during September-December 2003 were due to reasons beyond their
control, but acknowledged that slippages at the highest political levels had been responsible
for frequent expenditure overruns. Structural measures under the SMP were therefore limited
to areas within the authorities’ direct control. The authorities also indicated that they would
make sure that future structural measures could be achieved before agreeing to a target
completion date.
38.
The authorities expressed concern that the draft EPA report did not sufficiently
recognize the importance of the Fund’s continued support for Malawi’s adjustment and
reform effort. They stressed the risk that any prolonged disengagement by the Fund could
undermine the stabilization effort, forcing the government to resort to inflationary finance or
costly domestic borrowing; donor support—which accounts for a significant share of the
recurrent budget—was contingent on a Fund-supported program. The staff agreed to provide
periodic assessments of Malawi’s performance to other development partners in an interim
period and work toward a new PRGF arrangement after six months of strong performance.
G. The PRSP Process
39.
The realization of the poverty reduction goals outlined in the Malawi Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (MPRSP) is jeopardized by lower-than-planned pro-poor
expenditures and GDP growth. Pro-poor spending has been crowded out of the government
budget by rising domestic interest payments and other expenditures (Box 1). It is estimated
that an annual growth rate of more than 5 percent per year is required to achieve the
Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of income poverty reduction to below 40 percent of
the population. More generally, the lack of reliable information has limited assessment of
other MDGs.
40.
Malawi’s external debt sustainability indicators deteriorated somewhat after the
HIPC Decision Point was reached in 2000 (Appendix VIII). Preliminary information
shows that debt-to-exports ratios, before any debt relief, are higher than those envisaged at
the decision point. The NPV of debt-to-exports is now estimated to peak at 327 percent in
2003, mainly because of lower than expected tobacco exports. Based on preliminary debt
sustainability analysis, external debt remains a serious concern, even after the HIPC
completion point is reached. Sustaining faster growth through prudent policies will be
critical. The alternative scenarios show that Malawi underscores the need for borrowing
under concessional terms only and the critical need to shift toward more reliance on grants.

- 19 -

H. Food Security Policies
41.
The authorities will continue to pursue actively policies to prevent food
shortages. In the near term, the government intends to purchase up to 130,000 metric tons of
maize to offset to the lower than average harvest this year (Box 3). They are also looking at
medium-term improvements in the agricultural sector, such as an efficient infrastructure for
transport, to reduce the risk of large swings in the local production and prices.
42.
The government has introduced a two-tier fertilizer subsidy. About 800,000
subsistence farmers would receive fertilizer and seed (starter pack) under a targeted input
program. Other small and some midsize farmers would receive a fertilizer subsidy that would
offset part of the recent rise in fertilizer costs.
43.
The government explained that the fertilizer subsidy was necessary in the near
term, in part because local infrastructure and market inefficiencies put the cost of
fertilizer out of the reach of many farmers. The shock to world fertilizer prices was also a
factor. The staff expressed concern about the sustainability of fertilizer subsidy, but was
reassured by government and some other experts that the burden could be reduced when
structural impediments in the fertilizer market were addressed. These would be taken up as
part of the overall review of agriculture policy.
Box 3. Interim HIPC Debt Relief
HIPC interim relief has been granted by some multilateral and official creditors. Delays in
program implementation affected the delivery of Fund’s interim assistance. However, it was
resumed after the approval of the first PRGF review and extended until September 2004.
Interim assistance approved by the AfDB at the time of the decision point was exhausted by
end-2003. Other multilateral creditors have indicated that they will start providing relief after
the completion point. Bilateral agreements covering the original interim period were signed
with all Paris Club creditors, except France. The second and third phases of the Paris Club
agreement signed in March 2001 entered into force in November 2003, extending the interim
period until end-2004. In this connection, agreements with Germany, Italy, Spain, and Sweden
are still pending. The government of Japan decided to change the way it delivers debt relief in
late 2002. Instead of providing grants in return for repayment of ODA debt, it will forgive the
debt as it becomes due. The formal agreement between the governments of Malawi and Japan
is expected to be signed soon. It has also been decided that Japan’s official commercial debt
will be rescheduled under Paris Club terms.

- 20 -

Box 4. Government Maize operations in FY 2003/04 and 2004/05
During the 2003/04 fiscal year, the National Food Reserve Agency disposed of the entire
Strategic Grain Reserve to avoid spoilage. Approximately 80,000 tons of maize were sold
domestically through ADMARC and 46,000 tons were made available to WFP to be distributed to
vulnerable parts of the population. About 52,000 tons from the SGR were exported.
The government collected about MK 1.4 billion from maize sales during 2003/04. This recovers
only a portion of the MK 7.4 billion (4¾ percent of GDP) cost of the maize operation during
FY 2002/03. The difference is mainly explained by (a) the distribution of subsidized maize (the
government was paid MK 6 per kilogram sold through ADMARC) and (b) the selling of maize at an
average price of MK 10 per kilogram to parties other than ADMARC.
For the fiscal year 2004/05, the government has committed to replenish the SGR with 60,000
tons. In addition to SGR maize, the use of which is restricted by agreement with donors, the
government has decided to purchase up to 70,000 tons of maize that would be sold through
commercial channels. It is hoped that the availability of this stock in the country will help stabilize
the domestic maize market and avoid the price spikes seen during the maize shortage in 2002.
The cost to replenish the SGR in 2004/05 is estimated at MK 1.4 billion (1/2 percent of GDP),
about one-half of which will come from the European Union. The government has committed to
spend no more than MK 1.5 billion for the commercial maize purchases, and with the assumption that
this maize will be sold for MK 17 per kilogram, the net cost to the government would be limited to
about MK 800 million.
The role of ADMARC in the domestic maize market has been reformed. The government has
made a commitment to provide no further subsidies to cover operational expenses of ADMARC.
However, this year budget includes MK 800 to cover restructuring costs and MK 400 million to
subsidize the social functions of ADMARC. The World Bank will assist with ADMARC
restructuring under the Structural Adjustment Credit that was approved in April 2004.

IV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND DATA ISSUES
44.
Economic data show serious deficiencies. In particular, the national accounts are
very likely to understate domestic investment and foreign financed development spending is
underreported. The Data Module Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes found
that, while the institutional framework for the production of macroeconomic statistics was
broadly adequate, there are shortcomings in the scope, accuracy, and reliability of data. The
authorities are making efforts to improve the quality and timeliness of the statistical data.
Malawi is a participant in the GDDS and receives technical assistance under the project for
Anglophone African countries that is sponsored by DIFD.

- 21 -

45.
Malawi has received significant technical assistance from the Fund (Appendix I).
The RBM has benefited from advice in monetary operations, payment systems, and banking
supervision, but implementation has been slow in some cases. The authorities have
requested, and the staff intends to provide, further assistance in tax administration and
expenditure management. The staff is working closely with Malawi’s other development
partners, especially in the area of expenditure management.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
46.
Since the 2002 Article IV consultation, Malawi has recovered from a severe
drought and food emergency, but now finds itself in a precarious macroeconomic
situation. Above budget spending and delays in donor assistance over much of the past two
years have left Malawi with an unsustainable level of domestic debt, high interest rates, and
eroded private sector confidence. Fortunately, there are now tentative signs that Malawi is
turning the corner.
47.
The new government has demonstrated its determination to act decisively. It met
its budgetary targets for end-June and July and is on course to meet quantitative targets for
end-September under the SMP. Parliament has approved the 2004/05 budget that is in line
with the SMP and, if fully implemented, would sharply reduce domestic borrowing.
Quantification of already adopted savings measures such as the reduction in the number of
ministries will be needed at the midterm review.
48.
The SMP focus on the implementation of sound fiscal policies is crucial for
restoring macroeconomic stability and reducing the volatility in external aid. In this
context, the staff welcomes the government's commitment to strictly limit domestic
borrowing to 2 percent of GDP in FY2004/05, while including room for priority expenditures
on wage reform and food security.
49.
An active monetary policy continues to be essential for containing emerging
inflationary pressures. The RBM will need to remain vigilant and mop up the monetary
overhang that was injected into the economy during 2003-04. The staff welcomes the RBMs
willingness to tighten policies if high rates of monetary growth persist. The market
determined exchange rate has remained stable for almost one year, but low international
reserves and the end of the tobacco marketing season could put pressure on the exchange
rate.
50.
Food security is a critical issue in Malawi, and the country is facing a possible
maize shortage this year. The 2004/05 budget contains provisions to replenish the strategic
grain reserve and purchase maize for distribution through commercial channels later in the
year. The government has also appealed to the international community for assistance to
supplement its efforts. In addition, the budget includes a fertilizer targeted to poor
households. The staff welcomes the inclusion of these initiatives in the budget as well as
plans to address medium-term agricultural sustainability.

51.
Implementation of structural reforms has recently regained momentum and will
soon begin to pay off. The long planned civil service pay restructuring is about to be
implemented, and a new, more targeted role for ADMARC is expected soon. Other
achievements, including progress in the audit of domestic arrears and passage of legislation
to strengthen financial management, will also contribute to a more efficient government.
52.
Improvements in public expenditure management are of prime importance.
They are needed, first, to ensure that the government achieves its policy objectives within the
resources available and, second, to facilitate budget monitoring by the government itself, but
also parliament and other stakeholders. The staff welcomes the government’s commitment to
steadfast implementation of the approved budget, strengthened enforcement of budget
procedures, and plans to rebuild capacity in these areas. Specific measures are included in the
SMP. Moreover, the authorities have requested technical assistance in this area.
53.
Good governance is critical to Malawi’s economic success. The recent passage of
financial management legislation and amendments to the Anti-Corruption Act is important
steps in this direction. The staff commends the government on its recent actions to address
corruption at the highest levels.
54.
Improving the lives of all Malawians remains the overriding goal for economic
policies. The challenges facing Malawi are vast; widespread income poverty, low levels of
human capital, limited domestic resources and a high incidence of HIV/AIDS.
Implementation of MPRS during the first year was below expectations with insufficient
public funding of pro-poor expenditures. The staff supports the emerging medium-term
growth strategy, in particular its emphasis on the private sector. It also agrees with the
authorities that achieving macroeconomic stability in the very near term is a prerequisite to
economic growth and poverty reduction.
55.
The conclusions reached by the EPA provide a good guideline for future Fund
engagement. Lack of ownership and capacity has had a detrimental impact on the
implementation of economic policy and structural reforms. Recent efforts by the government
are a welcome sign of change, as are plans to strengthen capacity at the Ministry of Finance.
The staff is hopeful that the SMP will provide an opportunity for the authorities to
demonstrate budget discipline and the ability to achieve targets under their economic
program. The structural objectives in the SMP have been limited as recommended by the
EPA.
56.
While risks remain substantive, staff considers the current economic program,
with focus on macroeconomic stabilization and strengthening of the expenditure control
management, to be appropriate. As recommended in the ex post assessment, a new PRGF
arrangement would depend on a period of success in meeting program targets, with the
length of the period of demonstrated commitment balancing against Malawi’s need for
balance of payments assistance. In the staff’s view, strong performance relative to the endSeptember and end-December targets in the SMP would be an appropriate balance. Other

- 23 -

considerations are approval of the EPA report’s conclusion that a new arrangement would be
beneficial and a positive assessment of the program’s future success.
57.
Timely provision of reliable economic and financial data is essential for effective
macroeconomic management and Fund surveillance. The staff welcomes recent
improvements, and urges the authorities to strengthen further the statistical base.
58.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Malawi be held within
24 months if a new PRGF arrangement is put in place, or otherwise on the standard 12-month
cycle.

Program support plus HIPC Initiative debt relief
Nominal GDP
Sources: Malawian authorities; and Fund staff projections.

1/ Includes the 2002/03 maize operation (in contrast to presentation in IMF Country Report No. 03/344).
2/ For FY 2003/04 estimates, any measure taken is included in the appropiate category.
3/ For the 2003/04 program it was expected that these savings would result from a reduction of the travel budget, nonfilling of vacancies, a freeze
on promotions, the postponement of new domestically financed development expenditure, and additional postponement of discretionary outlays.
4/ Defined as overall balance plus statistical discrepancy, less grants, less revenue from maize, plus total interest,
plus expenditures for maize, plus foreign-financed development expenditures.

APPENDIX I

Malawi: Ex Post Assessment of Longer-Term
Programme Engagement
Authorities’ Response
Introduction
The Malawian authorities understand that the ex post assessment has been prepared by the
International Monetary Fund against a background of Malawi’s persistent failure to
implement not only Fund-supported programmes but also its inability to observe budgetary
limits. As a matter of fact, the need to choose a government that would instill fiscal discipline
became a major issue of the recently-held general election. In consequence, the new
administration identified key institutional and procedural obstacles to sound fiscal
management and has taken measures of addressing them. For example, the fact that for the
past ten years the government had a bloated cabinet of 49 ministers made it difficult for
government to prioritize activities. Its activities and development programmes were
consistently larger than the available resources. In consequence, extra-budgetary
expenditures became routine. Furthermore, the fact that the government operated from two
locations, at the capital in Lilongwe and in Blantyre where the President resided, meant that a
number of activities and events were duplicated. Thus, each minister and senior official had
two residences, offices etc. The huge travel budget reflected daily commuting between the
two cities.
Almost immediately on his inauguration, the new President, Dr. Bingu wa Mutharika,
decided to relocate the presidency in the capital city of Lilongwe. He also reduced the cabinet
from 49 ministers to 20. These two policy decisions have had an immediate impact not only
on the budget, but also on the efficiency of the government and the mind set of senior
officers on the need to economize resources.
Over and above these decisions, some important obstacles to the implementation of the
budgetary process have been identified and addressed. The first relates to issues of
governance. Although during the past 10 years, governance surveillance institutions such as
the Anti-Corruption Bureau, the office of the Director of Public Prosecution, and the
Auditor-General’s office were allowed to operate, hardly any prosecutions and convictions of
senior officials occurred. However, within the three months of the new government’s
assumption of office, a number of high profile cases are being held in the courts and in one or
two cases convictions have been sustained. This is due to the changes of top level personnel
of the institutions and the augmentation of their resources. It is therefore believed that
Malawi has now joined a group of African countries that are vigorously eradicating
corruption and which are establishing good economic governance.
The government is also reviewing its procurement system. During the last 10 years, in the
name of the empowerment of Malawians, a culture emerged whereby rules and regulations
pertaining to procurement were relaxed in order to allow middle-men to participate in the
procurement of goods and services for the government and parastatals. This became one of

- 34 -

APPENDIX I

the main causes of corruption such as the famous “education scam.” The government has
halted this policy and has reestablished rules and regulations that allow checks and balances
to prevail.
Furthermore, the system whereby ministries were unable to plan on the basis of budgetary
allocations and routinely ignored the budgetary framework, has been stopped. Henceforth,
ministries are required to work strictly within the budgetary limits and extra-budgetary
expenditures have been sharply constrained. As a result, the sanctity of the budget is being
strongly enforced as required by the Public Finance Management Act.
For the past five months, these measures have reestablished fiscal discipline and the
government was able to observe its fiscal and financial targets, by wide margins in most
cases. Thus, it is clear that Malawi has resumed the fiscal discipline that characterized it in
the 1970s when it was taunted as one of the best managed economies. It is felt that if the
large domestic stock of debt that is dominated by short-term Treasury Bills can be resolved
and interest rates were to be lowered, the resulting reduced interest bill of the budget should
enable the country to continue with the needed fiscal consolidation and discipline that is
being reestablished.
Therefore, in reading the ex-post assessment, it would be fair to bear in mind that the new
administration agrees with criticisms that are being leveled, and that long before views of the
Fund’s ex-post assessment team were known, the Malawi government had already identified
the fiscal weaknesses and on its own took measures to address the factors that propelled a
culture of fiscal indiscipline. It would also be fair to think of ways that would help the
government to sustain the measures that it has taken. In particular, it would be helpful if the
Fund were to decide as quickly as possible to resume a PRGF programme after the
establishment of the needed track record. The PRGF would anchor the support of the donor
community in order that the authorities could be helped to reduce and restructure the
domestic debt that has resulted from the past fiscal indiscipline. A prolonged period without
the support of the Fund, World Bank and bilateral donors is considered highly unsustainable.
General observations

On the whole, the document ascribes a neutral role to the IMF. It would be fairer that where
slippages occurred the responsibility should fall on both, the IMF staff and the authorities.
We believe that in certain cases, the staff have demonstrated policy inflexibility, suggesting
that in a number of instances, staff positions are defined by their Management in Washington
before the mission teams arrive in the country. Consequently, it is sometimes not possible to
openly discuss certain positions and have them altered.
In addition, the high turnover of mission chiefs over the review period exacerbated the
situation. Every time there was a change of a mission chief, we lost some of the policy
foundations that were set by a predecessor. This was particularly true with regards to interest
rate policy and projections of the interest bill of the budget.

- 35 -

APPENDIX I

Other observations
1.
Performance under the PRGF supported programme was poor (Paragraph 13).
Besides, the fiscal laxity that prevailed is a major cause of poor fiscal performance related to
the vagaries of donor support that anchored some essential expenditures. The “off and on”
donor support led to a large build up of domestic debt and budgetary interest bills.
Additionally, during the 2002/2003, maize operations also became a destabilizing factor.
Government financed emergency maize operations in the second half of 2002 on the
understanding that, as promised, the World Bank and donors would augment central bank
foreign exchange reserves expeditiously by providing budget support to the Government.
While the IMF responded with speed to the emergency situation, the World Bank responded
with considerable delays and some donors opted to finance maize imports directly. The
consequence of this development was an unplanned depletion of the central bank’s foreign
exchange reserves, putting the exchange rate under immense pressure. Government resorted
to domestic borrowing to finance these imports, also creating pressure on interest rates.
2.
Monopolies and oligopolies continue to dominate many economic activities,
including banking, cement, petroleum, retailing, tobacco auctioning, and transportation
(Paragraph 24). While it is true that the National Bank of Malawi and Stanbic still
command almost two thirds of the market, smaller banks such as First Merchant Bank and
INDE Bank continue to challenge their dominance. In fact, the number of banks has
increased from three to eleven over the span of just ten years.
3.
Malawi: Corruption and Governance (Box 3). As noted above, while it is true that
corruption and governance cases grew during the past ten years, issues of governance and
corruption are now being addressed through appropriate legislation and institutions, and
President Bingu wa Mutharika has adopted a “zero tolerance” stance on corruption. Within a
short time, high profile cases are being held in courts of law and already, some “high” people
have been convicted.
4.
Progress on structural reforms has also been uneven (Paragraph 41).
This is true but the report omits to inform that in some cases the implementation of structural
measures became problematic because the sequencing of reforms was poorly planned. For
example, in an effort to control fiscal deficits in the 1980s, subsidies on agricultural inputs
were removed without assessing the impact on food security. The cost of emergency maize
imports of the 1990’s and more recently in 2002 was much higher than the cost of subsidies
to the budget. As the EPA report rightly observes, “... elimination of the fertilizer subsidy
placed the use of fertilizers beyond the reach of many subsistence farmers”. In addition,
parastatal reforms were hastily done without the full support of the private sector, resulting in
increased unemployment and general insecurity.
5.
Malawi’s experience under its Fund-supported programme raises broad issues
of programme objectives, programme design, conditionality, and ownership
(Paragraph 43). While the Government of Malawi embraces the objectives of the
programme, that is, low interest rates, a stable exchange rate, low inflation, and a growing

- 36 -

APPENDIX I

economy, we believe programme targets, particularly, structural conditionalities have been
too ambitious, at times, and ignored capacity constraints and other realities. For example, the
recent Fund supported programme assumed a zero-borrowing target, while at the same time
failing to recognize the impact of drought during the programme period and the suspension
of donor aid.
6.
Lack of ownership, including and especially at the highest political levels of the
country, has resulted in repeated policy slippages, failures to deliver upon agreed
policies, and a poor track record (Paragraph 57). The Government’s view is that this
conclusion is inappropriate as slippages on fiscal accounts were largely due to higher than
anticipated outlays on domestic debt services. This debt was partly a result of non-fulfillment
of donor commitments to finance the budget and emergency maize imports. In addition, four
out of seven structural conditions were missed because the World Bank failed to act on time.
7.
Ultimately, Malawi’s experience with Fund-supported programmes raises issues
of selectivity more than of programme design or of conditionality (Paragraph 58). The
linking of donor support to Fund-supported programmes has inevitably meant that the Fund
has taken the center stage in programme design for recipient countries including Malawi.
This means, therefore, that the scope for independent policy design (domestic policy making)
and implementation in these countries has been virtually eliminated, as donors will only
respond to the guidance provided by the Fund. This has created dependence on the Fund by
recipient countries including Malawi.
Against this background, prolonged disengagement with the Fund is not a viable option for
Malawi. Donors will not provide financial support to this country outside a framework of a
formal Fund-supported programme. The consequences of the absence of such a framework is
obvious, that is, unsustainable fiscal deficits, high interest rates, high inflation, and economic
stagnation. The Authorities feel that this paragraph raises a lot of issues that can be
misunderstood. With respect to programmes selectivity, Malawi is not worse off than a
number of countries before Fund programmes improved their performance. Through the
implementation of Fund supported programmes, such countries as Benin, Ghana, Tanzania,
and Uganda, have had their economic programmes transformed through their implementation
of Fund supported programmes.
8.
Further programme engagement by the Fund, if any, should be carefully phased
to allow the authorities to build a track record while not over-burdening
implementation capacity (Paragraph 63). The need for a Fund-supported programme in
Malawi cannot be over emphasized. In the same vein, a long Staff-Monitored Programme
(SMP) of one year is tantamount to disengagement since for that period no donor funds will
be disbursed. Thus, Government strongly believes that the Gatekeeper role (signaling) of the
IMF makes it difficult for Government to consider a long-term disengagement as doing so
would leave the country without donor assistance, the very essence of a Fund programme.
9.
Therefore, in the view of the ex-post assessment team, prior to any formal
programme engagement, a credible and convincing track record of sustained policy

- 37 -

APPENDIX I

implementation under a SMP is required, including sufficient time to test commitment
and to verify compliance with targets, without being unduly protracted (Paragraph 63).
No time frame is suggested for the staff monitored programme in this paper. As alluded to
above, a year would be too long, as this country needs donor resources in order to establish a
credible track record. This is because future disbursements by our development partners are
dependent on engagement with the IMF. In the circumstances, it is doubtful whether a
desirable track record could be established over a 12-month period during which Malawi
does not receive budget support. A SMP of 4-6 months would be more realistic.
CONCLUSION

The Malawi economy is still fragile and vulnerable to shocks. In this regard, programme
disengagement or a longer SMP will have a destabilizing effect on the economy. The
Government, therefore, strongly believes that this is not a viable option. Moreover, the
signaling role that the IMF has assumed makes it imperative to have a programme.

that was approved on December 21, 2000 and is scheduled to expire on December 20, 2004. An
offsite safeguards assessment of the RBM was completed in July 2001. A follow-up on-site
safeguards assessment was conducted in May 2003. The latter concluded that the RBM had made
progress in remedying vulnerabilities, and it proposed steps to further strengthen the RBM’s
operations and safeguards, particularly in the areas of external audits, financial reporting, and
internal controls.

APPENDIX III

Malawi: Relations with the World Bank Group
Contact person: Ms. Yisgedullish Amde, Tel. 202 473 2203
A. World Bank Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
2.
The Malawi CAS was approved by the Bank’s board on May 14, 2003. The gray
cover report (Report # 25906 MAI) outlined the current social, economic, and political
situation in Malawi and proposed strategies for the next three years (FY04-06), based on the
lessons learned from the previous strategies. This strategy presents a transitional program
that aims to help the Government to address the urgent development issues as it is clear that
business-as-usual strategy will not achieve the required results.
3.
The program is organized under three pillars: i) strengthening economic management,
ii) establishing a platform for growth; and iii) improving service delivery and strengthening
the safety net. Three ongoing projects (Financial Management Transparency and
Accountability; Privatization and Utility Reform; and Global Development and Learning
Network), and a Structural Adjustment Credit (Fiscal Management and Accelerating Growth
Project) will assist in attaining the objectives under pillar one. To support the objectives of
pillar two, the on-going Community Based Land Reform Project, and two pipeline projects
(Infrastructure Services Project, and Agriculture Project) are under the base case. Finally,
core Bank interventions under pillar three include the HIV/AIDS (MAP) project; Third
Malawi Social Action Fund Project; Secondary Education Project, and the Emergency
Drought Relief Project, in addition to two sectoral projects under preparation in the area of
education and health even in a low case.
B. Financial Relations with the World Bank Group
4.
The World Bank has been active in Malawi since 1966. The World Bank Executive
Board has since approved 94 IDA credits, 4 IDA grants, and 10 IBRD loans. Total lending to
Malawi from the World Bank as of August 2004 is US$2,389.6 million, of which
US$2,086.0 million has been disbursed. Currently there are twelve active projects in Malawi
with a net commitment of US$381.6 million, and an undisbursed balance of US$262 million
(as of August 29, 2004). Sectoral breakdown is as follows: Rural at 21 percent, Transport at 8
percent, Public and Private Sector Development and Finance at 33 percent, and Social
Sectors at 39 percent.
5.
IFC has five investments in Malawi, in capital markets, agribusiness, health, timber,
and tourism, totaling a meager US$2.02 million (US$0.85 million in loans and US$1.16
million in equity). To address the issue of poor access to finance for SMEs, APDF in
association with a regional organization, COMESA Bankers Association, has provided
training for local bankers from Malawi as well as from other SADDCC countries. Future
focus will be on expanded IFC assistance for the private sector, especially in areas of

- 42 -

APPENDIX III

manufacturing, mining and tourism that Malawi has indicated as its target areas to reduce its
dependence on agriculture.
C. Areas in Which the Bank Leads
Education and health
6.
The Multi-Sectoral AIDS Project (US$35 million in grants) was approved in FY04.
The project will support efforts by the Government of Malawi to reduce HIV transmission
and mitigate the impact of the disease throughout Malawian society, thus also fighting the
poverty that AIDS brings to families and societies. A major study of Malawi’s HIV/AIDS
problem revealed 10 important constraints that the project, beginning in 2004 and running
through 2008, will address through a range of activities, from capacity building in public,
private, and civil society organizations to educational work for prevention, and increased
support for AIDS orphans. Many of Malawi’s other development partners are also active in
this effort, pooling their funds to support this critical effort.
7.
In addition, a Health Sector Project, and Education Sector Support Project are under
preparation to be presented to the Board in FY05. A Secondary Education project (US$48
million) which was approved in FY98, is slated to close in December 2004.
Social protection and community development
8.
MASAF is a long-term, wide-ranging poverty-reduction project that supports
decentralization and community capacity building. The project aims to empower individuals,
households, communities, and their development partners in the implementation of measures,
which can assist them in, better managing risks associated with health, education, sanitation,
water, transportation, energy and food insecurity, and to provide support to the critically
vulnerable through a variety of sustainable interventions. The current Project, MASAF III
(US$60 million, of which US$27 million is in the form of an IDA grant) was approved in
FY03. The project encourages communities to develop social safety nets for their most
vulnerable members (such as skills training for AIDS orphans), facilitates delivery of the
most needed social services, and stimulates communities to save and invest.
Infrastructure
9.
The Road Maintenance Project (US$30 million) was approved in FY99 to bring about
sustainable improvements in the quality of Malawi's road infrastructure which will help
economic growth and diversify the economy by reducing transport costs and improving
access by: (a) strengthening and restructuring of the road sector institutional framework;
(b) reform of road sector; and (c) addressing the backlog of road maintenance and
rehabilitation. In the pipeline (FY05), is also an Integrated Infrastructure Services Project to
primarily support rural energy, and transport needs.

- 43 -

APPENDIX III

Privatization
10.
Parastatal reform continues to be an urgent need in Malawi. In the past two years,
progress has been made in several privatizations with Bank assistance through the
Privatization and Utility Reform Project (PURP, US$28.9 million, approved in FY00). The
PURP aims to improve quality of and access to economic and physical infrastructure, notably
telecommunications, water, and power sectors, by promoting greater private-sector
involvement. The Government’s Privatization Commission identified some 100 public
enterprises that should be privatized; the project aims to support the Commission’s
divestiture work through technical assistance and support for strengthening existing public
enterprises, such as the postal service.
Agriculture
11.
A Community based Rural Land Development Project (US$27 million) was approved
by the Board in April 2004. Based on positive community-level experience gained in the
MASAF projects, and in partnership with the Government and UK’s Development agency,
DFID, this project will involve the acquisition of idle land and their transfer to small farmers,
thus enabling them to be self-sufficient in food and, hopefully, grow surpluses for
commercial sale. It is urgent that Malawi move toward a more equitable distribution of land
that will provide food security for smallholders. The new Structural Adjustment Credit,
FIMAG, also supports agricultural policy reforms (see further details in paragraph 19 below).
12.
An Irrigation, Rural Livelihoods and Agriculture project is under preparation at
present (for FY06), to complement other activities on the ground. The main objective of the
project is to support the implementation of the GoM National Irrigation Development Policy
and Strategy; to support the implementation of the Government’s new Extension Strategy;
and to improve market access and efficiency of smallholders.
Environment
13.
Direct Bank involvement in the environment sector is currently limited to the Mulanje
Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project (US$7 million), which was approved in FY01.
The Project aims to raise awareness of the need for conservation, strengthen the capacity of
the Forest Department and local communities to carry out conservation measures, and
encourage more participation by local communities in managing the forest reserve. However,
especially within the framework of MASAF, environmentally-sound community
development initiatives are promoted and community resource management projects are
funded.
Knowledge sharing
14.
A Global Distance Learning Network Project (US$4 million) was approved in March
2004. Working in conjunction with the Malawi Institute of Management, the Bank Group
plans to finance the creation of a Development Learning Center (DLC) that will provide

- 44 -

APPENDIX III

training in key fields to Malawian civil servants, including, for example, technical, policy
development, and management
Poverty monitoring
15.
The Bank is supporting the National Statistical Office with one aspect of the poverty
monitoring tasks identified in the PRSP as requiring technical assistance. Through the PRSP
Trust Fund, the Bank is assisting the government in conducting the Second Integrated
Household Survey, including design, collection, processing, and dissemination of data
covering not only household characteristics, but also community level indicators. A Poverty
Assessment is planned for FY06, and provides an in-depth analysis of the new household
data.
D. Areas Where the Bank and the Fund Share the Lead
Poverty reduction strategy
16.
The Government of Malawi finalized its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) in
April 2002. A joint IDA-IMF staff assessment was presented to the Boards of IMF and the
Bank on July 19, 2002 and the strategy was endorsed by the Boards of the IMF and the
World Bank on August 5, 2002 and August 29, 2002, respectively. The IMF and the Bank
staff maintained collaborative relationship in supporting the government in the process. The
Malawi PRSP is considered by the Bank and the IMF as highly participatory (involving all
stake holders), having an appropriate macroeconomic framework including a financing plan
with a balanced approach to public policy, and having laid out detailed action plan. In
October 2003, staffs of the World Bank and the IMF completed a Joint Staff Assessment
(JSA) of the first Malawi PRSP Annual Review.
Debt sustainability and Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Initiative
17.
Staff of the IMF and the Bank prepared “Malawi: Decision Point Document for the
Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative” that was presented to the
Board on December 8, 2000. The report recommended a reduction of US$331 million in Net
Present Value (NPV) terms with respect to the debt owed by Malawi to IDA based on a
proportional burden sharing approach accounting for 51 percent of total public debt, (69
percent of total multilateral debt). This is equivalent to 44 percent of outstanding World Bank
group debt in NPV terms at the end of December 1999.
18.
The staffs of the IMF and the Bank are currently working jointly on the update of the
HIPC Activity Action Plan (AAP) report for Malawi.
Budgetary planning, revenues administration, and public expenditure reforms
19.
Bank’s assistance in improvement in public expenditure management has been
channeled mainly via its most recent structural adjustment credit. The last adjustment
operation, FRDP III, was approved in FY00 and is fully disbursed; it supported budgetary

- 45 -

APPENDIX III

reforms, liberalization of petroleum pricing and marketing, telecommunications and financial
sectors, and creation of an affordable social safety net. The FRDP III also comprised a
Technical Assistance parallel project, which closed in June 2004.
20.
The Fiscal Management and Accelerating Growth (FIMAG, US$50 million)
structural adjustment credit was approved by the Board, and the first tranche of US$25
million was released in September 2004. The FIMAG program focuses on four areas:
(i) strengthening public expenditure management, (ii) privatizing state-owned enterprises,
(iii) small-holder agriculture and land reform, and (iv) HIV/AIDS. All first tranche
conditions (for Board presentation) have been met.
21.
The Financial Management, Transparency and Accountability Project (FIMTAP,
US$24 million, FY03) is also assisting the Government with improving financial
management systems and increase their transparency. The main objectives are to build the
capacity of Malawi’s public servants in the areas of accounting, auditing, and other areas of
managing public finance, and to introduce the use of the IFMIS computerized financial
management system.
Civil service and wage reform
22.
The World Bank has financed a study to review civil service and wage policy issues
and propose a road map for reform. The Government has agreed to the road map, and has
committed to begin implementation of the recommendations of the study in early 2004.
These include: streamlining the system of allowances; consolidating them in the base for
personal income tax; rationalizing salary grades; and moving towards a unified salary
structure. These reforms are also supported under the proposed IMF program.
Humanitarian assistance
23.
The Bank approved an Emergency Drought Recovery Credit (EDRC, US$50 million,
of which US$21 million is in the form of an IDA grant) in FY03, with the following
objectives: a) to allow government to maintain key commitments to economic priorities and
investments; b) to help restore the productive capability of the populations; and, c) to support
longer term disaster management by the government. The Board of the IMF also approved an
Emergency Credit (US$23 million) to Malawi in September 2002, to support food imports.
E. Areas in Which the Fund Leads
Macroeconomic stability, fiscal policy, and monetary policy
24.
Malawi is confronted with a number of macroeconomic challenges, including a
history of repeated fiscal slippages and unpredictable monetary policies, a rapidly rising level
of domestic debt, and a persistently high level of real interest rates. The Fund will work with
the authorities to master these challenges, both through financial support and technical
assistance, to make steady progress.

- 46 -

APPENDIX IV

MALAWI: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Malawi’s economic statistics show serious deficiencies, which have affected program
monitoring. A draft Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes, November 2003,
found that, while the legal and institutional framework for the production of macroeconomic
statistics was broadly adequate, there are shortcomings in the scope, accuracy, and reliability
of data. There is a need for strengthening the provisions of the Statistic Act to define the
responsibility of the Ministry of Finance for the compilation of government finance statistics
and of the Reserve Bank of Malawi in the compilation of monetary statistics. The authorities
are making efforts to improve the quality and timeliness of the statistical data. Malawi is a
participant in the GDDS and receives technical assistance under the project for Anglophone
African countries that is sponsored by DFID.
F. Real Sector
2.
Real sector statistics covering the national accounts, prices, and trade statistics need
substantial improvements. Only a limited set of source data is available, and the quality and
timeliness of the data need to be improved. Additional resources are needed by The National
Statistics Office (NSO) to meet, in particular, the required quality standard of national
accounts.
National accounts
3.
The National Statistics Office has the responsibility for compiling the national
accounts data. However, while the final estimates are comprehensive,10 the source data
underpinning these estimates are inadequate. There are gaps, especially for medium- and
small-scale establishments, and informal activities that affect the coverage of the national
accounts. The statistical techniques used for national accounts compilation are deficient, and
processes to assess and validate source, intermediate and final data are generally limited. The
national accounts are published in the Statistical Yearbook and Quarterly Statistical Bulletin
with a significant time lag.
Prices
4.
A consumer price index (CPI) is available on a timely basis. The CPI index is based
on the 1997/98 household survey results, and data are collected on a monthly basis by
regional price collectors. The effectiveness of the index could be improved by applying
systematic, comprehensive, and consistent approaches to the quality adjustment of product
prices. There is also a need to evaluate trends in the consumer prices against other relevant
economic statistics, such as import and export prices, and commodity prices.
10

Covering GDP from the production side at constant prices, GDP by expenditure at current
prices, gross national income and its components, national disposable income and use of
disposable income, and the capital finance account.

- 47 -

APPENDIX IV

Trade
5.
Preliminary estimates of trade are now available with a lag of two to three months.
Trade data are received electronically from six major ports. The adjustment of imports from
c.i.f. to f.o.b. prices is not appropriate and data reconciliation with bordering countries is
lacking.
G. Government Finance
6.
Malawi is not reporting government finance data for inclusion in the Government
Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) or in International Financial Statistics (IFS).
7.
Malawi reports some fiscal data on a cash basis to AFR. Although administrative
records are kept on a manual basis, the systems are designed to provide adequate
information. However, there are serious quality problems, including data inconsistencies, that
complicate program monitoring:
x

While tax revenue data are received in a timely fashion, it is not always
possible to reconcile them with deposits made into the MG Account No. 1.

x

Nontax revenue collected by line ministries is not properly accounted for in
the fiscal reports prepared by the Ministry of Finance. It also includes capital
revenue.

x

Data on recurrent expenditure suffer from serious shortcomings partly
related to insufficient bank reconciliation at the level of line ministries
(between spending records and financing information). The fiscal reports
prepared by the Ministry of Finance show spending based on funding data
(from the Credit Ceiling Authority). Line ministries subsequently submit
spending reports to the Ministry of Finance based on recorded expenditure.
There are at times sizable discrepancies between these two sources of data for
both wages and other recurrent transactions—to some extent reflecting the
widespread practice of reallocation across budget lines.

x

Expenditure on domestically-financed development expenditure is based on
funding released to line ministries, and data on externally funded expenditure
is based on reported project grants and loans. Owing to differences in timing
and financing modalities (e.g., some donors require prefinancing of
expenditure before reimbursement), there are substantial differences between
the flow of expenditure and corresponding financing data. Thus, there are
substantial errors in the reporting of expenditure. Also, many donor projects
are still not incorporated in the budget, and hence the corresponding
expenditure is not at all captured in reports. Some externally funded
development expenditures likely are of recurrent nature, and thus the reporting
of capital expenditure is erroneous.

- 48 -

APPENDIX IV

x

Data on expenditure arrears are likely incomplete, as reporting from the
Commitment Control System appears to be only partial, and ministry level
data are not consistent from report to report. Previously unknown arrears have
repeatedly been cleared through the “special activities” vote, thus calling into
question the accuracy of arrears data as well as these data on clearances. [A
recent audit of domestic arrears in [8] ministries and agencies has uncovered
sizable arrears that were not previously reported.]

x

The budget classification and chart of accounts may be adequate for some
administrative, economic, functional and program classifications. An outputoriented activities-based budget classification (ABB) is used for the
presentation of the budget. However, pro-poor expenditures that are
protected in line with the PRSP are only identified in the ABB classification.
As no bridge table exists that maps the ABB classification into the program
classification used for expenditure reporting and accounting, pro-poor
expenditures cannot be monitored.

x

Financing estimates are based on monetary and debt data, rather than on
government records of financing. Reporting on treasury bills directly issued to
the RBM at times has been slow.

25.
The authorities have received significant technical assistance from the Fund and other
donors to strengthen expenditure monitoring and reporting, accounting, and statistical
reporting, but results have not been adequate. The new government has pledged to strengthen
public financial management and fiscal reporting, and renewed efforts are being made to
establish a work plan, including effectively utilizing donor technical assistance.
H. Monetary Accounts
26.
The Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM) reports monetary and financial statistics (MFS)
to STA on a regular basis. The MFS reported are generally in line with the Fund’s data
needs. The MFS mission that took place in April - May 2004 noted that significant progress
was achieved in implementing the recommendations made by the MFS mission conducted in
August - September 2002. One of most notable achievements was the improved coverage of
monthly monetary survey that now accounts for more than 90 percent of the banking sector.
On the other hand, the mission also noted that some important recommendation were yet to
be implemented. The mission recommended that improvements be implemented in several
areas, such as the institutional coverage of the financial corporations, sectorization of the
domestic economy, and classification of financial instruments to ensure that the MFS of the
RBM adhere fully to the methodology of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual.
27.
Concurrently, the mission completed the development of an integrated database that
will be used by the RBM, STA, and AFR for publication and operational needs. The mission
also discussed the standardized forms (SRF) that will be adopted in the near future by all

- 49 -

APPENDIX IV

countries for reporting monetary data to STA. The RBM is examining the SRF with a view
to reporting monetary data to the IMF using the SRF as soon as feasible.
I. Balance of Payments
28.
Concepts and definitions used to compile the balance of payments statistics are in
broad conformity with the guidelines presented in BPM4. Progress has been made in the
transition to the methodology of BPM5. The NSO has provided these data to the IMF’s
Statistics Department for publication in the 2003 Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook.
Mainly as a result of the liberalization of exchange controls, the compilation of data relies on
balance of payments surveys as the major available source of information for major
components in the balance of payments, such as services, direct investment flows, and other
financial transactions of the private sector. Data from primary sources (surveys and/or ITRS
reports) are supplemented with information from secondary data sources, such as foreign
trade statistics collected by the MRA through customs declarations, debt statistics from the
MOF, and net foreign assets from the RBM. Organizational Measures
29.
The NSO has expanded its Lilongwe office with a view to relocating some sections
from Zomba.
30.
Statistics produced by various units of the government have often differed and are
difficult to reconcile. Some progress has, however, been made in generating more consistent
data. For instance, the NSO and the National Economic Council (NEC) now harmonize their
national accounts figures and, in fact, present a common set of figures. Similarly, the RBM
and the Ministry of Finance and Planning now have meetings where government debt and
related statistics are harmonized. These efforts need to be sustained and intensified.

MALAWI: HIPC COMPLETION POINT TRIGGERS UPDATE –

APPENDIX VI

September 200411

Malawi reached the decision point in December 2000. The total amount of debt relief
assistance to Malawi is equivalent to around US$1.0 billion in nominal terms (US$643
million in NPV terms). Debt relief will be delivered between January 2001 and December
2020 by providing 55 percent relief on annual debt service due.
IDA is the largest creditor to Malawi, accounting for 51 percent of the entire external debt
(and 69 percent of multilateral debt). IDA approved debt relief for US$588 million in
nominal terms (US$331 million in NPV terms), equivalent to US$29 million of debt relief on
average per year.
The debt relief will become irrevocable only after Malawi reaches the completion point.
Prior to that time, Malawi is receiving interim relief, which cannot exceed one third of the
total assistance to be provided by IDA (in NPV terms).
The completion point could be reached in late 2005 if Malawi achieves:
(i)

Satisfactory macroeconomic performance (as demonstrated by a minimum sixmonth track record under a new PRGF).

(ii)

One-year satisfactory MPRSP implementation: The full MPRSP was completed in
April 2002 (and endorsed by the Boards in August 2002). The first Annual Progress
Report approved by the Boards in October 2003 indicates that MPRSP implementation
has been limited. The second APR is expected in the Fall 2004. Thus satisfactory oneyear implementation of PRSP could be met at the earliest in Fall 2004.

Satisfactory implementation of the outstanding completion point triggers:
(Note: substantial progress has been achieved – see next page for triggers already met)

APPENDIX VII

Malawi: External Debt Sustainability Analysis
The objective of this appendix is to assess Malawi’s external debt dynamics in the medium
term. This analysis (DSA) is based on the new proposed framework for external debt
sustainability in low income countries13.
Malawi’s stock of external debt at end-1999 was estimated at US$2,608 millions in nominal
terms, equivalent to 144 percent of GDP. At end-2003, the debt has reached 166 percent of
GDP, in line with the expectations of new borrowing at the time of the HIPC decision point.
Malawi’s largest creditors continue to be multilateral institutions and Japan.
The main assumptions underlying the baseline scenario are:
x

A recovery in the real GDP growth in the immediate future, rising to 6 percent per year
by 2010 and stabilizing at 5.5 percent thereafter.

x

Export volumes are expected to grow at a rate of about 3.5 percent over 2005-10 and 4
percent from there onward. Tobacco will continue to be the main export product (about
60 percent of total exports), but this share will be slowly reduced to 50 percent by 2023
as a result of lower export volume growth and smaller price increases (about 2 percent
per year). The projections envisage some effort to promote non-traditional exports.
Import volumes are projected to grow at a rate of about 3.5 percent per year.

x

Foreign direct investment is envisaged to average US$35 million during 2005-10 and
increase to US$55 million during 2011-20.

x

Official grants are expected to remain at about US$90 million during 2005-10 and to
jump to about US$125 million during 2011-20. The residual financing gaps will be
covered by concessional loans, resulting in high new borrowing. In this connection, loan
disbursements will have to increase from an average of about US$120 million during
1999-2004 to US$200 million during 2005-09 and to US$260 during the next decade.

x

Malawi is assumed to reach the HIPC completion point at end-2005.

13

This framework differs from the one applied for HIPC countries, in particular regarding
the discount rates and the use of current exports and not three-year average. A full DSA on a
loan-by-loan basis will be carried out at the time of the HIPC completion point.

- 57 -

APPENDIX VII

Results based on preliminary borrowing data show that:
x

Under the baseline scenario, the nominal public debt relative to GDP peaks in 2003 at
166 percent of GDP and falls after reaching the HIPC completion point. By 2023 the
nominal debt-to GDP would be less than half the level reached at end-2003. However, in
terms of net present value (NPV) of debt-to-export ratio (current-year exports) shows that
the external debt will continue to be a problem. The NPV of debt to exports will go down
from 514 percent in 2003 to 325 percent in 2023 because of the high reliance on foreign
loans.

x

The alternative scenarios reveal that Malawi’s external debt indicators are significantly
sensitive to the level of concessionality of new borrowing and that if key macroeconomic
variables remain at their historical averages, the NPV of debt-to-exports will go back to
the levels experienced in 2003, even after reaching the completion point.

x

The bound tests reveal that an “export shock” (bound test B2) will result in a substantial
increase in the NPV of debt-to-export ratio (from 429 percent to 714 percent) and in the
debt service ratio (from 13 percent to 33 percent) in 2005.

Conclusions:
x

The external debt sustainability remains a serious concern, even after reaching HIPC
completion point. Unless the authorities make a serious effort to maintain effective
macroeconomic policy implementation, the external debt indicators will significantly
deteriorate. Sustaining faster growth policies would be key to Malawi’s debt
sustainability. Intensification of structural reforms to increase export is vital, in particular
to reduce Malawi’s dependence on tobacco exports.

x

The alternative scenarios show that Malawi’s government should follow a prudent
borrowing strategy, borrowing under high concessional terms only and should increase
its reliance on grants.

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with Malawi and Discusses
Ex Post Assessment of Performance Under Fund-Supported Programs
On October 29, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Malawi.1
Background
Malawi benefited from a modest economic recovery in 2002 and 2003. Overall inflation
decreased sharply from 40 percent in 2000 to less than 10 percent in 2003. However, higherthan-programmed budget deficits have led to a doubling of domestic debt since June 2002.
Real GDP grew by an annual average of 3 percent in 2002–03. Agricultural production
rebounded from the drought in 2001, but the 2004 harvest was affected by a drought and
President wa Mutharika has appealed for humanitarian assistance to alleviate the crisis.
Macroeconomic imbalances, high interest rates, and infrastructure constraints have adversely
affected the non-agricultural economy. Manufacturing—mainly agro-processing activities—and
distribution (together one-third of GDP) stagnated in 2002–03 and industrial activity remains at a
very low level.
Fiscal policy slippages over much of the 2002–04 period have resulted in a unsustainable
domestic debt situation and a high level of public expenditures. Largely unbudgeted expenditure
for maize imports of 3.9 percent of GDP were a major factor in 2002/03, while 2003/04 was
impacted by above budget spending in a number of non-pro-poor expenditure areas.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2Compounded by shortfalls in external financing and high interest rates, this led to a large
increase in domestic borrowing.
Malawi’s external current account deficit (excluding grants) mirrored changes in the government
balance and the emergency maize imports in 2002. The 2002 current account deficit of
25 percent of GDP—about one-half of which was related to maize imports—was financed
through a drawdown in official reserves and external assistance. The real effective exchange
rate depreciated in 2002/03 as changes in the nominal exchange rate outpaced inflation, while
the nominal kwacha-U.S. dollar exchange rate has remained stable after a 20 percent
depreciation in August 2003.
Progress in implementing structural reforms was mixed. Several parastatal corporations were
privatized and reforms have been implemented in the telecommunication, electricity, and water
sectors. ADMARC’s monopoly in the marketing of maize has been abolished and some
businesses sold off. Plans for the commercialization of some the remaining ADMARC
operations are under way. The Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) has been strengthened through
an amendment to the Corrupt Practices Act that would increase transparency. The new
administration has declared a policy of zero tolerance on corruption and has already taken
steps to enforce this policy.
The Reserve Bank of Malawi has maintained high nominal interest rates. However, owing to
higher-than-programmed government spending, pressures on nonfood inflation reemerged in
the first half of 2004.
Malawi’s performance under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement,
approved in December 2000, was disappointing. The authorities requested Fund staff to monitor
their economic program to establish a track record that could lead to a new PRGF arrangement.
The 2004/05 budget limits the domestic borrowing to 2 percent of GDP, down from 12 percent
in 2002/03 and 8 percent in 2003/04. The budget aims at reducing expenditures across
government while accommodating priority spending in areas such as food security and wage
reform. Monetary policy will aim to achieve 10 percent inflation by the end of 2005 and structural
reforms will focus on financial management. Key risks are budget implementation and inflation.
As part of the Article IV consultation, an assessment of the IMF’s Longer-Term Program
Engagement in Malawi was prepared by the staff and discussed with the authorities.2 The
assessment concludes that under the last two arrangements covering 1995–2003, performance
has generally fallen short of expectations because of a lack of ownership, weak planning,
insufficient monitoring, and lax enforcement of regulations. Furthermore, external resources
have not always been put to good use because of limited implementation capacity and
governance issues. The assessment also concludes that the periods of fastest growth in Malawi
had coincided with implementation of relatively prudent fiscal and monetary policies.
2

Such assessments are required for members with longer-term program engagement. Malawi
has had arrangements with the IMF almost continuously since 1979.

Executive Board Assessment
Directors noted that economic growth picked up in 2003–04, inflation has been brought down,
and the exchange rate has been stable for more than one year. Directors commended the new
government’s ownership of economic policies and recent actions to address corruption at the
highest levels.
Directors noted, however, that although Malawi has recently recovered from a severe drought
and food emergency, it now finds itself in a precarious macroeconomic and social situation.
Above budget spending and delays in donor assistance over much of the past two years have
left Malawi with an unsustainable level of domestic debt, high interest rates, and low private
sector investment. In addition, widespread poverty and the high incidence of HIV/AIDS continue
to present vast challenges.
Directors welcomed the determination to act decisively in meeting budget objectives. Adherence
to the fiscal objectives in the Staff-Monitored Program—which will require effective expenditure
controls—is critical for restoring macroeconomic stability, and the recent passage of the
2004/05 budget was a key step in this direction. Directors urged the authorities to quantify
savings stemming from the ongoing government restructuring, including the reduction in the
number of ministries and the relocation of the president’s office to Lilongwe.
Directors generally agreed that the budget for 2004/05 balances the critical objective of
restoring sound macroeconomic policies with pressing social needs. In this context, they
considered the government’s target of restricted domestic borrowing as appropriate. Directors
emphasized that determined implementation of the budget will be essential. They welcomed the
Ministry of Finance’s refusal of requests for resources above the budget and stressed that
ministries should find savings and set priorities in order to operate within their budgets. Based
on preliminary information, Directors noted that performance had been good through endSeptember.
Despite recent encouraging inflation trends, Directors expressed concern over the recent pace
of monetary expansion. They urged the Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM) to mop up excess
liquidity before it translated into higher inflation. They welcomed, therefore, the RBMs
willingness to raise interest rates if necessary. Directors viewed Malawi’s exchange rate policy
as broadly appropriate. A few Directors took note of the differential with the exchange rate in the
parallel market and the low level of reserves.
Directors further underscored the importance of food security in Malawi and expressed concern
about the possibility of a maize shortage this year. They generally concurred with the
government’s plan to replenish the strategic grain reserve and welcomed the government’s
appeal to the international community for assistance to supplement its efforts. Directors
welcomed the inclusion of these initiatives in the budget, although some expressed concern
over the costs and scope for corruption of the subsidy programs for maize and fertilizer. They
urged the authorities to solidify medium-term agricultural plans, including in the area of land
reform.

-4Directors welcomed recent progress in implementing key structural reforms. The long planned
civil service pay restructuring is about to be implemented, and ADMARC, the governmentowned agricultural product marketing company, was about to adopt a new, more targeted role in
providing public services. However, Directors encouraged further progress in public enterprise
restructuring, and expressed concern that monopolies or oligopolies remain dominant in many
sectors. They observed that progress in other areas, including the audit of domestic arrears and
passage of legislation to strengthen financial management, would also contribute to a more
efficient government. Directors welcomed the government’s focus on anti-corruption, and urged
strong enforcement.
Directors considered improvements in public expenditure management to be critical. These are
needed to ensure that the government achieves its policy objectives—particularly those related
to growth and poverty alleviation—within the available resource envelope. Directors welcomed
the government’s strengthened enforcement of budget procedures and plans to rebuild capacity
in the budget process and expenditure control.
Directors noted that Malawi’s economic program faces a number of risks. The steps now being
taken by the government should help minimize the chances of near-term food shortages and
enhance the prospects for macroeconomic stability. More will need to be done to lay a solid
foundation for medium-term growth and sustainable poverty reduction. Directors, therefore,
emphasized the importance of the evolving medium-term strategy and welcomed its emphasis
on the private sector.
Directors agreed with the general conclusions reached by the Ex Post Assessment on the
lessons from past Fund engagement and the guidelines for future Fund support. In particular,
they noted that inadequate ownership and weak capacity were key factors behind the poor
record of program implementation, and asked the staff, going forward, to take into account the
concerns raised about program design and donor relations.
Directors were hopeful that the SMP will provide an opportunity for the authorities to
demonstrate budget discipline and the ability to achieve targets under their economic program.
Considering Malawi’s need for balance of payments assistance, most Directors agreed that
strong performance relative to the end-December targets in the SMP would be an important
prerequisite for a new PRGF arrangement.
