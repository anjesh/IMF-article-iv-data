Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2010 Article IV Consultation with
the People’s Republic of China
Approved by Anoop Singh and Tamim Bayoumi
July 9, 2010
Mission. A staff team consisting of N. Chalk (Head), A. Ahuja, S. Barnett, P. N’Diaye,
N. Porter, M. Syed (APD), R. Duttagupta (SPR), I. Lee, and T. Feyzioğlu (Resident
Representatives) visited Beijing, Lanzhou, and Shanghai from June 17 to July 1, 2010.
Messrs. He and Zhang (OED) joined the mission and Mr. Shinohara and Mr. Singh
participated in the senior policy meetings. The mission overlapped with a joint MCM-World
Bank mission that began work on the Financial Sector Assessment Program for China.
Outlook. The recovery has taken hold and growth should be in the double digits this year.
Barring further food supply shocks, inflation will peak by mid-year and then slowly decline.
The current account surplus continues to fall and is now around one-half of its 2007 peak.
However, over the medium-term, there is a potential for sizable current account surpluses to
return as the policy stimulus is wound down and the global economy recovers.
Risks. The main risks facing the Chinese economy include a renewed weakening in the
global recovery, a worsening of credit quality (notably from an expansion of lending to local
governments), or a misstep in the government’s response to rising property prices.
Rebalancing. A range of policies will be needed to ensure a sustained rebalancing of growth
toward private consumption. These include measures to reform and liberalize the financial
system, fiscal support for household consumption, an expansion of the social safety net,
policies to capitalize on the ongoing process of urbanization, developing the service sector,
structural changes to lower corporate savings, and an appreciation of the renminbi. There has
been important progress in many of these areas but more remains to be done.
Past advice. The authorities broadly agree with the Fund’s advice on the need to rebalance
toward domestic sources of growth, but there have been different views on the appropriate
pace of some reforms.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
A strong fiscal response and an expansionary monetary policy have ensured that China has
led the global recovery. At the same time, important progress has been made in a range of
structural areas which will contribute to a rebalancing of the economy. The challenge now
will be to sustain this strong growth performance while switching decisively to an economy
that is powered by the Chinese consumer. Much has been done but, given the complexity of
the task at hand, a broad agenda remains ahead and includes:


Maintaining the fiscal stimulus through 2010 while, on the margin, reorienting further
toward fiscal measures that will spur consumption. If the recovery continues as
envisaged, begin gradually withdrawing fiscal stimulus in 2011 while continuing to
expand near-term fiscal support for consumption.



Continuing to withdraw monetary stimulus to return credit growth to more normal levels.
In doing so, a greater role for interest rates, open market operations, and reserve
requirements is warranted.



Maintaining supervisory and regulatory vigilance to identify and manage any
deterioration in credit quality that may arise from last year’s credit expansion.



Increasing the transparency and availability of information on local government
financing vehicles. Strictly enforcing the existing prohibition of local government debt
guarantees.



Continuing to deploy prudential measures to counter unwarranted growth in real estate
prices. Introducing a property tax and, over time, raising the cost of capital to lessen the
propensity for property price bubbles.



Using the flexibility in the current exchange rate regime to allow for an appreciation of
the renminbi in real effective terms.



Liberalizing the financial system with an eventual phase-out of deposit rate ceilings and
of direct limits on credit growth.



Developing a broader range of financial markets and investment products to raise
household capital income, offer households alternative investment and insurance
products, and lessen the demand for physical assets (such as housing) as a store of value.



Sustaining the recent pace of progress in building out China’s social safety net,
particularly in health, education, and pensions.



Capitalizing on urbanization as a force for growth and rebalancing. This would include
reducing labor market rigidities, investing in urban infrastructure, rural land reform, and
removing barriers to competition in the service economy.



Tackling high corporate saving by raising the costs of factor inputs (including capital),
widening corporate ownership, boosting dividend payouts, and increasing competition in
domestic markets.

4
I. HOW HAS CHINA HANDLED THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS?
1.
The crisis response. China was hit hard by the global financial crisis, predominantly
through trade channels. The policy response was quick, determined, and effective and
comprised three broad strands:


A major fiscal stimulus. The public stimulus was concentrated in infrastructure
spending, drawing on the government’s successful use of capital spending as a
countercyclical tool during the Asian financial crisis. The government did, however,
devote an estimated 2–3 percent of GDP to higher social spending and incentives—
largely on the tax side—to support private consumption.



An extraordinary credit expansion. Chinese banks extended new loans of 31 percent of
GDP in 2009. This outturn was largely a result of the removal of limits on credit growth,
supported by a relaxation of restrictions on property lending and a reduction in both
interest rates and reserve requirements.



Re-pegging the renminbi to the U.S. dollar. In July 2005, the central bank began to
allow the renminbi to appreciate against the U.S. dollar, at its peak reaching a rate of
appreciation of around 1 percent per month. However, in response to increasing
volatility in the world economy and in global financial markets, the central bank
returned to pegging the renminbi to the U.S. dollar in July 2008.

2.
Outcomes. This policy package was instrumental in mitigating the effects of the
shock to external demand and in arresting the downward momentum to both activity and
confidence (Figure 1).


Growth began to pick up in the second quarter of 2009 and reached an average for the
year of 9.1 percent, around half of which is estimated to be due to public spending.



Inflation moved into negative territory for much
of 2009 but has since registered a modest
increase. The bulk of this inflation has been
directly attributable to higher food prices.



Since late 2009 inflation has resumed

3.
Spillovers. China’s recovery had significant positive trade spillovers to the region and
the global economy, initially through increased demand for commodities—which contributed
to an upswing in global commodity prices—and later through higher imports of capital goods
(notably from Japan, Korea, Germany, and Taiwan Province of China).
4.
Exit. The government has started to unwind many of its crisis response measures
(Figure 2). Credit growth is being slowed; prudential requirements related to property
lending are being tightened; and the government announced it would return to the managed
floating exchange rate regime that was in place from July 2005 to July 2008 (Box 1).
Box 1: Further Reform of the Renminbi Exchange Rate Regime
 On June 19, 2010 the People’s Bank of China announced the return to a managed
floating exchange rate regime that allows for movements in the exchange rate based
upon market supply and demand and with reference to a basket of currencies.
 Under this regime, the U.S. dollar-renminbi spot exchange rate can move intraday

5.
Monetary policy. The central bank’s loosening of monetary policy in response to the
global financial crisis served to support growth and mobilize the resources needed to finance
a surge in investment. However, the rapid expansion in credit has led to an increased risk of a
worsening in credit quality. With China’s economic recovery now firmly established, the
need for monetary support has greatly diminished. The central bank is, therefore, targeting a
reduction in M2 growth from 28 percent at end-2009 to 17 percent by end-2010. This will
imply an increase in new lending of around Y7.5 trillion for the year as a whole. To achieve
that goal, the central bank has increased reserve requirements three times this year (from
15.5 to 17 percent, for the large commercial banks). In addition, domestic liquidity
conditions have been tightened through the stepped-up issuance of central bank bonds.
However, benchmark interest rates have yet to move upwards and the government continues
to rely on quantitative limits to slow credit growth. The targeted reduction in the pace of
credit growth is fully appropriate. However, staff argued for a broader range of tools to be
used with a greater reliance placed on interest rates, open market operations, and reserve
requirements. Central bank officials indicated that they are fully committed to a greater use
of indirect monetary policy instruments. They noted, however, that, with a benign inflation
outlook, there was less need for higher nominal interest rates at this point. Also, as a
secondary factor, they were concerned that higher interest rates could risk fueling capital
inflows.
6.
Fiscal policy. The 2010 budget targets a deficit of 3 percent of GDP, which should
support a steady resumption of private demand. This fiscal stimulus has come through a
combination of infrastructure spending, a reduction in the tax burden, and incentives to boost
purchases of consumer durables and autos. In addition, pensions, social transfers, healthcare,
and education spending have all been increased in an

stimulus would be measured and gradual. On the other hand, if the global recovery falters,
there was a shared view that China should turn once again to fiscal tools to offset the
resultant shock to external demand. Over a longer horizon, the authorities’ preference was to
gravitate back toward budget balance, noting that China’s strong fiscal position going into
the global crisis had afforded it the space needed to respond forcefully to the shock to
external demand. Staff agreed that such an approach to the setting of fiscal policy in the
coming years was fully appropriate.
7.
The exchange rate. The authorities characterized their decision to return to a
managed floating regime as part of an effort to overcome the temporary interruption to the
reform process that was caused by the global financial crisis. They emphasized the marketdetermined nature of the exchange rate under the managed floating regime and indicated that
they are prepared to allow the exchange rate to respond more to the forces of demand and
supply. Staff agreed that the return to the pre-crisis regime would afford the central bank
significant flexibility and greater monetary policy independence. Going forward, it would be
important to allow movements in the exchange rate to assist in the ongoing tightening of
monetary conditions.
8.
External risks. There was broad agreement that the principal near-term risk facing
the Chinese recovery is the possibility of a renewed downswing in the global economy. The
authorities indicated that events in Europe have increased concerns within China about the
sustainability of the global recovery, inducing greater caution in the pace of exit from the
government’s crisis response measures. Over a longer horizon, they were also concerned that
the process of fiscal consolidation in Europe, Japan, and the U.S. had the potential to lower
global growth with longer-lasting negative spillovers to China. The authorities indicated they
were watching carefully for a decisive approach to tackling the unsustainable sovereign debt
trajectory in a range of countries and that they would also favor early publication of bank
stress tests in Europe. Finally, they indicated their full support for the G-20 mutual
assessment process—and the important role of the IMF—as a means to achieve a more
coordinated approach to global economic policy.
II. HAS THE CRISIS RESPONSE EXACERBATED EXISTING VULNERABILITIES?
A. Has the Policy Stimulus Created a Risk of Overheating?
9.
Context. Monetary aggregates have been growing at a very fast pace. At the same
time, the growth rebound has been rapid. This has raised concerns by some analysts that the
output gap may now be closing in China and inflationary pressures may rise in the period
ahead. Indeed, after a period of deflation in 2009, prices have moved on to an upward
trajectory and inflation is now around 3 percent.
10.
What drives inflation in China? Aside from periodic bouts of food inflation, prices
in China have been remarkably stable since the end of the high inflation in the late 1990s.

10
This is despite rapid economic and monetary growth throughout that period. Empirical work
suggests that the output gap is not a major predictor of inflation in China.1 This finding is
robust for several different measures of the output gap. Staff interpret this result as an
indication that, over much of the past decade, China has been on the flatter part of the
inflation-output trade-off, with the economy operating away from potential output. However,
empirical work suggests that foreign demand and rising commodity prices do affect nonfood
inflation. In particular, a 1 percent increase in foreign demand or a 20 percent increase in
world commodity prices would each raise nonfood inflation by around ½ percent.
Movements in food inflation, on the other hand, appear to be largely a result of supply shocks
to agriculture.
11.
What about wages? China has recently seen some high profile labor disputes that
have been resolved with significant increases in nominal wages. At the same time, there are
reports of labor shortages in some of the coastal areas. Discussions with the private sector
indicated that while nominal wages were rising in the 10–15 percent range, this was a
reasonably similar pattern to that of previous years and represented more an indication of the
high level of productivity growth rather than tightness in the labor market. Indeed,
historically, there appears to be relatively little pass-through from higher wages to domestic
inflation with the costs being absorbed either through productivity gains or within
companies’ existing margins. In addition, facilitated by ongoing investments in infrastructure,
jobs are continuing to move toward the interior of the country where wages are lower. This
will be a structural force for some time to come that will help put downward pressure on
average labor costs. The authorities agreed that labor market conditions were stable and that,
for the nation as a whole, there was still an excess supply of labor (which would restrain
wage pressures). There was broad agreement that steadily rising real wages were a healthy
development that would ultimately boost household income and promote consumption,
leading to a more balanced economy.
12.
Outlook. Looking forward, the massive investment program put in place since late
2008, continued high levels of investment, and significant productivity growth will continue
to neutralize demand pressures in the near term. Staff forecasts that inflation will soon peak
and converge to a level of around 2–3 percent over the next few years, even after accounting
for stronger external demand and the IMF’s forecast for global commodity prices. In addition,
producer price inflation should also begin to fall in the coming months. However, it is worth
noting that, since the housing component in the CPI is linked to rental and actual mortgage
costs, nonfood inflation does not fully capture the underlying cost of living associated with
rising housing costs.

1

See N. Porter, “Inflation Dynamics in China,” IMF Working Paper (forthcoming).

11
B. What are the Emerging Risks in the Property Sector?
13.
Context. The government’s removal of constraints on lending to residential real estate
and lowering of real estate transaction taxes was effective in fostering a turnaround in both
construction and property prices (Figure 3). However, attention is now shifting to whether
this policy response has created a situation where housing prices are rising faster than would
be justified by underlying fundamentals. Housing affordability is also becoming an
increasingly prominent social issue.
14.
Is there a risk of a bubble? Low real returns on bank deposits and a lack of
alternative investment vehicles mean that residential real estate presents an attractive
destination for China’s high domestic saving. Nonetheless, at a national level, it does not
seem as if property prices are significantly above fundamentals (Box 2). However, a property
bubble is beginning to inflate in some of the larger cities and there has been an uptick in
credit to the real estate sector. As a result, preemptive action is warranted.
15.
Policy implications. The Chinese authorities are acutely aware of the underlying risks
of asset price inflation, not least due to the lessons learned from Japan’s experience in the
1980s (Box 3). The government has, therefore, deployed a range of regulatory tools to
contain unwarranted inflation in asset markets. These have included increases in transaction
taxes, stricter regulatory controls on lending (including lower loan-to-value ratios for second
or third homes), and increases in mortgage interest rates for second or third homes. Staff
argued that, while recent measures are treating the

leading to a leveling off in prices. In addition, the
government would expand its investments in low
income housing in the coming years. They also pointed out that deposit rates in China were
still well above those in many other industrial countries. Nevertheless, the government will
evaluate the impact of these measures over time and further enhance them, as needed, to
ensure stability in the housing market. They indicated that, while there is no timetable yet for
the introduction of a property tax, research into the issue was underway.

Box 2: China’s Residential Real Estate Market1
An empirical model is used to link housing prices—in China and a set of comparator
countries—to a set of key fundamentals. An estimated benchmark housing price is then
derived. The fundamental explanatory variables include rents, real interest rates,
property tax payments, the degree of mortgage tax deductibility, maintenance costs, a
proxy for expected capital gains, and an additional risk premium between owning and
renting a home.
Estimates indicate that, for China as a whole,
the deviation between the current price and
underlying fundamentals is relatively small. The
same model does, however, show large
deviations from fundamentals in those countries
in the sample that were subsequently found to
have had a significant property price bubble
prior to the onset of the global financial crisis.
However, the picture differs greatly across
China’s cities. In particular, the deviation of
housing prices from the estimated benchmark is
larger in some, but not all, of the Tier-1 cities.
Interestingly, despite rapid price inflation in
Shanghai, the deviation of the current price from
the benchmark is more modest. This is largely
because rents in Shanghai have more closely
tracked house price inflation than elsewhere in
China.

Box 3: Key Lessons from Recent Japanese History1
China’s economy today faces the difficult task of shifting its sources of growth away from
exports and investment and toward private consumption. This is a similar challenge to that
which confronted Japan in the 1980s. During that period, Japan’s growing share of the global
export market inflamed protectionist sentiments, eventually resulting in the Plaza and Louvre
accords. As part of these accords, Japan agreed to appreciate the yen, implement fiscal policies
to support domestic demand, promote private sector development, and conduct monetary policy
in a flexible manner with due attention to the exchange rate. Analysis of this history provides the
following lessons:
Market Share Since Growth Take Off



There are limits to export-oriented growth. At its
peak, Japan occupied around 10 percent of global
exports and, by the mid-1980s, was beginning to
find it increasingly difficult to push its share in
global markets higher.

to achieve sustained rebalancing. Shifting toward a
greater reliance on the service sector requires a real appreciation of the exchange rate,
supportive macroeconomic policies, and structural reforms to develop nontradable sectors.
Japan’s experience shows that without all the components in place and working in concert
the risk of incomplete rebalancing and economic stagnation is high.



The growth and employment impact of exchange rate appreciation can be alleviated with
supportive macroeconomic policies. The appreciation of the yen that followed the Plaza
accord led to slower growth and higher unemployment. However, these trends were
subsequently reversed by a looser monetary stance and supportive fiscal measures.



However, such supportive macroeconomic policies, if maintained for too long, can inflate
asset bubbles. Maintaining loose monetary policy for too long combined with incentives to
boost consumer and mortgage credit fueled a rapid rise in equity and land prices in Japan.
The subsequent protracted adjustment in goods and asset markets and the deleveraging in
household, bank, and non-financial corporate balance sheets contributed to Japan’s “lost
decade” of deflation, public debt accumulation, and stagnation.



Financial liberalization has to be carefully managed. Liberalizing interest rates in the
context of a banking system with excess liquidity has the potential to lead to a significant
decline in deposit rates, fueling asset price inflation. An early shift toward greater reliance
on indirect monetary instruments can help to maintain control over monetary aggregates
following liberalization but, even with this, the stance of monetary policy still needs to be
correctly calibrated.

C. What are the Vulnerabilities in Local Governments’ Fiscal Positions?
16.
Context. Despite legal restrictions prohibiting subnational borrowing, it has been
common practice for a number of years for local governments to establish corporate vehicles
(capitalized by transfers of money, land, equity, or other government assets), which are then
used to borrow. In addition to their publicly provided capital, these financing platforms
regularly receive implicit or explicit guarantees from the local government to underwrite
their borrowing. In 2008–09, as restrictions on credit growth were removed and the central
government actively encouraged infrastructure investment to offset the shock to external
demand, local governments significantly increased their recourse to such vehicles.
17.
Risks. Information on the activities of these entities (and their underlying financial
condition) is sparse, making it exceedingly difficult to assess the risks they imply for the
banking system. Indeed, officials indicated they were only now putting in place systems to
identify and measure the level of recourse to these financing arrangements. Some part of the
expansion in this quasi-fiscal lending will end up as nonperforming loans with negative
implications for both local government finances, bank balance sheets, or, potentially, central
government finances. The ongoing Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) will
carefully assess the underlying vulnerabilities associated with such lending.
18.
Policies. It was generally agreed that many of the investments being made at the
subnational level were needed and were in projects that would ultimately improve the
livelihoods of the Chinese people. Lowering the potential risks from such lending, however,
will need to involve better information in the operations of local government financing
platforms; work is already underway within the government to collect such data. Officials
underlined their commitment to more strictly enforce the existing prohibition on direct local
government borrowing and the use of explicit (or implicit) local government guarantees.
They particularly pointed to the recent instruction by the State Council, reaffirming that local
governments cannot borrow directly or issue debt guarantees and, if they do, any such
guarantees will be deemed invalid. To contain credit risks, the China Banking Regulatory
Commission (CBRC) has instructed banks to reappraise all lending to local government
vehicles and, if needed, return to the borrowers to request additional collateral to back such
lending, particularly for those projects where the underlying cashflows are weak or
insufficient. Staff argued that some consideration could also be given to formalizing local
government financing (for example through establishing a municipal bond market),
accompanied by appropriate prudential controls. Any such change, however, would need to
weigh carefully the broader consequences for fiscal federal relations and fiscal stability going
forward. In addition, staff indicated that the introduction of a property tax would benefit local
government finances and lessen local governments’ reliance on land sales as a source of
revenue.

16
D. How has the Credit Expansion Affected the Banks?
19.
Context. The scale of the expansion in credit has been unprecedented. Experience, in
both China and abroad, would suggest that this could

Implications. A detailed assessment of risks will be provided by the ongoing FSAP.
At this point, the banking system looks well-placed to withstand a significant deterioration in
credit quality. Profitability is solid, most banks meet the regulatory requirements of being
well capitalized, large banks are subject to a capital surcharge, and provisioning levels are
being increased. The authorities noted that, in addition to their proactive regulatory response,
the loan rate floor and deposit rate ceiling—and the resulting loan-deposit rate margin—
would also provide some protection to the banking system going forward. Nevertheless, they
would continue to scrutinize carefully banks’ risk management practices and adapt China’s
regulatory framework as international standards evolve.
III. WHERE IS THE CHINESE ECONOMY HEADING OVER A LONGER HORIZON?
A. Will the Decline in the Current Account Surplus Endure?
21.
Prospects. In the past two years, the current account surplus has almost halved as
global demand collapsed and China’s demand for commodities and capital goods imports
picked up. Indeed, import volume growth has well outpaced export growth for more than a
year and the current account surplus is still falling (Figure 4). However, as external demand
recovers and the fiscal position moves back to budget balance (and assuming current policies
and a constant real exchange rate) there is a potential for larger current account surpluses to
reassert themselves (Box 4). The accumulation of net foreign assets will also put upward
pressure on the current account through its impact on income flows, particularly as global
interest rates return to more normal levels. The authorities disagreed with this assessment.
Instead, they anticipate that the current account surplus will settle at about 4 percent of GDP
over the medium term. Ongoing structural reforms, rising wages, and the recent appreciation
of the currency will combine to boost consumption. At the same time, continued fast growth
will shrink the current account surplus as a share of GDP. They underlined the important
progress that had already been made in lowering the current account imbalance and expected
that policies would continue to be calibrated to ensure that large surpluses do not return,

17
recognizing that the high level of the trade surplus witnessed in 2007 was simply not
sustainable.

Box 4: Prospects for the Current Account Surplus
A Time Series Approach. Staff simulations—using a Bayesian Vector Autoregression
model (BVAR) estimated on quarterly data—suggest that the recent decline in the
current account surplus may be partially reversed in the coming years. The model was
fitted to historical data and used to forecast assuming:


a steady fiscal consolidation in China;



a recovery in the global economy along the path forecasted in the current World
Economic Outlook;



constant real exchange rates.

Under this out-of-sample simulation,
beginning from end-2009, the current account
surplus rises to around 8½ percent of GDP
over a two-year horizon. Most of the impact
is due to the pace of recovery in the global
economy with little apparently attributable to
the change in fiscal stance.
A Structural Modeling Approach.
Simulations using the Global Integrated
Monetary and Fiscal model (GIMF) show
that the combination of stronger global
demand and a lower fiscal deficit will
increase the current account surplus to around
8–9 percent of GDP. However, compared to
the BVAR results, the simulations based on
this calibrated global structural model
indicate a much larger impact of fiscal
consolidation but a more modest effect from
stronger global output.

Staff’s current account forecasts take these results as a guide but assume a more

alone, using some degree of judgment to adjust for the impact of the policies put in
place in 2009–10.

22.
What does this imply for the exchange rate? Staff believe that the renminbi remains
substantially below the level that is consistent with medium-term fundamentals. This
assessment is based upon three broad arguments:


The pace of accumulation of international reserves continues to be rapid. The
authorities did not view this as compelling evidence of a meaningful undervaluation of
the currency. In particular, they argued that the recent accumulation of international
reserves was more a product of the unprecedented expansion of global liquidity, a result
of monetary policy decisions in the large industrial economies.



The current level of the real exchange rate is
close to the level it was at in the late 1990s even
though, in the interim, China has had
significantly higher productivity than its trading
partners. The authorities regarded it as arbitrary
to judge the current level of the exchange rate
by referencing a particular point in time when
the currency may or may not have been in
equilibrium. In particular, they noted that the
currency was currently more than 50 percent
stronger than when the exchange rate was
unified in 1994 and 22 percent more
appreciated than at its recent low point in
2005. They also made the broader point that
the real exchange rate had been very flexible
over the past decade, moving significantly in
both directions. Staff agreed that comparison
to any one point in time could indeed be
deceptive. However, the real exchange rate
was now back to the average level of
1999‒2003, a period when there did not
appear to be any decisive imbalance in the
external accounts. In the interim, cumulative
productivity differentials had been substantial.

The real exchange rate is now around
the level of a decade ago.

China’s current account is set to return to a position of sizable surplus in the coming
years. The authorities refuted this view, indicating that the reforms put in place over the
past several years—including the appreciation of the real exchange rate, improvements
in health, education, and pension systems, and others—are already resulting in a
structural change in saving and investment behavior in China. They viewed the level of
the renminbi right now as much closer to equilibrium than at any time before. In
addition, they argued that China was at a stage of development where, going forward,
the share of imports in domestic demand was likely to become an increasingly

2.8

20
important factor. In addition, the trend processes of urbanization, demographic change,
and rural reform will all work to lower the current account surplus. Therefore, the
authorities believed that the current account surplus would continue to decline modestly
in the coming months, leveling off at around 4 percent of GDP by end-2010, a level
that was regarded as appropriate for China. If this forecast proves accurate, the resulting
undervaluation (as measured by standard methodologies) would be negligible.
B. How can Recent Gains in Consumption Growth be Sustained?
Consumption is low as a share of GDP.
Private consumption (in percent of GDP)

23.
Context. The Chinese government has
emphasized boosting consumption for more than a
decade. During that period, China’s consumption
growth has indeed been among the strongest of any
country (growing on average by more than 8 percent
per year). Nevertheless, China has still seen a secular
decline in its consumption-output ratio due to rising
rates of precautionary saving and a rate of growth of
household income that has not kept up with GDP.
Last year saw the beginnings of a reversal of this
trend and the challenge now will be to sustain and
strengthen that dynamic.

24.
What does this mean for policies? To achieve a sustained rebalancing of the
economy, continued progress will be needed in a range of areas:


A stronger currency. An appreciation of the real exchange rate needs to be a key
component of the government’s medium-term strategy to rebalance toward higher
private consumption. The current undervaluation is counterproductive and acts as a
headwind to increasing private consumption. A stronger currency will help increase the
purchasing power of households, raise the labor share of income, and reorient
investment toward those sectors that serve the domestic market. There may be some
negative short-term impact on growth and employment (Box 5) but, over time, job
gains in the service sector should offset losses in tradable goods industries. The
authorities noted that significant progress had already been made in strengthening the
currency since 2005. They believe that the structural changes that are taking place and
the continued implementation of the reforms aimed at transforming the growth model
point to a permanent shift from external to domestic demand.

60

21
Box 5: The Inter-Provincial Impact of Exchange Rate Changes1
Panel data on Chinese provinces was used to examine the impact of exchange rate
changes. The database provides for considerable cross-provincial economic diversity in
growth, the movement in the real exchange rate (due to cross-province inflation
differentials), and in structural factors. This heterogeneity allows for an examination of
the different effects of currency movements across regions but also provides useful
information on the impact on growth and employment for the economy as a whole.




An appreciation of the currency in real
effective terms has an impact on growth. In
particular, a 5 percent appreciation of the
exchange rate shaves a cumulative
1 percentage point off of headline growth.
The effect lasts for around 2–3 years and
then tapers off over time. Those provinces
that have had a higher degree of
appreciation, all else being equal, have seen
slightly lower growth outturns.

There are considerable geographical
disparities in growth responses to a
movement in the real exchange rate. For
example, Western provinces are much less
affected by movements in the exchange rate
than the coastal provinces. This, in part,
reflects a relatively lower dependence on
tradables in the Western provinces than elsewhere. More generally, across
provinces, those with a large service sector or greater labor market flexibility
appears to be less affected by currency appreciation.



A real appreciation also effects employment; a 5 percent appreciation lowers
employment growth by around ¾ percent.



The bulk of the adjustment to exchange rate changes is borne by primary and
manufacturing industries; there is a relatively little impact on the service sector.



Not surprisingly, a stronger external environment can help offset the growth impact
of movements in the currency.

22


Financial liberalization. Important progress has been made in recent years in
developing a more market-based financial system in China. Many fixed income
markets have been liberalized, including rates on interbank transactions, central bank
paper, and repo instruments. In addition, a SHIBOR reference yield curve has been
established and markets for corporate bills and bonds continue to expand. Nevertheless,
China still uses certain non-market means in order to maintain macroeconomic stability
and conduct monetary policy. These include regulated ceilings on deposit rates as well
as direct limits on the quantity of new bank lending. This has led to a financial system
where the cost of capital is relatively low, credit allocation is sometimes determined by
non-price means, and market prices have the potential to become disconnected from
underlying fundamentals. Gradually moving to a system where there is an even greater
role for markets in the setting of interest rates and determining the pace of loan growth
would yield a more efficient allocation of capital, create incentives to favor labor over
capital in the means of production, raise household income, and lessen the underlying
propensity for asset price bubbles. Doing so, however, would need to be accompanied
by continued improvements in banks’ risk management systems and strong supervision.



Financial development. There was broad agreement that continued development of
equity markets and corporate bond markets will be an important ingredient to achieving
a rebalanced economy. Considerable efforts have been made in this direction in recent
years including the introduction of short selling and margin trading, the creation of
traded index futures, and further expanding the markets for listing smaller corporations
(with the creation of the Growth Enterprise Board last October). There was a common
view that further steps could include the promotion of wider share ownership, a
simplification of regulatory oversight in various markets, and mechanisms to increase
liquidity in a range of markets. In addition, increased availability of a range of financial
products—including mutual funds, exchange traded funds, annuities and other
insurance products—would be beneficial.



Fiscal support for consumption. The authorities emphasized that they had already
deployed multiple fiscal tools to boost consumption. Staff agreed that these measures
had demonstrated significant effects on the economy and encouraged the authorities to
go still further. For example, lowering the VAT rate and expanding its base would help
increase the marginal incentives to consume. A similar effect could be achieved by
reducing the burden of other consumption taxes or by further expanding the system of
consumption incentives and subsidies.



Raising household income. Staff argued that there was also significant scope to reduce
the taxation of labor income. To do so would necessarily imply a reduction in social
contributions (since personal income tax has only limited coverage). Staff pointed out
that social contributions were high (in excess of 40 percent of base wages) and
regressive. A lower level of contributions would boost household disposable income,
lessen inequality, and foster job growth. However, this would also need to be
accompanied by

23
greater reliance on other revenue sources to ensure continued financing of social
spending. Further increases in transfers to lower income groups and the unemployed
could also be considered.


Healthcare. China has achieved significant progress over the past several years with
near universal coverage of health insurance in urban areas and significantly expanded
coverage for rural residents. The government has increased its subsidies to cover health
insurance premia, devoted significant resources to build hospitals and community
health centers, and has plans already underway to expand the number of healthcare
workers through training and other programs. Finally, the government has also
introduced coverage for a core set of essential drugs. From 2009–11, through a
budgetary investment of Y850 billion (around 2¼ percent of annual GDP), the
government aims to achieve universal coverage of basic health services and to reduce
the costs borne by patients. These efforts have been important but the authorities
indicated there was still a very uneven quality of service delivery and funding across
regions, particularly between rural and urban areas. They noted that lessening regional
disparities in benefits and the quality of service would require further increases in fiscal
resources, particularly to poorer regions. There was general agreement that, going
forward, priorities should be to improve the healthcare system by increased investments
in primary care and community health facilities , continuing to pursue universal
healthcare coverage (particularly of rural and migrant workers), and reducing out-ofpocket expenses through higher reimbursement rates. Other goals were to reduce the
medical system’s heavy reliance on revenue from drug sales and user fees including by
lowering the costs of essential drugs. Staff also advocated an expansion of benefits to
cover catastrophic and chronic illness.



Pensions. In 2009 the government launched its plan to introduce a new rural pension
scheme, financed by the local and central government, and began pilots in 10 percent of
rural counties. By end-2010 it is expected that 23 percent of rural counties will be
covered with universal coverage by 2020. For workers in urban areas, valuable efforts
have also been made to increase the regional pooling of pension funds, unify key policy
parameters at the provincial level, and increase the portability of urban pensions.
Nonetheless, the pension system remains fragmented with multiple occupational
systems that overlay the national rural and urban pension systems. This complexity will
prove to be a constraint to a more dynamic labor market. The authorities agreed that
reforms would need to focus on continuing to expand coverage of the new rural pension
scheme and urban workers’ basic pension system, increasing the uniformity of pension
policies, and putting in place an effective mechanism for interprovincial transfers to
facilitate increased portability. Staff indicated that it would also be important to realize
(and deal with) the legacy costs from the current pension system and move toward
greater pooling of risks at the national level.



Education. Despite a relatively low level of public spending on education, China has
achieved near universal enrollment and full public funding up to junior secondary

24
education. Staff argued that the next steps could focus on ensuring universal publicly
funded education up to the senior secondary school level and improving the quality of
and access to education (particularly in poorer areas and to children of migrant
workers).


Urbanization. In China, 18 million people migrate to urban areas each year. Urban
areas have less than one-half the population but generate over ¾ of China’s
consumption. The process of urbanization creates a steadily expanding flow demand for
housing, services, and higher productivity jobs. The Chinese government has
recognized the tremendous promise that continued urbanization holds for rebalancing
the economy, developing the service sector, and maintaining the strong productivity
performance that has underpinned China’s spectacular growth. The authorities
indicated the challenge ahead will be to generate sufficient urban employment to meet
the inflows of new workers, to provide affordable housing and public infrastructure in a
range of areas (sanitation, transportation, and others), and to tackle the environmental
and energy use hurdles associated with a greater urban population. They emphasized
the need for careful urban planning and a balanced approach to prioritizing and
investing in urban infrastructure. Staff argued for greater efforts to foster labor mobility,
including through improvements to the household registration system. There was broad
agreement that labor mobility would also be facilitated by greater portability of
entitlements and increased national uniformity of social protection schemes.



Tackling high corporate saving. Corporate
savings in China are high. This has been a critical
factor in the large current account surpluses of
recent years. The reasons for this are multifarious.
In part, they are linked to low costs for various
factor inputs (including capital, energy, and
pollution). This has particularly benefitted highly
capital and energy intensive industries in tradable
sectors. Market structure is also important with
some firms enjoying oligopoly positions in
domestic markets. For some smaller companies,
uncertain access to future financing has created
incentives for precautionary saving to ensure that
the resources are on hand to fund profitable projects.
Finally, corporations are not subject to the same
contestability of ownership that is seen in other
systems. This may lead firms to have less incentive
to distribute profits in the form of dividends,
resulting in higher corporate savings.

Corporate, household, and government
savings have all risen.

The authorities’ view. The authorities expressed general agreement with the thrust of
the structural agenda outlined by staff. They emphasized, and staff agreed, that remarkable
changes had taken place in many of these areas over the past few years. Officials underlined
the full commitment of the government to make China less reliant on exports and driven
more by private consumption. They noted this was a dynamic reform process and certainly
not all the reforms had yet been fully deployed; further measures were, nonetheless, being
carefully studied. The authorities also noted that China’s performance should be judged in an
international context. They believed that China had moved at a much faster pace toward
strong, sustained, and balanced growth than others in recent years, in part due to the difficult
short-term economic and social situation in many of the industrial countries.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
26.
Growth. The government’s policy response to the global financial crisis has been
proactive, speedy, and resolute. Its success can be clearly seen in the robust outturn in 2009,
where growth exceeded 9 percent despite an over 4 percent of GDP drag on the economy
from net external demand. The recovery is well established and a transition from public
stimulus to private sector-led growth is underway. Staff projects growth will reach into the
double digits this year, decelerating modestly in 2011 as fiscal and monetary stimulus are
wound down. These achievements further reinforce China’s position as a central driver of
global growth.
27.
Inflation. At this point in the recovery, there is little evidence that the upswing in
inflation is coming from either binding capacity constraints, rapid growth in broad monetary
aggregates, or demand pressures. Barring an unforeseen supply shock to food prices,
consumer price inflation should peak in mid-year and begin falling in the second half of 2010.
28.
Monetary policy. The authorities’ target for broad money growth for this year
balances well the need to provide continued support to the economy on the one hand and to
safeguard the health of bank balance sheets on the other. To achieve the targeted withdrawal
of monetary stimulus, benchmark interest rates could be moved higher, liquidity can be
absorbed through greater issuance of central bank paper and repo operations, and reserve
requirements could be further increased. A more flexible exchange rate will also serve to
support this withdrawal of monetary stimulus. Over a longer horizon, the government should
consider moving toward the full use of indirect instruments for monetary policy and the
phase-out of direct limits on new lending.
29.
Fiscal policy. The stimulus package initiated in 2008 has provided essential support
to the economy. Fiscal stimulus from the state budget ought to be maintained over the near
term but further reoriented, insofar as is possible, away from capital investment and toward
measures to raise household income, lessen income inequality, improve the social safety net,
and boost consumption. While such measures may not be as fast-acting or with as large a
multiplier as infrastructure spending, they are likely to provide more enduring social and

26
economic benefits, helping to facilitate a rebalancing toward private consumption. In 2011,
presuming the current trajectory for the economy is maintained, fiscal stimulus could begin
to be gradually phased out and spending on capital projects (both in the budget and through
local government financing platforms) can be wound down.
30.
The exchange rate. The central bank’s recent decision to return to the managed
floating regime that was in place prior to the global financial crisis is extremely welcome.
This decision affords the central bank considerable flexibility to tighten monetary conditions
through an appreciation of the exchange rate. Going forward, the central bank will need to
avoid having movements in the real effective exchange rate determined by the relative
strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar, particularly given the very different cyclical
conditions in the two economies. In addition, unlike in 2005, there is now significantly more
liquidity in the global financial system. As China begins to appreciate the renminbi, it will
have to confront the prospect of a surge in inflows aiming to circumvent the existing capital
control regime. Macroeconomic and prudential policies will need to be attentive to ensuring
that such capital flows do not feed rapid price increases in key asset markets or undermine
the steady progress made over the past several years to improve the health of the financial
system.
Handling near-term risks
31.
The global context. The principal near-term risk facing China arises from a renewed
downturn in the global economy. If such downsides were realized, China has the flexibility
and room to return to an expansionary fiscal stance to offset the shock to external demand. In
doing so, a larger weight could be put on budgetary measures to boost private consumption
rather than further increases in public infrastructure spending. Over time, medium-term
reforms to rebalance the economy toward private consumption will reduce China’s reliance
on external demand and better insulate the economy from shocks in overseas markets.
32.
The property sector. It is probably too early to say that, on a national level, property
prices are significantly above fundamentals. However, prices in an increasing number of the
larger cities have been rising rapidly and a property bubble is beginning to inflate. Unfettered,
this dynamic risks leading to an acceleration of property price inflation followed by a crash
in the real estate market. Such a path has been seen repeatedly in other countries. Therefore,
the pragmatic deployment of a range of countervailing prudential measures has been fully
warranted. Nonetheless, calibrating such a policy response is complicated and carries with it
a risk of both over- and under-reaction. The government will have to carefully fine-tune these
measures in order to avoid excessively driving down prices or curtailing real estate
investment. Recent price increases are, however, a symptom of a deeper, structural problem.
In spite of the government’s efforts, the propensity for property price inflation and concerns
about bubbles will persist. A lasting solution will need to include a combination of
structurally higher real interest rates, the introduction of a meaningful property tax to raise
the carrying costs of real estate, and broader financial market development to provide

27
alternative destinations for China’s high savings. A property tax would also serve to
strengthen local governments’ financial positions and lessen their reliance on land sales as a
source of revenue.
33.
Local government finances. The recent increase in the use of local government
investment platforms to finance infrastructure and other projects has been extraordinary.
Given the low levels of transparency for many of these operations, the heterogeneous nature
of their activities, and the weak fiscal situation of many local governments, inevitably some
share of the lending associated with these financing platforms will go bad. It is, however,
exceedingly difficult to quantify the risks that such lending could imply for bank balance
sheets. Greater transparency is needed. Going forward, all such entities should be required to
publish annual, audited financial statements. It is also fully appropriate that the Ministry of
Finance, together with the People’s Bank of China and CBRC, are now working to build a
comprehensive database to better understand these operations. Once available, that data
could also be published.
34.
Credit quality. Last year’s rapid expansion in credit, over time, will likely translate
into weaker credit quality and an eventual increase in nonperforming loans; the international
history in this context is compelling. Recent efforts to tighten prudential requirements will
provide important protection to the banking system. In addition, the apparent financial health
of the principal banks should allow them to absorb losses associated with this increased
lending. Nonetheless, the expected rise in nonperforming loans will still place strains on bank
balance sheets in the coming years. These will need to be closely monitored, particularly for
some of the smaller, regional banks.
Rebalancing
35.
Current account. The recent decline in the current account surplus has been dramatic.
However, international experience indicates that for reversals of current account surpluses to
be sustained, there typically needs to be a combination of a real effective appreciation of the
currency, macroeconomic policies to support demand, and in some cases, structural reforms
to develop the nontradable sectors of the economy. Under currently announced policies and
assuming a constant real exchange rate, there is a potential for significant current account
surpluses to reappear over the medium term, albeit not of a scale that was seen in 2007.
36.
A sustained rebalancing. To achieve and sustain the government’s predicted decline
in the current account surplus will be an exceptionally complicated exercise in
macroeconomic engineering. At this point, the critical mass of policy reforms that will be
needed to realize this goal is not yet fully in place. In addition to the commendable efforts
already underway, a sustained decline in the current account surplus will require concerted
action on multiple fronts.
37.
A stronger currency. A stronger renminbi is needed and the recent reform of the
exchange rate regime affords the flexibility necessary to undertake this appreciation. It is

28
possible that shifting resources from the export sector to industries that are more geared
toward domestic markets will take time and, in the interim, growth and employment could be
moderately lower than would otherwise be the case. This is a valid concern. Nevertheless,
given international experience and staff analysis, we are convinced that, over time, job gains,
particularly in the service sector, will outweigh near-term losses and the benefits to the
Chinese people from a stronger currency will far outweigh the costs.
38.
Financial liberalization. Notwithstanding the significant progress made in financial
market liberalization, China should work toward an eventual removal of ceilings on deposit
rates, to make them more market-determined and responsive to forces of demand and supply.
At the same time, the government should move toward a greater reliance on indirect
instruments in exercising monetary control, giving up the use of direct limits on bank lending.
Unwinding the complex system of controls that are currently in place will take time and will
need to be carefully sequenced as well as closely supervised and regulated. It will be
particularly critical that, as interest rates are liberalized, this does not translate into an
unintended loosening of monetary conditions. Rather, such reforms should be designed
carefully in order to lead to a structural increase in real interest rates.
39.
Financial development. Moving to a fully market-based system of financial
intermediation will need to be accompanied by the development of a broader array of
financial markets and instruments. This would offer households alternate investment and
insurance products, increase household capital income, and lessen the demand for physical
assets—such as housing—as a store of value. Such reforms would support consumption,
lower corporate saving, increase employment, improve the allocation of capital, and lessen
the likelihood of asset price bubbles. The ongoing FSAP will provide valuable input in
articulating a clear roadmap for financial development in the coming years. That assessment
will form an integral part of next year’s Article IV consultation.
40.
Fiscal support for consumption. The recent efforts to provide budgetary incentives to
raise household income, lower income inequality, and boost consumption have been effective.
However, the underlying momentum in catalyzing consumption needs to be maintained and
deepened. To do this, the government could examine ways to lower further the tax burden on
both consumption and labor income and further increase transfers to lower income
households and the unemployed. Such a reorientation of fiscal policy would have to be
designed within the broader context of ensuring a medium-term downward path for the fiscal
deficit. As such, supporting consumption and boosting household income may require
offsetting actions to raise other revenue sources (for example, from property taxes) and
reduce other spending items.
41.
Social safety nets. Over the past year, there has been admirable progress in building a
more effective system of social insurance in China. Recent efforts to expand pension
coverage to rural residents, improve the portability of urban pensions, and increase the
quality and availability of health care will be indispensable in lessening household-specific

29
risk and lowering the motivation for precautionary saving. Further steps could include greater
access to high quality health care, particularly for rural residents and migrant workers, an
expansion of benefits to cover catastrophic and chronic illness, and a reduction in out-ofpocket expenses for the insured. The government is also right to continue to move toward its
goals of universal coverage of the basic pension, with a particular focus on covering rural
residents and migrant workers, greater pooling at the national level, and full portability of
pension benefits.
42.
Urbanization. Fully capitalizing on the potential that urbanization holds will require a
range of reforms. Over time, there will need to be a removal of various barriers to labor
mobility, an improvement in the household registration system, continued rural land reform,
measures to ensure uniform access to education and social protection for all urban residents
(particularly migrant workers), and a reexamination of the intergovernmental fiscal system.
Effective urbanization also means that the government will need to continue to seek out ways
to ensure the availability of affordable housing in urban areas and to prioritize large
investments in a range of urban infrastructure. Finally, greater urbanization will bring with it
an increased demand for a range of services that has the potential to generate a significant
number of jobs. To ensure that a service economy fully develops, barriers to competition and
private participation in service industries will need to be sought out and removed.
43.
Lessening corporate savings. Realigning relative prices of various factor inputs
through increases in the cost of capital, land, electricity, gas, water, and pollution will lower
corporate savings, particularly in capital and energy intensive industries. This would be fully
in line with the government’s own priorities to conserve energy, reduce emissions, and
protect the environment. There has already been progress in this direction as domestic
petroleum product prices are now more closely linked to global price movements. However,
recent moves to reduce VAT rebates to select industries are distortionary and
counterproductive. Instead, it would be better for the VAT to be zero-rated for all exports
with the objectives of dissuading energy intensive and polluting industries achieved through
other means. The government may also wish to consider expanding its program of having
state owned enterprises pay dividends to the budget, and ensure that these dividends are used
to finance general budget spending (rather than being recycled back into the corporate sector
through various means). Efforts ought to be made to ensure there is sufficient competition in
domestic markets to avoid companies leveraging their oligopoly positions to generate excess
rents. Finally, increasing households’ stake in the corporate sector through wider share
ownership—both directly and via institutional investors—will allow high corporate saving to
translate into increased household wealth. This, in turn, will facilitate higher household
consumption.
44.
Conclusion. The government’s macroeconomic policy response to the crisis has
delivered very positive results and mitigated the impact of the global downturn on China’s
economy. China has also made significant progress in many of the policy areas that have
been highlighted in the G-20 Mutual Assessment Process. In doing so, China is contributing

30
greatly toward ensuring strong, sustained, and balanced global growth. The challenge now
lies in calibrating the pace of exit from these crisis measures, particularly in the context of a
very uncertain global environment. In addition, there is a broad structural agenda to be
accomplished if China is to realize its own goal of making private consumption a central
driving force behind growth in the coming years. In achieving that outcome, no policy tool
should be left untapped. A stronger currency will be needed but should be viewed not in
isolation but rather as a part of the broader package of measures described above.
45.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with China takes place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

1/ Coverage of public sector refers to gross debt of the budgetary general government. Official NPLs on bank’s balance sheets were about 1.5 percent of GDP at end 2009, although
this does not include the Y820 billion (2½ percent of GDP) carved out during the 2008 reform of the Agricultural Bank of China, and the unknown residual losses still held by the AMCs
on their legacy loans. It is assumed around one third of the NPL stock each year is resolved, achieving a recovery rate of about 20 percent, with the resulting loss added to public debt in
the forecast period. Future NPLs are conservatively assumed to be higher from lending in 2009 and 2010, of which 20 percent is eventually recovered. Unfunded pension liabilities (as
part of a transition) are assumed to be covered each year by the budget in 2010−15; interest will also be paid on these and the bonds issued to cover NPLs.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreigncurrency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).

Exchange Arrangements:

1.
China’s exchange rate regime is currently classified as a stabilized arrangement. On
July 21, 2005, the People’s Bank of China (PBC) announced that the exchange rate of the
renminbi against the U.S. dollar would be revalued upward by about 2.1 percent
(from RMB 8.28/US$ to RMB 8.11/US$) and the exchange rate regime would move to a

3
managed float in which renminbi’s value is set with reference to a basket of currencies. The
stated intention of the Chinese authorities was to increase the flexibility of the renminbi’s
exchange rate. The authorities indicated that they will not publish the currencies in the
reference basket and their relative weight. The PBC indicated that it would adjust the
exchange rate trading band as necessary to reflect market developments and financial and
economic conditions. Under the new regime, the band around the daily trading price of the
U.S. dollar against the renminbi was kept at ± 0.3 percent around the central parity published
by the PBC while the trade prices of the non-U.S. dollar currencies against the renminbi were
allowed to move within a certain band announced by PBC, which was initially set at
±1.5 percent and increased to ±3 percent in September 2005. In August 2005, the governor of
PBC revealed that U.S. dollars, Euro, Japanese yen, and Korean won were the main
currencies included in the basket, and U.K. pound, the Thai baht, and the Russian ruble were
among other currencies included in the basket. In May 2007, the band around the daily
trading price of the U.S. dollar against the renminbi was widened to ± 0.5 percent. After
maintaining the renminbi closely linked to the U.S. dollar between July 2008 and June 2010,
the PBC announced on June 19, 2010 a return to the managed floating exchange rate regime
prevailing prior the global financial crisis with the exchange rate allowed to move up to 0.5
percent from a central parity rate.
2.
On January 4, 2006, over-the-counter (OTC) trading of spot foreign exchange was
introduced with 13 banks initially designated as market makers and the number of market
makers has since risen to 22. The centralized spot foreign exchange trading system (CFETS)
remains operative, but its central parity rate (renminbi against the U.S. dollar) is now based
on a weighted average of CFETS and OTC transactions. Under the new system, CFETS first
inquires prices from all market makers before the opening of the market on each business day,
exclude the highest and lowest offers, and then calculates the weighted average of the
remaining prices in the sample as the central parity for the renminbi against the U.S. dollar
for the day. The weights for the market makers, which remain undisclosed, are determined by
the CFETS in line with the transaction volumes of the respective market makers in the
market.
3.
China accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s
Articles of Agreement on December 1, 1996. There are repatriation and surrender
requirements on proceeds from exports and from invisible transactions and current transfers.
Starting on August 13, 2007, all enterprises (domestic institutions) having foreign exchange
revenue from foreign operation or from current accounts may keep foreign exchange receipts
according to their operational needs in their current account foreign exchange accounts.
Domestic institutions that had no current account foreign exchange revenue in the previous
year are allowed to retain an initial limit of foreign exchange revenue equivalent to
US$500,000. Current account foreign exchange accounts with special sources and designated
uses have limits of 100 percent of actual foreign currency income. In the case of exportimport and manufacturing enterprises that, because of actual operating needs, must retain all
current account foreign exchange revenues, SAFE may determine their limits as 100 percent

4
of actual foreign exchange revenue and actual needs. From invisible transaction, balances, if
any, beyond operational needs must be sold to foreign exchange banks, with amount
exceeding US$50,000 requiring documents be submitted to SAFE. There are no measures
currently in force that have been determined to be exchange restrictions subject to
Fund jurisdiction. However, China has notified measures to the Fund, pursuant to procedures
under the Executive Board Decision 144-(52/51), which apply to measures imposed solely
for national or international security reasons.
4.
Exchange controls continue to apply to most capital transactions. Effective on
July 1, 2006, quotas on foreign exchange purchases for foreign direct investment (FDI) were
abolished, and domestic investors were allowed to purchase foreign exchange to finance
pre-FDI activities. Since December 1, 2002, qualified foreign institutional investors (QFIIs)
have been allowed to invest domestically in A shares, subject to certain restrictions, and all
nonresidents have been allowed to purchase B shares, which are denominated in U.S. dollars
or Hong Kong dollars. The overall QFII quota was increased to US$30 billion in
December 2007 from US$10 million. The Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII)
scheme was introduced in 2004, and measures have since been taken to promote its
development. Since May 1, 2006, residents can purchase up to US$20,000 foreign exchange
for depositing in banks or for current account transactions and this limit was raised to
US$50,000 in September 2006. Beyond the quota, purchases require relevant documents. In
May 2007, the QDII scheme was expanded to allow qualified banks to invest retail funds in
foreign equities. Effective July 5, 2007 the China Securities and Regulatory Commission
extended QDII to securities and fund-management companies. The firms have to meet
certain capital and other requirements. From April 2006, qualified insurance companies were
also allowed to invest their own foreign exchange externally under the QDII scheme. In 2004,
international financial institutions were approved to raise funds domestically in renminbi for
use offshore, while in December 2007, it was announced that foreign-funded enterprises
would be allowed to issue renminbi bonds. Other nonresidents are still not permitted to issue
capital or money market securities in the domestic market. An annual foreign borrowing plan
sets mandatory ceilings for all medium- and long-term borrowing by government
departments and enterprises (except FFEs which are subject to individual limits negotiated in
the investment approval process).

ANNEX II. CHINA: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP1
1.
The World Bank has been active in China since 1980. World Bank commitments to
China as of end-FY 2010 are expected to total about $47 billion for 323 projects. About 75
of these projects are under implementation, as well as a significant number of trust funds,
making China’s portfolio one of the largest in the Bank. World Bank-supported projects are
found in almost all parts of China and in many sectors of the economy, with infrastructure
(transport, energy, urban development) accounting for more than half of the total portfolio,
and rural development, social sectors (health, education, social protection), and direct
poverty reduction programs comprising the remainder. Roughly three-quarters of Bank
supported activities have environmental objectives and a strong environment focus runs
across sectors with environment-related projects in energy, urban wastewater, water supply
and sanitation, and rural development.
2.
The nature of the China-World Bank partnership has also changed over time. Initially,
China looked to the Bank for technical assistance to introduce basic economic reforms,
modern project management methodologies, and new technologies. With time, the
partnership increasingly focused on institutional strengthening and knowledge transfer. As
China has successfully adopted new practices and registered unprecedented development
achievements, the remaining development challenges have become less amenable to standard
solutions. Instead, China has engaged the Bank in a two-way exchange to tailor unique
approaches that match local realities and capacity with global experiences. The Bank has also
increasingly sought to support China in sharing its own important development experiences
and knowledge with the rest of the world. Going forward, China is placing an increasing
emphasis on growth that is balanced with social and environmental concerns. Given the
resources constraint and difficult reform challenges, innovative approaches, ideas, and
system reforms will be critical to China’s achieving its national goals.
3.
The World Bank Group Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), endorsed by the WB
Board in May 2006, covers both lending and non-lending activities and is designed to
support the five strategic themes consistent with China’s 11th Five-Year Program: integrating
China into the world economy, reducing poverty and inequality, addressing resource
scarcities and environmental challenges, strengthening the financial sector, and improving
market and public institutions. The mid-term Country Partnership Strategy Progress Report
(Report 46896-CN) completed in January 2009 determined that the Strategy is well on track
to fulfill or exceed most strategic targets. The Progress Report notes that implementation of
the CPS has largely proceeded as envisaged, however there has been a more intensified
engagement in a number of areas, including: China’s integration into the world economy,
especially regarding south-south learning; energy efficiency, environment and climate change;

7
and, more recently, integrated urban-rural development. Bank support for disaster and risk
management generally, and earthquake reconstruction, specifically, in the wake of the tragic
May 2008 Sichuan earthquake has been mobilized. The Bank is also providing support to
help the government in managing the impacts of the current global economic downturn.
4.
In FY 2009 lending totaled $2.3 billion in IBRD loans for 13 projects. These projects
focus on urban environment improvement, transportation (urban transport, inland waterways,
railways and provincial highways), vocational training, eco-farming, flood and watershed
management, coal bed methane development and a cultural and natural heritage project. The
Bank also supported reconstruction following the Wenchuan earthquake with a $710 million
loan. For FY 2010 we envisage lending of $1.4 billion in total for 14 projects in support of
poverty reduction, eco-livestock development, food safety, sustainable forestry, urban
environment and transport, river basin management, biomass heat power cogeneration and
vocational education. As in the past, these lending operations are knowledge-based:
successful pilots may be scaled up and replicated in other provinces or at the national level.
5.
In addition to financial assistance, the provision of economic analysis, policy advice,
technical assistance and training is an essential part of the Bank’s partnership with China.
The Bank has responded to the country’s evolving needs, by having a better balance between
comprehensive reports on issues requiring detailed technical analysis and more demanddriven rapid delivery brief policy notes, supplemented by other forms of collaboration such
as senior-level workshops and focused study tours.
6.
Key analyses that were recently released include: Quarterly Economic Updates,
reports on trade issues, pension reform, health care reform, improving rural-urban linkages in
Chongqing and Guangdong, rural compulsory education, rural urban migration, energy
intensity, capital market development, land market reform, and financial sector development.
7.
The China Economic Reform Implementation project, a technical cooperation loan,
was approved in FY 2006. A large program of technical assistance has also been financed by
trust funds from within and outside the Bank, covering issues such as environmental
management, financial sector reform, statistical reform, poverty issues, and social security.
The World Bank Institute carries out a wide range of training, peer learning and South-South
knowledge exchange programs, including through use of the Global Development Learning
Network.
8.
China has also signed 20 carbon purchase agreements with the World Bank totaling
USD 1.297 billion as of June 2010.
Representation: The People’s Republic of China assumed China’s representation in the
World Bank on May 15, 1980.

8
Capital Subscription: China’s current subscription is 44,799 shares, amounting to
US$5,404.3 billion, which is 2.85 percent of the total subscribed shares of IBRD. China has
fully subscribed to its share allocation.
Resident Mission: A resident IBRD office in Beijing has been in operation since
October 1985. In October 1997, responsibility for managing the Bank’s total program for
China was decentralized to the Beijing office.
International Finance Corporation (IFC): \ As of June 15, 2010, IFC had invested $4.65
billion in 193 projects across all major sectors ($1.65 billion in equity, $2.00 billion in loans,
$754 million in syndications and $250 million in guarantees). IFC’s early partners were
mostly foreign investors, but now 85 percent of IFC’s clients are domestic companies. The
investment program for FY 2010 is expected to be approximately $420 million. IFC’s China
strategy focuses on climate change, balanced rural-urban development, and South-South
investment particularly focused on Africa. A resident IFC office in Beijing has been in
operation since 1992. In July 2000, IFC began to operate its regional headquarters in Hong
Kong. In 2002, IFC opened an office in Chengdu to provide advisory services to small and
medium enterprises (SMEs) in Western region of China.

ANNEX III. CHINA: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK1
1.
The Asian Development Bank’s (ADB) partnership with the People’s Republic of
China (PRC) has evolved since the PRC became a member of ADB in March 1986. The PRC
is ADB’s second largest shareholder among regional members and the third largest overall,
as well as an important middle-income country client. By the end of 2009, the PRC’s
cumulative borrowing from ADB reached $22.2 billion with 156 loans for public sector
projects. Of the total public sector loans, 56 percent was allocated to the transport sector,
followed by water supply, sanitation and waste management (13 percent), energy
(12 percent), agriculture and natural resources (8 percent), multisector (5 percent), industry
and trade (3 percent), and finance (3 percent). Over the past 23 years, ADB has helped
finance 29 private sector projects in the PRC totaling $2.1 billion.
2.
ADB also funds technical assistance for the PRC. By the end of 2009, ADB had
provided a total of $331.8 million in grants for 598 technical assistance projects, consisting
of $100.1 million for project preparation and $231.7 million for policy advice and capacity
development.
3.
Overall, the PRC has demonstrated strong capabilities in implementing projects. The
good performance shows the strong sense of project ownership among agencies involved in
the design, implementation, and management of projects, as well as the rigorous screening
process for development projects, particularly those proposed for external financing. Loan
disbursement and contract award performance is good.
4.
The PRC has demonstrated its strong partnership with ADB by contributing
$35 million to the Asian Development Fund, and establishing the $20 million Poverty
Reduction and Regional Cooperation Fund. The Poverty Reduction and Regional
Cooperation Fund—the first fund established in ADB by a developing member country—
provides technical assistance for projects in the Greater Mekong Subregion and in Central
Asia.
5.
In 2008, the Asian Development Bank issued its most recent Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) for the People’s Republic of China, covering 2008 to 2010. The CPS was
developed in close cooperation with the PRC Government, and supports the government’s
implementation of the 11th 5-Year Plan through four strategic pillars: (i) inclusive growth and
balanced development; (ii) resource efficiency and environmental sustainability; (iii) regional
cooperation and public goods; and (iv) the enabling environment for private sector
development. In addition, two themes cut across all of ADB’s operations: (i) knowledge and
innovation; and (ii) governance. A new CPS is currently under preparation, covering 2011 to
2015.

6.
Projected public sector lending in 2010–11 will total about $2.98 million, of which
42 percent will support transport infrastructure and maintenance; 22 percent for agriculture,
rural development and natural resource management; 22 percent for urban development,
water supply and sanitation improvement; and 14 percent for the energy sector. With
85 percent of the projects located in the western and central regions, and all projects having an
environmental focus, the pipeline closely follows the strategic pillars of the CPS, particularly
its emphasis on inclusive growth and environmental protection.
7.
The ADB’s lending program will continue to be supported by technical assistance.
Grants for technical assistance program are expected to be $15 million to $20 million
annually. To enhance the strategic focus of ADB operations, better meet the goals of the
government’s development plans, and address pressing concerns on environmental protection
and energy preservation, several advisory technical assistance projects are directly related to
resource efficiency, environment protection, and climate change initiatives.

ANNEX IV. CHINA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
While economic statistics are adequate for surveillance purposes, weakness remain in
the quality of the data, including coverage, frequency and timeliness. Nevertheless, China has
made significant strides in bringing its economic and financial statistics into line with
international good practice. In April 2002, China began participation in the Fund’s GDDS,
and it certified and updated the metadata posted on the Fund’s DSBB (the most
comprehensive documentation of economic and financial statistics available in English), in
early 2009 (with the exception of financial sector and social demographic sector, which were
certified in 2006). The technical assistance (TA) and training evaluation mission in March
2009 concluded that STA’s TA and training missions to China were highly appreciated by all
recipient agencies.
Real Sector Statistics
2.
The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) compiles and disseminates annual GDP by
activity in current and constant prices (2005). The techniques for deriving volume measures
of GDP are not sound and need to be improved. GDP by expenditure is compiled at current
and constant 2000 prices, but the constant price estimates are not published. Quarterly GDP
estimates are compiled in cumulative form, with minimal revisions, making it difficult to
assess quarterly developments accurately or to make seasonal adjustments. Data on the
expenditure components of GDP are not available on a quarterly basis. Nevertheless, the
NBS has made a number of improvements to the range and quality of national accounts data,
the most important being improving the exhaustiveness of the GDP estimates by activity.
Further improvements are intended, including the adoption of the 1993 System of National
Accounts, further improvements to quarterly GDP estimates. However, no target dates have
been set. As in other countries, rapid economic change, including the expansion of the
private sector, presents new problems for data compilation. The ability to change the
collection of data is restricted by the decentralized nature of the statistical system. Extensive
technical assistance has been provided from multilateral and bilateral institutions.
3.
Monthly industrial production, retail sales, and fixed investment indices are compiled
with the corresponding month of the previous year as a base period. However, no chainlinked time series are produced. Data revisions tend to be made without publishing the entire
revised series.
4.
Labor market statistics—including employment and wage data—are not
comprehensive, and are only available on an annual basis, with considerable lag.
5.
In January 2001, the NBS began to publish an annually-chained Laspeyres price
index, which more accurately reflects consumer spending patterns (e.g., the weight of
services increased, while the weight of food declined). The number of survey items has been
expanded to around 700. The most recent weights of the major CPI components were
provided to the staff in 2006. Prior to 2001, the index was compiled and disseminated on a

12
month to month and year to year basis using current year weights for most items. The data
for this index are for the period 1978−2000.
Government Finance Statistics
6.
Serious data shortcomings continue to hamper fiscal analysis. Budgetary data exclude
spending associated with domestic bond proceeds on-lent to local governments and official
external borrowing. Also, data on the social and extra budgetary funds are only provided
annually and with a long lag. Expenditure classification remains poor, mainly because data
are not classified by economic type. However, the situation should gradually improve with
the recent introduction of a revised budget classification system, starting with the 2010
budget. The authorities have indicated an intention to develop accrual based measures of
fiscal performance over the medium term while also strengthening the compilation of cash
based GFS.
7.
China has reported general government cash-based budget data for 2003−2007
following the GFSM 2001 methodology for publication in the 2009 GFS Yearbook. However,
these data are limited, with no data provided on government debt and transactions in
financial assets and liabilities. The revenue classification does not fully distinguish between
revenue and grants, tax and nontax revenue, and current and capital revenue. The
presentation of expenditure by function is largely aligned with international best practice.
Owing to source data issues, the authorities have not yet been able to report a GFSM 2001
Statement of Sources and Uses of Cash for the budgetary central government accounts on a
subannual basis. As a result, there are no fiscal data for China on the Principal Global
Indicators website.
Monetary and Financial Statistics
8.
In recent years, improvements have been made by the People’s Bank of China (PBC)
in monetary and financial statistics. The most notable progress made by the PBC are as
follows: (1) expanding the coverage of financial institutions; (2) adjusting the sectorization of
financial corporations; (3) improving the “all accounts” reporting system; and (4) improving
data dissemination following the GDDS recommendations, such as disseminating advance
release calendars on the PBC’s websites. On financial soundness indicators (FSIs), China
began reporting annual data on core FSIs to the Fund under a pilot project although no
agreement has been given by the authorities for publication of these data.
9.
However, the monetary and banking surveys lack sufficient detail with regard to bank
claims on the government, hampering the estimation of the fiscal deficit from the financing
side. The reported net foreign assets position of PBC does not include exchange rate
valuation effects and interest earnings on foreign reserves. The PBC has also ceased to report
separate data on central government deposits in its balance sheet since April 2005 because
the MOF no longer distinguishes between central and other government deposit accounts.
This change has led to breaks in data series of monetary base and monetary aggregates. In

13
addition, detailed breakdowns of bank credit by industry, and by borrower (including by the
various elements of the state and nonstate sectors), are not publicly available.
10.
Due to the restructuring of the banking sector, new statistical issues have arisen, such
as how to record the transfer of nonperforming loans to asset management companies, and
how to sectorize these companies in the banking survey. The monetary and financial statistics
mission that visited Beijing in 2007 and 2009 made recommendations for addressing these
issues. These missions also assisted the authorities in addressing issues related to (1) the
implementation of Standardized Report Forms; (2) expansion of data coverage to include
other financial corporations; and (3) compilation of FSIs and reporting of FSI data and
metadata using the standard templates. .
11.
A financial statistics mission will visit China in the 2nd half of 2010 to assist the
authorities in advancing their work in addressing data issues on monetary and financial
statistics and financial soundness indicators.
External Sector Statistics
12.
The State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) relies on an International
Transactions Reporting System (ITRS) which produces data derived from information on
foreign exchange transactions conducted by banks. To supplement the ITRS, data on travel
credits and trade credits are collected through periodic sample surveys, while additional data
are collected from other government agencies and reports on balance sheet information from
financial institutions and data on portfolio investment and direct investment.
13.
The data are compiled (in U.S. dollars) largely in accordance with the fifth edition of
the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5). Preliminary semi-annual (January-June) data are
compiled and disseminated within three months after the end of the reference period while
annual data are disseminated four to five months following the end of the reference period. It
appears that the authorities may be close to being able to publish quarterly estimates of the
balance of payments. Within the current account, component detail is available on goods,
services, income, and transfers. Data on the financial account, with significant component
detail for functional categories, and data on the capital account are also available. Data on
China’s international investment position (IIP) are published for the period 2004-2009.
14.
The coverage of direct investment transactions remains a problematic issue in the
balance of payments and IIP statistics, although progress is being made in developing these
statistics. Data on transactions for the nonfinancial sector, received mainly from the Ministry
of Commerce (formerly Ministry of Foreign Trade and Cooperation), apparently do not cover
all required elements such as disinvestments. In 2007, inward direct investment stock data of
the nonfinancial sector were based on new source data collected through the “Joint Annual
Review and Evaluation of Overall Performance on China’s Inward FDI,” a joint government
department effort to collect performance data from foreign-funded enterprises. Since ITRS is
the major data source for BOP, in order to ensure its smooth operation, regular training
programs for staff in the provincial offices of SAFE were recommended. In addition, in

14
January 2003 a legislative guarantee for the improvement of the quality of ITRS reporting
entitled “The Checking System on Balance of Payments Reporting Data (experimental)” was
promulgated by the SAFE. An upgraded version of the ITRS has been used since 2009.
15.
The Fund has provided extensive technical assistance and training to improve
balance of payments and IIP statistics. At the Joint China-IMF Training Program in Dalian,
STA conducted a specialized seminar on Cross-border Stocks and Flows in June 2006 and a
Balance of Payments and IIP course in June 2007. Following China’s agreement to
participate in the Coordinated Direct Investment Survey (CDIS), STA visited Beijing in
April 2008 to conduct an interagency meeting on the CDIS. At the request of SAFE, STA
also conducted a one-week seminar on the new draft Balance of Payments and International
Investment Position Manual (BPM6) in Kunming, China.
16.
The Fund has also provided technical assistance on the coverage, timeliness, and
periodicity of data on official reserves, reserves-related liabilities, as well as on other external
assets and liabilities, financial derivative activities, and other contingent and potential
liabilities. Despite an ostensibly modest level of external vulnerability, there remains a need
to strengthen external debt monitoring and compilation. STA conducted a seminar on
external debt statistics in August 2005 as part of the China Training Program. In January
2010, China started submitting total and public external debt data for the Quarterly External
Debt Statistics (QEDS) database, a notable step forward.
Data Reporting to STA for Publications
17.
Despite improvements in reporting a number of breaks remain in the series, and
comparable historical data are not available. Reporting of data to STA for IFS has, in the past,
tended to be sporadic and with a considerable time lag. Following the introduction of new
reporting arrangements, the timeliness of consumer price, industrial production, trade value,
and total GDP data in IFS has improved substantially. However, the range of information is
relatively limited, with no data published on producer prices, wages, trade volumes or
prices/unit values. The authorities have recently resumed reporting data on international
reserves for IFS. However, the monthly time series will now be submitted every three months,
instead of every month.
Data Dissemination to the Public
18.
The publication of a quarterly statistical bulletin by the PBC has significantly
improved the timing and coverage of publicly available data on the monetary accounts and
the main real sector indicators. However, the monthly statistical publications do not contain
many time series (e.g., unemployment) or the disaggregation necessary for analysis.
Moreover, several important time series, particularly on the main fiscal variables, are not
released in a systematic and timely manner. Extensive annual economic data are available in
various statistical yearbooks, but these are published nine months or more after the end of
the year.

ANNEX V. CHINA: FISCAL REFORMS AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
1.
In recent years, the Fund has provided technical assistance in a number of areas
(Table V.1). This annex focuses on the main issues and recommendations in the fiscal area.
Fiscal Technical Assistance Program
2.
FAD has largely provided advice on tax policy, tax administration, budget and
treasury reforms, and intergovernmental relations.
Tax Policy
3.
The scope of the Fund TA work in this area has been quite comprehensive, covering
every major tax: the value-added tax (VAT), the business tax, the enterprise income tax (EIT),
and the personal income tax (PIT), or the tax treatment of specific sectors (i.e., financial
sector).
4.
On the VAT, the focus of the Fund’s TA advice on the VAT has been on
transforming it into a consumption-type VAT (now being piloted). As there are important
revenue and central-province intergovernmental implications of the VAT reform, the Fund
has paid particular attention to alternative transition strategies. The Fund’s TA advice has
also focused on improving the structure of the EIT, including the unification of the regimes
applying separately to domestic and foreign enterprises, and rationalizing and reducing the
scope of EIT incentives. The EIT was unified on January 1, 2008. For the PIT, whose yield is
still relatively insignificant, its structure should be streamlined and its rates simplified; the
authorities have recently increased the PIT income exemption threshold, along the lines of
previous Fund’s advice. In addition, the liberalization of the financial sector under the WTO
commitments has important tax implications, some of which has already been covered by
Fund TA; such as the August 2007 mission which advised the authorities on financial
taxation. The authorities have also expressed interest in receiving TA on streamlining real
estate taxes, which are an important revenue handle for local governments. A mission on
revenue forecasting took place in March 2008, and a mission on tax gap estimation is
scheduled for June 2009.
Tax Administration
5.
The authorities have been putting in place the basic building blocks of a modern
national tax administration. In this regard, the Fund TA program has aimed at assisting the
State Administration of Taxation (SAT) to develop the strategic capacity required for it to
manage a national tax system, with assistance provided to both the central and provincial
governments. During 2006−07, TA covered strategic planning, compliance risk management,
business process reengineering, VAT administration, taxpayer services, and the planned IT
modernization program, Golden Tax Project 3 (GTP 3). A seminar on strategic planning and
management practices in support of previous FAD recommendations was conducted

17
January 2008. The SAT has made good progress particularly in VAT administration and
delivery of taxpayer services (including the introduction of e-services). Importantly,
compliance risk management capacity is under development and a major IT system
enhancement is in the beginning stages. Other organizational reforms have proven more
difficult, such as implementing a fully functional organization structure with expanded
headquarters responsibilities and staffing, and integrating strategic and annual business
planning into the SAT’s management processes. With the assistance of the Resident
Representative in Beijing, the SAT’s TA needs for the immediate future have been
determined as consolidating the VAT on services, and in large taxpayer compliance
programs—both areas will be addressed by FAD during FY2011.
Public Financial Management
6.
In order to improve control, allocation and management of public spending, several
budget and treasury reforms have been implemented in recent years. These include:
improving budget preparation, especially budget classification; introducing departmental
budgets; centralizing the government payments function; and establishing treasury single
accounts (TSA) at the central and provincial levels.1
7.
Up until 2007, these efforts were supported by extensive technical assistance from
FAD, which also provided TA for a possible reform of the 1994 Budget Law and on accrual
accounting (see Table V.1). Topics for further TA—including for preparing medium-term
expenditure frameworks, improving fiscal transparency and macrofiscal forecasting,
developing government financial management information systems (GFMISs), and
strengthening government cash management—were discussed in 2007. However, the
authorities have not yet followed up with requests for TA in any of these areas. In 2009 FAD
participated and provided the keynote speech at an international conference in Hainan
Province on local government cash management organized by MOF and the ADB. FAD has
offered to provide further TA in this area.
Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations
8.
The authorities are aware of the need to reform the system of intergovernmental fiscal
relations, as imbalances between the center and subnational levels are growing and regional
disparities are widening. There is a need to clarify expenditure mandates, including by
centralizing some spending responsibilities such as pensions. Revenue sharing and the
design of the transfer system also need to be reformed. In November 2007, FAD organized a
conference on “Reforming Assignments and Next Steps in Intergovernmental Reforms” (in
Hangzhou) with funding from the UNDP and the Chinese authorities. The authorities
1

A standard Treasury Single Account (TSA) is a centralized bank account or a set of linked bank accounts
through which the government, including its entities and spending units, transacts all receipts and payments and
consolidates its cash balances. TSA reform has been introduced in all 36 provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities, and is being pursued in some 500 prefectures and larger cities.

18
confirmed that they have now established a Sub-National Debt Management Division in the
Ministry of Finance, and that one of the additional areas of reform will be to assess
subnational risks and liabilities.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on the People’s Republic of China
July 26, 2010
The following information has become available following the issuance of the staff report. It does
not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.
Recent data. Latest data releases indicate growth is on track to reach into the double digits
this year, while inflationary pressures are abating.
Real GDP growth slowed to 10¼ percent year-on-year in the second quarter of 2010, down from
11.9 percent in the first quarter. This is in line with staff forecasts. Investment and a rebound in net
exports were the main drivers of growth in the second quarter.


Consumer and producer price
inflation eased in June as food and
commodity price inflation slowed.

US$ 20 billion. As in May, export



Gross official reserves were broadly flat in the second quarter at US$ 2.45 trillion.



Provisioning for nonperforming loans rose to 186 percent by end-June.

2. Property Market. There are signs the government’s measures to cool off the property market
have started to have an impact with sales volumes continuing to be low and a slowdown in
residential property prices in the major cities.
3. Exchange Rate. In the four weeks following the
return to the pre-crisis managed floating system, the
exchange rate has appreciated by about ¾ percent
against the U.S. dollar and depreciated by ¾ percent in
nominal effective terms.
4. IPOs. Agricultural Bank of China was listed in
both Shanghai and Hong Kong SAR. Proceeds from
the dual listing were US$ 19.2 billion.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with China
On July 26, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with China.1
Background
China was hit hard by the global financial crisis. However, the authorities quick, determined,
and effective policy response has helped mitigate the impact on the economy and ensured
that China has led the global recovery.
Public infrastructure spending was quickly increased, taxes were lowered, the government put
in place incentives to boost purchases of consumer durables, and pensions, social transfers,
healthcare and education spending were all raised. At the same time, interest rates and
reserve requirements were lowered and limits on credit growth were removed, leading to an
extraordinary surge in bank lending.
These policies were instrumental in arresting the downward momentum to both activity and
confidence. Growth began to pick up in the second quarter of 2009 and reached an average

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

for the year of 9.1 percent. Inflation moved into negative territory for much of 2009 but has
since registered a modest increase, the bulk of which has been directly attributable to higher
food prices. In the 12 months to May, the nominal effective exchange rate has depreciated by
1¼ percent while the real effective exchange rate has depreciated by 0.1 percent.
China’s recovery had significant positive spillovers to the region and the global economy,
initially through increased demand for commodities—contributing to an upswing in global
commodity prices—and later through higher imports of capital goods. The balance of
payments saw a dramatic shift with the current account falling quickly as exports slowed and
imports surged. Despite the lower current account, reserve accumulation has continued to be
rapid.
With the recovery becoming increasingly well established, the government has begun to
unwind some of its crisis response measures. Credit growth has been slowed, reserve
requirements were modestly increased, and prudential requirements related to property
lending were tightened. The government also announced that it was returning to the managed
floating regime that had been in place from July 2005 to July 2008. Fiscal policy, however,
continues to provide important support to the economy.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended China’s proactive and decisive policy response to the global
economic crisis. Growth is expected to continue to be robust, while the inflation outlook
appears benign. The policy challenge now is to calibrate the pace and sequencing of exit from
the fiscal stimulus and credit expansion, while making further progress in reorienting the
economy toward private consumption. Directors commended the Chinese authorities for their
commitment to the G-20 framework for strong, sustainable, and balanced growth.
Directors considered it appropriate that the 2010 budget maintains support for a steady
resumption of private demand. They saw room for further reorientation of the stimulus package
toward measures that promote private consumption, raise household income, lessen income
inequality, and improve the social safety net, building on recent progress. Directors supported
a gradual phase out of the fiscal stimulus in 2011, provided the current trajectory for the
economy is maintained.
Directors agreed that the targeted reduction in broad money growth this year balances well the
need to provide continued support to the economy with the desire to safeguard the health of
bank balance sheets. They encouraged the authorities to rely more on market-based
instruments to achieve this goal, including via open market operations, higher interest rates,
and reserve requirements. Directors highlighted the need for regulatory and supervisory
vigilance to manage any deterioration in credit quality, and for increased transparency in
lending to local government financing vehicles. At the same time, it would also be important to
continue to liberalize the financial system; the ongoing FSAP will provide useful guidance for
the content and sequencing of the necessary reform measures.

Directors welcomed the recent decision to return to the managed floating exchange rate
regime. This decision will increase the central bank’s flexibility to tighten monetary conditions.
Several Directors agreed that the exchange rate is undervalued. However, a number of others
disagreed with the staff’s assessment of the level of the exchange rate, noting that it is based
on uncertain forecasts of the current account surplus. Many Directors stressed that, over time,
a stronger renminbi would help facilitate a shift from exports and investment to private
consumption as the principal driver of economic growth. A number of Directors pointed to
signs that a structural shift in the balance of payments is already underway, reflecting the
reforms already put in place to strengthen consumption.
Directors commended the government for its pragmatic deployment of a range of
countervailing prudential measures to contain property price inflation. Additional measures
could be needed to address the fundamental causes of property price inflation, possibly
including consideration of a property tax and broader financial market development to provide
alternative savings vehicles.
Directors commended the authorities for the progress made in building a more effective
system of social insurance. They encouraged further steps to improve health care, expand
pension coverage, foster labor mobility, and reduce corporate savings.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
