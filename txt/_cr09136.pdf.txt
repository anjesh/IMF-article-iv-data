EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background and outlook
•

After several years of solid economic growth, real GDP growth in Namibia slowed in
2008 and is expected to decrease further in 2009 as the downturn in the mineral sector
continues.

•

High international food and fuel prices pushed inflation into double digits in 2008, but
with the sharp fall in fuel prices by year-end, it should fall back to single digits in 2009.

•

The 2007/08 fiscal balance recorded a much higher surplus than budgeted, but the
2008/09 budget envisages a large swing in the fiscal balance to deficit, which would raise
public debt close to the authorities’ target level of 25 percent of GDP.

Policy issues
•

While recognizing the need for a countercyclical fiscal expansion, staff cautioned that the
planned shift in the fiscal balance in 2008/09 went beyond what was warranted by
automatic stabilizers and risked compromising the quality of spending. The authorities
considered the budget appropriate and able to be implemented without risk to fiscal
sustainability. Staff supports the authorities’ plan for a less expansionary fiscal stance in
2009/10. For more comprehensive fiscal analysis, the authorities were receptive to the
staff recommendation that the current public debt target be expanded to include publicly
guaranteed debt and central government deposits.

•

The exchange rate peg to the rand remains a strong monetary policy anchor. The Bank of
Namibia (BoN) has found some room to deviate from the interest rate policy of the South
African Reserve Bank (SARB), although staff cautioned that as a small, open economy
with a fixed exchange rate, Namibia has limited scope for effective independent
monetary policy. Close monitoring of capital flows will be essential to allow for timely
interest rate adjustments.

•

A revision to the regulation on pension funds and life insurance companies introduced in
2008 will tighten domestic investment requirements, including a required minimum
investment in unlisted companies. Staff recommended a more modest revision to mitigate
risks to institutional investors because of limited domestic investment opportunities,
although the authorities indicated that they consider the change relatively moderate with a
sufficient phase-in period.

intensive mineral sector and limited
opportunity in the non mining sector have left unemployment high (over 30 percent), and
income inequality among the highest in the world. A high, though declining, HIV/AIDS rate
and low school enrollment continue to undermine productive capacity (Figure 1).

President Pohamba, who assumed office in 2005, is Namibia’s second president
since independence in 1990. The ruling party, SWAPO, dominates politics and holds threequarters of the seats in parliament. Elections are scheduled for November 2009.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
3.
Real GDP growth is expected to moderate to about 3 percent in 2008 from
4.1 percent in 2007, reflecting a downturn in the mineral sector and the lagged impact
of monetary tightening in 2007 (Figure 2).1 Activity in the mineral sector slowed abruptly
in late 2008: in November, the copper company suspended mining operations as prices fell
sharply, while the main diamond company cut production following a significant drop in
demand and large inventory accumulation.
4.
Large increases in international food and fuel prices pushed inflation into double
digits in 2008. The 12-month inflation rate rose sharply during the first half of the year and
remained at 10.9 percent in December, compared with 7 percent a year before (Figure 2).
Although world fuel prices fell significantly in late 2008, this was partly offset by the sharp
depreciation of the Namibian dollar, limiting the pass-through to domestic prices. As a major
trading partner with a one-to-one currency peg to the South African rand, domestic prices in
Namibia continue to closely follow inflation in South Africa.

5.
The 2007/08 (April–March) fiscal surplus, including extrabudgetary expenditure,
was 4.5 percent of GDP, compared with the budgeted 0.2 percent. Stronger revenue
performance was driven by a significant improvement in tax administration, increased
mineral export taxes due to high commodity prices, and strong SACU receipts. The large
fiscal surplus was also partly due to lower than budgeted capital expenditure.
6.
The 2008/09 budget envisages a sharp swing in the fiscal balance to a deficit, with
an unprecedented increase in expenditure (Figure 3). The fiscal balance is projected to
shift to a deficit of 5.7 percent of GDP, a swing of over 10 percent of GDP from the 2007/08
outturn. Budgeted current and capital expenditures are considerably higher than the average
for the past three years, with externally financed capital expenditure projected at 3.7 percent
of GDP compared to 0.6 percent in 2007/08. While revenue performance in the first two
quarters of 2008/09 remained strong, the impact of falling global demand could dampen it for
the rest of the fiscal year. Should the budget be fully implemented, public debt would rise to
24.8 percent of GDP, close to the authorities’ target of 25 percent.
7.
The current account surplus is projected to fall to 2 percent of GDP in 2008,
reflecting declining terms of trade and substantial imports for mineral exploration and
public infrastructure projects (Figure 4). The terms of trade decline mostly reflected the
collapse in mineral export prices from historic peaks in recent years. Although capital
outflows—mostly through pension funds—slowed, they remained large. Official
international reserves increased to an equivalent of 3.7 months of imports of goods and
services in December 2008, up from 3 months at end-2007. In line with the South African
rand, the Namibian dollar depreciated by 26 percent against the U.S. dollar during 2008,
roughly two-thirds of which took place during September–December.
8.
The BoN reduced its repo rate by 50 basis points in December 2008 in response
to slowing economic activity and moderating inflation, in line with the move by the
SARB. This left the rate at 10 percent, still 150 basis points below the SARB repo rate, after
the BoN opted not to follow three SARB rate increases in 2007–08 (Figure 5). The BoN also
modified its operational framework in 2008, introducing a seven-day repo facility as the key
monetary policy instrument and increasing issuance of BoN bills in order to manage liquidity
and provide an alternative asset for banks to meet statutory asset requirements. Growth in
credit to the private sector slowed drastically in 2008 as a result of monetary tightening in
2007,2 falling to 5.6 percent in November (year on year) from 13 percent in December 2007.

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Global Outlook and Risks
9.
Namibia’s real GDP growth is projected to slow to 1 percent in 2009, despite the
large fiscal expansion, as external demand weakens further. Mining output is expected to
fall significantly, and after slowing dramatically in late 2008, investment in mineral
exploration is likely to remain weak. The marked tightening in international financial
markets could also jeopardize several investment projects expected to be the main drivers of
medium-term growth, including investments in electricity generation and water desalination.
The authorities agreed that output growth was likely to slow in 2009, but projected real GDP
growth of roughly 2 percent during the November 2008 mission, when the global
environment was still more benign.
10. There is potential for a more significant slowdown in 2009 if a protracted global
downturn results in an even sharper decline in mining output. Preliminary reports
indicate that the diamond industry is considering a reduction in output of as much as
40 percent relative to initial plans for 2009 in response to concerns that demand will weaken
further. In addition, a more significant slowdown in South Africa than currently envisaged
could further reduce the SACU revenue pool. As an illustrative scenario, if both of those
risks should materialize, real GDP is projected to decline by roughly 0.5 percent, compared
with an increase of 1 percent projected in the baseline. In addition, the current account would
shift to a deficit of 2 percent of GDP compared to a projected surplus of 0.8 percent, while
the 2009/10 fiscal deficit would widen from the projected 2.3 percent of GDP to nearly
5 percent.
11. Further depreciation of the Namibian dollar could put upward pressure on
inflation through increased import prices. While the decline in international food and fuel
prices should help moderate inflation in 2009, the rapid depreciation raises the risk of a
substantial increase in imported inflation that could constrain the scope for monetary easing
within the CMA.
B. Maintaining Macroeconomic Stability
Fiscal policy
12.
The authorities considered the planned fiscal expansion in 2008/09 an
appropriate countercyclical response to the economic downturn that would support
growth and address infrastructure deficiencies. The authorities were optimistic that the
budget would be fully executed, including the planned 7 percent of GDP increase in
spending, and that implementation capacity would not pose a significant constraint, given the
high import content of expenditure. Moreover, the budget implies that public debt would
remain within the 25 percent of GDP target, limiting the risks to macroeconomic stability.

13
13.
Staff agreed that an expansionary fiscal stance was appropriate given the
economic slowdown, but cautioned that the magnitude of the planned increase appears
large and expressed concern about compromising the quality of spending. Taking into
consideration the import content of expenditure, the historical implementation rate, and the
expected impact of the slowdown on mining sector revenue, staff estimated that a deficit of
2.6 percent of GDP for 2008/09 would be a more likely outcome. Staff also considered a
deficit in this range to be a more appropriate fiscal target to safeguard macroeconomic
stability, while still entailing a strong discretionary fiscal impulse.
14.
The authorities indicated that the increase in spending in the 2008/09 budget
would be largely one-off, with a decline planned for 2009/10–2010/11, as described in
their Medium-term Expenditure Framework (MTEF; 2008/09–2010/11). They explained
that spending will remain higher than the recent trend in order to address infrastructure
bottlenecks and reduce poverty, but that the fiscal deficit will be less than during 2008/09.
Staff supported the less expansionary fiscal stance planned for 2009/10. However, a staff
projection based on the authorities’ MTEF indicates that authorities’ target of a 25 percent
public debt-to-GDP ratio would be breeched by 2011/12.

is expected to fall by about 2
percent of GDP during 2008/09–2010/11, with further declines likely in the medium term,
given the planned transformation of Southern African Development Community (SADC)
into a customs union and the planned Economic Partnership Agreement between countries in
the region and the EU. The authorities’ medium-term fiscal projection does not appear to
have taken these risks sufficiently into consideration. The deficit in the overall balance
excluding SACU and mineral revenue is projected to increase from 10.6 percent of GDP in
2007/08 to 19.6 percent in 2008/09, despite a healthy surplus in 2007/08.

16.
Staff agreed that a public debt target of 25 percent of GDP continues to provide
an appropriate fiscal policy anchor, but recommended that the definition of public debt
be expanded to include publicly guaranteed debt and be adjusted for government
deposits. The anchor is consistent with research indicating that on average the sustainable
level of public debt for emerging market economies is about 25 percent of GDP and does not
breech the threshold for debt intolerance derived in a recent staff study.3 Given the volatility
of cyclical revenue booms and a significant increase in publicly guaranteed debt, staff
considered that a broader definition of ‘net public and publicly guaranteed debt’4 would
better anchor the fiscal stance and safeguard against surprise calls of publicly guaranteed
debt. The authorities generally agreed, with the inclusion of government deposits in the
coverage addressing their concern about a possible lack of fiscal space under the new
definition. However, they could not commit to a timeframe for implementation.

1/ "Overall balance" reflects externally financed project spending (except for roads) that is not channeled through the state
account. "Overall balance excluding extrabudgetary spending" excludes such spending and thus corresponds directly with the

2/ The change in domestic debt includes bonds issued for local capital market development.

17.
Staff’s alternative scenario achieves a reduction of net public and publicly
guaranteed debt to the 25 percent of GDP target through two main modifications. First,
the scenario assumes that the planned reforms of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) will result
in a gradual decline in their need for budgetary support and debt guarantees starting in
2010/11. The anticipated reforms of SOEs include improvements in operational efficiency
and in financial management by tightening the criteria on publicly guaranteed debt of SOEs,
consistent with the public and publicly guaranteed debt target. Second, the scenario adjusts
the planned level of capital expenditure to reflect historical implementation rates. Estimates
of public debt sustainability confirm that the level of public debt is largely sustainable.5 The
simulations were sensitive, however, to declining SACU revenue, increases in publicly
guaranteed debt, and a moderation of recent high GDP growth rates.
18. The authorities have made considerable progress in reforming public financial
management. Revenue administration was strengthened through the introduction of
comprehensive auditing of value added tax (VAT) refunds, and there are plans to expand the
mineral tax to all minerals. The use of the Integrated Financial Management System has
improved utilization of resources and prevented diversion of funds, while the first Annual
Accountability Report on budget implementation prepared for 2006/07 will further
strengthen budget execution and make the budgetary process more transparent. The
authorities are also working to improve program budgeting and revenue forecasting, which is
crucial for efficient fiscal management.

5

See Debt Sustainability Analysis Annex.

16
19. Staff recommended consolidating extrabudgetary project expenditure into
regular budget reporting in order to provide more comprehensive coverage. This would
not only enhance transparency, but also allow for a more comprehensive assessment of the
overall fiscal balance and the macroeconomic impact of fiscal policy.
20. The authorities are moving forward with fiscal decentralization and exploring
how best to effectively use public-private partnerships (PPP). Staff commended recent
progress on decentralization, but suggested a more comprehensive approach to fiscal
relations between the central and lower tiers of government, with clear guidelines on revenue
and expenditure assignments, transfers and subsidies, and financing and borrowing.6 The
authorities agreed with this recommendation, and noted that they were formulating a
formula-based intergovernmental fiscal allocation mechanism with minimum standards for
fiscal accountability. The authorities also agreed on the importance of establishing a clear
legal and institutional framework for implementing PPP projects, clearly identifying and
disclosing the fiscal risks associated with such projects.
Pursuing external stability
21.
The authorities stressed that the peg of the Namibian dollar to the rand has
underpinned Namibia’s deep economic and financial ties with South Africa. Although
the significant recent depreciation and prolonged current account surplus may suggest a
possible undervaluation, staff’s assessment suggests that the real effective exchange rate
(REER) is not significantly different from the equilibrium level and is broadly consistent
with external stability (Box 1). The REER depreciated by 9 percent in real terms from
the end of 2007 through November 2008, but this follows an appreciation of more than
30 percent from

Box 1. An Assessment of External Stability
The equilibrium real exchange rate approach suggests that Namibia’s REER may be
undervalued. An econometric analysis of behavioral determinants of the equilibrium
REER1—trade openness, investment rate, broad money, and relative productivity against
main trading partners—indicates that Namibia’s REER is undervalued. However, these
estimates are highly volatile, depending on the assumption about the smoothing factor for
the fundamentals, an important consideration for a commodity exporting country like
Namibia. The magnitude of the undervaluation ranges from 13 to 20 percent, depending on
the period considered.

However, the macroeconomic balance approach finds the current REER to be
overvalued. The underlying current account deficit is estimated to about 4.5 percent of
GDP, while the current account norm stands at 4 percent. This results in an overvaluation
of 11 percent assuming that current account elasticity with respect to the REER is about
0.8.
Overall, these results do not provide conclusive evidence that the REER was not
aligned with its equilibrium value at the end of 2008 and the findings do not indicate
substantial risks to external stability.

WP/07/191, is based on data for 1980–2007.

22.
Improving competitiveness is essential to stimulate Namibia’s growth and
reduce high unemployment. The country’s main strengths remain its strong institutions and
good infrastructure. However, labor skill shortages and complicated business registration and
licensing procedures continue to undermine firms’ competitiveness. With the support of the
World Bank and the EU, Namibia’s Strategic Plan for Education and Training Sector
Improvement Program (2005–20) aims to make the education system more effective. To
promote investment and trade, a “one stop-shop” has been established to facilitate fast-track
processing of regulatory requirements.

Monetary policy and financial stability
Monetary policy
23.
The BoN did not follow the SARB interest rate hikes from December 2007
through June 2008, considering that further monetary tightening was not necessary
given moderating inflation. The authorities maintain that capital controls allow them to
retain some scope for independent monetary policy within the CMA. The BoN requires that
domestic assets of commercial banks be equal to or greater than their domestic liabilities, and
limits their foreign assets to one-half their level of equity capital. While the exchange rate
peg to the rand remains the monetary policy anchor, the BoN considers that these constraints
on capital movement provide some discretion to deviate from the SARB repo rate without
significantly affecting capital flows. Also, to ensure the stability of the fixed peg, the BoN
maintains foreign exchange reserves well above the level necessary to cover currency in
circulation and monthly average capital outflows.
24.
Staff agreed that the current deviation from the SARB repo rate poses little risk at
present, provided that the BoN maintains sufficient international reserves. Staff noted,
however, that as a small, open economy with a fixed exchange rate as a member of CMA,
Namibia has limited scope for an effective independent monetary policy. Although the

19
current capital controls constrain banks to some extent, there remain a wide range of other
possible channels for capital to move back and forth from South Africa, which keeps money
market and deposit rates closely linked to rates in South Africa.
Financial stability
25.
The global financial crisis has had little direct impact on the Namibian financial
sector, which has benefited from continued prudent supervision by the BoN. Banks in
Namibia appear to have been well-protected by conservative lending practices and little
direct overseas exposure, and remain well-provisioned and profitable. The expected entrance
of a fifth bank in 2009 is expected to increase competition within the sector. Nonperforming
loans are at very low levels despite a modest increase in 2008, but can be expected to
increase as the real economy continues to slow. Given that banks have relatively high
concentration to real estate and consumer lending, the banking system may be exposed to
higher risks.
26.
The BoN has acted quickly to curb pyramid schemes. It closed down one such
scheme in 2008, and has initiated a public awareness campaign to deter others. The
authorities plan to increase consultation within the CMA on the issue, given similar problems
elsewhere in the region and will participate in an IMF workshop on the issue in early 2009.
The BoN has also continued to strengthen its stress-testing framework and will move forward
with implementation of Basel II in 2009.
27.
The capacity of the Namibia Financial Institutions Supervisory Authority
(NAMFISA) is increasing, but the authorities recognize the need for further
improvement. A new law to consolidate regulation of nonbank institutions and clearly
define NAMFISA’s supervisory authority is expected to be approved by the end of 2009.
NAMFISA has also introduced regular standardized reporting for pension funds and
insurance companies that should help address deficiencies in data collection and monitoring
and is implementing a risk-based auditing system.
28. The government is considering modifications to the tighter domestic investment
requirements introduced for pension funds and life insurance companies in 2008 to
address market uncertainty about their interpretation. The new regulation, which was to
be phased-in over five years beginning in 2009, limits dual-listed companies (largely traded
in South Africa) to a maximum of 10 percent of local assets and requires a minimum of
5 percent of total assets to be invested in unlisted Namibian companies. The previous
regulation permitted investment in dual-listed companies to be counted toward the 35 percent
domestic investment requirement, with no required minimum investment in unlisted
companies.
29. The authorities consider the revision an important step to help channel high
domestic savings to support economic growth. They indicated that the previous regulation
was not working as envisaged, given that the domestic investment requirement was mostly

20
met through investment in dual-listed companies that also trade in South Africa, and that they
considered the revision a relatively modest change with a sufficient phase-in period. The
authorities maintained that it would not create undue risk for these funds and cited the
example of many other emerging market economies with similar requirements.
30. Staff encouraged the authorities to consider a more moderate change to the
requirements on domestic investment. Staff agreed that a modest revision to direct a larger
share of investment into local assets rather than dual-listed shares could be appropriate, but
cautioned that there are insufficient instruments to absorb efficiently the significant volume
of capital inflows that the new regulation would require. The limited number of domestically
listed companies and corporate and government bonds are mostly held by buy-and-hold
investors and do not trade in sufficient volume or size to absorb the capital inflow. In
addition, staff noted the higher risk associated with the required allocation in unlisted
companies and the implications for insurance reserves and pension savings. Experience with
investment in unlisted domestic companies by the government pension fund in the mid-1990s
raises significant concerns about excessive risk associated with these investments.
C. Poverty Reduction and Structural Reforms
31.
The authorities have taken several measures to address poverty and alleviate the
temporary impact of high food and fuel prices. These include a zero-rate value-added tax
on selected food items, rebate facilities for food importers, and a food distribution program to
feed the most vulnerable. The authorities restated their commitment to combating poverty
and expanding the social safety net and noted that the 2008/09 budget increased payments to
the elderly, orphans and vulnerable children, and war veterans’ allowances. The mission
supported additional but targeted social safety support and recommended that any increase
should be accommodated by reallocation of resources within the existing budget envelope.
32.
The National Development Plan 3 (NDP3) (2007/08–2011/12) aims to achieve
sustainable economic growth and reduce poverty. Under NDP3, the authorities plan to
focus resources on the poorest and the most vulnerable, improve the social safety net to
alleviate poverty and inequality, and foster competitiveness to promote growth and
employment. Each ministry is required to develop a strategic plan consistent with the MTEF,
with a firm focus on monitoring and evaluation of outputs.
33.
Unemployment and HIV/AIDS remain the major challenges to overcoming
poverty. The Labor Act of 2007, enacted in 2008, aims to provide greater protection to
workers while acknowledging that the business sector needs flexibility and cost
competitiveness in staffing. Under the National Strategic Plan on HIV/AIDS, Namibia has
made good progress in expanding the availability of anti-retroviral treatment (ART), with
about 80 percent of those in need currently receiving treatment. Progress on prevention
remains a priority, however, and reliance on external funding could jeopardize the long-term
provision of ART.

21
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
The macroeconomic outlook faces significant downside risks from the slowing
global economy. Real GDP growth is projected to slow to 1 percent in 2009, with the
potential for a much more significant slowdown if weakening global demand results in
further cuts in mining activity. However, the decline in world food and fuel prices toward the
end of 2008 should bring the inflation rate back down to single digits in 2009.
35.
Although countercyclical fiscal policy is appropriate in the context of the
economic slowdown, the budget for 2008/09 appears too expansionary. A less
expansionary fiscal stance would allow for a more gradual increase in capital expenditure,
while remaining within the target for the net public debt-to-GDP ratio over the medium term.
In this regard, the more modest fiscal deficit projected for 2009/10 appears appropriate. SOE
reform remains a priority to improve their operational efficiency and reduce the need for
budgetary support for these enterprises.
36.
The exchange rate peg to the rand remains a strong monetary policy anchor. The
BoN has found some room to deviate from the interest rate policy of the SARB, although the
peg and close financial links with South Africa are likely to constrain the scope for effective
independent monetary policy over the longer-term. It will be important to maintain sufficient
international reserves and monitor capital flows closely to allow timely adjustment of interest
rates. At present, staff’s analysis does not indicate substantial risks to external stability and
the real exchange rate appears broadly in line with equilibrium, with the estimates subject to
considerable uncertainty.
37.
The turbulence in international financial markets seems to have had little impact
as yet on the banking sector. The banks are well-capitalized and very profitable, with a low
level of non-performing loans, although the authorities will need to remain vigilant as the
economic downturn advances in 2009, especially given a high concentration of real estate
and consumer loans.
38.
Consideration should be given to easing the new regulation on domestic
investment requirements for pension fund and life insurance companies. The authorities’
plan to phase in the changes will help smooth the transition, but further flexibility to mitigate
the risks to institutional investors would be desirable.
39.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Exchange rate arrangement
The Namibia dollar is pegged at par to the South African rand, and both currencies are legal
tender in Namibia. Namibia formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3,
and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement, as of September 20, 1996, and maintains an
exchange rate system free of restrictions in the making of transfers and payments of current
account transactions. The mission will update this assessment.
Article IV consultations
Namibia is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle; the last Article IV
consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on January 18, 2008.
During the Executive Board meeting, Directors commended the authorities' sound
macroeconomic management, which, together with a favorable external environment, has led
to robust economic growth, subdued inflation, and large current account surpluses. Directors
stressed, however, that improved expenditure prioritization is needed within the context of
the new medium-term expenditure framework. Directors considered that the exchange rate
peg to the South African rand remains appropriate, but stressed the importance for policy
interest rate differentials with South Africa to be limited to levels that do not destabilize
capital flows or official reserves. Directors also stressed the importance of further progress in
addressing the HIV/AIDS pandemic, high unemployment, and large disparities of income.

III. STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance
purposes. Significant lags and revisions of key macroeconomic data continue to hamper staff
analysis. Namibia is participating in the SDDS and the monetary and financial statistics
modules of the Anglophone Africa project (funded by the U.K. Department for International
Development (DFID)). GDDS metadata were posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards
Bulletin Board on December 19, 2002. Since then, metadata on central government debt were
updated in November 2003 while metadata for the financial and external sectors were
updated in May 2005.
Real sector statistics
2.
The Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) recently released updated national accounts
data for 2000-2007 that significantly revised the previous series for both constant and current
prices. The revisions reflect the introduction of an expanded data survey that has resulted in a
substantial upward adjustment to estimates of output, particularly in the mining, services and
manufacturing sectors. In addition, the constant price series was rebased from 1995 to 2004
prices, with adjustments to the deflators used for a number of sectors. As a result, gross
domestic product measured in current prices has increased by an average of 14 percent for
the period 2000-2007 over previous estimates, while growth in real GDP increased by an
average of 0.7 percentage points. A regional real sector advisor covering Botswana,
Mauritius and, Namibia assisted the CBS with these improvements. However, further efforts
are needed to compile and disseminate seasonally adjusted QNA estimates and to improve
existing source data.
3.
In February 2005, the government introduced a nation-wide consumer price index to
replace the previous index that only covered the capital city of Windhoek. The new index is
available from January 2002.
4.
Data on the labor market, including labor force, employment, and wages are not
systematically collected, which impedes the analysis of labor market developments. The last
labor market survey was conducted in 2004.
Government finance statistics
5.
Annual fiscal data on budgetary central government through 2003 have been
disseminated in the 2007 GFS Yearbook and IFS. These data, which are reported on a cash
basis in the GFSM 2001 format, are reasonably complete, despite some gaps in terms of
details. The African Department receives actual fiscal data (including government debt)
several months after the end of the fiscal year. No data on budget implementation during the
fiscal year are provided.

8
6.
Expenditure data of line ministries are not available in a timely manner after the end
of the fiscal year, and are also subject to frequent revisions; however, preliminary general
ledger data related to the 2006/07 fiscal year were received by the area department relatively
quickly following the end of the fiscal year, contrary to past practice. Overall, the system for
providing expenditure information needs to be strengthened, and preliminary information on
cash expenditures of ministries should be made available on a regular basis and more
quickly. Similarly, the reconciliation of above-the-line fiscal data with financing data should
be conducted on a regular and timely basis.
Monetary and financial statistics
7.
Monthly monetary statistics for the Bank of Namibia (BoN) and the other depository
corporations (ODCs) are reported on a regular basis, although there is room for improving
the timeliness of reporting particularly with regard to BoN data. Beginning in April 2002,
data are based on standardized report forms which accord with the concepts and definitions
of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. The coverage of the ODC sector was
expected to include unit trusts beginning in September 2008. The consistency in inter-ODCs
positions as well as between the ODCs and BoN has improved substantially. In July 2008, an
STA technical assistance mission assisted BoN staff in developing a base call report form for
collecting quarterly balance sheet data from other financial corporations (OFCs).
External sector statistics
8.
Since 2001, the BoN has been reporting the balance of payments data on a quarterly
basis with a lag of one quarter. Those data are subject to substantial revisions. The
methodology underlying the balance of payments is consistent with the fifth edition of the
IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual and is well documented. The international investment
position (IIP) data are compiled quarterly with a lag of one quarter. Through a series of three
missions between January 2003 and May 2004, the Bank of Namibia received Fund TA to
improve the compilation of the capital and financial transactions and IIP statistics. However,
further work is needed to expand the coverage of the IIP and restate the IIP in a format that
will allow for comparison with the balance of payments statistics.

IV. FISCAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
1.
At end-2008, Namibia’s public debt is estimated at about N$14.1 billion,
(20.2 percent of GDP). About a third of the debt is owed to bilateral and multilateral foreign
creditors, while the rest is domestic debt. Since 2004, domestic debt has declined gradually
from around 28 percent of GDP due to strong fiscal consolidation and prudent fiscal policies.
Privatization receipt of 1.3 percent of GDP in 2006, from the sale of a telecommunications
firm, contributed to the decline. On current projections, the debt-to-GDP ratio will rise
steadily in the medium term, reaching 28.1 percent in 2013, driven largely by rising external
debt.
2.
The baseline scenario underlying the macroeconomic framework assumes that the
central government primary budget balance moves from a substantial surplus in 2007 to a
deficit in 2008, and remains so throughout the projection period. During the same period,
revenue and grants decline by about 2 percentage points of GDP, mainly due to declining
SACU revenue. Primary expenditure increases by around 4 percentage point of GDP owing
to a large increase in foreign financed project expenditure in 2008. Expenditure remains at
around 31 percent of GDP in the projection period due mainly to continuous future
commitments to foreign financed projects. As a result of these, the public debt ratio rises
from around 20.2 percent of GDP in 2007 to 28.1 percent in 2013. Reflecting the more
expansionary fiscal stance relative to revenue receipts, public debt to revenue ratio, which
was 63 percent in 2007, gradually increases to around 97.3 percent by the end of the
projection period.
3.
Table 1 shows two additional scenarios. The first shows the fiscal outcome if real
GDP growth, real interest rates, and the primary balance are maintained at their historical
10 year averages. In this case, instead of remaining stable around 20 percent of GDP, the
public debt ratio declines by about 3.3 percentage point of GDP by 2013. The projected
decline reflects the relatively more benign historical levels of the key variables, as well as a
prudent fiscal stance that delivered primary surpluses in the recent past. The second scenario
shows the outcome if government’s policies in 2008 remain unchanged, with the result that
the primary deficit for the projection period remains at the 1.6 percent of GDP. In this case,
public debt rises to 28.8 percent of GDP by the end of the forecast period. In all, relative to
the 2007 Debt Sustainability Analysis, debt indicators have worsened.
4.
The bounds tests illustrate the vulnerability of the fiscal position to exogenous shocks
(Figure 1). The results show that with different levels of standard deviation shock to key
indicators, the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to increase by between 4 to 8 percentage points
of GDP depending on the shock. The most benign shock is that from real interest rate, which
nevertheless could result in up to 4 percentage point increase in the debt to GDP ratio, while
the 10 percent of GDP increase in public and publicly guaranteed debt in 2009, results in
more than 10 percentage point increase in the debt to GDP ratio. The inclusion of a country

11
specific shock of around 2 percentage point of GDP annual decline in SACU revenue starting
from 2009, also worsens the debt to GDP ratio.1
5.
A further analysis of the extent to which Namibia is overborrowing confirms that
Namibia is at low risk of default. A government is overborrowing if the ratio of actual public
debt to the benchmark level of debt (calculated as the present discounted value of expected
future primary surpluses) is greater than 1.2 The analysis, based on a benchmark model of
constant primary balance using 10 year historical average; and comparing the public debt to
GDP ratio in the baseline and benchmark models indicates an overborrowing range of around
0.1 in 2013 to 0.6 percent in 2013, much less than the 2½ times median value found for
emerging market economies that are at risk of default.
6.
The authorities’ fiscal policy has been anchored on maintaining a public debt ratio of
25 percent of GDP. Though this was achieved in the recent past, positive shocks to both
SACU revenue and strong performance in diamond production have been instrumental to the
debt reduction. While the debt to GDP ratio remains sustainable and is still relatively low,
declining SACU revenue and higher contingent liabilities from publicly guaranteed debts
could change the outcome. In light of government’s plan to increase infrastructure spending
consistent with the objectives of the National Development Plan 3, especially by raising
foreign financed debt, debt ratios would rise above the target. As SACU revenues decline,
and in the presence of additional negative shocks to the economy from declining mining
production, the impact of these on the debt to GDP ratio could be substantial. The authorities
will need to improve tax administration and reduce expenditures to moderate the impact from
declining SACU and mineral revenue. In addition, including publicly guaranteed debt in the
target would allow for appropriate policy to focus on the growth of publicly guaranteed debt.
Without these efforts, the public debt ratio could rise substantially.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
April 15, 2009

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
Namibia
On February 27, 2009 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Namibia. 1
Background
Real GDP growth is expected to moderate to about 3 percent in 2008 from 4.1 percent in 2007,
reflecting a downturn in the mining sector owing to the global economic slowdown, and the
lagged impact of monetary tightening in 2007. The external current account surplus is expected
to fall to 2 percent of GDP in 2008 on account of declining terms of trade and substantial
imports for mineral exploration and public infrastructure projects. Official international reserves
have increased to an equivalent of 3.7 months of imports of goods and services in December
2008, up from 3 months at end-2007.
Large increases in international food and fuel prices pushed inflation into double digits in 2008.
The 12-month inflation rate rose sharply during the first half of the year and remained at
10.9 percent in December, compared with 7 percent a year before. In line with the South African
Reserve Bank (SARB) rate cut, the Bank of Namibia (BoN) reduced its repo rate by 50 basis
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
points in December 2008. This left the rate at 10 percent, still 150 basis points below the SARB
repo rate, after the BoN opted not to follow three SARB rate increases in 2007–08. Mirroring the
weakening of the South African rand, the Namibian dollar depreciated by 26 percent against the
U.S. dollar during 2008, roughly two-thirds of which took place during September-December.
The 2007/08 (April-March) fiscal balance recorded a much higher surplus than budgeted,
reflecting stronger revenue performance driven by high commodity prices and an improvement
in tax administration. Accordingly the 2008/09 budget envisages a large swing in the fiscal
balance to a deficit, which would raise public debt close to the authorities’ target level of
25 percent of GDP.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities’ sound macroeconomic management, which
had contributed to solid growth and strong external and fiscal positions. The global economic
and financial turmoil has, however, worsened the near-term outlook. In particular, the
deterioration of the global economy has led to a downturn in the mineral sector, which could be
more pronounced in the event of a prolonged global crisis. Directors recommended continued
pursuit of sound macroeconomic policies and determined implementation of structural reforms
to accelerate growth in the non-mineral sectors of the economy with a view to reducing
unemployment and poverty.
Directors noted that the authorities’ prudent fiscal policies in recent years have created fiscal
space to support growth and address infrastructure needs. They agreed that some loosening of
the fiscal stance in 2008/09 was appropriate in view of the economic slowdown. At the same
time, Directors cautioned that the planned fiscal expansion is sizable, and should not
compromise the quality of spending. A less expansionary fiscal stance would allow for a more
gradual increase in capital expenditure, while safeguarding fiscal sustainability. Directors
welcomed the authorities’ intention to broaden the definition of the public debt target to include
publicly guaranteed debt and central government deposits, while stressing the need to keep in
place a strong and appropriately defined fiscal anchor. They encouraged the authorities to
continue to strengthen public financial management and revenue administration.
Directors considered that the exchange rate peg to the South African rand continues to serve
Namibia well in view of the large trade and capital flows between the two countries. They noted
the staff’s assessment that the real effective exchange rate appears broadly in line with
equilibrium. While the Bank of Namibia has found some room to deviate from the interest rate
policy of the South African Reserve Bank, Directors considered that the peg and close financial
links with South Africa are likely to constrain the scope for effective independent monetary policy
over the longer-term. In this connection, they stressed the importance of maintaining sufficient
international reserves and monitoring closely capital flows so as to adjust interest rates in a
timely manner as necessary.

3
Directors noted that the turbulence in international financial markets has so far had little
immediate impact on the banking sector, as banks remain well-capitalized with a low level of
non-performing loans. Nonetheless, they urged the authorities to remain vigilant as the
economic downturn advances in 2009, especially given a high concentration of real estate and
consumer loans.
Directors encouraged the authorities to press ahead with their structural reform agenda so as to
improve the country’s competitiveness, diversify the economy, and bolster growth prospects.
They noted the authorities’ intention to phase in the tightening in domestic investment
requirements for pension fund and life insurance companies, while monitoring the developments
closely and making adjustments as necessary to mitigate the risks to institutional investors.
Directors encouraged the authorities to implement the planned reforms of state-owned
enterprises with a view to reducing their burden on the budget. Sustained further efforts are
needed to address the high unemployment and HIV/AIDS challenges.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Samuel Itam, Executive Director for Namibia
February 27, 2009
1.
The Namibian authorities value the constructive engagement and policy dialogue with
Fund staff. They also appreciate the support of the Executive Board and Management. They
find the staff report and selected issues paper informative and useful.
Economic performance and prospects
2.
The Namibian authorities have pursued sound macroeconomic policies, which have
resulted in solid economic performance over the last few years. However, real GDP growth
was expected to moderate to below 3 percent in 2008 from 4.1 percent in 2007, reflecting
weaker external demand for the country’s exports as well as the impact of monetary
tightening since the second half of 2007. Domestic economic activity in the mining sector
slowed rapidly in the second half of 2008 due to rapid deterioration in global economic
conditions and falling commodity prices. While economic activity is likely to remain weak in
2009, the authorities are implementing countercyclical measures and are prepared to adopt
additional suitable measures to support growth. These include bringing down the central
bank’s policy rate by 150 basis points since December 2008 and spearheading high-level
consultations between Government and the private sector on possible policy responses.
3.
Increases in global food and fuel prices in 2008 pushed inflation into double digits for
the first time since 2002. Annual inflation increased to 10.3 percent in 2008 from 6.7 percent
in 2007. Food price inflation, which accounts for 30 percent of the CPI basket, peaked to 18
percent in the twelve months through October 2008, before declining to 16.5 percent in
December 2008 due to a decline in a global food prices. In addition, a decline in global fuel
prices in the second half of 2008, is expected to significantly dampen further inflationary
pressures. However, the authorities are aware that the sharp depreciation of the Namibia
dollar over the same period, may limit the full-pass-through of the oil price effect into
domestic prices. Domestic price developments in Namibia continue to closely follow the path
of inflation in South Africa, mainly due to exchange rate parity and the strong trade linkage
between the two economies.

Fiscal policy
4.
The Namibian authorities remain committed to prudent fiscal policy. In 2007/08 fiscal
year, the fiscal outturn, including extrabudgetary capital expenditure, registered a surplus of
4.5 percent of GDP, much larger than budgeted. This strong performance stemmed from a
stricter enforcement of tax regime, and aggressive collection of tax arrears from corporations
and self-employed individuals. In addition, strong commodity prices boosted mineral export
taxes, while SACU receipts remained strong. Lower than budgeted capital expenditure also
supported the fiscal outturn.
5.
The fiscal stance in 2008/09 fiscal year, however, targets a deficit of around 5.0
percent of GDP, mostly reflecting large increases in capital expenditures such as, power
supply, rural development, and roads and rail networks. Notwithstanding the large expected
deficit, compared to a surplus in the previous year, public debt will continue to remain below
the authorities’ target of 25 percent.
6.
The Namibian authorities remain committed to enlarging the fiscal space, through
strengthening revenue collection. They are aware of the emerging risks of SACU revenues,
and are mindful of the volatility of the SACU, mining, and other receipts, and continue to
reflect these in their spending decisions. Moreover, they are gearing their efforts towards a
broad-based and effective domestic tax system.
Monetary and exchange rate policy
7.
The Namibian authorities view the exchange rate peg to the rand as an appropriate
monetary policy anchor. Being a member of the Common monetary area (CMA), the
authorities are aware of their limited scope for independent monetary policy. However,
capital controls (domestic asset requirements) provided for within the CMA arrangement,
could allow member countries to exercise with limited extent, an independent monetary
policy. Recently, the Bank of Namibia opted not to follow the South African Reserve Bank’s
interest rate hikes, as they considered that further monetary tightening was not necessary
given the moderating inflation and slowdown in the economy. Also, to further enhance the
efficacy of monetary policy, the Bank of Namibia introduced a seven-day repo facility to help
manage liquidity and provide an alternative instrument to commercial banks to meet statutory
asset requirements.
8.
The foreign exchange reserves level has remained well above the central bank’s
target. The level increased to about 4.5 months of imports cover in December 2008,
compared to 3.2 months of cover for the same period in the previous year. In line with the
South African rand, the Namibia dollar depreciated by 26 percent against the U.S dollar
during 2008.
Financial sector
9.
The global financial crisis has had little direct impact on the Namibian financial
sector, which has benefited from continued prudent supervisory and regulatory framework.

3
Commercial banks in Namibia are sound, profitable, and well capitalized; and their balance
sheets have little direct overseas exposure. The authorities are mindful that a high
concentration of banks’ loan portfolios to real estate and consumer lending may pose risks,
though manageable, if the economy continues to slow. They are, therefore closely monitoring
this development in the financial sector. A new law to strengthen the regulatory framework of
non-bank financial institutions under the supervision of Namibia Financial Institutions
Supervisory Authorities (NAMFISA) is under consideration and is expected to be approved
in the second half of 2009. This law will consolidate regulation of nonbank financial
institutions and give more supervisory authority to NAMFISA.
10.
The authorities consider the modest revision of domestic asset requirements for
pension funds and life insurance companies as an important step to help channel high
domestic savings to support domestic economic growth. The revision entails reducing 35
percent of domestic qualifying assets for dual-listed companies gradually over a five-year
period. The tightening of the domestic investment requirements for the dual-listed companies
is expected to encourage more domestic investment. Being cognizant of possible
distortionary effects if implemented unsystematically, the authorities plan to undertake these
reforms in phases over a five-year period to allow the development of market-based
instruments, and provide an opportunity to monitor the developments closely, in order to
make adjustments when necessary.
Poverty reduction and structural reforms
11.
The authorities launched the Third National Development Plan (NDP3) in 2008,
which aims at achieving sustainable economic growth and reducing widespread poverty.
They also focus on improving the living standards of the people, especially of the poorest and
the most vulnerable, and further improving the social safety net to alleviate poverty and
inequality. Fostering competitiveness and enhancing productivity also remain key factors in
promoting growth and creating employment under the government national development
plan.
12.
The authorities are committed to implementing program-based budgeting to help
improve accountability and prioritize government expenditure. They have also made
substantial progress in reforming public financial management. Additional measures to
strengthen revenue administration have been adopted, including the introduction of
comprehensive auditing of value added tax (VAT) refunds, and plans to extend the current
mineral tax to all minerals. The planned reform of state-owned enterprises, which include
improvements in operational efficiency and financial management by tightening the criteria
on publicly guaranteed debt, is also expected to contribute positively to enhancing public
financial management. This would lead to reduce dependency for budgetary support and debt
guarantees.
Conclusion
13.
The Namibian authorities remain committed to implementing prudent macroeconomic
policies. They consider that a countercyclical fiscal stimulus during the period of economic

4
slowdown is warranted. They are positive that this temporary fiscal expansion would not
pose risk to medium and long-term fiscal sustainability. They continue to monitor the
unfolding global economic and financial crisis and stand ready to take appropriate action to
mitigate its negative impact on the economy. As usual, they continue to count on the support
of the Fund through its technical assistance as well as policy advice to assist them overcome
current and future economic challenges.
