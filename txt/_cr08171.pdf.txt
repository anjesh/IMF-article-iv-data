Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by Staff Representatives for the 2008 Consultation with the Netherlands

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Strong macroeconomic foundations have so far largely shielded the Netherlands from financial
turbulence. In recent years, growth has been above and inflation below euro area averages. Staff
expects growth to slow to about 2 percent in 2008, which, in light of a large carryover from 2007,
reflects a rapid deceleration owing to the global turmoil and the spillover from the U.S. downturn.
The authorities’ growth projections are more sanguine. Inflation should stay subdued, slightly above
2 percent. However, with a tightening labor market, wages are anticipated to accelerate. Uncertainties
regarding the outlook are high, but risks broadly balanced. Officials concurred that external
competitiveness is broadly adequate.
Staff saw merit in a somewhat tighter fiscal stance from both cyclical and long-term
sustainability perspectives. The structural balance slipped by about ½ percent of GDP in 2007 and
would again weaken in 2008-09, net of gas receipts and interest payments. With output above
potential and mounting labor market pressures, some withdrawal of fiscal impulse would instead be
appropriate. The authorities expressed conditional support for saving potential margins under the
expenditure ceilings, as spending pressures may prevent them from doing so. For 2011, staff broadly
endorses the government target of 1 percent of GDP structural surplus. However, owing to population
aging, sustainability requires further correction (2¼ percent of GDP). Front-loading it would benefit
intergenerational equity. There was agreement that adjustment should focus on expenditure
retrenchment or tax base broadening.
The authorities concurred that structural reforms are essential to raise long-term growth and
help secure fiscal sustainability. Reforms of the tax system, social entitlements, and employment
protection, would alleviate the effects of population aging on employment, but needed consensus
among social partners will take time. Recent actions to boost competition and innovation are
welcome, although officials approach cautiously further liberalization required to stimulate
productivity, which has been lagging.
The Dutch financial system appears robust, albeit the authorities recognize some concerns.
Risk-weighted capital ratios of banks are comfortable, though return on assets remains low. Stress
tests suggest that banks can withstand the current global turmoil. The mortgage market carries low
risks, but house prices, high mortgage debt, risk concentration, and growing securitization require
careful watch. Takeover of a large Dutch bank by an international consortium typifies rising
challenges for cross-country supervision.

I. MACROECONOMIC SITUATION
1.
The Dutch economy is doing well, but important challenges lie ahead. Following
the prolonged stagnation early in the decade, a solid recovery has taken root, with growth
above and inflation below euro area averages, unemployment decreasing, and the fiscal
position strong (Figures 1-2). The expansion is set to continue, but uncertainties associated
with the recent financial market turbulence are high. Looking forward, moreover, rapid aging
and sluggish productivity are twin threats to longer-term growth, competitiveness, and fiscal
sustainability. And comparatively weak bank profitability, complex products, and growing
financial integration create new risks and supervisory challenges.
2.
Strong macroeconomic foundations have so far largely shielded the Netherlands
from recent financial turbulence. With growth of 3½ percent in 2007, output is estimated
to have topped potential (Table 1). Growth surged to 4.1 percent (y-o-y) in the second half of
2007—the highest rate in more than seven years. The expansion has been broad based, with a
rebound in consumption, strong investment, and a positive external contribution.

Despite a tightening labor market, inflation remains subdued. Employment grew
1¼–1½ percent in 2007, on par with the rest of the euro area. However, about half of the new
jobs are through temporary agencies, given strict employment protection legislation (EPL)
for permanent workers. The unemployment rate fell to 3.4 percent, less than half the euro
area average, while registered vacancies have rebounded sharply. These growing labor
market tensions notwithstanding, inflation has been restrained, reaching 2 percent only this
February.

4.
The external current account surplus remains large, and various approaches
suggest that Dutch competitiveness is satisfactory. Although mild weather dampened gas
exports in the winter of 2006-07, the underlying export performance continued to be robust.
The current account surplus reached 6¾ percent of GDP in 2007, about 1½ percentage points
off the 2006 total. These developments, as well as various measures of the real effective
exchange rate, together with application of the CGER methodology and other econometric
tests to the Netherlands, point to adequate external competitiveness (Box 1 and Figure 4).
5.
Fiscal performance, while
staying strong, was mildly pro-cyclical
in 2007. The general government balance
improved by a cumulative 3¾ percent of
GDP over 2004-06, mostly owing to
buoyant revenues. In 2007, it was
broadly unchanged, posting a modest
surplus. But in cyclically-adjusted terms
it slipped about ½ percent of GDP, in
light of the vanishing output gap (Table
2). This reflected the absence of an
expenditure ceiling during the
government interregnum as well as
discretionary decisions. Nevertheless, the
general government debt ratio, now about
46 percent of GDP, continued on its
declining path, comfortably below the
Maastricht limit.

Box 1. Netherlands’ External Competitiveness
Various standard real effective exchange
rate (REER) measures have been relatively
stable in recent years. Following a sizable
real appreciation in 2001-03, REER gauges
based on different price or cost indices have
moved little (top panel and Figure 3).
Manufacturing unit labor costs (ULCM) have
fallen for the last four years at a pace largely
on par with trading partners, and low inflation
has limited the increase in the CPI-based
REER.
However, a measure of exporter
profitability displays a marked
improvement. Proxying profitability of the
tradables sector by the ratio of the ULCMbased REER to the REER using industry
deflators suggests a persistent amelioration
since 2002, similar in magnitude to Germany
(and unlike the worsening trend for Italy and
France). This is because, although the ULCMREER has risen, the industrial-outputdeflator-REER improved even more over the
same period.

Box 1. Netherlands’ External Competitiveness (concluded)
Rapid export growth also suggests that external competitiveness is not at stake. With cumulative
real growth of almost 40 percent since 2002, Dutch export growth exceeds the Euro area average, and
lags only that in Germany among major euro area economies. Also, the growth of reexports—which
represent about half of Dutch exports in value—has been very strong.

Figure 3 shows that the Netherlands has gained overall export market share. Further, a CPB study1
indicates that, while domestically produced exports have lost market share in recent years, this loss is
much reduced if market growth is corrected by including only domestically produced exports and for
the double counting due to reexports when calculating the relevant world trade.
Sectoral analysis of Dutch export performance confirms that competitiveness is not a problem,
but with signs of erosion. The SIP shows that, in the 2000’s, the Netherlands generally preserved its
advantage in trend export growth vis-à-vis Germany. But it lost its traditional lead over Germany in
exports of manufactured goods, machinery, and transport equipment. Econometric tests also suggest
that the Netherlands is more exposed to supply-driven shocks while Germany to demand-driven
shocks.

6.
Long-term fiscal sustainability remains elusive, owing to population aging and
its attendant budgetary costs. The Netherlands is in a comparatively favorable position to
deal with this problem, given its relatively benign initial fiscal position. In addition, the
existence of a large, fully funded, pension pillar helps mitigate the burden of aging.
Nonetheless, its fiscal impact is large (about 7 percent of additional annual expenditures by
2040, mostly on account of healthcare and pension outlays). If not offset by a reduction of
aging-related entitlements, or cuts in other spending and revenue increases, this prospective
millstone would lead to an unsustainable deterioration in public finances.
7.

The Dutch financial system has proven generally resilient to the turmoil.

•

The regulatory capital ratio of Dutch depository institutions has improved from
11.9 to 13.2 percent (e-o-y) in 2007, but equity capital ratios are comparatively low.
Despite some recovery over 2003-06, return on assets remained lackluster and
noninterest expenses high in international comparison, although risks—as assessed by
commercial banks for purposes of determining capital requirements—are also low.
Corporate loans, especially short term, rose rapidly, reflecting strong investment.
While home prices held up well, mortgage lending growth fell sharply, reflecting
higher interest rates and tighter credit standards under the new Code of Conduct.1 Tax
incentives encourage high loan-to-value (LTV) mortgages, but banks generally
maintain separate collateral against them.

•

Despite losses and write-offs of about €7 billion for 2007, the large international
banks have generally small and higher-rated U.S. subprime exposure, smaller banks

have little or no exposure, and the system has remained profitable. Several affected
banks have raised significant new capital, and one major bank that reported higher
profits and dividends is implementing a share buyback.
•

The average funding ratios in the pension and insurance sectors improved in 2007.
Sectoral exposure to subprime loans is low, particularly for insurers.

productivity and low profitability in the Dutch financial sector weigh down on its ability to
support growth and adaptation of the economy. The spread of complex products, deepening
international integration, high mortgage debt, and rising securitization pose challenges—
underlined by the turmoil—about internal risk management and supervision of financial
institutions.
II. OUTLOOK
9.
Economic expansion is set to continue, albeit at a lower pace. Staff projects that
output will rise somewhat above 2 percent in 2008. With a large growth carryover from
2007, this implies a rapid within-year deceleration owing to the impact of the global financial
turmoil on U.S. and European growth. Consumption is expected to lose speed as lower
employment gains should be only partly offset by higher labor compensation. Fixed
investment will also slow somewhat, following completion of important infrastructure
projects, while the foreign contribution to growth fades. Inflation should rise moderately,
above 2 percent, with the output level remaining above potential and wages expected to
increase more than productivity amid a tightening labor market. For 2009, further growth
deceleration at about 1½ percent is anticipated, owing to the lingering effects of the financial

11.
The authorities concurred that external competitiveness is broadly adequate, but
noted risks going forward. They considered that the business sector is in a sound position
for profitability and competitiveness, but stressed the danger that buffers may be eroded
quickly if wage rises exceed productivity gains, leading to increased unit labor costs. In this
context, officials also remarked that appreciation of the euro, if continued, would rapidly
exhaust residual competitiveness margins.
12.
One important concern is the risk to longer-term growth and competitiveness
posed by rapid aging and sluggish productivity. The Netherlands experiences declining
trend productivity growth, which, despite some recent recovery, remains slower than in other
partner economies. Furthermore, imminent population aging will shrink working-age cohorts
from early the next decade. Therefore, raising the employment rate and stimulating faster

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
13.
Against this background, discussions focused on fiscal policy, structural reform,
and financial sector issues. Specifically:
•

adopting tax and public expenditure policies that promote continued economic
expansion while ensuring fiscal sustainability;

•

reforming labor and product markets to enhance utilization of soon-to-be shrinking
human resources and competition;

•

maintaining stability of the financial sector—to prevent that global market tensions
and rising volatility unleash a crisis of confidence—while raising its efficiency.
A. Fiscal Policy

14.
Staff saw merit in a somewhat tighter fiscal stance in 2008-09. The authorities’
budget plans for both years envisage surpluses of about ½ percent of GDP, which are
projected to be exceeded owing mainly to high gas revenues. However, the fiscal balance
corrected for the cyclical position, gas proceeds, and net interest payments—namely the
“robust” balance—weakens appreciably compared to the 2007 level, pointing to a procyclical stance. Instead, in light of the expected above-potential output and labor market
tensions, in the staff’s view, some withdrawal of fiscal stimulus would be appropriate—a
robust balance outcome higher by ¼-½ percent of GDP in 2008-09. Nonetheless, staff
underscored that, were growth to fall significantly short of current projections, automatic
fiscal stabilizers should be allowed to operate fully.

13
15.
The authorities expressed conditional support for the recommendation to err on
the side of higher surpluses in budget execution. Projections point to a sizable revenue
overperformance, though owing mainly to cyclical upswing and buoyant gas proceeds. But
there are also potential savings associated with underexecution of investment projects
financed by the Infrastructure Development Fund and other margins under the expenditure
ceilings. Therefore, staff believes that a better-than-planned outturn for the robust balance
could be achieved within the existing fiscal framework. The authorities indicated that they
too would prefer to realize those savings, but pressures to increase spending, especially for
health- and child-care, may prevent them from doing so. In any case, they were determined
not to exceed the expenditure ceilings set by the multiannual budget and to ensure that the
medium-term surplus objective is attained.
16.
The authorities also acknowledged that their medium-run fiscal plan falls still
short of ensuring long-term sustainability. It targets a structural surplus of 1 percent of
GDP by 2011, corresponding to a robust surplus of ¼ percent of GDP, an improvement
which reflects the impact of already announced measures over the government’s term.
Furthermore, such measures will produce additional sustainability-enhancing effects after
2011 equivalent in present value to about ½ percent of GDP. These efforts notwithstanding,
in an otherwise “passive” projection, the additional public spending associated with
population aging eventually generates ever growing deficits and debt. Authorities and staff
concurred that long-term fiscal sustainability requires a robust surplus permanently higher by
some 2¼ percent of GDP than in the passive scenario—around 3 percent of GDP in 2011.4

already announced with effects after 2011.

15
17.
Nevertheless, further early progress to cope with the fiscal brunt of aging is
difficult. Staff recommended filling about one-third of the sustainability gap by 2011.
Indeed, front-loading the fiscal adjustment is desirable for intergenerational equity and to
contain the size of the required tightening. In this connection, given the better-than-budgeted
outcome for 2007 and likely overperformance in 2008-09, staff argued that the 2011 robust
surplus could be ½-¾ percent of GDP higher than in the authorities’ medium-term plan. The
authorities did not discount this possibility, but doubted that revenue buoyancy and the
margins under the expenditure ceilings could be sustained through 2011. They agreed,
however, that, if preserving these margins did not prove feasible, the additional spending
ought to support structural reforms that reduce the sustainability gap.
Delaying budgetary adjustment until 2040 will require a tightening of more than 7 percent of GDP to
attain sustainability. Furthermore, the costs of the delay for those born after 2040 amount to almost
2 ½ percent of their lifetime income (or 19,000 euros in present value terms).

There was agreement that adjustment should focus on expenditure
retrenchment or tax base broadening. The government’s economic footprint is already

It was not disputed
that further pension reform
is key to contain the fiscal costs of aging. Since life expectancy has increased substantially,
the authorities concurred that raising the retirement age from 65 to 67 years, as in some other

20.
The authorities viewed savings in healthcare as a significant contributor to
longer-term fiscal sustainability. It was noted that most of the projected surge in healthcare
spending is due not to demographic changes, but to expensive advances in medical
technology and real income growth (given high income elasticity of health-services demand).
Staff argued that an increase in user fees could moderate healthcare demand growth. The
authorities objected that such a step could overburden the chronically ill or prove
administratively cumbersome if designed to avoid this problem. They believed that tighter
definition of entitlements in long-term care could spawn significant savings in an area that
had not been touched by the 2006 reform.
5

SIP estimates suggest a negative impact on corporate taxation of ½–1 percent of GDP, depending, inter alia, on
the corporate tax rate differential with new EU members.

17
21.
Some scope to reduce unemployment-benefit and other expenditures was also
identified. Though cut from 60 to 38 months in 2006, maximum unemployment benefit
duration remains high by international standards. Staff suggested lowering it to 18 months, a
period which would remain sufficiently long to support job search and simultaneously tend
to raise labor participation. The authorities stated that a gradual decrease was in the longer
run likely, but in the meantime they would concentrate on strengthening activation of the
unemployed. Staff then noted that, according to some studies, in the Netherlands efficiency
gains of roughly 20 percent may be possible in public administration, education, and
infrastructure provision, when compared with best OECD practice. Thus, significant savings
could be realized without jeopardizing the provision of services. The authorities pointed to
ongoing efforts to strengthen efficiency through targeted reduction of public employment and
diffusion of information technology.

B. Structural Policies
23.
The view prevailed that structural advances are slowing down (Table 5). This was
the result of “reform fatigue” after the bold steps taken in the last few years as well as of the
need to take stock of the impact of recent reforms before launching new ones. In addition,
dissensions in the governing coalition prevented action in some areas like EPL. Nonetheless,
the authorities have also established a commission charged with identifying further reform
measures to invigorate the labor market. It will report to the government by mid-2008.

The authorities concurred that reforms of the tax system, social entitlements,
and employment protection are key to stimulate employment. Given low labor utilization
and to promote female and elderly employment, they enacted a gradual elimination of the
imputation of the general tax credit to the primary worker and are planning targeted increases
of tax credits for workers aged 57 and above, while exempting pensioners that have worked
between ages 63-65 from the new levy for people over 65. Steps are also under consideration
to limit use of the disability scheme for the young. Staff endorsed these measures, but argued
that further action would be desirable, especially in light of the impending aging. Various
proposals, in line with OECD recommendations, were well received in principle, but the
authorities emphasized that their fiscal costs or the need to reach agreement with social
partners meant that they could not be introduced soon (Table 6).

greater liberalization. The authorities stressed that it had to be gradual and its impact
assessed at each step to prevent deterioration in the quality of urban living.
26.
The authorities support overseas development assistance (ODA), continuing to
exceed the United Nations’ target of 0.7 percent of GNI.
C. Financial Sector
27.
The authorities confirmed the overall robustness of the Dutch financial system,
but admitted several concerns. These include: (i) the impact of prolonged turmoil on key
banks; (ii) weaknesses in ratings and regulatory reliance thereon; (iii) valuation and risk
management of structured products; (iv) difficulties in raising liquidity or capital under
disturbed market conditions, though the authorities did not believe that Dutch banks had
particular problems in this regard; and (v) quality of disclosure of complex products. The
authorities are actively participating in international fora to address these problems. While
low risk-weighting and higher leverage have boosted the regulatory capital ratio and return
on equity, the authorities recognized that banks’ return on assets has been one of the lowest
among peers. They also conceded that life insurers suffer from languishing premia and low
margins, while the transparency of unit-linked insurance products was an issue. Finally, the
pension funds’ cover ratio can be quite volatile (it dropped 20 percentage points in the first
two months of 2008) given both the large duration mismatch and asset price volatility.
28.
Based on recent stress tests, supervisors concluded that banks can withstand
current global turmoil, but pension funds would suffer more.6 The regulatory capital
ratio would decline by 1.4 percent. Though not similarly tested, insurers would be less
vulnerable due to negligible exposure to subprime and other low-rated assets, while, as
mentioned, the pension funding ratio is quite sensitive to changes in interest rates or asset
prices. Regarding liquidity concerns, Dutch banks consolidate their conduits under IFRS, and
accordingly their liquidity management extends to the needs of such conduits. Following the
global turmoil, the central bank (DNB) is monitoring bank liquidity intensively as well as
reassessing the banks’ internal risk management, use of ratings, internal models, and early
warning system.
29.
The authorities expressed satisfaction with progress of the ABN-AMRO
takeover, while stressing managerial and supervisory challenges. They were generally
pleased about cooperation with fellow supervisors and progress made by the consortium—
Fortis, Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), Santander. DNB and the Financial Supervisory
Agency (FSA) have agreed that DNB will remain the consolidated supervisor of ABN6

AMRO, while FSA that of RBS Group. The Dutch and Belgian supervisors already have a
memorandum of understanding (MOU) regarding Fortis, which will be reviewed in light of
the ABN-AMRO transaction and the increased share of Dutch activities of Fortis. Staff
welcomed these steps. All concurred that this takeover underlines the difficulties of
supervising large EU-wide financial institutions by national regulators and the burden of
complying with multiple regulations. Accordingly, staff highlighted the importance of
reviewing all existing MOUs in particular to clarify the responsibility for crisis management
and lending of last resort.
30.
Supervisors maintained that mortgages carry low risks, but high mortgage debt,
risk concentration, house prices, and securitization require careful watch.
•

Staff questioned the very large and increasing LTV ratio of mortgages (averaging
114 percent in 2007) and the predominance of bullet loans. The authorities
acknowledged these problems, but attributed them to high tax incentives, and pointed
out that systemic risk is reduced by build-up of collateral in mortgage-linked
insurance or savings accounts. Still, they recognized that risks are concentrated in
new mortgages with high LTV ratios, especially for young workers with low
incomes. In this regard, the authorities conceded that the voluntary code of conduct
has not limited LTV ratios as much as expected, primarily due to high competition.

•

While aware of the large declines in housing markets in the U.S., U.K., and Spain, the
authorities felt that limited land supply and generous mortgage interest deductibility
reduce the likelihood of sharp house price corrections in the Netherlands. Staff and
authorities concurred that, based on existing regulatory constraints, which tend to
cause higher prices, house overvaluation is only slight (Box 2).

•

Officials accepted that mortgage interest deductibility results in high housing prices,
lower affordability—especially for younger workers—and greater vulnerability to
interest rate shocks. Mortgage debt at 95 percent of GDP is much higher than in most
mature markets, and large build-up of mortgage-related collateral distorts investment.

Box 2. House Prices in the Netherlands
Some raw indicators raise concerns that housing prices deviate from fundamentals in the
Netherlands. Both the price-to-income and the price-to-rent ratios have increased continuously
throughout the 1990s and have remained at high levels thereafter. Nevertheless, these indicators do
not consider the influence of other fundamentals that may also have changed. Hence, a more detailed
analysis based on econometric techniques is appropriate.
In this regard, in a cross-country exercise, the Spring 2008 WEO points to a sizable house price
gap. WEO estimates a gap of about 30 percent between actual increases in Dutch house prices over
the last decade and those that can be explained by common fundamentals. At the same time, the WEO
assessment is based on a house pricing model aimed at cross-country comparisons, which necessarily
takes limited account of country-specific factors.
However, most Dutch-specific econometric studies suggest a small or no gap. For example, staff
work for the 2005 and 2006 Article IV consultations1 found house prices to be approximately in line
with fundamentals. The authorities’ own analysis broadly supports this conclusion.2 An OECD study3
of the probability of having reached a turning point in various housing markets indicates that it is very
small in the Netherlands (as opposed to several other countries, including the U.S.).
The different results may be due to the choice of the base period, institutional factors, and
measurement of disposable income.
•

In general, the house price level in a given year must be set as the base from which price
changes explained by the respective models are compared to actual changes. If the latter
exceed the former, a gap results. Because of its cross country nature, WEO, for all countries
in its sample, selects 1997 as the base year. However, this may not have been an
“equilibrium” from a Dutch perspective. For example, the price-to-income ratio in 1997 was
some 12-13 percent below the long-term average. Accordingly, models which take periods
closer to the average experience as a base interpret the fast growth of house prices in the
second half of the 1990s as catching-up towards equilibrium.

•

Institutional features also matter for house prices. In the Netherlands, these include strict
zoning regulations that limit housing supply and generous mortgage interest deductibility
from income taxes that drives up demand, both of which tend to raise the house equilibrium
price. Models which incorporate good estimates of the initial equilibrium and are better
specified overall will reflect these institutional factors more accurately.

•

Housing prices are modeled by WEO as a function of, among other variables, disposable
income per capita. If total disposable income were used, the size of the gap shrinks. Indeed,
the latter measure captures not only the increase in household incomes, but also the rise in the
number of households, which is important in the Netherlands because an increasing
proportion of single-person households has contributed substantially to housing demand.

With large mortgage debt, securitization has grown rapidly. The authorities agreed
that this calls, inter alia, for high origination standards, good rating models, and
supervisory vigilance about liquidity and capital requirements for securitized assets.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL

31.
The Netherlands is well equipped to deal with the global financial crisis, but the
outlook is unusually uncertain. Recent growth and inflation performance are excellent in
the EU context. External competitiveness is adequate, the government budget is in surplus,
and financial sector supervision is strong and well designed. Thus, despite the financial
turmoil and U.S. slowdown, staff expects real GDP to continue expanding above the EU
average in the near term, with output remaining above potential and persisting labor market
tightness. Risk factors range from lending, housing, and equity market conditions, to oil
prices, external demand, and labor market tensions. Staff regards current growth projections
as conservative and thus these risks are broadly balanced, but with fatter-than-ordinary tails.
32.
Though conjunctural indicators are positive, the challenges of an aging
population and low productivity growth loom large. Despite a large, fully-funded second
pension pillar, population aging is anticipated to create large fiscal burdens, including for
growing health care costs. Productivity growth in the Netherlands, despite some recent
recovery, remains slower than in partner economies. Further, imminent population aging will
shrink the working-age cohorts from early the next decade. Thus, raising the employment
rate and stimulating faster productivity gains will be essential for long-term potential growth,
competitiveness, and fiscal sustainability.
33.
A somewhat tighter fiscal stance is advisable from both long-term fiscal
sustainability and cyclical perspectives. To stabilize net government debt despite the
budgetary costs of impending aging, the robust balance must improve by about 2¼ percent of
GDP relative to the path implicit in the authorities’ medium-term policies. Early reduction of
the sustainability gap would limit the size of the needed fiscal correction and distribute the
burden more equitably across generations. Under current growth projections, modest
withdrawal of fiscal stimulus (broadly locking in the overperformance realized in 2007) is
also called for because economic activity is somewhat above potential and the labor market
tight. Maintaining a margin under the expenditure ceilings set in the medium-term budget
framework could contribute greatly to this outcome. However, if growth turned markedly
lower than projected, automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate fully.
34.
With relatively large tax wedges on labor income, fiscal adjustment should focus
on spending restraint and tax base broadening. Otherwise, expenditures would rise
rapidly owing to aging, while international tax competition puts pressure to lower corporate
tax rates. Savings require: (i) further pension reform; (ii) additional efforts to rein in health
care expenditures; (iii) enhancements in public expenditure efficiency, building on existing
efforts, to curtail expenditure growth without endangering services; and (iv) tighter

25
unemployment benefits. More transparency of tax expenditures would further strengthen
budgetary discipline and reduce residual elements of procyclicality in the fiscal framework.
35.
Efforts to increase employment are crucial to ease growing labor shortages,
support growth, and address the impact of population aging. Despite relatively high
employment rates, low hours worked attest to limited labor utilization. Reforms of the tax
system, social entitlements, and employment protection, supported by enhanced activation
strategies, are needed to stimulate employment. In particular, reducing the high effective
marginal tax rates on second family earners could promote more female employment, while
targeted tax incentives could induce elderly participation. Stricter enforcement of work
availability requirements, and tightening reassessment of disability status to those aged
45 years and over would lower the share of working-age population receiving social
entitlements. Strict EPL for regular employment ought to be liberalized and a funded
severance pay system introduced to enhance labor mobility.
36.
Further liberalization would be useful to promote productivity growth. The
authorities’ “innovation pillar” and additional reductions in red tape are welcome, but
barriers to entrepreneurship and product market regulation remain relatively high. Careful
liberalization, including of zoning regulations and rigid shop opening hours, would favor
emergence of more firms and greater use of information and communications technologies.
37.
The Dutch financial system is healthy, but with scope to improve its robustness.
It is well poised to weather the global turmoil, thanks to strong initial conditions and good
supervision.
•

However, banks must boost equity capital and profitability and ameliorate cost
efficiency, transparency of complex products, and investor relations to meet
conjunctural and structural challenges. The Dutch contribution and leadership in
international efforts to implement the lessons from the ongoing crisis concerning
ratings, valuation, liquidity, risk management and fine-tuning of capital and other
prudential regulation are welcome in this regard. The insurance sector is wellregulated, but has to consolidate and improve margins to deal with global competition
and excess capacity. DNB stress testing is of high international standards, but needs
to adapt to novel risks (including difficulties in raising capital and liquidity), rapid
rating migration, more adverse asset valuations, and incorporate the insurance sector
fully.

•

For mortgages, regulatory action to reduce high LTV ratios, better measurement of
related collateral, and fine-tuning capital requirements for loans with different risk
would be useful. Gradual removal of mortgage interest deductibility would lower
households’ vulnerability to price swings and interest rate shocks. Rapidly growing
securitization calls for vigilance about the adequacy of origination standards, rating
models, liquidity, and capital requirements for securitized assets.

26
38.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with the Netherlands
remains on the 12-month cycle.

1/ The introduction of the new health insurance scheme in 2006 caused a significant shift in health care expenditure from private to
public consumption, thereby lowering private and raising public consumption growth without changing overall GDP. In a related vein,
government revenues rose and private disposable income fell, without affecting the financial position of the public sector or households net
terms. This is because public expenditure for health care also rose, while the fall in private disposable income is offset by a similar fall in
private health consumption, which is now taken care of in the public domain.

1/ The introduction of the new healthcare system in 2006 did not affect the overall balance, but permanently increased both revenue and expenditure by
1.6 percentage points of GDP.
2/ The calculation of the structural balance is based on the standard methodology which uses fixed elasticities with respect to GDP. Biases can occur, in
particular in the context of asset price boom and busts (as discussed for the Netherlands in Country Report No. 04/301).
3/ The increase in expenditure growth in 2006 largely reflects the introduction of the new health care system, as in footnote 1.
4/ The robust primary balance is defined as the structural balance adjusted for net interest payments and gas revenues.

To lessen these traps, changes in the real estate tax and
amendments to the child credit (which came into effect
in 2006) reduced spikes in marginal effective tax rates.

To increase female participation, the government increased
childcare subsidies by €130 million in 2006 and a further
€125 million in 2007.

Poverty and
inactivity traps

Female
participation

The government introduced legislation requiring primary
schools to organize childcare with certified childcare
providers from the beginning of the 2007–08 school year if
parents so request.

Effective October 2006, the maximum duration was cut
from 60 to 38 months.

The government introduced on 2/1/2008 wage subsidies, to
foster “bridge-jobs” for partially disabled and former
(partially) disabled people whose degree of disability has
been reassessed.

Latest reform came into effect in January 2006. Reform
entails: strengthened eligibility criteria, including a tighter
definition of full disability, and work incentives for partially
disabled.

In general the government has formed a commission to
advise measures to increase labor participation. The
proposals of the commission are expected in summer
2008.

Actions Taken

Disability

Area

Phasing out, by 6⅔ percent every year, of the imputation of the general
tax credit to the primary worker over the period 2009–2024. This will
apply only to partners born after 1971 who do not have children aged
under six years.

The new cabinet will introduce an earned income tax credit (EITC) in
2009, but the parameters still have to be determined.

The government intends to change some rules in unemployment
insurance in order to stimulate the unemployed to take up jobs not
necessarily aligned with their own education level or which pay less than
the unemployment benefit. The cabinet is also developing plans to allow
the employment agency (UWV) to give wage subsidies for work to the
long-term unemployed. (The municipalities can already give wage
subsidies for work to people on social security.) Further, the cabinet
wants to permit “participation jobs.”

Abolishing social assistance for people aged less than 27 years in
combination with a study/work obligation.

The cabinet is preparing changes in the Wajong (law for young disabled)
to stimulate labor participation by postponing Wajong eligibility until
27 years of age (while maintaining income support rights).

Fiscal incentives for early retirement were removed in
January 2006.

Effective October 2006, the LIFO principle for worker
dismissal was eased. Effective October 2006, dismissed
workers no longer have to prove they resisted being laid off
to get unemployment benefits.

The competition agency (NMa) has become formally
independent in July 2006 and its investigative and
enforcement powers were enhanced on October 1, 2007.

Significant progress was made towards meeting the
previous cabinet’s goal of lowering red tape by 25 percent
by the end of its term (2007), including by reducing the
number of permits and simplifying the license system.

Actions Taken

Area

Further reduction of red tape by 25 percent.

Plan to Increase work-related tax credits for workers over age 57 and
restrict the pensioners’ exemption from social contributions only to those
retiring at 65, except for certain categories—the latter measure is to be
phased over [ten years].

Action plan 45+, whereby CWI (the employment office of the
Netherlands) will assist 30,000 people aged 45 and older to find a job.

At the same time, the level of the general tax credit will be fixed in
nominal terms. Starting in 2009, the above measures will boost
household revenues by €0.5 billion annually (until 2011). An extra
€700 million by 2011 will be made available for child care over the
cabinet’s term.

Product Market
The Netherlands is an outlier in high barriers to
entrepreneurship, partly due to cumbersome
licensing requirements, and only achieves middling
rank in product market regulation. Despite recent
improvements, zoning regulations and shop opening
hours remain strict.

Employment Protection Legislation (EPL)
EPL on regular contracts is high in international
context. Strict EPL for regular employment results in
high long-term unemployment, hinders labor mobility
and the adoption of innovative processes. In
addition, severance payments are comparatively
generous, and may also reduce labor mobility to
prevent loss of accumulated severance rights.

Unemployment and Disability Benefit
The share of working-age population receiving
social entitlements is comparatively high (almost
17 percent), with those on disability benefit alone
totaling nearly 10 percent. In addition, the length of
the unemployment benefit is still above
comparators.

Taxation
High effective tax rate on second family earners and
the imputation of the general tax credit to the
primary worker act as a disincentive on second
earners’ participation. Despite relatively high
employment rates, with a short average work week
and the majority of women employed part-time
(Figure 6), hours worked are the lowest in the
OECD.

Labor Market

Main Issues

The mission advocated further reduction of
administrative burden and greater regulatory
liberalization, including zoning restrictions and shop
opening hours.

The mission advocated a degree of EPL liberalization
and a funded severance pay scheme designed to
promote mobility.

Staff urged stricter enforcement of requirements for
work availability and extension of the new tighter rules
for obligatory periodic reassessment of disability status
to those over 45 years of age.
Regarding unemployment entitlements, the mission
argued that the benefit length could be further tightened,
or benefits could be diminished over the unemployment
spell to intensify job search activity,

To induce more female employment, the mission
counseled further to reduce the high effective tax rate on
second family earners (by phasing out less rapidly social
benefits as a function of family income).
The mission also recommended faster elimination of the
imputation of the general tax credit to the primary
worker, presently spread over 15 years from 2009,
which would also lower disincentives for second earners.

Staff Recommendations

The authorities argued that their innovation pillar should
facilitate the adoption of new technologies. The recent
strengthening of the competition authority’s (NMa)
investigative powers should kindle competition and thus
productivity. Finally, the government intends to reduce
red tape by an additional 25 percent.
The authorities stressed that liberalization had to be
gradual.

The authorities explained that differences of view
among members of the governing coalition had not
been resolved and therefore actions in this area during
the current legislature were unlikely.

The authorities explained that opposition to tougher
disability reassessments for older workers was
insurmountable at present. On the other hand, steps
were under consideration to limit use of the young
disabled scheme.
The authorities did not dispute staff’s view regarding
unemployment entitlements, but stressed that these
steps require agreement with social partners.

The authorities remarked that reducing the effective tax
rate on second family earners is costly to the budget
and could only be introduced slowly.
The authorities aired support for faster elimination of the
general tax credit to the primary worker, but stressed
that the existing schedule reflected a difficult
compromise among social partners and changes would
be hard.

1/ The consumption growth in 2006 is adjusted for the health care reform. The reform of the health care system at the
beginning of 2006 resulted in a shift of health care expenditures of about euro 8.0 billion (1.5 percent of GDP) from
private to public consumption, distorting private consumption downward by about 3 percentage points in 2006.

Fiscal consolidation of over 2½ percentage points of GDP, in structural terms,
was achieved during 2003–07. The authorities improved coordination between
various levels of government, recently excluded interest payments from the
expenditures ceiling, lowered the “signaling value,”1 introduced fixed funding of
the FES.
Maximum duration of unemployment benefits was lowered to 38 months—
which however remains high in international comparison. Tax/benefit
incentives for early retirement were eliminated, “poverty traps” attenuated, and
disability rights tightened. Recommendations not yet taken on board include:
(i) reducing the still high effective tax rate on second family workers, in part
through faster elimination of the imputation of the general tax credit to the
primary worker; (ii) tightening access to the disability scheme by the young; (iii)
stricter enforcement of work availability requirements for the partially disabled
and unemployed; (iv) extension of the new more severe rules for periodic
reassessment of disability status to those aged 45 and over; and (v) raising the
retirement age or linking it to life expectancy. In addition, as noted,
unemployment benefit maximum length is still quite generous.
The powers of the competition authority have been gradually increased. The
previous government achieved its goal of a 25 percent reduction in
administrative burden and the new government manifested its intention to
lessen it by an additional 25 percent. However, barriers to entrepreneurship
and product market regulation are still relatively high. For example, despite
recent progress, licensing requirements remain burdensome, zoning
regulations stringent, and shop opening/delivery hours strict.
The authorities have implemented most of these recommendations. There is
only partial progress regarding mortgage interest deductibility, which has not
been phased out but the authorities have made small reductions. Similarly, the
mortgage code of conduct has been strengthened, but it has not been very
effective in reducing the high LTV ratio. The approach to stress testing could
be further extended.

Fiscal Policy: Past recommendations included structural fiscal adjustment of
at least ½ percentage point of GDP per year, closer coordination between the
central government and the local governments, refinements to enhance the
transparency of the fiscal framework (e.g., reporting of tax expenditures in the
budget and their inclusion in the expenditures ceiling), and to reduce a few
procyclical features.

Labor Market: Past recommendations included tightening unemployment
benefits, abolishing fiscal incentives for early retirement, reducing inactivity
traps, reassessing disability entitlements, and liberalizing employment
protection legislation.

Product Market: The Fund has generally supported the authorities’ own
liberalization program, including the regional unbundling of the energy market,
the reduction in required licenses and permits, and, more generally, the efforts
to increase competition and reduce the cost of doing business.

Financial Sector: the key recommendations from the 2004 Financial Sector
Stability Assessment (FSSA) included passage of a new Financial Supervision
Act, clarifying the framework for financial sector supervision and the authority of
the minister, improvements in security settlement systems, introduction of the
new regulatory framework for pension funds, establishment of a Financial
Stability Division, expanding stress testing models, strengthening the AML-CFT
framework, eliminating or at least reducing mortgage interest deductibility, and
introducing a mortgage code of conduct.

The “signaling value” is the fiscal balance ratio to GDP below which corrective measures must be taken to avoid breaching the Maastricht criteria. It has been
reduced to 2 percent from 2½ percent of GDP.

Appendix IV. Netherlands: Statistical Issues
April 10, 2008
The Netherlands publishes a wide range of economic and financial statistics. Specifically,
annual and quarterly national account data are provided by the Central Bureau of Statistics;
financial and balance of payments data are provided by De Nederlandsche Bank; and fiscal
data are provided by the Ministry of Finance. These data are increasingly available in
electronic form. Macroeconomic data are generally of high quality.
As a one-off matter, a number of institutional reforms had a significant impact on national
account and other data in 2006. Most importantly, the reform of health care insurance caused
a significant reclassification of private consumption into public consumption. This shift had a
big impact on the growth rates of the components concerned, but overall GDP was not
affected.
The frequency and timeliness of the availability of the statistical indicators required for Fund
surveillance purposes are summarized in the attached table. The authorities subscribe to the
Special Data Dissemination Standard, providing information about their data and data
dissemination practices on the IMF Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. In addition,
they have committed to a ROSC data module mission tentatively set for later this year.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
May 21, 2008

1.
This statement summarizes developments in the Netherlands since the issuance
of the staff report. The additional information does not change the thrust of the staff
appraisal.
2.
Economic growth slowed in the first quarter of 2008, while inflation remains
significantly below the euro area average.
•

Real GDP rose by 0.2 percent in the first quarter of 2008, the lowest quarter-onquarter rate for three years. This is below the preliminary estimate of 0.7 percent
quarterly growth in the euro area. However, expansion from the same quarter of last
year—at 3.1 percent—continues to exceed the euro area average (2.2 percent),
because of strong growth in the latter part of 2007. The slowdown reflects a
deceleration of consumption, especially in consumer durables, and exports. In
contrast, business investment stayed strong.

•

Harmonized inflation dipped to 1.7 percent (12-month change) in April from a recent
peak of 2.0 percent in February. It remains well below the 3.3 percent euro area rate,
the result of comparatively smaller price increases for food, rent, and energy in the
Netherlands.

These developments in GDP growth and inflation are both broadly consistent with the
projections in the staff report.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with the
Kingdom of the Netherlands—Netherlands
On May 21, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Kingdom of the Netherlands—Netherlands. 1
Background
Strong macroeconomic foundations have so far largely shielded the Netherlands from recent
financial turbulence. Growth in recent years has been above and inflation below euro area
averages. Economic expansion is expected to slow this year to 2-2¼ percent, which, in light of a
large carryover from 2007, reflects a substantive deceleration owing to the global turmoil and
spillover from the U.S. downturn. Inflation should remain subdued, slightly above 2 percent,
although with a tightening labor market, wage increases are anticipated to accelerate somewhat
and to exceed productivity growth. Uncertainties surrounding the outlook are high, mainly owing
to uncertainties on the extent of the global financial distress and its impact on consumer and
producer confidence, but the risks are broadly balanced.
The external current account surplus remains large and various approaches support the
conclusion that Dutch competitiveness is satisfactory. Thus, standard real effective exchange
rates have been relatively stable in recent years, while application of the Consultative Group on
Exchange Rates (CGER) methodology suggests that the real exchange rate is broadly in

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
equilibrium. Rapid export growth also implies that external competitiveness is not at stake,
although sectoral analyses capture some early signs of erosion.
Fiscal performance, while staying strong, was mildly procyclical in 2007. Although the overall
surplus was unchanged at ½ percent of GDP, with output above potential, the structural balance
slipped by about ½ percent of GDP. Despite a declining government debt ratio and a strong,
fully-funded pillar of the pension system, population aging is anticipated to increase government
expenditure by some 7 percentage points of GDP in the coming decades and, without fiscal
retrenchment or growth-enhancing structural reforms, render the public accounts unsustainable.
The financial system is proving generally resilient to the recent market turmoil, but some
pockets of weakness warrant caution. Stress tests suggest that banks can withstand quite
strong shocks, in particular those associated with the ongoing financial turbulence. Riskweighted capital ratios are comfortable, although the return on assets remains low. While
mortgage lending has slowed, the outstanding stock remains among the highest in relation to
GDP in mature markets, owing to policy-induced distortions—especially the tax deductibility of
mortgage interest payments—and exposes households to interest rate and housing price risks.
The takeover of a large bank by an international consortium typifies rising challenges for crosscountry supervision.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that sizeable fiscal consolidation and stability-oriented
macroeconomic policies, complemented by broad-based structural reforms, have underpinned
an extended period of strong growth, outperforming the EU average, and have shielded the
economy from the recent global financial turmoil. Directors considered that, despite an expected
deceleration in growth following the U.S. economic slowdown, near-term prospects remain
favorable, with real GDP expected to continue expanding above the EU average. They
acknowledged, however, that the outlook is subject to greater-than-usual uncertainty.
Directors noted that imminent population aging—which will shrink working age population
starting early in the next decade—and comparatively low productivity growth could pose
considerable challenges to long-term fiscal sustainability and external competitiveness. It will
therefore be important to make early progress on labor and product market reforms aimed at
raising the employment rate and stimulating faster productivity gains.
Given the expected above-potential output and tight labor market, most Directors agreed that a
somewhat tighter fiscal stance for 2008 and 2009 would be appropriate from both long-term
sustainability and cyclical perspectives, while acknowledging that the scope for reducing current
expenditures might be limited at the present juncture of an economic downturn. Should growth
turn out to be markedly lower than projected, automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate
fully. Directors welcomed the commitment of the government to a medium-term structural
surplus target of 1 percent of GDP, although most saw scope for a further gradual improvement
in the structural primary balance (net of gas proceeds), noting that frontloading the fiscal

3
adjustment would limit the size of the needed fiscal correction and distribute the burden more
equitably across generations.
Directors concurred that fiscal adjustment should rely on spending restraint and a broadening of
the tax base, given relatively large tax wedges on labor income. Possible sources of savings
include efforts to control health care spending, improvements in public sector efficiency, an
increase in the effective retirement age, and a reduction in unemployment benefits. Directors
also called for increased transparency of tax expenditures to strengthen budgetary discipline.
Directors welcomed the ongoing efforts and the recent announcement of new measures to ease
growing labor shortages and the impact of population aging. In this regard, reforms of the tax
system and social entitlements should aim to reduce the effective marginal tax rates on second
family earners, target tax incentives to induce participation by the elderly, and tighten the
enforcement of work availability requirements and reassessments of disability status. Directors
encouraged the authorities to further liberalize the rigid employment protection legislation and to
adopt other measures with a view to further enhancing labor mobility.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ “innovation pillar” and additional efforts to reduce red tape
to promote productivity growth. Noting that barriers to entrepreneurship and product market
regulation remain relatively high, Directors recommended careful liberalization to facilitate the
emergence of innovative firms, which can make greater use of productivity-enhancing
information technologies.
Directors observed that the Dutch financial system is healthy and well poised to weather the
global turmoil, and they strongly welcomed the enhanced supervisory and regulatory
framework. In view of growing risks associated with cross-border financial integration and
increased use of structured products, Directors underscored the importance of strengthening
cooperation and information-sharing among supervisors in home and host countries, as well as
transparency in reporting complex products, while increasing cost efficiency and equity capital.
Directors noted the staff’s assessment that overvaluation of the Dutch housing market is only
minor, while stressing that high household mortgage indebtedness, and house price
developments in general, warrant careful monitoring. They saw benefit in regulatory action to
reduce high loan-to-value ratios, improve the measurement of related collateral, and fine-tune
capital requirements for loans with different risks. Gradual removal of mortgage interest
deductibility would contribute to decrease loan-to-value ratios, thereby lowering households’
vulnerability to house price swings and interest rate shocks.
Directors commended the authorities’ continued commitment to high levels of Official
Development Assistance.

Statement by Age Bakker, Executive Director for
the Kingdom of the Netherlands—Netherlands
May 21, 2008
I thank staff for their comprehensive appraisal of the Dutch economy and want to convey the
appreciation of the authorities for the informative exchange of views during the mission.
As the Netherlands is among the bigger financial centers in the world, and in line with the
direction the Fund should take, my statement will pay relatively much attention to the
financial markets.
General comments
• For the past years, the Dutch economy has performed well as reflected by satisfactory
economic growth, low inflation and unemployment, and strong fiscal performance.
However, after the Dutch economy attained its highest growth rate in seven years in
2007, it is clear that the broad based expansion will slow down this year.
•

Whereas the IMF forecasts a relatively sharp slow down, the independent Netherlands
Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis (CPB), the European Commission, and other
institutions have a somewhat less pessimistic view. Also, given the 1.9 percentage point
growth carry-over from 2007 and taking into account first quarter data, IMF’s growth
forecast of 2.1 for 2008 seems cautious.

•

The WEO 2008 included a housing market analysis, which attracted wide attention from
the Dutch press, financial markets and policymakers by suggesting a sizable
overvaluation of the housing market in the Netherlands. The staff report rightly puts the
WEO cross-country study in perspective by noting that Dutch-specific studies, including
by the IMF, suggest a small or no house price gap.

Fiscal Policy
The budgetary framework of the Netherlands was found to meet or set international best
practices by the 2006 fiscal ROSC. To achieve further improvement, the government
implemented several of the Fund’s recommendations when taking office last year. The
recommendations made during the current consultation will be assessed by the Study Group
on the Budget Margin which designs the budgetary policy for the next government. They
cannot be taken up earlier since the strong medium-term fiscal framework of the Netherlands
prevents the government from changing the rules of the game during its term.
Given pension assets which amount to 176% of GDP (December 2007), the Netherlands is
relatively well placed to cope with the budgetary cost of ageing. Nevertheless, the
government is committed to further improve the long-term sustainability of public finances.
Previous governments have already achieved a reduction of the debt ratio from close to 80%

2
in the mid-nineties to below 50% of GDP in 2007. The new government is committed to
build on this achievement and has defined its budgetary policy agenda in light of an ageing
population. Continued budgetary surpluses are expected to bring the debt ratio below 40% in
2009.
The authorities have set a target of a structural surplus of 1% of GDP in 2011, as previously
recommended by staff. Recently, the short-term budgetary outlook improved, driven by
higher gas revenues. When the Board last discussed the Netherlands in June 2007, staff
forecasted a deficit of 0.7% of GDP for 2007; current expectations are that a surplus of 0.4%
of GDP has been achieved. Moreover, the structural balance for 2007 is expected to come out
half a percentage point better than expected last June. For 2008, a small further improvement
in the government balance is expected, again both in nominal and structural terms.
Structural reforms
The commitment to fiscal discipline, as illustrated by aforementioned facts, is being
complemented by a structural reform agenda, which work hand-in-hand to address the
economic impact of an ageing population. As staff notes, bold reforms have been
implemented in the past few years. The effects of these reforms are now starting to pay off.
For instance, the staff reports gives disability figures up to 2004, while according to the CPB
the volume of disability recipients has dropped by about 10% in 2006 and is expected to drop
by a further 20% in the period till 2011. Notwithstanding these positive results, staff rightly
notes that further progress needs to be made if the employment and the number of hours
worked per employee is to be increased. To this effect, the government has announced new
measures.
•

•

The budget for childcare facilities has been increased with an aim to increase female
participation. Primary schools are now obligated to arrange pre and after school
childcare.
Changes in the law for young disabled are planned and social assistance for people
under 27 will be abolished (income support will be given if needed for education).
Wage-subsidies for so-called ‘participation jobs’ aimed at gaining work experience
have been introduced.
On top of the various fiscal measures mentioned in the staff report, the tax credit for
secondary earners will be changed to reduce the effective marginal tax rate.
A commission has been established to analyze further reforms to invigorate the labor
market; its report will be published in the beginning of June.

Financial Sector
Important structural reforms did also take place in the financial sector. At the instigation of
my predecessor here at the Fund, a new financial sector supervision model was introduced in
the Netherlands in 2004. According to this ‘twin peaks model’ the systemic and prudential
supervision has been concentrated in-house with the central bank (DNB), for the banking,

3
insurance and securities sector, while all conduct-of-business supervision is done by
Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM). Experience with this model, which
currently receives much international attention, has been satisfactory. The authorities are
pleased with staff’s appraisal that the Dutch financial system appears robust due to a strong
capital base and good supervision.
The supervisory model facilitated an appropriate response to the financial market turmoil.
When the market turbulence began to emerge, DNB reacted by further intensifying banks´
liquidity monitoring. This included the collation of information derived from banking
supervision, the payment system and the financial markets. The combination of central bank
and supervisory duties and powers in one institution offered clear advantages in this regard.
Also, DNB’s bank liquidity supervision required that constructs such as conduits were
consolidated in liquidity testing and reporting, and stress tests confirmed the robustness of
bank safety margins, even under relatively extreme scenarios. So far, Dutch banks have
shown resilience in the face of the financial market turmoil with financial stability indicators
and rating agencies’ assessment supporting this positive view.
Up until the first quarter of 2008, bank lending to households and firms in the Netherlands
has not been materially affected by the turmoil. Lending to households continued its gradual
downward path since the beginning of 2006, in line with a moderation of growth of house
prices, whereas lending to firms is increasing strongly. That said, the recent Bank Lending
Survey provides indications for a tightening of lending conditions, which finds support in
indicators of the funding structure, returns and capital ratios of banks. The divergence
between the actual growth of bank lending and the indicated tightening of credit standards
could be evidence of a time lag in changing lending practices, or to the high persistence of
lending growth and favorable domestic economic conditions in the second half of 2007.
Staff raises the issue of the large and increasing loan-to-value (LTV) ratio on new mortgages.
In order to prevent payment problems, a renewed Mortgage Lenders’ Code of Conduct (the
Code) has come into force in 2007 and the AFM has recently announced to tighten its
supervision on excessive mortgage lending with particular attention to compliance with the
Code. The LTV-ratio has stabilized since the beginning of 2006 and is accompanied by the
build-up of assets in insurance and savings accounts. Also, the associated credit risks are
contained when measured against available Tier 1 capital and taking into account the low
share of vulnerable households with mortgage debt. The impact of interest rate shocks on
debt service costs is limited due to the high percentage of long-term fixed rate mortgages.
Staff points to the relative low profitability of the banking sector, which would limit ‘its
ability to support growth and adaptation of the economy’. However, as staff points out, this
lower profitability can be explained by the fact that Dutch banks take on less risks compared
to international peers, which is reflected in lower returns. Another reason, not mentioned in
the report, is the intensified competition partly due to cross-border financial integration. This

may actually imply that Dutch banks are indeed supporting growth and adapting to a
changing economic environment.
The takeover of ABN AMRO by a consortium of international banks is exemplary for the
increased cross-country integration in the financial sector. The authorities agree with staff
that this takeover poses various managerial and supervisory challenges and in this regard
there is close cooperation with the UK, Spanish and Belgian authorities. As regards Fortis,
which will take over the Dutch retail banking operations of ABN AMRO, joint risk
assessments take place with the Belgian authorities as well as frequent cooperation and
information sharing on the basis of MOUs, which will be updated as needed. With respect to
crisis management, there is a bilateral MOU with the Belgium authorities, while an EU-wide
MOU on financial stability will be published soon.
Conclusion
A relatively benign economic environment over the past years has been utilized to strengthen
the fiscal position and to introduce a wide range of structural reforms. The financial sector is
sound and has weathered the financial turmoil well. Unemployment is low and inflation has
so far been contained. That said, the authorities are aware that there is no room for
complacency. The short-term economic outlook is darkening, and in the medium- to longterm the economic impact of an ageing population will be felt. Staff’s recommendations to
improve the resilience of the economy are well-taken, and while the long-term sustainability
of public finances compares favorable to the region, the authorities are fully aware of the
need for further progress.
