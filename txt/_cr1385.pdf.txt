STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND THIRD POST PROGRAM MONITORING DISCUSSIONS

KEY ISSUES
Overview: The government has continued to pursue an unconventional strategy for
economic recovery. Despite improved market sentiment which has eased financing
constraints, the economic outlook remains difficult and large external and public
financing needs leave Hungary exposed to risks. Maintaining market confidence and
reviving growth are the most pressing priorities for which decisive action to improve
policies is needed.
Fiscal policy: The government is determined to exit the EU’s Excessive Deficit Procedure
(EDP), but the adjustment relies excessively on controversial tax measures which have
increased uncertainty and hurt the business climate. The key challenge is to achieve the
needed deficit reduction with more growth-friendly and sustainable measures. This will
require a rebalancing of the adjustment toward durable spending consolidation and
rationalization of the tax system, including a gradual elimination of sectoral taxes.
Monetary policy: While the output gap remains sizable, inflation expectations are not
well anchored and after seven consecutive policy rate cuts a pause seems prudent.
Further monetary policy easing can be supported by stronger macroeconomic policies.
In this regard, safeguarding the Central Bank’s (MNB) operational and legal
independence is critical.
Financial Sector: An adverse environment, including a heavy tax burden and rising
NPLs, have increased bank losses and contributed to sharp external and domestic
deleveraging. Restoring financial intermediation is essential to support economic
growth. This would require a better operational environment for banks and measures to
facilitate faster clean up of NPLs while ensuring adequate provisioning.
Structural reforms: Some efforts have been made to improve labor participation, but
potential growth remains far too low for a country that should converge faster to EUaverage incomes. Productivity, labor demand, and competition in product markets need
to improve, for which a more business friendly policy environment is a key prerequisite.

Hungary has been plagued by low growth
and high debt for much of the last decade. Growth
performance has been one of the weakest in the
region, and real GDP in 2012 was about 6 percent
below the 2008 level. At the same time, public and
external debt and currency mismatches in the economy
have been very high (Figure 1).

of the financial crisis, the economy is undergoing a
difficult period of balance sheet adjustment which inevitably exerts a negative impact on growth.
And although the imbalances have improved, the adjustment process is still not complete.
Government policies have sought to cushion the impact of the downturn on households, rein in
fiscal deficits, and boost employment. However, increased state interference in the economy
including through frequent and unpredictable policy changes (e.g., sectoral taxes, pension
nationalization, mortgage pre-payment schemes, utility tariff cuts) and the weakening of institutions
(e.g., diminished role of the Fiscal Council and the Constitutional Court) have hurt the investment
climate, undercutting prospects for recovery (Box 1).

3.
Despite considerable headwinds, financial stability was broadly maintained in 2012.
With large vulnerabilities and limited space to absorb shocks, financial pressures rose sharply in late
2011–early 2012, in the wake of growth and financial spillovers from the eurozone crisis, which
exacerbated existing strains on the domestic economy. However, despite these pressures, the
authorities managed to navigate a challenging year and maintain macroeconomic stability. The
external financial environment has improved considerably in recent months, but this has not
translated into benefits for the broader economy.

Box 1. Implementation of Past IMF Recommendations
During the last Article IV consultation, Directors underscored the need for a different policy mix to
restore confidence in economic governance, anchor the ongoing adjustment, and strengthen
economic institutions. Overall, there was no major change in policy direction in 2012, and several
policies deviated from past Fund advice.
Key recommendations

Implemented policies

Ensure fiscal sustainability through a coherent
tax and expenditure policy mix.

A large fiscal adjustment was implemented and the
deficit target was met. However, the adjustment relied
heavily on ad-hoc tax measures.

Strengthen the Fiscal Council.

No significant measures were taken to strengthen the
Fiscal Council’s independence and mandate.

Contain financial sector risks and finalize the
bank resolution framework.

Several initiatives were implemented to provide debt
relief for households, often with little prior consultation
with banks. Plans to reduce bank taxes were reversed; the
levy became permanent and a new tax on bank
transactions was introduced. The bank resolution
framework is still under discussion.

Pursue structural reforms to improve the
business environment, competitiveness, and
labor supply.

No major structural reforms were advanced in 2012, but
some measures were taken to increase labor
participation including through tightening
unemployment benefits and launching the Job
Protection Plan (effective in 2013).

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.
The economic environment deteriorated markedly in 2012. Against strong headwinds
from a challenging environment, strained balance sheets, and a drag from the significant fiscal
adjustment, the economy slipped into a second recession in four years, with real GDP estimated to
have declined by 1.7 percent (Figure 2).
Consumption resumed its trend decline (about 2½ percent in 2012) despite several initiatives to
support household incomes and improve labor
market conditions. In particular, the minimum
wage was increased by 18 percent in 2012; the
public works program was extended to cover over
100,000 workers; and various mortgage
restructuring schemes were implemented (Box 2).
Nonetheless, consumer confidence remained
depressed and household consumption continued

to decline reflecting the elevated debt service burden, erosion of real disposable income due to
high inflation, and heavier tax burden on low income workers from the regressive flat personal
income tax. Unemployment stayed flat at around 10.7 percent (e-o-p), near post crisis high
levels, as demand for labor from the private sector remained subdued.

Net exports remained the only source of
growth, on the back of continued import
compression and the expansion of the auto
industry. Although the recent weakening in the
pace of exports can be attributed to a
worsened external environment, the decline in
export market shares in recent years indicates
that Hungary may be losing ground compared
to peers (Box 3).

Financial intermediation declined
sharply. Banks have continued to scale down
their operations under pressure from heavy
taxation, losses from government mortgage relief
schemes, and rising NPLs (Figure 3). The reduction
in external funding accelerated beyond the pace
seen in peer countries, and the loan-to-deposits
ratio dropped sharply to 111 percent at end-2012.
Most of this reflects reduced lending as the
deposit base has remained broadly stable. Banks
have tightened their lending standards and are
less willing to expand in the corporate sector,
particularly to small and medium enterprises
(SMEs). Demand for new loans, especially from
households, is also very weak. Non-performing
loans (NPLs) continued to increase in both the
retail and corporate segments (reaching
15 percent and 21 percent, respectively).1
Restructured loans are on the rise (11 percent of
all loans), reflecting the implicit incentive by the
absence of penalties in the form of provisions.

The fiscal deficit declined below 3 percent of GDP. After nine years under the excessive
deficit procedure (EDP) and to avoid the suspension of cohesion funds, the government embarked
on a sizable consolidation (Figure 4). The 2012 deficit is estimated at 2½ percent of GDP, implying a

Against a decline in risk premia and a weak economic outlook, the MNB started to
ease monetary policy in the second half of 2012 (Figure 5). The policy stance was kept tight
during the first seven months of the year as financial conditions were unsettled and inflation
remained stubbornly above 5 percent. Since August, policy rates have been cut by 175 basis points
in seven successive steps. These were split vote decisions, with the monetary council’s (MPC)
external members outvoting MNB’s management. The majority considered that the effects of costpush factors (energy prices and indirect tax rate hikes) that kept inflation above the central bank’s 3
percent target were waning, and the pull from weak demand conditions was sufficient to steer
inflation towards the target by mid-2014. The exchange rate closed at HUF291 per euro at end 2012,
appreciating by 6½ percent during the year, but suffering bouts of volatility.

thereafter as domestic demand bottoms out.
Yet weak policies, low labor participation, and the poor investment climate are likely to keep
growth subdued in the medium term.2 Current account surpluses are projected for 2013–14,
which would gradually narrow as domestic demand and imports recover. Absent new tax hikes
and administrative price adjustment, inflation will moderate in 2013–14.
10.
Downside risks to the baseline outlook are considerable. On the domestic side, the
recession could prove more persistent prolonged by weaker than expected private consumption
and business confidence. On the external side, the reemergence of pressures in the euro area
could be particularly destabilizing for Hungary given its strong regional trade and financial
linkages leading to sharper credit crunch and economic slowdown. In addition, a reversal of
capital flows, including markedly diminished non-residents’ participation in Hungarian securities,
prompted by either an intensification of the euro area crisis or domestic policies could cause
severe funding pressures and an abrupt depreciation. In turn, this would further impair balance
sheets given the still sizable foreign currency exposures (Box 5) and undermine external
sustainability (Appendix).3 On the upside, sustained capital inflows could lead to an exchange
rate appreciation and improved balance sheets, providing a boost to domestic demand.
Authorities’ views
11.
The government was generally sanguine about the outlook and confident that
current policies will support economic recovery. It viewed the 2012 contraction as the result
of external headwinds, the poor agricultural harvest, and the drag from fiscal adjustment. It

expected real GDP to grow by 0.9 percent in 2013 and 2 percent in 2014, as external conditions
improve, the drag from the fiscal stance is lifted, targeted measures increase household
disposable income, and the absorption of EU funds is accelerated. The MNB was less upbeat. It
expressed serious concerns about the worsened growth outlook. It estimated that potential
growth declined to around 0–½ percent in 2012 (in line with staff’s assessment), and expected it
to rise to a modest 1 percent in 2013–14.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Discussions centered on the viability and challenges of the current economic strategy, the
sustainability of the fiscal adjustment, the need to repair bank and household balance sheets,
and structural reforms to support investment and job creation.

groups of workers.4,5 Overall, revenues in the form of sectoral taxes are expected to rise to
around 2½ percent of GDP in 2013. Total spending is expected to exceed 50 percent of GDP.
13.
Based on current policies, the 2013 target is expected to be missed. Staff supported
the slightly looser 2013 target (relative to the 2.2 percent target under the convergence plan),
given the weak state of the economy, but expressed deep concern about the composition and
adequacy of measures underpinning the budget. Absent new measures, the deficit is likely to
reach 4½ percent of GDP with the overrun mainly caused by overestimation of revenue

15.
Importantly, staff called for a significantly different composition of fiscal policy to
improve growth prospects and ensure the sustainability of the fiscal adjustment. The tax
burden on several economic sectors has increased, undermining investment, employment, and
growth. At the same time, public expenditure is among the highest in the region (Box 6). Staff
argued for a medium-term plan to streamline spending while protecting the most vulnerable,
which would open room for the needed rationalization of the tax system.6 Possible actions
include : (i) reducing the cost of the central government bureaucracy and containing spending at
the local government level, where savings can be found after the centralization of health and
education spending; (ii) restructuring loss making transport state-owned enterprises (SOE)s to
reduce state transfers; (iii) better targeting social benefits to vulnerable groups; (iv) gradually
eliminating sectoral taxes while streamlining the corporate tax regime; (v) reducing disincentives

Staff’s analysis suggests that consolidation based on current expenditures cuts yields the smallest GDP
contraction in the short term and can increase output in the long term by stimulating labor participation and
private investment. See Selected Issues Paper: “The Composition of Fiscal Consolidation Matters: Policy

to work embedded in the personal income tax; and (vi) reducing tax expenditures and adopting a
more comprehensive approach to tackle VAT fraud, particularly in the basic food sector (Box 7).7
16.
Staff underscored the need to move ahead with the structural fiscal reform agenda
and strengthen fiscal institutions. Enhancing fiscal institutions would better support
macroeconomic and fiscal performance. In this regard, staff recommended: (i) introducing a
medium-term budget framework that will support the targets under the Convergence plan and
EU fiscal rules; and (ii) strengthening the fiscal council by enhancing its independence, providing
it with sufficient resources, and broadening its mandate to effectively assess budgetary objectives
and risks.
Authorities’ views
17.
The government was confident that the 2013–14 deficits will remain below
3 percent of GDP. It argued that despite some possible slippages, the contingency reserves are
sufficient to meet the deficit target. The government saw no room to change the current tax
system, which in its view, balances appropriately the tax burden among the various sectors of the
economy. In this respect, they also saw no need for sizable reduction in spending, although they
noted plans to reduce the cost of public administration. They also noted their plans to
strengthen the budgetary framework by introducing the European Structural Balance rule for the
general government by end-2013.

B. Monetary Policy—A Difficult Balancing Act

higher taxes and nominal wage increases.
19.
Staff argued that a pause in the easing cycle seems prudent and further cuts should
be considered only in the context of strengthened macro policies and improved market
conditions. Beyond the uncertainty surrounding the inflation trajectory, staff cautioned that

policy rate cuts cannot substitute for other policies to jump-start growth, particularly when the
credit channel is impaired. In fact, with fickle market confidence, deep policy rate cuts could lead
to currency depreciation and could risk de-stabilizing the financial system, given the sizable FX
exposures in private balance sheets. Stronger policies (including fiscal), moderation of inflation
expectations, and low risk premia would facilitate further policy rate cuts. In this regard,
maintaining the legal and operational independence of the MNB is critical.
20.
Although there is no compelling evidence that the forint is considerably
misaligned, structural factors may be eroding competitiveness (Box 3). Standard
methodologies find only weak evidence for overvaluation. Nonetheless, Hungary has been
gradually losing export market share and lagging labor productivity has raised unit labor costs
relative to peers due mostly to structural factors rather than exchange rate developments.
Considering the balance sheet exposure to exchange rate movements, improving
competitiveness should be based on removing the impediments that hamper investment and
hold back private activity, and advancing structural reforms. This would help to maintain a strong
current account and improve the large negative net international investment position over time.
21.
An adequate reserve position would help provide strong buffers against shocks.

Views within the MNB were divided. The MNB management favored a tighter
monetary stance. They expressed concern that the higher production costs and possible overestimation of the output gap may lead to higher inflationary pressures in the period ahead. They
also doubted the effectiveness of monetary easing to spur growth in the current juncture, given
the impaired credit channel and the adverse balance sheet effects of a weaker currency that may
be associated with further cuts. The external MPC members were more sanguine about the
inflation outlook, arguing that higher production costs will not result in inflationary pressures as
the output gap remains sizable. In this regard, they were convinced that the improved external
environment creates room for monetary policy easing and that policy rate cuts could contribute
to credit growth. The MPC members assessed the level of reserves as adequate by a variety of
indicators. The MNB did not see the forint as overvalued, but shared staff’s concerns that
Hungary’s international competitiveness may have started to weaken recently.

C. Financial Sector—Restore Conditions for Financial Intermediation
23.
While the banking system is generally stable, important vulnerabilities remain.
Banks’ average capital adequacy ratio (CAR) as of end-2012 (15 percent) appears adequate and
stress tests conducted by the Central Bank indicate an improvement in the shock-absorbing
capacity of the banking sector as a whole. However, with subdued economic activity, rising nonperforming and restructured loans, possibly over-stated collateral, and a heavy tax burden,8
banks’ profitability is projected to remain low. In this difficult landscape, banks are planning to
further scale down their operations. Credit growth is projected to remain negative in 2013 on the
back of weak household demand and banks’ limited appetite to lend. Reduction of parent banks’
cross-border exposure (including to their subsidiaries) is likely to continue, albeit at a more
gradual pace, and thus contribute to the negative credit growth and weak economic activity in
the period ahead.9
24.
Higher bank provisioning is needed in view of the worsening asset quality and
weak collateral. Rising corporate and household NPLs point to the risk of further losses,10
particularly given the relatively low provisioning (47

Sector (Percent of Total Loans)

provisioning, including through more frequent and

uncertainty regarding future losses and assist with the

are adequately reported and provisioned for.

25.
Speeding up portfolio cleaning is desirable but banks’ capacity to absorb further
losses is limited. Portfolio cleaning remains sluggish. Staff concurred with the authorities that
resolution of NPLs should be led by banks in a cooperative fashion, yet noted that a more
proactive approach, which would provide incentives for the banks to clean up their portfolios, is
warranted. In this regard, staff stressed the need to remove legal, tax and regulatory
8

The levy imposed on banks has a fixed base reflecting the size of the banks’ balance sheets in 2009. However,
since then, some banks’ balance sheets have contracted by as much as 20 percent, resulting in a rising tax

See Selected Issues Paper “NPLs in CESEE: Determinants and Impact on Macroeconomic Performance”.

10

The recent rise in NPL ratio in the household segment is in part due to the early mortgage repayment scheme,
which reduced the stock of outstanding household loans by 12 percent.

This in part reflects banks’ reluctance to realize losses in the face of a frozen real estate market.

impediments to facilitate speedy liquidation of collateral while keeping an adequate balance
between creditors and debtors rights.13 Establishing a personal insolvency framework would also
help expedite the portfolio cleaning process. Staff noted that developing an out-of-court debt
restructuring framework would reduce present delays and high collection costs while further
alleviating the pressure on the judicial system. Staff welcomed the establishment of the National
Asset Management Agency (NAMA), though saw room to relax the participation requirements
and change its financing structure to reduce the burden on the treasury.14
26.
Banks need more stable sources of external funding to reduce reliance on FX swaps.
The stock of FX swaps (used to hedge on-balance sheet open FX positions) declined in 2012, in
tandem with the reduction in banks’ FX assets. But at a level of €10 billion (about 10 percent of
GDP) and with relatively short maturity (on average 1½ years), FX swaps represent a significant
vulnerability to the financial system as they can amplify the negative effects of external shocks on
the exchange rate. Staff noted the recent improvements in the macro-prudential regulatory
framework, including the introduction of the FX Funding Adequacy Ratio (FFAR),15 and stressed
that, as the reduction of banks’ FX assets continues, banks should be encouraged to turn to more
stable sources of external financing. In this regard, staff also welcomed the authorities’ efforts to
reduce the rollover and liquidity risks associated with FX swaps by negotiating with the banks to
voluntarily limit their off-balance sheet net FX position to below 15 percent of total assets.
27.
Hungarian banks’ regional operations should continue to be monitored to minimize
the risk of potential adverse outward spillovers. The largest domestic bank has several
subsidiaries in the region accounting for about 40 percent of its total assets. While these
subsidiaries are mostly small, they are relatively large in Bulgaria and Montenegro (among the
top three banks by bank assets).16 The HFSA is in regular contact with host country supervisors
and staff does not see an imminent risk of systemic spillovers in the host countries from the
activities of this bank. Continued effective supervision of banking group’s and enhanced
cooperation with host country supervisory agencies will be critical to ensure the stability and
soundness of host country financial systems.
13

For instance, by reconsidering the regulations for debt cancellation, such that under certain conditions it would
not result in income for debtors (i.e. no tax consequence), and could be booked as cost by banks (i.e. tax shield
effect).

14

NAMA started to operate in the summer of 2012 with the objective of helping lower income families who are
unable to repay their loans by purchasing their properties and renting them back at a price determined by law. It
is not clear, however, whether NAMA would be able to purchase the full 25,000 properties allowed by the law by
2014 given the strict requirements (for example, only those that have at least one child and receive some sort of
social benefits are eligible to participate).

15

The liquidity buffer has to exceed 20 percent of corporate and retail deposits and/or exceed 10 percent of total
assets (January 2012). Under FFAR, the ratio of stable FX funding (including FX swaps above one year) to FX
assets needs to exceed 65 percent.

16

Other subsidiaries are located in Russia, Ukraine, Croatia, Romania, Slovakia, and Serbia, and make up between
1 and 7 percent of total banking group assets each. They are increasingly locally funded and are more active in
retail banking, though some specialize in corporate lending.

28.
Staff warned against an increased role of the government in providing credit to the
economy, particularly given the limited fiscal space. The government’s efforts to facilitate
lending to SMEs through tax incentives, refinancing, and direct lending by the state-controlled
banks has had little success so far, and further efforts to expand the government’s involvement in
lending to the private sector are underway. Staff argued that the most efficient way to restore
credit growth is through improving the broader policy framework and its predictability, including
by abolishing the bank levy, which is delinked from banks’ current size and performance. Staff, in
this regard, welcomed the governments’ intent to re-engage with banks in an effort to establish
a better operational environment.
Authorities’ views
29.
The authorities agreed that the lack of financial intermediation undermines
economic activity. They concurred that credit is likely to continue to contract in 2013 due to
both demand and supply factors. They saw a role for government action, including through
credit guarantees and mortgage rate subsidies, to improve SMEs’ access to credit and reduce the
cost of borrowing to households. While agreeing that the high share of NPLs and restructured
loans burdens banks’ balance sheets, the authorities expressed concern that forcing banks to
move faster with portfolio cleaning would amplify their losses, particularly given the weak real
estate market. The MNB agreed that the regulatory framework could be strengthened to ensure
adequate provisioning. However, the financial supervision authority (HFSA) was more optimistic
arguing that loan-loss provisioning is adequate and the recent improvement in the banks’ capital
position would be sufficient to withstand possible losses. The HFSA noted its intent to issue
guidelines to banks within the first half of 2013, requiring additional provisions for loans that
have been restructured multiple times. They also stressed their plans to enforce stricter collateral
valuation for real estate, and harmonize appraisal methods across banks. The authorities are
working on a bank resolution framework, including with IMF technical assistance, aiming to
submit legislation for parliamentary approval by June-2013.

below the level needed to bring the high unemployment back to its pre-crisis levels.

HUNGARY

31.
The gains to potential growth from comprehensive efforts to raise productivity and
labor participation could be substantial. In this regard, measures are needed to:


Improve the business climate. Hungary’s ranking (54) in the World Bank’s Doing Business
Report continued to deteriorate in 2013 after falling both in 2012 and 2011 (by 5 and 8
places, respectively), primarily due to worsening perceptions about investors’ protection,
institutions, and tax burden. A level playing field for all business, a stronger investor
protection framework, and a more predictable policy framework, including through more
balanced fiscal consolidation and a better operational environment for banks would help
support investment and economic activity.



Raise the exceptionally low labor participation rate. The authorities have placed job
creation as a key policy objective and have adopted measures to stimulate employment,
including by tightening unemployment and welfare benefits, expanding the public works
program, and reducing tax rates and social contributions for some segments of the labor
force. Staff argued for (i) a more employment-friendly taxation for low income earners,
including by introducing a basic allowance in the personal income tax to increase labor
supply; (ii) upgrading the public works program by significantly scaling up training and skillenhancing services; and (iii) raising women’s participation in the labor market by reorienting
public spending from cash benefits, including overly long post-maternity parental leave
benefits, towards the development of high quality early childhood education and day care
centers.



Strengthen competition. Possible measures in this area include the reduction of
unnecessary regulations and entry barriers that continue to pose obstacles to
entrepreneurship, and enhancing the operation, effectiveness, and role of the Competition
Authority.17 In addition, increasing competition in the services sectors can raise productivity.
This includes the utility sector, where reforms to allow for more competition is a more
sustainable way to help drive down utility tariffs than administrative measures.



Enhance the efficiency of SOEs. The restructuring of loss making transport SOEs is long
overdue and could help improve services and resource reallocation while phasing out a
persistent drain on the budget.

Authorities’ views

While agreeing on the need to remove structural bottlenecks to growth, the
authorities envisage a more favorable growth outlook based on ongoing initiatives. In their

base to jumpstart the economy. Private investment would be supported by strategic agreements
with large manufacturing companies and more targeted use of EU transfers. They pointed out
that Hungary’s labor market regulations ensure a high degree of flexibility, and labor
participation will continue to increase thanks to recent changes to early pension requirements
and unemployment and disability benefits. Labor demand will strengthen on account of the
targeted relief afforded by the Job Protection Plan. Finally, they noted that exports could be
supported by expanding the role of the Eximbank and by efforts to strengthen trade links with
non-EU partners such as China, Russia, and the Arab countries.

POST PROGRAM MONITORING
33.
In the current favorable market environment no official financing is envisaged.
Outstanding Fund credit to Hungary is projected to fall below 200 percent of quota in August
2013, and be mostly eliminated by mid-2014 (Table 11). Hungary’s capacity to repay the Fund is
expected to remain adequate, assuming continued access to international capital markets and/or
continued strong nonresident participation in the domestic government debt market. However,
downside risks (as described in paragraph 10) remain sizable and should they materialize
meeting the debt payments could become challenging.

STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
Hungary managed to navigate a challenging year. Despite the strong headwinds from
the external and domestic environment, financial stability was maintained. However,
vulnerabilities are still high and leave Hungary exposed to considerable risks. In this environment,
external shocks and policy missteps could threaten financial stability. The main challenge is to
strengthen policies to maintain confidence, reduce vulnerabilities, and generate robust and
sustainable economic growth.
35.
A change in policy direction would help revive growth, improve competitiveness,
and support the orderly unwinding of imbalances. The output decline in recent years has
been deeper than in peer countries, and the economic outlook is clouded by unconventional
policies that are steadily eroding confidence, undercutting investment and growth.
Competitiveness has been declining despite no strong evidence of exchange rate misalignment.
Priority should be placed on strengthening policy credibility, delivering the fiscal adjustment in a
more growth-friendly way, and restoring bank intermediation. The pace of structural reforms,
which has lost steam recently, should be accelerated. In this regard, efforts are needed to
improve the poor business climate, address the persistent weak conditions of state-owned
enterprises (especially in the transportation sector), and increase competition in product markets.
These efforts should be combined with further measures to raise labor participation, including by
enhancing vocational training and introducing a basic allowance in the personal income tax to
make the taxation of labor more employment-friendly for low earners.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

HUNGARY

36.
The commitment to fiscal consolidation is welcome but the composition of the
adjustment needs to improve to support growth. Transient sectoral surcharges have now
become a permanent feature of the tax system and new taxes, like the bank transaction tax, have
been introduced to support an unsustainably high level of public spending. The authorities are
encouraged to focus their efforts on achieving a durable spending reduction that will pave the
way to reduce the tax burden and improve the efficiency of the tax system over time. In addition,
decisive steps should be taken to strengthen revenue administration, in particular to combat VAT
fraud.
37.
Strong discipline and additional efforts are necessary to put public debt firmly on a
downward path. Public debt has stabilized but remains high and its financing poses
considerable risks. This leaves no space to loosen the fiscal stance in 2013 or to pause the fiscal
consolidation in 2014. Additional efforts are needed to ensure that public debt and financing
needs are reduced to more manageable levels.
38.
Restoring financial intermediation is critical for economic recovery. A turnaround in
bank lending requires improving the banking system’s operational environment. Key steps
include scaling down the tax burden on the financial sector and facilitating conditions to help
banks clean up their asset portfolio from rising NPLs, including by removing tax, legal, and
regulatory obstacles that hamper the resolution of impaired assets. This would be a more
effective and less costly way to support credit growth than resorting to ad-hoc initiatives
involving tax incentives, credit guarantees, and on-lending by state-controlled banks. At the
same time, the authorities should step up the monitoring of NPL classification and provisioning,
including for repeatedly restructured loans.
39.
While the recent monetary policy easing was appropriate, a pause in the easing
cycle seems prudent at this point. The challenge ahead is to guide inflation sustainably to
lower levels while striking the right balance between supporting economic activity and financial
stability. Inflation is still not well anchored and is projected to decelerate in 2013 mainly on the
back of lower administered utility tariffs. Further monetary easing should proceed only as
inflation expectations and risk premia moderate and pressures on the forint do not emerge. A
strong policy framework, including maintaining the operational and legal independence of the
MNB, will be critical for the credibility of the inflation targeting regime.

It is recommended to hold the next Article IV consultation on the standard
12 month cycle.

When the crisis hit, servicing the debt became
increasingly burdensome. The rising share of debt
payments in income and the decline in asset prices led to a
steep increase in default rates. To alleviate the pressure, the
government introduced several measures in 2011–12,
including:

Interest payment/disposable income

Source: MNB.

 Early FX mortgage repayment scheme (September 2011). Households with FX-denominated
mortgages were allowed to pay off their loans at a preferential exchange rate (around 25 percent below
the market rate). The cost arising from the exchange rate difference was initially to be borne by the
banks, though the scheme was later modified to allow banks to deduct 30 percent of the losses from
the 2011 bank levy.
 Locking in preferential exchange rates for a five-year period (“exchange rate cap”). Eligible
borrowers can lock their amortization payments at a preferential rate through June 30, 2017. The
difference with the originally scheduled principal payments is accumulated in the form of separate HUF
loan to be repaid by the debtor after five years. The cost arising from the interest rate differential will be
split between the state and the banks.
 Conversion of non-performing FX mortgage loans into forints. Borrowers of FX mortgage loans
with at least 90-day overdue payments of over HUF 78,000 at end-September 2011 were entitled to
convert their loans to forints at the average exchange rate prevailing between May 15 and June 15,
2012. Banks had to cancel 25 percent of the debt converted to forints, but were allowed to deduct 30
percent of the resulting loss from the bank levy.

Box 2. Household Indebtedness (continued)
The mortgage relief programs have so far had a modest impact on the debt stock. The participation
rate was relatively low – in part due to the complex design of the programs. In particular, the early
repayment scheme mostly favored borrowers in good standing who could afford to pay off their loans. The
participation in the conversion scheme of non-performing FX mortgages was hindered by the collateral
requirement which specified that the value of the borrower’s real estate could not exceed HUF 20 million
and by the fact that part of the savings were offset by the higher interest rate of new forint loans. Finally, the
registration (one third of eligible debtors) in the “exchange rate cap” program (open until March 2013) has
undershot expectations due to the complexity of program and the uncertainty that it envisages after the 5year grace period.
But the cost has been sizable. The programs have so far resulted in a net transfer of about 1½ percent of
GDP to households, of which two-thirds was borne by banks and one-third by the government.

These metrics notwithstanding, Hungary’s international
competitiveness may be weakening (panel chart). Compared to regional peers, labor productivity has
remained broadly flat since 2009, making unit labor costs relatively high in Hungary. Along with the
deteriorating business climate, this may be contributing to Hungary gradually losing export market share,
receiving less FDI than it did in the pre-crisis years, and having a lower share of profits generated by
nonresident-owned corporates reinvested in Hungary.

Box 4. External Deleveraging and Economic Growth
Real growth of credit to the private sector

Since 2008, the reduction in cross-border exposures to
Central Eastern and Southeastern Europe (CESEE) has
been sizable reaching an average of 4¾ percent of
GDP.1 The strong positive correlation between banks’
external funding and credit growth (Figure 1) suggests
that the outflows may be associated with a weak pace of
economic recovery, particularly in economies that face
difficulties in substituting external resources with domestic
ones.

To study the impact of the reduction in cross border
Sources: IFS and IMF staff's calculations
funding on economic activity, a panel VAR was
estimated using quarterly data from 2001q1 to 2012q2 for 12 CESEE economies. The VAR includes
three endogenous variables: the real GDP growth, the real growth of banks’ credit to the private sector, and
the real change in banks’ liabilities to non-residents (yoy). The results confirm that there is a positive and
significant link between cross-border financial flows and economic growth and that the causality runs both
ways. In particular:

 A positive shock of one standard deviation (17 percent, yoy) to the banks’ external liabilities leads to
an increase of 3.3 percent in real credit growth and 0.6 percentage point in real GDP growth (after four
quarters, yoy basis) (Figure 2).
 A positive shock of one standard deviation (2.5 percent, yoy) to real GDP growth leads, on average,
to a real growth in banks’ external liabilities of about 4.7 percent (after four quarters, yoy basis) (Figure
3).

Implications for Hungary: The sharp decline in banks’ external funding observed in Q2:2012 (12 percent) is
likely to induce further credit contraction and subdued GDP growth in the year ahead. Other things being
equal, the estimation suggests that it could contribute to the contraction of lending to the private sector (of
about 2.3 percent in the real terms), and to shave about 0.4 percentage points off real GDP growth in the
next four quarters. This magnitude is about twice the size of the impact that would have been if external
deleveraging in Hungary was in line with the median size of deleveraging among CESEE economies.

Box 5. Sectoral Balance Sheets—FX Exposure
The currency exposure of the economy has
diminished recently. This reflects the ongoing
balance sheet adjustment in the economy as well as
the small exchange rate appreciation in 2012.
However, at close to 130 percent of GDP, Hungary’s
external debt remains among the highest in the
region.
 Government. Foreign currency
denominated public debt stands at 34 percent of
GDP about (40 percent of total public debt). Its
decline in 2012 reflects a small currency
appreciation and the lack of external placements
since 2011. However, non-resident holdings of
HUF government bonds have increased
considerably to 45 percent of the stock (18
percent of GDP).

 Banks. The banks’ open FX position has
declined from a peak of over 15 percent of GDP
in 2011 to 8 percent in 2012. This reflects a very
large contraction in FX assets (including due to
the early mortgage repayment and the ban on
new FX household loans), partly offset by the
sharp reduction in cross border funding.

Non-residents' net FX swaps

 Non-financial enterprises. The stock of FX
debt has moderated since 2009, due to the
repayment of maturing loans and the weak
issuance of new loans.

 Households. The stock of FX debt,
consisting mostly of mortgages, has declined
considerably since its peak in 2010 but still
represents close to 25 percent of GDP. To a large
extent, the decline reflects the impact of the
early repayment schemes launched in recent
years.

Box 6. Fiscal Policy During 2010–13
Several fiscal policy measures have been adopted since 2010. The analysis below focuses on structural
changes by excluding the largest transitory factors, such as the nationalization of the pension system, EU
transfers, and the payment of overdue VAT refunds. The main conclusions are the following:
 The large fiscal adjustment in 2012-13 is to a large extent a reversal of the structural loosening in
the previous two years.
 The adjustment between 2011 and 2013 reflects higher revenue collections. Specifically, revenue in
2013 is expected to be 2½ percent of GDP higher than in 2011, most of which is due to higher taxes. By
contrast, primary spending has been broadly flat as savings associated with the implementation of the
Szell-Kalman plan have been largely offset by other discretionary increases.
 The structure of the tax system has changed significantly compared to 2010. The current system
involves a shift away from direct taxes towards consumption taxes and special levies. This is mainly the
result of the introduction of the flat PIT and a lower corporate tax (CIT) rate combined with higher VAT
and excise tax rates. At the same time, the tax system now relies significantly (2 ½ percent of GDP) on
sectoral taxes.

Box 7. Tackling VAT Fraud
The level of VAT fraud in Hungary is high. The authorities’ conservative estimates place it at 1¾ percent
of GDP. The problem in the agricultural and food sectors is particularly pervasive, with losses of ½ a percent
of GDP in the food sector alone, according to private sector organizations), but other sectors (e.g.
construction) are affected too. VAT frauds amount to 20 percent of all the tax violations detected by the
National Tax and Customs Administration in 2011.
Beyond the fiscal implications, VAT fraud results in an unfair playing field for companies and might
be detrimental to employment and investment. The main types of VAT-related fraud are fictitious
invoicing and missing trader or carousel fraud. The profits made by fraudulent companies in the VAT “chain”
enable them to sell products at a reduced price to retailers who, in turn, are able to sell products at a
reduced price to consumers. This generates unfair competition and pushes down the profit margin of
“lawful” companies, some of which may have difficulties to survive in these market conditions.
A comprehensive approach is needed to tackle VAT fraud, notably carousel fraud. The authorities have
introduced, among other measures, reverse VAT charging for certain products, but this is only a stop-gap
measure. A comprehensive plan with measures to prevent, detect and disrupt the fraud can help with VAT
administration. Specific goals should be to: (i) stop the fraud before it begins by identifying “fraudulent”
companies at the registration stage; (ii) enhance risk management of the verification of VAT returns and
proactively target audits to missing trader fraud-related cases; and (iii) make greater use of the anti-money
laundering (AML) framework to tackle missing trader fraud.

APPENDIX
Hungary: Debt Sustainability Analysis
Hungary’s high public and external debt and financing needs remain important sources of
vulnerability. Although liquidity pressures have diminished on the back of improved market conditions
and the recent Eurobond issuance, rollover risks remain high. Stress tests indicate that shocks to
growth and the exchange rate could make debt unsustainable.
1.
Under the baseline scenario, public debt is projected to remain broadly flat but at an
already high level. The baseline scenario assumes no policy changes, and therefore the fiscal deficit
is expected to deviate from the convergence program targets. Under this scenario, debt would
remain at around 80 percent of GDP as the small projected primary surpluses are almost entirely
offset by an unfavorable interest rate/growth differential. Due to the high level of debt Hungary is
susceptible to sudden changes in investor sentiment and, although financing pressures have
subsided, rollover needs remain high. In staff’s view, sustained primary surpluses above 2 percent of
GDP are needed to put debt firmly on a downward trajectory.
2.
A number of plausible shocks could threaten Hungary’s public debt sustainability
(Figure 1). The main risks to the baseline stem from weaker than expected growth and a
depreciation of the forint. The former, which could result from a continued weak external
environment, could lead to an increase in the public debt ratio to above 100 percent of GDP by
2018. Similarly, a depreciation of a magnitude comparable to historical episodes as a result of a
sizable reversal of capital flows would have an immediate and substantial impact on the public debt
ratio due to the still significant share of foreign currency denominated debt. In particular, 30 percent
depreciation would raise public debt to close to 100 percent of GDP.
3.
Hungary’s external debt has declined in recent years but remains high (Table 2, Figure
2). Gross external debt has declined from its peak of about 150 percent of GDP in early 2010 to 129
percent of GDP at end-September 2012. The improvement mainly reflects the heavy deleveraging by
the banking sector that began during the global financial crisis, although this was partly offset by
higher external government debt. Intra-company loans related to FDI remain broadly stable,
amounting to just above 20 percent of gross debt throughout this period. Going forward, external
debt is expected to continue to decline, with all sectors except for the government continuing to
make net repayments. External bond issuances and continued purchases of HUF-denominated
securities by nonresidents are expected to keep government external debt elevated, albeit declining
in percent of GDP over the medium term.
4.
As with public debt, shocks to growth and the exchange rate are the main sources of
risk to external debt sustainability. An adverse permanent growth shock of ½ standard deviation
of the historical variation in growth (about 4 percentage points) would put external debt dynamics
on an unsustainable path. Similarly, a one-time real depreciation of 30 percent would add about 40
percentage points to external debt.

1/ General government gross debt. Estimates based on government debt agency (AKK) data.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes. For 2011, largely reflects the effect of the pension assets transfer to government.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.
10/ 2011 calculations exclude the effect of the pension asset transfer to government on revenues.

Current Status of Safeguards Assessment:
The safeguards assessment of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) was finalized on January 28, 2009.
The assessment found that the central bank had a relatively strong safeguards framework in place.
The MNB’s control environment was well established, and the audit and financial reporting practices
adhered to international standards. The assessment recommended measures to improve the process
of program data reporting to the Fund and to strengthen audit oversight, especially over the central
bank’s basic tasks. In recent years the central bank law was subject to numerous changes. Going

HUNGARY

forward, it is critical to avoid undue changes to the MNB’s legal framework and to ensure that the
law continues to support MNB’s operational and legal independence.
Exchange Rate Arrangements:
The Hungarian forint is classified as floating, effective November 1, 2008. Hungary has accepted the
obligations of Article VIII and maintains an exchange rate system free of restrictions on the making
of payments and transfers on current international transactions except for those maintained solely
for the preservation of national or international security and that have been notified to the Fund
pursuant to Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51). Effective February 27, 2012, the MNB
discontinued the program of foreign exchange sale tenders, which involved multiple exchange rates
for spot transactions.
Article IV Consultation:
Hungary is on a 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV Board discussion took place on
January 18, 2012. The associated Executive Board assessment is available at

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance


General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance.



Government Finance Statistics: Data reporting on fiscal accounting needs to be improved
further. The monthly cash-basis accounts of the central government prepared by the
Ministry of National Economy do not reflect the GFS presentation. This complicates staff’s
ability to analyze trends and to appropriately anticipate the impact on general government
accounts. Data on revenue and expenditure arrears has been readily provided by the
authorities upon request, but provision of this data on an automatic basis would facilitate
the monitoring of obligations on an accrual basis. Similarly, automatic provision of local
government revenues and expenditures, as well as of financial statements of state-owned
enterprises (an important source of contingent liabilities), would allow for closer regular
monitoring of the general government.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
March 29, 2013

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation and Third
Post-Program Monitoring Discussions with Hungary
On March 18, 2013 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation and Third Post-Program Monitoring discussions with Hungary. 1
Background
Hungary’s economy has not yet recovered to pre-crisis levels. After a modest recovery in 2011,
real GDP is estimated to have contracted by 1.7 percent in 2012. Continued weakness in
private consumption and investment, compounded by a sizable fiscal consolidation, contributed
to the downturn. Net exports, buoyed by the expansion of the car industry, were a key source of
growth.
The outlook remains challenging. The economy is projected to stagnate in 2013 amid continued
weakness in domestic demand and only a mild improvement of external conditions.
Consumption is still hampered by the ongoing repair of households’ balance sheets and the
business climate and investment have weakened. Banks remain under stress, reflecting the
heavy tax burden, high Non-Performing Loans (NPLs), and weak growth outlook. Labor
participation, while somewhat increasing, remains low. In this context, the economy’s growth
potential is subdued, thus, amplifying the cost and risks related to the large imbalances in the
economy.
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.
1

2
With regard to policies, significant strides were made toward fiscal consolidation in 2012, with
the general government deficit declining to around 2½ percent of GDP. Some two-thirds of the
adjustment was due to revenue measures, including unconventional taxes on the banking,
telecom, electricity, and retail sectors. The government is aiming for a fiscal deficit of
2¾ percent of GDP in 2013, maintaining a broadly neutral cyclical stance.
In line with global trends, market sentiment toward Hungary improved markedly in recent
months. After spiking near the end of 2011, risk spreads narrowed and the exchange rate
strengthened during 2012. Taking advantage of the situation, Hungary’s National Bank (MNB)
started a monetary policy easing cycle in the second half of 2012.
While financing constraints have eased, Hungary’s economy remains vulnerable. Strong nonresident investor appetite for domestically issued government securities and the recent bond
placement in international capital markets have helped cover a large part of this year’s foreign
exchange financing requirement. However, with still large external and public financing needs,
continued access to the markets remains critical. In addition, currency mismatches in the
economy remain sizable and leave balance sheets exposed to exchange rate volatility.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that Hungary has preserved financial stability despite challenging
domestic and external environments, and has successfully returned to the international bond
market. However, high public and external financing needs leave the economy exposed to shifts
in market sentiment, while weak investment and low labor participation undermine long-term
prospects. Accordingly, Directors agreed that robust and credible policies are needed to support
confidence, reduce uncertainty, improve competitiveness, and raise potential growth.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to fiscal consolidation. They noted, however,
that additional efforts are needed to durably reduce the high public debt-to-GDP ratio. To make
the adjustment more balanced and growth-friendly, these efforts should focus on streamlining
expenditure, which could pave the way to lower taxes and a rationalization of the tax system. In
addition, Directors saw room to improve tax collection by strengthening revenue administration,
particularly the VAT system. Many Directors noted that strengthening the fiscal framework,
including by enhancing the resources and independence of the Fiscal Council, would help
improve fiscal policy credibility.
Directors agreed that improved external financial conditions have supported the recent
monetary loosening, but a pause to the easing cycle would now be prudent. In this regard, they
noted that inflation is not well anchored and the projected deceleration in 2013 mainly reflects
administrative price cuts. Directors underscored the importance of preserving the legal and
operational independence of the central bank, which is crucial for price and financial stability
and the credibility of the inflation targeting regime.

3
Directors noted that weak financial intermediation remains an obstacle to economic recovery.
They called for improving the operational environment for banks, including by gradually cutting
back the heavy tax burden and putting in place the necessary conditions to facilitate an orderly
clean up of banks’ and households’ balance sheets. Ad hoc initiatives to stimulate lending,
including by state-owned banks, are less likely to be effective in reviving credit and may have
undesired effects on credit quality.
Directors welcomed recent steps to improve labor participation, but encouraged the authorities
to pursue a broader structural reform agenda. In particular, they saw the need to promote
competition and a level playing field in product markets. Further advances in restructuring of
loss-making state-owned enterprises should also remain a priority.

Statement by Mr. Prader and Mr. Benk on Hungary
March 18, 2013
The authorities thank staff for the thorough and constructive discussions during the Article IV
mission and for their valuable advice on macroeconomic policies. The authorities remain
committed to prudent macroeconomic policies, focusing their strategy on sustainable debt
reduction, increasing labor participation, improving competitiveness, and reducing financial
vulnerabilities.
Economic developments and outlook
2012 was a challenging year for Hungary. Real GDP declined by 1.7 percent in the face of a
worsening external environment, weak domestic demand reflecting the ongoing deleveraging
process and significant fiscal consolidation effort, as well as a sharp fall in agricultural
production caused by severe weather conditions.
The authorities expect that growth will resume in the course of 2013, backed by net exports and
stabilizing domestic demand. The manufacturing sector is gaining momentum, supporting export
growth and continuing attracting investments. While overall investment contracted in 2012 amid
tight credit conditions, investment in manufacturing increased by 4.9 percent and is likely to
remain at high levels in 2013, increasing productivity and potential output. Several significant
FDI projects will be implemented in the course of 2013, which, through the vertical supply
chains, will add momentum to the domestic SME sector. The strategic partnership agreements
which the government has signed with a wide number of large manufacturing and other
companies will further contribute to job creation and investment in R&D. Public investment will
be supported by the continuous absorption of EU funds.
Private consumption growth is expected to gradually resume by 2014. The still-ongoing
deleveraging in the household sector will be offset by the gradual recovery of real disposable
income, supported by rising real wages, increasing labor participation, and a decelerating
inflation. Inflation is expected to slow to around 3 percent, due to weak domestic demand and
contained regulated energy prices.
Fiscal Policy and Consolidation
The authorities are fully committed to pursuing prudent fiscal policies compatible with
sustainable debt reduction. The key building blocks of fiscal policy have been expenditure
reductions through structural measures, fair tax burden sharing among various economic players
in accordance with their capacity, and employment-friendly taxation which shifts the burden
from labor to consumption and turnover taxes (growth-oriented reform). The fiscal consolidation

strategy aims to permanently keep the fiscal deficit comfortably below 3 percent of GDP, which
allows an exit from the EU’s Excessive Deficit Procedure.
In 2012, the government achieved a structural consolidation of around 2.5 percentage points of
GDP, based on measures announced in the multi-annual Széll Kálmán Plan I and II, the
implementation of which is continuing, implying further spending cuts in the 2013 budget. A
number of further corrective actions throughout the year ensured that the 2012 fiscal deficit stood
at around 2.5 percent, in spite of the worse-than-expected macroeconomic environment.
Going forward, the Hungarian government is committed to fully implement the measures
underpinning the 2013 budget which will ensure the safe attainment of the deficit target. With
respect to the items on which Fund staff identified a risk of slippages, the authorities assure that
the necessary measures will be implemented timely (e.g. launching the electronic toll system and
the connection of cash registers to the tax authority). Furthermore, the substantially increased
contingency reserves (1 1/3 percent of GDP) provide sufficient buffers to address unforeseen
risks, including any that surround the macroeconomic outlook. The centralization of the local
government’s finances gives the government stricter control over spending, and contracting new
local debt. The legally binding framework on debt reduction along with the government’s solid
track record in terms of strictly fulfilling the planned deficit targets since 2010, are further
factors to be considered in this context.
The power of the Fiscal Council has been strengthened by a number of measures: (i) It has been
entrusted with a veto right in the adoption of the annual budget. (ii) It evaluates the budget
execution twice a year on its consistency with the debt reduction goal. (iii) It has the right to
evaluate any bill that has budgetary implications, or express its opinion on any other issue that
has implications on budget planning, its execution, or the use of public money. In fulfilling its
tasks, the Fiscal Council can rely on the expertise of the staff of the State Audit Office and the
Magyar Nemzeti Bank, whose presidents are also members of the Fiscal Council. Moreover, the
Council has been endowed with a small professional staff team and its own appropriation.

Taxation. Tax policy aims at creating incentives for labor participation and SME development,
at the same time securing the revenues needed to pursue the structural transformations while
containing the fiscal deficit. The tax burden was gradually shifted away from labor income,
leaving the overall burden on capital income unchanged at an already low level. Revenues were
replaced by VAT hikes, excise duties, new consumption and turnover taxes based on a “broad
base – low rate” approach (financial transaction levy, telecommunication tax), taxes on negative
externalities (tax on unhealthy food products, product fees, car accident tax), several tax base
broadening measures (improving tax compliance, deleting tax reliefs, tax hikes on fringe
benefits, stricter loss carry-forward rules) and the introduction/increase of taxes on businesses
with excess market power (bank levy, tax on energy companies). Hence, funding has been
secured for the launch of the Job Protection Action Plan, intended to reduce the tax burden on the

most vulnerable groups of the labor market, targeting those with the highest responsiveness to
incentives to join the workforce: unskilled, young and elderly workers, and those returning to the
labor market after a long period of inactivity. The lump sum tax for small entrepreneurs may
significantly improve compliance among the self-employed, while the small business tax
provides a simple and transparent framework to promote both employment and investment
among small enterprises.
Debt and Financing
The public debt-to-GDP ratio has been continuously declining since 2010. The government was
also able to reduce the share of FX-denominated debt, as it completed the 2012 FX redemptions
by issuing domestic currency denominated papers while maintaining the level of official reserves
through the continuous inflow of EU funds. As for 2013, the government has already secured the
bulk of the 2013 FX financing need by a USD 3.25 bn bond issuance in international markets in
mid-February, and a EUR 1.5 bn retail euro-denominated bond sale in the domestic market
during November - January.
Monetary Policy and Reserves
The Magyar Nemzeti Bank launched a rate-cutting cycle in August 2012, lowering the policy
rate by a cumulative 175 basis points in seven successive steps to 5.25 percent. The monetary
easing has occurred in association with the improving market sentiment vis-à-vis Hungary and
the strong global risk appetite. The central bank may consider a further reduction in the policy
rate if the medium-term outlook for inflation remains consistent with the 3 percent target, and the
improvement in financial market sentiment is sustained.
The central bank has been continuously accumulating international reserves over the past few
years. The current level of reserves is adequate by a variety of metrics. The authorities share
staff’s assessment that there is no compelling evidence showing that the exchange rate is
misaligned.
Financial Sector
The resilience of the Hungarian financial system in terms of capital and liquidity is adequate, and
has improved markedly over the last year. Capital adequacy exceeds 15 percent supported by
ongoing deleveraging and capital injections by parent banks. Liquidity risks have abated due to
the appreciation of the forint, the drop in CDS spreads, a decrease in the net FX swap exposure,
and the longer maturities of swaps.
The excessive FX lending practices pursued before the onset of the global financial and
economic crisis led to a relatively high and still increasing share of NPLs. Nevertheless, in the
view of the supervision authority, the provisioning of NPLs is adequate, exceeding 100 percent if

collaterals are taken into account. While the deleveraging is still ongoing, the government has
supported the so-called managed deleveraging through various measures (e.g. fixed exchange
rate repayment schemes, interest subsidy on FX loans converted into HUF, etc.). The functioning
of the National Asset Management Agency is conducive to the portfolio cleaning process, which,
amid weak real estate market conditions, offers targeted support to low income families by
purchasing their homes.
The Financial Stability Board has started elaborating on the legislative proposal regarding crisis
management and the resolution framework, with the aim of submitting it to Parliament during
the Spring 2013 session.
To facilitate the restoration of lending, an agreement with the Hungarian Banking Association
has been concluded, with special focus on providing credit to the SME sector. A surge of lending
to exporting SMEs can be expected also from the expanding role of the Eximbank, which has
recently attracted substantial resources through international bond issuance and refinancing
operations.
Structural Reforms
The implementation of growth-enhancing structural reforms, including the measures of the Széll
Kálmán Plan I-II is underway. The reform of the local government sub-system (including
administrative tasks, public education, health care, and social services) is at an advanced stage
and will continue in 2013 as well, and the reform of the higher education system is progressing.
The reorganization of the MÁV group is ongoing, aiming to create an independent track operator
and an integrated passenger transport company, in parallel with the divestment of assets not
required for railway operations.
Labor market reforms, aiming at a workfare state, and work-based social-security system, are
already reflected by the rising labor force participation and employment (both growing by 1.7
percent in 2012, leaving the unemployment rate broadly unchanged). These figures comprise
employment growth in small enterprises and the extension of the public work scheme. The
government views the public work programs as a temporary measure until the business sector
becomes capable of absorbing those involved now in public work. Nevertheless, regular public
employment continues to decline, a trend supported by some of the public administration’s
recent streamlining measures (e.g. compulsory retirement at the retirement age, abandoning the
practice to receive salary and pension simultaneously).
