STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
January 25, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context. Growth slowed in 2012, as fiscal consolidation and high levels of debt weighed
on households consumption, while external headwinds depressed exports and business
spending. Growth is expected to accelerate again from mid 2013 as the global economy
improves, but the balance of risks remains tilted to the downside as concerns linger over
the external environment and the unwinding of domestic imbalances.
Policy mix. The return to more neutral interest rates should be delayed until there are
signs of a sustainable acceleration in growth. There is some space to cut rates if activity
were to weaken significantly. The pace of fiscal consolidation is appropriate under the
baseline scenario. Automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate if growth
disappoints, while temporary fiscal stimulus could be considered in the event of a large
adverse shock, especially at the federal level. It will be important to continue to address
long-term spending pressures from population ageing and increasing health-care costs.
Containing domestic imbalances. The high level of household debt makes the
Canadian economy more vulnerable to adverse shocks. The macro-prudential measures
adopted by the authorities seem to have reduced some of the exuberance in mortgage
credit and the housing sector. But more measures may be needed if the household
debt-to-disposable-income ratio continues to rise.
Structural reforms. Increasing labor productivity remains a priority, to help support
structural adjustment in the economy associated with a growing commodity sector and
a strong currency. It will be important to continue pursuing measures that boost
innovation, promote trade, and attract foreign direct investment.
Policy response to past advice. In recent years the authorities have taken several
measures to support the long-term stability of the housing market and limit the increase
of household debt. These measures have been consistent with policy recommendations
contained in past reports, in particular the introduction of macro-prudential measures
and enhancements to the governance and oversight of CMHC. The authorities’ progress
in fiscal consolidation has been supported by staff, which saw it as a necessary step to
rebuild the fiscal space. Continued efforts at the federal and provincial level to introduce
a single security regulator are also in line with past staff advice.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
After recovering rapidly from the
Great Recession, the Canadian economy
slowed in 2012. Supported by the strong
monetary and fiscal policy response and a quick
rebound in the terms of trade, the Canadian
economy grew well above potential in 2010–11.
However, growth weakened in the first three
quarters of 2012 (Chart) and recent indicators
suggest the pace of economic expansion
remained subpar in the fourth quarter, with
growth estimated to have fallen to 2 percent on
average for the whole year.

2.
The weaker economic momentum reflects lower growth of private domestic demand.
Private consumption weakened on the back of slower disposable income growth, owing to lower net
transfers from government, and the lackluster growth of real wages, reflecting low productivity
growth and unemployment still hovering around 7¼ percent in 2012 (Figure 1). Private consumption
was also dampened by sluggish consumer credit growth, as the record-high household debt
induced more caution in borrowing, while access to home equity lines of credit was tightened by the
authorities (Figure 2). The housing sector also cooled off over the past few months, especially in the
large metropolitan areas of Toronto and Vancouver, with home sales and construction activity
moderating since the summer of 2012 (Figure 3 and Box 1). Business investment, a key driver of
growth after the 2008–09 recession, retrenched somewhat in the second half of 2012, reflecting
increased uncertainty on the global outlook.
3.
External demand hasn’t picked up the slack, and the current account continued to
deteriorate. After growing strongly in 2011, exports contracted in the first three quarters of 2012,
owing to weaker external demand and the strong currency, boosted by capital inflows attracted by
Canada’s safe haven status (Figure 4). Weaker export growth and the worsening of the terms of
trade led to a rise in the external current account deficit to 4 percent of GDP in the first nine months
of 2012.

Simple indicators suggest house prices are still on the
strong side. As of December 2012, at a national level
house prices were still almost 30 percent above their
January 2009 trough. In Q3:2012, the house price-to-rent
ratio was 60 percent above its historical average in Canada,
more than in any other advanced economies with the only
exception of Norway and Belgium (Chart). Price-to-income
ratios also look high, and at almost 40 percent above their
long-term average are among the highest (Chart).

Average House Price

Belgium

House price growth moderated in 2012, although with
some regional variation. National house prices fell
1.2 percent over the second half of 2012, driven mainly by
the sharp retrenchment in British Columbia (Chart). In turn,
this was mainly the consequence of a sharp correction of
prices in the Vancouver area, where condos prices were
down to their 2010 levels as of December 2012. On a yearly
basis, national house prices index is still up by about
3.5 percent in 2012, slightly down from the 6 percent
growth in 2011, with Toronto, Calgary and in particular
Regina posting the largest increases.

There is also some evidence of overbuilding. Despite
falling in real terms since the second quarter of 2012,
residential investment continued to increase as a share of
GDP and reached a two-decade high of about 7 percent.
After a sharp contraction during the 2009 recession,
housing starts have rebounded sharply to early 2000s
levels, at a pace faster than household formation. Using
different metrics, Chapter 2 of the Selected Issues Paper
finds a relatively modest excess housing supply at the
national level in Canada. Most of the excess supply is
concentrated in Ontario and Quebec.

Box 1. Canada’s Housing Sector: A Soft Landing Scenario (concluded)
We anticipate a gradual adjustment of these excesses in our baseline scenario. In this scenario,
Canada’s terms of trade will remain relatively flat over the next five years, employment will grow at
about1 percent per year, and mortgage rates will begin to increase gradually since late 2013. Based on these
assumptions, a 1 percent yearly decline in real house prices would be enough to absorb the estimated
current overvaluation by the end of the forecast horizon (2017). Based on this path for house prices, our
housing stock model predicts the number of housing starts to fall over the next three years to around
165 thousand new units per year. This is consistent with residential investment falling below 6 percent of
GDP over the next three years, before picking up again and setting to a level above the historical average
(6.5 percent of GDP) by the end of our forecast horizon.
The weaker housing sector is expected to subtract about 0.4 pp to GDP growth yearly over the next
five years. Lower residential investment will subtract 0.1 pp to GDP growth in both 2013 and 2014. Based on
staff estimates of the wealth effect in Canada (IMF Country Report No. 11/365), the projected cumulative 11.5 percent reduction in real house prices over the next five years would subtract 0.3 pp to private
consumption (about 0.2 pp to GDP growth). This is likely to underestimate the impact on consumption
though, as weaker house prices would also limit households’ ability to access liquidity using their homes as
collateral, and thus the role of home equity extraction in financing consumption. Bank of Canada (2011)
shows that 2 percent of aggregate consumption was financed by home-equity extraction at the end of 2010.
Assuming that our projected decline in house prices will reduce home-equity extraction by one half, private
consumption will decline -0.5 pp per year, corresponding to a 0.3 pp decline in GDP.
A worse scenario is also possible if labor market turned out weaker than expected. Under a relatively
mild alternative scenario in which employment is kept at its 2012 level, staff estimates that house prices
would decline by almost 3 percent per year over the next five years, a cumulative decrease of about
18 percent by 2017. In such a scenario, the subtraction to GDP growth would be as high as ⅔ pp yearly.

4.
Fiscal policy has also continued to be a drag on growth, as the stimulus is being
withdrawn. Fiscal consolidation continued in 2012, with the federal government leading the effort
and most provinces proceeding with their consolidation plans. As a result, the contribution to
growth from government consumption and public investment is expected to have turned negative
in 2012, for the first time since 1997. The general government cyclically-adjusted fiscal deficit fell by
a cumulative estimated 1¾ percentage points between 2010 and 2012, mainly reflecting cuts in
spending (Figure 5). Net public debt is estimated to have reached 34½ percent of GDP in 2012 (with
gross debt at about 85 percent of GDP), but remains below many other advanced economies.1

1

The difference between gross and net debt is accounted by financial assets, predominantly held by sub-national
governments (about 35 percent of GDP). At the federal level, financial assets are mainly government claims on Crown
enterprises (loans to state-owned enterprises, equity, and foreign exchange reserves kept at the Central Bank). At the
sub-national level, about half of the assets are financial investments (e.g., securities, domestic and foreign shares).
See 2011 Staff Report and Selected Issues for more details.

5.
These headwinds have been only partly
offset by an improvement in financial
conditions in 2012 (Chart). Canadian financial
markets have benefited from improved global
financial conditions and credit conditions
remaining highly favorable, with credit spreads on
corporate bonds continuing to narrow and some
further easing in business lending conditions in
2012 (Figure 6). The policy rate has remained
exceptionally accommodative, at 1 percent since
September 2010 (Figure 7), in a context of wellbehaved inflation expectations (Chart) and
significant external headwinds. Headline and core
inflation are well below the 2 percent target,
partly reflecting the persistence of some slack in
economic activity (with the output gap estimated
at about 1 percent as of end 2012) and the
strength of the currency.

6.
Growth is expected to gain new momentum over 2013. We expect economic activity to
grow at a pace slightly above potential (estimated at about 2 percent) from the second half of the
year, thanks to the strengthening of the U.S. economy from mid-2013 as envisaged by the January
2013 update of the World Economic Outlook. However, the negative carry-over from a weak second
half of 2012 means that the average rate of growth for 2013 is expected to be a modest 1.8 percent.
After 2013, annual output is expected to accelerate to slightly below 2½ percent, a pace consistent
with a gradual absorption of the output gap and a gradual convergence of unemployment to its
natural rate (estimated by staff at about 6¾ percent).
7.
This forecast is based on a smooth rotation over the medium term of the main drivers
of growth away from private consumption and residential investment, and toward net
exports and business investment. Canada’s rapid recovery from the Great Recession was built in
part on the resilience of private consumption and residential construction. But with elevated house
prices and both residential construction-to-GDP ratio and the household debt-to-income ratio at
historically high levels, the prospects for both sources of demand have weakened. Staff projections
are based on the assumption that domestic imbalances will unwind gradually and that domestic
demand will return to a more sustainable pace of growth while the slack in the external sector is
gradually reabsorbed as the United States closes its output gap. In particular we assume that:


As external conditions gradually improve, activity will receive a boost from net exports.
After subtracting from growth for the last decade, the net export contribution to annual GDP
growth is expected to turn positive and average 0.3 pp over 2014–18. The current account deficit

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

CANADA

is expected to gradually improve to 2¾ percent of GDP over the medium term, on the back of
stronger demand from the United States.


Business investment will be a key driver of domestic demand, with consumption remaining
subdued as household leverage stabilizes. Business investment is expected to strengthen,
sustained by reduced global uncertainty, strong capital spending in the energy sector, still easy
financial conditions, and relatively cheap imported capital goods. As discussed in Box 1, we
expect national house prices to grow slightly below inflation over the medium term, and
household savings to gradually rise as macro-prudential measures and higher interest rates curb
the demand for housing credit. Private consumption and residential investment are therefore
likely to grow at a more moderate pace than before the 2008–09 recession.



Fiscal policy will continue to hamper growth, although less so than in 2012, while
monetary policy will remain highly accommodative. Fiscal policy will remain a drag on
growth as the federal and provincial governments implement their consolidation plans. In
particular, the annual fiscal impulse is envisaged to be around -0.6 percent through 2015, with a
drag on yearly GDP growth of about 0.5 pp. Policy rates are expected to increase in Q3:2013,
and to return to more neutral levels only very gradually over the next 4 years.

8.
The balance of risks is tilted to the downside, as near-term uncertainty remains
elevated. Canada is particularly vulnerable to three possible external shocks:


Continued uncertainty over fiscal policy in the United States. The United States is Canada’s
largest trading partner, absorbing about two thirds of total Canadian merchandise exports, and
with significant financial linkages to Canada. Even if an agreement has been reached in the
United States to avoid the full materialization of the “fiscal cliff”, failure to raise the debt ceiling
expeditiously may bring back the risk of heightened uncertainty and financial market disruption.
Stronger U.S. fiscal consolidation than currently envisaged in our baseline, for example through
a materialization of the “sequester” in early 2013, could also subtract to growth.



Further distress in European sovereign debt markets. Canadian banks’ direct exposure to
European countries is moderate, representing about 5 percent of their overall assets. However, a
deterioration of the euro area debt crisis could have significant indirect spillovers to Canada,
through its impact on the U.S. economy and global financing conditions. Reduced credit
availability and higher funding costs would affect both Canadian non-financial businesses (about
⅓ of their funding comes from abroad) and Canadian banks, which have a non-negligible
dependence on wholesale funding (Annex I).



A fall in global commodity prices, particularly if driven by stress in emerging markets.
While China accounts for less than 5 percent of Canada’s total exports, a hard landing in China
could have a material impact if it were to lead to a generalized fall in commodity prices
(Annex I).

9.
Domestic imbalances make Canada more vulnerable to these possible shocks. While the
risk exists that the unwinding of domestic imbalances will prove less gradual than we anticipate in
8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CANADA

our baseline (see Box 1 and Selected Issues, Chapter 1), Canada is unlikely to suffer from a house
boom-and-bust similar to the one that occurred in the United States. This reflects Canadian banks’
more conservative lending practices, relatively high levels of housing equity, and the governmentbacked insurance for mortgages with high loan-to-value (LTV) ratios. But high household debt and
an exuberant housing market make Canada more vulnerable to adverse macroeconomic shocks,
particularly to a tail-risk downside global scenario in which external demand weakens, commodity
prices fall, and global financial conditions tighten at the same time. The impact on economic activity
from these shocks could be exacerbated by the distress among some highly indebted Canadian
households, with a negative impact on banks’ balance sheets, house prices and construction, and
the potential for a negative feedback loop into the real economy.

Expected Impact on Economy
A spike in global risk aversion and counterparty risk would
tighten financial conditions and weaken demand (Annex I).
Lower interest rates and fiscal automatic stabilizers would sustain
demand. If contagion were severe, authorities could alleviate
financial market disruptions by providing liquidity support and
could buffer the economy through a new fiscal stimulus.
Uncertainty over raising the U.S. debt ceiling could lead to
tighter financial conditions, and larger-than-currently projected
spending cuts would hurt growth. For example, the “sequester”
would subtract between ¼ and ½ of a percentage point to
Canada’s growth in 2013 (or about three-fourths of the expected
U.S. impact).
A significant fall in commodity prices would hurt Canada’s terms
of trade and trigger a fall in income, employment, and house
prices. The impact would likely be partially softened by a
weakening of the Canadian dollar, whereas lower interest rates
and fiscal automatic stabilizers would sustain demand (Annex I).
A sharp fall in house prices is unlikely to provoke financial
system stress or induce large direct fiscal losses from CHMC
insurance outlays. But given the high level of household debt, it
could weaken consumption growth and residential investment.
For example, in a scenario where the adjustment in the housing
market is more abrupt than assumed in the baseline (and
involves a 10 percent fall in house prices in one year), private
consumption would be around ¾ percent weaker in 2013
(Selected Issues, Chapter 1)

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
The policy discussion focused on the need to sustain growth in the short term while gradually
unwinding domestic imbalances, maintaining the fiscal position on stable footing, and progressing
with the financial regulatory reform agenda. The discussions also touched on policies to boost
Canada’s external competitiveness and take into account the macro-economic and fiscal impact of
commodity price volatility.

A. Monetary Policy: A Gradual Normalization of Rates
10.
The discussion on monetary policy focused on the appropriate stance in the face of a
weaker economy and domestic imbalances. Staff argued that the beginning of the tightening
cycle should be made conditional to growth regaining a stronger momentum, and therefore should
be delayed towards late 2013 (in line with staff’s baseline scenario). The authorities noted that
monetary policy will react as usual to the changes in the economic outlook but will also take into
account the evolution of domestic imbalances, although monetary policy should be seen as a last
line of defense against the risk of financial instability. While supporting the highly accommodative
monetary policy stance, the mission noted there is some space for further easing if the economy
were to weaken further. The authorities emphasized that maintaining rates at the current low levels
already provides stimulus to economic activity. But staff and authorities agreed that in the event of a
significant negative economic shock there would be room for conventional monetary easing and
that, if needed, other tools could be used, including forward guidance and liquidity support.

B. Fiscal Policy: Striking The Right Balance Between Rebuilding Fiscal
Space And Supporting Growth
11.
Although Canada is in a stronger fiscal position that many other advanced economies,
the ongoing consolidation effort is important to rebuild the fiscal buffer against future

adverse shocks. While the federal government is

likely to achieve a balanced budget by 2016, the

to fall below 80 percent of GDP by 2017, with the net
debt-to-GDP ratio declining by 2015, in line with the 2010 Toronto G-20 commitments (Chart).
12.
The mission noted that the authorities have the policy space to adjust to a
deterioration in the economic outlook. While the pace of the consolidation is appropriate under

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CANADA

the broadly benign medium-term scenario, staff noted that the federal government and provinces
with stronger fiscal positions have room to allow the full impact of automatic stabilizers if the
economy proves weaker than expected. While this could delay achieving the government timetable
for a return to a nominal (as opposed to a structural) balanced budget, it would provide important
support to activity while having only a modest impact on debt levels. The federal authorities agreed
there was policy room for a flexible response and noted that the budget already includes a margin
to take into account the risk of slower economic growth and weaker revenues. Both staff and
authorities agreed that fiscal measures could be considered in the event of a large adverse shock.
13.
Canada will need to make further headway in addressing spending pressures from
population aging and the rising cost of providing health care. The federal authorities have taken
several measures to contain future pension costs and announced nominal growth caps to their
transfers to provinces, including on those that finance health-care spending. Also as a result of these
measures, the federal government’s finances are on a solid path (Annex II). But placing the general
government debt on a sustainable long-term path will require renewed efforts to contain healthcare costs. The authorities argued that the burden rests with provinces as they have the
responsibility for providing health care. While acknowledging that provinces will have to shoulder
the main burden of the adjustment, staff argued that achieving long-term fiscal sustainability should
be considered as an objective for Canada as a whole, as failing to do so would have negative
consequences for the economy and all levels of government. In this context, staff encouraged the
authorities to publish a comprehensive fiscal sustainability report for the general government, for
example every 3–5 years, which would review the progress achieved at each level of government
and include a discussion of policy options to help gain the necessary public support for reforms. In
2012 the federal government published a fiscal sustainability report for the federal level. Federal
authorities noted that the federal government is not accountable for the fiscal situation of the
provinces, and that it would continue to publish long-term fiscal analyses for the federal
government annually.

C. Addressing Domestic Imbalances
14.
House price growth and residential investment have moderated somewhat recently
but remain high relative to fundamentals. Residential investment was about 7 percent of GDP as
of Q3:2012, well above its historical average, and there is evidence of some modest overbuilding
(Selected Issues, Chapter 2). At the national level, house price growth has decelerated somewhat in
recent months, but staff estimates suggest prices are still above levels justified by fundamentals,
although with significant variation across provinces (Figure 3 and Box 1). The strong housing market
has been fuelled by the very low interest rates and abundant supply of mortgage credit, which was
still expanding at a robust pace as of Q3:2012, although well below the double digit pace of growth
achieved right before the 2008–09 recession. The authorities agreed there has been some
exuberance in the housing sector, with evidence of modest overbuilding and stretched house
valuations in some markets, but noted that the adjustment was already ongoing and that absent a
severe shock on economic activity (involving a large and persistent increase in unemployment), the
correction would likely proceed gradually over the next few years.

15.
Staff welcomed the measures taken over the last few years to moderate the expansion
of mortgage credit and house prices. Research by staff (Selected Issues, Chapter 3) suggests that
the macro-prudential measures taken since 2008 to tighten eligibility rules for government-backed
mortgage insurance have had some effect. A new round of macro-prudential measures was
introduced in July 2012, and was complemented by a tightening of lending mortgage standards
(effective by end of fiscal year 2012); a strengthening of the governance and oversight framework of
the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a major provider of government-backed
mortgage insurance; and the decision to prohibit the issuance of covered bonds backed by
government-backed insured mortgages. At the same time, CMHC has limited the availability of
insurance for loans with low LTV ratios, used primarily for securitization purposes. While noting that
it was too early to assess the impact of these measures, the authorities were confident that they
would help support the long-term stability of the housing market over time.
16.
Staff noted that additional policy action may be needed if household imbalances
continue to rise. Despite the measures adopted, the household debt-to-income ratio has continued
to increase in 2012 and reached a new record high of about 162 percent in Q3:2012 (equivalent to
153 percent when adjusted to U.S. definition, Chart). The mission stressed that a tighter macroprudential regime might need to be considered if household leverage kept rising, in order to reduce
Canada’s vulnerability to adverse shocks. These

measures could include higher down-payment
requirements (tighter LTV limits for first buyers),
lower caps on debt-service-to-income ratios, and
tighter LTV ratios on refinancing. Staff
recommended that a gradual approach would be
most appropriate in this case, as a further

US definition)

mortgages could have stronger-than-desirable
effects. The authorities reported that they
continue to monitor developments in the housing
market and would consider further action if
necessary. Staff enquired whether authorities would consider differentiating measures across
provinces, so as to target areas with more buoyant housing sectors. The federal authorities noted
that regional supervisors could tighten underwriting standards if they considered it necessary. While
staff suggested there could be room to improve the macro-prudential framework by giving a clear
mandate to a committee of regulators chaired by the Bank of Canada, the authorities stressed that
the current framework (with multiple agencies exchanging information through several committees,
and the Department of Finance ultimately accountable for financial stability) has worked well and fits
better in Canada’s overall institutional framework.

D. Canada’s Financial System: Outlook and Reforms
17.
With the Canadian financial system remaining sound, the discussion focused on the
risks from an intensification of stress in global financial markets and the low interest rates
environment.


Canada’s banking system is well capitalized, profitable, and continues to show low
nonperforming loans. Canadian banks reported solid earnings in the first three quarters of
2012, driven by consumer and commercial

aggressively abroad (Chart). The authorities
indicated that there is little evidence of excessive risk taking so far and noted that banks’
expansion abroad helps diversify risks and is primarily in sectors where they have a comparative
advantage.



Stress-testing scenarios developed by the authorities show manageable losses for the
financial system under adverse scenarios. Authorities noted that their stress tests are based
on a severe deterioration of macroeconomic conditions, although existing models do not yet
fully capture second-round effects from loss of confidence and liquidity dry outs. The favorable
test results reflect the strong position of Canadian banks, their conservative lending practices
under strong supervision, and the broad extension of government-backed insurance for
mortgages with high LTV ratios. As a result, while mortgages and home equity lines of credit
represent their single largest exposure, Canadian banks are largely protected from a house price
downturn and would suffer greatly only in case of a large and persistent increase in
unemployment. The mission argued that Canadian banks would be affected by increased global
financial turbulence mainly through a squeeze in wholesale funding, as in the 2008–09 crisis, and
underscored the importance of banks having appropriate liquidity buffers. The authorities
agreed and noted they stand ready to provide liquidity support in case of spillovers from severe
distress in international financial markets. Staff argued in favor of publishing the results of the
stress tests, as this would promote a better awareness of the risks, induce more realistic risk
pricing, and enhance market discipline. OSFI believes, among other matters, that markets should
be doing their own credit assessments (not relying on regulatory stress tests, which creates
moral hazard), and that publicly disclosing stress test scenarios and results could undermine

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

CANADA

their effectiveness, as doing so might incent regulators to limit the scope or severity of the
scenarios.


Low interest rates have also continued to put pressures on the balance sheets of
institutions with long-duration liabilities. Canadian pension plans are facing solvency deficits,
partly as a result of low long-term yields and more challenging equity markets, and in some
cases have received relief from provincial governments. Pension funds are trying to reduce their
exposure to interest rate risk by using liability-driven investment strategies, in a few cases
involving leveraged positions (e.g., interest rate swaps and repurchase agreements). The life
insurance sector is equally being affected by the low interest rates environment, and is posting
financial results below historical averages. Life insurance companies are trying to mitigate those
risks mainly by re-pricing and redesigning products, but also by investing more in alternative,
non fixed income, assets. The authorities highlighted that they are closely monitoring whether
actions taken in response to low interest rates could expose pension plans and life insurance
companies to new risks.

18.
Canada continued to push ahead with financial reforms, including the transition to
Basel III (Box 2). The authorities decided for an early implementation of new Basel III capital
requirements, by January 2013, and noted that the new guideline provides an option for
implementing countercyclical capital buffers. Capital surcharges for domestically systemically
important banks could be also introduced possibly in 2013. Moreover, a few provinces are planning
to introduce Basel III capital standards for provincially-regulated financial institutions. Staff argued
this would be a positive development, and that more in general it would be important to increase
cooperation across federal and provincial regulators to ensure similar regulatory standards and a
level playing field between federally regulated and large non-federally regulated institutions.
19.
Staff and the authorities agreed that it would be important to adopt a single securities
regulator. The authorities noted that efforts to adopt a single securities regulator for Canada are
continuing, after a proposal in this direction was rejected by the Supreme Court of Canada. Staff
supported the idea, arguing that a single regulator would reduce compliance costs, simplify the
monitoring of systemic risk, and facilitate coordination with other agencies and policy intervention.

Box 2. Progress on Financial Reforms
The implementation of the financial reform has progressed well since the last Article IV mission. The
authorities advanced on a number of regulatory initiatives, notably the implementation of new international
capital standards, the development of central counterparties for clearing repo contracts, the definition of a
credible resolution and recovery framework for major financial institutions, as well as the publication of
proposals to improve the transparency of over-the-counter (OTC) derivative markets.



Basel standards: While Basel II.5 framework became effective on January 2012, OSFI has recently
published guidelines to implement Basel III capital standards from January 1, 2013. The regulator is
expecting all institutions to achieve target capital ratios equal to or greater than the 2019 minimum
ratios (plus a conservation buffer) from January 2013. With regard to liquidity, OSFI plans to implement
Basel III standards once they are finalized, and has implemented liquidity risk management guidelines in
line with the BCBS principles in February 2012. Finally, to facilitate the adjustment to the new leverage
requirement, the amount of total capital used to calculate the asset-to-capital multiple is expected to be
calculated using transitional Basel III definitions.



Repo markets: To underpin the resilience of Canada’s most important source of market-based
financing, a new central counterparty (CCP) service for the Canadian repo markets has been introduced.
The first phase, launched in February 2012, involved bilateral repo trades for government securities only.
The clearing of cash trades and repo transactions negotiated by intermediaries is planned for
implementation starting in early 2013. Reforms in this area will continue in 2013-2014, and will involve
clearing general repo transactions in which any security can serve as collateral.



OTC derivatives markets: Canadian authorities are working to implement the G-20 commitments to
reform OTC derivatives markets, so as to reduce counterparty risk and enhance transparency. In October
2012, the authorities announced that Canadian market participants will be allowed to centrally clear OTC
derivatives at any central counterparty recognized by Canadian authorities, including global CCPs. In an
effort to coordinate and harmonize the regulatory framework for OTC derivatives across provinces, the
Canadian Securities Administrators laid several proposals to improve regulatory oversight of OTC
derivatives transactions, including recommending mandatory CCP clearing and reporting to a trade
repository.



Resolution plans: Federal authorities are making collaborative efforts to enhance the resolution
framework for major banks by implementing resolution and recovery methods consistent with the FSB
guidelines. The first generation resolution plans for the largest banks were completed by the end of
2012 and revised recovery plans are expected to be submitted in 2013. The implementation of Basel III
is expected to further enhance Canada’s bank intervention and resolution frameworks through the
implementation of non-viability contingent capital.



Regulation of credit rating agencies (CRAs): In April 2012 a regulatory framework for the oversight of
credit rating organizations was introduced. Under this framework, CRAs that apply for designation in
Canada would have to: (i) maintain, enforce and comply with a code of conduct that is compatible with
the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) Code of Conduct Fundamentals for
Credit Rating Agencies; (ii) implement policies and procedures to identify and manage conflicts of
interest in connection with the issuance of ratings and (iii) prohibit the issuance of ratings in the event of
certain conflicts of interest.



Reporting standards: Canadian financial institutions, including banks and life insurance companies,
moved to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and Auditing Standards for fiscal years
commencing in 2011.

E. Canada’s External Stability and Competiveness
20.
The sharp decline in the current account over the past few years partly reflects
Canada’s large exposure to the U.S. business cycle. Canada’s current account position has moved

Sources: Haver, Fund staff estimates
strengthen Canada’s trade balance over time,
staff argued that the full absorption of the U.S. output gap would still leave Canada’s current
account balance about 2–3 percentage points below its “norm”.
21.
Staff noted that the weaker external position also reflects more secular factors,
including Canada’s increased dependence on commodities.2 The Canadian dollar has
appreciated sharply over the past 10 years, reflecting to a large extent the increase in commodity
prices over the same period (Selected Issues, Chapter 4). Based on staff estimates, Canada’s real
effective exchange rate is between 5 and 15 percent above the level consistent with long-term
fundamentals (Annex III). The authorities emphasized that the currency’s strength most recently
owes to the strong capital inflows attracted by Canada’s “safe haven” status. Staff’s analysis shows
that the stronger currency and the emergence of China as a trade competitor contribued to the
decline of Canada’s manufacturing market share in the United States over the last decade. The
authorities only partially agreed with this view, and underscored that the shrinking manufacturing
sector is a trend that Canada shares with all advanced economies. They also noted that while
Canada's exchange rate has fluctuated over the past several decades, it is near the same level as it
was in the mid-1970s, and therefore can not explain the secular decline in Canada’s manufacturing
sector.
22.
In this context, both the authorities and staff agreed it would be essential to increase
the competitiveness of Canadian firms and reduce their dependence on U.S. markets. Low
productivity growth remains a major challenge for Canada—over the last decade, labor productivity
growth was less than ⅓ of the United States. While recognizing that this is a complex issue, and that
2

Mining and oil/gas exploration rose from about 4 to about 10 percent of GDP between 1999 and 2008, while
manufacturing fell from 19 to 11 percent of GDP in the same period. Also, the share of commodity (energy and
metals) exports has doubled (to 40 percent of good exports) since 2000.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CANADA

much has already been done (including through large cuts in corporate taxes and improvements in
the employment insurance program and immigration system), staff and authorities agreed that
further reforms are needed. In particular, there is room for a better, more targeted, public support to
investment in research and development, and for measures aimed at increasing labor mobility and
retrain the workforce towards sectors experiencing labor shortages. It will also be important to keep
a favorable business environment for domestic and foreign investors, given Canada’s large
investment needs and potential benefits from increased competition. Continued efforts in opening
up new markets, through multilateral and bilateral trade agreements, could also boost competition
and innovation and further diversify trade towards markets with higher growth potential. Canada will
also need to undertake large investments and address environmental challenges to fully benefit
from its large energy reserves.
23.
Staff suggested that a new fiscal framework could better manage the volatility
associated with commodity prices. While Canada’s flexible exchange rate regime provides an
important buffer to external shocks, fiscal policy could also help manage the volatility associated
with commodity prices. With oil-gas production and related tax receipts expected to more than
double over the next decades, the mission argued it would be useful to start considering a fiscal
framework designed to better mitigate the macro-economic and fiscal impact of commodity price
volatility, including by adopting fiscal indicators that exclude revenues from the most volatile
commodities (Box 3). Such framework could help stabilize the economy including by setting aside
stabilization savings during commodity booms.3 The authorities agreed that this approach could be
considered for resource-rich provinces, but was not appropriate for the federal government given its
lack of resource royalties.

3

About 40 percent of commodity-related fiscal revenues (oil/gas and metals) go to the federal government. See
reports from The Mining Association of Canada (Facts and Figures of the Canadian Mining Industry, 2011) and
Canadian Energy Research Institute for more details.

Box 3. Policy Framework to Manage Nonrenewable Resources
Canada’s energy sector is expected to become an increasingly important driver of the country’s
exports, economic activity and fiscal revenues. The non-energy trade deficit has grown significantly,
backed by large net exports of energy. Commodity revenues are already a significant share of fiscal receipts
for some provinces and are scheduled to grow for all levels of government, if Canada successfully develops
its large energy reserves. This poses new policy challenges for Canada, mainly from the increased exposure
to large swings in commodity prices.
Fiscal policy plays a key role in managing the macroeconomic impact of commodity revenues. In
general, mining and oil exploration tends to be a separate “enclave”, largely isolated from the domestic
economy but for the government’s use of its share of natural resources. Commodity related revenues tend
to be highly uncertain and volatile and, as they originate from exhaustible sources, involve delicate intertemporal considerations, as today’s choices are likely to have significant long-term implications. Moreover,
they largely originate from abroad and can thus have a significant impact on the exchange rate.
As a result, resource-rich countries typically face unique challenges to their macro and fiscal
management (Medas and Zakharova, 2009 (www.imf.org)) and in particular need to:



Accurately assess the macro-fiscal stance in order to ensure well informed policy decisions. The special
nature of commodity revenues complicates the evaluation of the macro-fiscal stance and the impact of
fiscal policy on the domestic economy. In particular, conventional fiscal indicators, such as the overall
and primary balances, and debt sustainability analysis, are not sufficient for an appropriate assessment
of the short-term fiscal stance and longer-term fiscal sustainability. Canadian governments (resourcerich provinces and federal) could complement the fiscal analysis with various non-commodity indicators
(or indicators/targets that explicitly correct for commodity price volatility) and comprehensive measures
of government net wealth—as done by other countries (e.g., Norway and Chile).



Avoid transmitting volatility to public expenditure and the economy in general. In particular, a key issue is
to mitigate spillovers from ‘boom and bust’ commodity cycles. During boom periods, rapidly rising
expenditures could lead to overheating, appreciation pressures, and unsustainable levels of spending. A
sudden fall in commodity revenue could require a drastic reduction in expenditure with subsequent
negative effects on economic activity and the provision of crucial public services (e.g,. public spending
growth in Alberta has fluctuated significantly with commodity prices). Good planning and management
during boom times can reduce the need for large spending cuts later on. Medium-term fiscal
frameworks, that include risk analysis, could help Canadian governments to assess the appropriate size
of fiscal buffers and design robust policies over commodity cycles.



Address financial sustainability and intergenerational equity issues. Given the exhaustibility of reserves,
countries need to decide how to allocate commodity wealth across generations. This has implications
not only for long-term fiscal sustainability, but also for intergenerational equity. The particular choices
(e.g., how much to save) will depend on country circumstances, but it will be important that today’s
policies take into account their long-term consequences (e.g., by including such discussion in
budgets)—this is particularly relevant for Canadian provinces with high dependence on commodityrelated revenue.



Develop fiscal institutions that are better suited to help manage commodity related revenues. Given the
challenges mentioned above, it is important to develop institutions that can help to address them. In
addition, political economy considerations may require strengthening the accountability framework.
When oil revenue is seen as a rent and not a tax, pressures may arise to increase spending without
safeguards or accountability, since there is no direct cost for most taxpayers. Some countries have
adopted special fiscal institutions (e.g., oil funds, fiscal rules) with mixed success (Ossowski, Villafuerte,
Medas, and Thomas, 2008 (www.imf.org)). In particular, it is important to ensure that such institutions
are transparent and fully consistent with overall policy objectives (e.g., like the Norwegian oil fund).

STAFF APPRAISAL
24.
The main challenge for Canada’s policymakers is to support growth in the short
term while reducing the vulnerabilities that may arise from external shocks and domestic
imbalances. The Canadian authorities have to balance several objectives: preventing the economic
momentum from slowing further amid the heightened degree of external uncertainty; rebuilding the
policy buffers that may be needed in case of further shocks; and managing the transition to a less
leveraged household sector while supporting the long-term stability of the housing market.
25.
The beginning of the monetary tightening cycle should be delayed until growth
strengthens again. The current monetary policy stance is appropriately accommodative given the
negative output gap, well-anchored inflation expectations, and a challenging global environment.
Under our baseline scenario, a gradual monetary tightening should start in late 2013, when growth
is expected to accelerate. If household imbalances continue to build up in the context of modest
growth, further macro-prudential measures should be taken into account before considering an
earlier start of monetary tightening. On the other hand, there is some space for further monetary
easing if the economy were to weaken significantly.
26.
The timing and pace of the ongoing fiscal consolidation process are appropriate,
with room for supporting activity if the economy were to weaken. Progressing with fiscal
consolidation is essential to rebuild a fiscal buffer against future adverse shocks. The ongoing fiscal
adjustment is expected to reduce the deficit of the general government in 2013 by around
¾ percent of GDP, with an estimated drag on economic growth of about ½ percentage point. While
the consolidation plans of the federal government are well advanced and a budgetary balance by
2015 is well within reach, balancing the budget may require further efforts in some of the largest
provinces, where the current consolidation plans rely on ambitious spending cuts. If the economy
weakened further, the federal and some provincial governments should allow the full operation of
automatic stabilizers. In the event of a large adverse shock, the federal authorities could also
consider a new temporary fiscal stimulus package, given the available policy space.
27.
At the same time, it will be important to continue to address long-term spending
pressures. Canada has a relatively low net public debt ratio compared to most other advanced
economies. Still, it is not immune to long-term spending pressures from population aging and rising
health costs. Staff analysis suggests that placing the general government debt on a sustainable
long-term path would require reforms that durably contain these pressures, as well as higher
revenues. Renewed efforts at the provincial level to slow the growth of health care spending would
be particularly important in this regard, with progress measured against a long-term fiscal
sustainability benchmark. In addition, publishing a comprehensive fiscal sustainability report
covering all levels of government and including a discussion of policy options would help gain the
necessary public support for reforms.
28.
The authorities’ gradual tightening of mortgage insurance rules was appropriate,
but further macro-prudential measures should be considered if household leverage continues
to rise. Household debt in relation to income reached new historical highs in 2012, and remains

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

CANADA

high in relation to assets. Moreover, staff analysis suggests that real house prices and residential
investment as a share of GDP remain above levels consistent with economic fundamentals. In this
context, staff welcomed the introduction of a new round of measures in the second half of 2012,
which tightened the rules for government-backed mortgage insurance and lending mortgage
standards. While it is too early to ascertain the full impact of the latest round, staff believes that the
cumulative effect of all measures taken since 2008 has slowed the growth of household
indebtedness and the housing sector. However, should the household debt to income ratio continue
to rise, additional measures may be needed. Higher down payment requirements, lower caps on
debt-service -to-income ratios, and tighter LTV ratios on refinancing are some of the possible
options.
29.
The Canadian banking system is healthy, but it is important to remain vigilant
against the risk of contagion from adverse shocks. Canada’s banking system is well capitalized,
has posted another year of strong profits, and continues to show low nonperforming loans, also
owing to high prudential standards and rigorous supervision. Going forward, however, pressures on
margins from low interest rates and slowing growth in household loans may result in a more
challenging environment for banks, and induce them to increase their exposure to more volatile
capital market operations and expand their operations abroad. Moreover, despite the significant
strength of the system, Canadian banks are not immune to the risk of increased global financial
turbulence, which would reduce their access to wholesale funding. Stress-testing scenarios
developed by the authorities show manageable losses for the financial system under adverse
scenarios. Consideration could be given to publishing the results of the tests, especially as this
would promote a better awareness of the risks and enhance market discipline.
30.
It is also important to continue monitoring the risks to financial stability from the
non-bank sector, particularly from the low interest rate environment. Persistently low interest
rates have continued to challenge the financial positions of institutions with long-duration liabilities,
such as defined-benefit pension plans and life insurance companies. This challenging environment
increases the risks of underfunding for pension funds, and may require higher contributions. To
reduce interest rate risk and achieve a better matching of assets and liabilities, many pension plans
have adopted liability-driven investment strategies, but this may expose them to a new
configuration of risks in the cases where it involves the use of leverage. Life insurance companies
have reacted by redesigning and re-pricing their products but also by investing into alternative
(non-fixed income) assets. While there is little evidence that the search for yield has led to excessive
risk taking so far, it is essential to remain vigilant.
31.
An appropriate response to these risks is to take further steps to enhance the
resilience of the financial system. Staff welcomes Canadian authorities’ strong determination to
move ahead with the international financial reform agenda, often taking a leadership role among
other jurisdictions. In particular, staff supports the decision by the authorities to implement Basel III
capital requirements by January 2013, and their plan to implement liquidity standards once they are
finalized. Staff also welcomes the establishment in 2012 of a central counterparty service for fixedincome repos, which will increase the resilience of this important core funding market by mitigating
counterparty risk. Efforts to establish a single securities regulator for Canada should continue to

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CANADA

further strengthen the robustness of the financial system. Finally, staff welcomes the intention of the
authorities to undertake an update of the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) in 2013.
32.
Over the medium term, a key challenge for Canadian policymakers is to manage the
structural changes in the economy associated with the growing commodity sector. Higher
productivity growth is essential for Canadian firms to respond to persistent competitive pressures
from a strong currency and the opening of global trade markets to emerging and developed
economies. While recognizing that this is a complex issue and that the authorities have done much
to address the problem more can be done. For example, there is room for a better, more targeted,
support to investment in research and development and for measures aimed at increasing labor
mobility and retrain the workforce towards sectors experiencing labor shortages. Continued efforts
in opening up new markets, through multilateral and bilateral trade agreements, could also boost
competition and innovation. Finally, consideration could be given to adopting a fiscal framework
that mitigates the macro-economic and fiscal impact of commodity price volatility, for example by
excluding revenues from the most volatile commodities. This would allow a better assessment of the
underlying fiscal stance and the identification of the appropriate level of stabilization savings during
commodity price booms, particularly for resource-rich provinces.
33.

It is recommended that the next consultation occur on the usual 12-month cycle.

ANNEX I. CANADA’S TRADE AND FINANCIAL LINKAGES AND RISKS
SCENARIOS1
Inward spillovers to Canada predominantly come through the United States. In addition to the large
trade exposure, financial spillovers could be nontrivial, as many Canadian businesses and banks derive
a non-negligible share of their funding from abroad. However, the greater dependence on commodity
exports and production means that spillovers from large swings in global commodity prices could also
be significant. Model simulations confirm Canada’s exposure to U.S. and oil price (EMs) shocks, and
show that domestic imbalances greatly amplify the vulnerability to these shocks.
A. Inward Spillovers: Trade Channels
1.
Both geographical and product composition of Canada’s trade has changed over the
last decade. The share of Canada’s exports to the United States has fallen by about 15 percentage
points (pps) since 2000, though at about
Energy/Commodity Sector's Value Added Exports
75 percent is still by far the highest. Over the

doubled, while China’s share quadrupled, but
both remain relatively low, at 15 and 4 percent
100
respectively. The energy-related share of goods
80
exports has increased from 20 percent in 2000 to
60

above 30 percent in 2011. In terms of value

sector is even higher, and reached 30 percent in
0

this is still a relatively low number compared to
other economies (Chart).
2.
As a result of these changes, Canada has become more exposed to emerging markets
and the commodity price cycle. Having become a large consumer of a broad range of primary
commodities, China has come to play a dominant role in their global markets. IMF analysis suggests
that an increase of 1 percent of China’s GDP tend to lead to a rise in the prices of crude oil and
copper of about 6 percent after six months, and the effect is persistent given the slow supply
response (IMF “Spillover Report”, 2011 (www.imf.org)). In particular, given its high commodityintensity, fluctuations in China’s fixed asset investment could affect Canada, though a decline in
commodity prices as well as of export demand. IMF analysis suggests that a 1 percent reduction in

electricity (OECD Bilateral Trade Database).

34

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CANADA

China’s fixed investment growth has a peak effect on Canada’s GDP growth of about ¼ percentage
points (IMF “Spillover Report”, 2012 (www.imf.org)).
B. Inward Spillovers: Financial Channels
3.
Spillovers through financial channels, especially from the United States, are also
important. A global adverse financial shock can be transmitted to Canada directly, through a
reduction in the total amount of foreign borrowing that Canadian firms derive from abroad and
losses on foreign assets; and indirectly through a tightening of financial conditions in Canada.
4.
The importance of direct financial channels is not surprising given the size of debt
raised abroad by Canada’s non-financial private sector. As of Q3:2012, external debt is about
one quarter of total debt outstanding of Canada’s non-financial private sector, mostly bonds (about
60 percent) and inter-company lending (about 20 percent). This figure however could understate the
true dependence on external funding, as it ignores loans extended to Canadian businesses by
subsidiaries of foreign banks. Adding the local claims of foreign affiliates of all BIS reporting banks
(most of which is likely to fund Canadian businesses) raises the share of total Canada’s non-financial
private sector credit financed by external sources to about 30 percent.
5.
Canada’s banking sector holds nontrivial liabilities and claims vis-à-vis nonresidents.
Looking at the asset side, as of Q3:2012, around 30 percent of Canadian banks’ overall assets are
claims vis-à-vis nonresidents. The vast majority of this exposure is to the United States and mainly
consists of “local” claims in foreign currency (i.e., local claims of subsidiaries abroad). This has
increased over the last few years, reflecting Canadian banks’ acquisitions of U.S. financial institutions.
On the liability side, close to one quarter of banks total liabilities are vis-à-vis nonresidents (this
includes deposits held by subsidiaries of Canadian banks abroad). Moreover, Canadian banks have
always had a non-negligible dependence on wholesale funding denominated in foreign currency.
About half on non-retail liabilities (which accounts for about two third of Canadian banks’ total
liabilities) is in foreign currency.
6.
Canadian banks weathered the 2008–09 crisis well and remain healthy, but a few
changes are worth noting. Canadian banks had ample capital and large buffers of highly liquid
assets which allowed them to bridge temporary cash flow shortfalls. Moreover, relative to their size
of loans and mortgages, Canadian banks had a relatively stable source of long-term funding (retail
and non-retail deposits from small and medium businesses that tend to be relatively sticky) and
could access official funding programs designed to ease liquidity strains. While Canadian banks have
increased their capital and liquidity buffers since 2008, the U.S. debt market has become a more
important source of their funding—as of November 2012, U.S. Money Market Mutual Funds
exposure to Canadian banks was three times greater than at the end of 2007. Also, a greater share
of loans to households and businesses is now funded by non-retail deposits.
7.
Indirect financial channels are also an important source of inward spillovers. Tighter
financial conditions in the United States tend to lead to tighter financial conditions in Canada.
Canadian lending standards (from the Bank of Canada’s Senior Loan Officer’s Survey, SLOS) are
strongly correlated with those in the United States. Corporate bond spreads in the United States and

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

35

CANADA

Canada are also tightly linked (with a 0.9 correlation for the period between 1996 and 2009), and
similar ties can be found for prime and interbank rates.
8.
Several studies found that spillovers from financial channels could be significant.
Duttagupta and Barrera (2010) found that a shock to U.S. lending standards reduces Canadian
growth (y-o-y) by close to ½ pp in six quarters, more than a similar increase in Canadian lending
standards. The larger effect likely reflects the indirect effects of U.S. lending standards through lower
U.S. growth, as well as tighter Canadian lending standards. Klyuev, 2008 (www.imf.org), finds that a
percentage point increase in the U.S. 3-month T-bill rate leads to a decline of more than one
percentage point in Canada’s real GDP growth after 3 quarters. When the impact of the U.S. financial
shock is decomposed into trade and financial channels, the latter channel appears to be larger.
Swiston and Bayoumi, 2008 (www.imf.org), find that a one percent shock to U.S. real GDP shifts
Canadian real GDP by ¾ of a percentage point in the same direction, with financial spillovers more
important than trade in recent decades. Beaton et al., 2010 (Bank of Canada) found that while the
transmission of U.S. financial shocks to Canada occurs mainly through real channels (trade,
commodity prices and exchange rate), financial channels are also important, in particular through
the large reliance of Canadian firms on U.S. sources of lending.
C. Outward Spillovers
9.
Canada economic conditions have significant spillovers to Caribbean countries. These
spillovers could materialize primarily under three different channels:


Tourism. A 1 percent increase in OECD average unemployment causes a 4 percent fall in tourist
arrivals in Caribbean economies (Regional Economic Outlook, WHD, October 2010
(www.imf.org)). Hence, Canada’s relatively strong performance during the Great Recession was
an important buffer for some of these countries (e.g., Jamaica).



Financial links. Canadian banks are particularly active in the Caribbean countries, partly for
historical reasons.3 As of June 2012, Canadian banks’ claims accounted for about 70 percent of
total foreign claims in Trinidad and Tobago, about 35 percent of GDP.



Remittances. Direct spillovers through this channel are limited, as typically only a small fraction
of total remittances in Caribbean countries is from Canada (e.g., under 5 percent in Jamaica).
D. Risks Scenarios for Canada

10.
Strong trade and financial linkages make Canada particularly exposed to external
shocks. We assess the impact on Canada of several global risk scenarios, using the IMF Global
Integrated Monetary and Fiscal Model (GIMF) and the G35 Model. Because these models do not
have any role for house prices and household leverage, they may underestimate the impact of the
shocks on Canada. We thus augment the response of private consumption in GIMF by adding the
3

Nova Scotia) in the early 1900s.

36

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CANADA

additional impact that the same shocks have on consumption in a model with housing and financial
frictions, calibrated on Canada (Selected Issue Paper, Chapter 1). Moreover, GIMF is tweaked so as to
capture the impact of oil prices on Canada’s real effective exchange rate—a 10 percent reduction in
oil prices leads to a 1½ percent depreciation in Canada’s real effective exchange rate. We consider
two scenarios:


A worsening of the euro area debt crisis. In this scenario, deleveraging by euro area banks
leads to a sharp credit contraction in periphery countries. Concerns over fiscal sustainability raise
periphery sovereign spreads 300 basis points in 2013, forcing them to an ever more frontloaded fiscal consolidation (a 2 pps improvement in cyclically adjusted fiscal balances over 2013,
gradually returning to baseline by 2017). The euro area core countries are assumed to
experience milder credit contractions and lower sovereign risk premia (the U.S. the spread also
decreases by around 50 bps), as they benefit from a flight to quality. Risk concerns are assumed
to spill over into all other regions, with corporate risk premium rising by 50bps in advanced
countries and 100bps in emerging countries in 2013. Relative to the October 2012 World
Economic Outlook baseline, GDP falls in 2013 by 3 pps in Advanced Europe, ¾ pp in the United
States, and 1¼ pp for the world.4



Increased financial stress in emerging market economies. In this scenario, concerns about
the viability of private investment projects, particularly in the tradable good sectors, lead to a
tightening in private financial conditions in emerging market economies. The corporate risk
premium peaks in 2014 at 400 bps above baseline in the tradable sector, and 250 bps in the
non-tradable sector of these economies. Real GDP falls in 2013 by about 3 pps in emerging
markets, and less than 1 percent in both the United States and euro area. World GDP declines by
about 1½ pp.

11.
The results suggest that Canada is particularly vulnerable to EM shocks through the
commodity price channel. Assuming no monetary response from the Bank of Canada the
simulation results show that heightened euro area stress would subtract about ¾ pp from Canada’s
GDP in 2013 (the red dashed line in the Charts). The initial impact on Canada’s GDP from financial
stress in emerging markets is also about ¾ pp This is somewhat surprising, given that both Canada’s
major trading partners (the United States and euro area) are hit less in this scenario. The main
reason is that oil prices fall more in this case (about 15 percent in 2013, against 10 percent in the
euro area stress scenario). With many emerging market economies’ demand being more energy
intensive (notably China), falling demand in those regions has a greater impact on oil prices.

Monetary policy is constrained at the ZIF in the G3 countries for the first two years, while elsewhere monetary policy
eases to help offset the impact on market interest rates of rising risk premium.

Flexible exchange rates, as well as having room for a conventional monetary policy
response, are an important buffer against these shocks. In the absence of a monetary response,
the depreciation of the Canadian dollar following lower oil prices halves the impact of the shocks on
real exports in both scenarios. Without the depreciation, real GDP would have fallen by about
1½ pps and 2 pps over 2013 in the euro area and EM shock scenarios, respectively (the black line in
the Charts). Not surprisingly, when monetary policy can respond by stimulating domestic demand
with lower interest rates, the impact of the shocks would be largely offset: GDP would decline by
about ½ pp relative to the baseline in the euro area shock, and even less in the EM shock (the blue
line in the Charts). Much of the offset in this case would come from a muting of the initial decline in
external demand via additional currency depreciation.

ANNEX II. LONG-TERM FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY1
1.
This Appendix provides an assessment of the long-term sustainability of Canada’s public
finances, at the general government level (defined as federal, provincial, territorial and local
governments, and the Canada and Quebec Pension Plans). It relies on the staff’s medium-term fiscal
projections for General Government (Table 4) and mainly on Canada Parliamentary Budget Office’s
(PBO) projections for the long term. In particular:


Health care spending projections are based on IMF (2010).2 These projections are obtained
assuming that the current structure of spending per age group is constant over the forecasting
horizon. Each age cohort is assumed to

(percent, ratio of individuals over 65 years of age to population over 15)

Projections
50
scenario of the 2010 United Nations World
Population Prospects. Based on these
40
projections, Canada’s elderly population will
30
increase rapidly over the next 20 years, with
the old age dependency ratio projected to
20
increase from 20 percent in 2010 to around
10
40 percent afterwards. Finally, health

to grow in real terms at an annual rate that
Sources: UN World Population Prospects, Fund staff estimates
is 1 percentage points above productivity
growth. This excess cost growth (ECG) is
slightly above the average for Canada over
the 2002–2011 period. Based on these
assumptions, health spending is projected to
grow from 7½ percent of GDP in 2010 to
about 14 percent by 2050. Population aging
and the health care ECG are expected to
contribute equally to the increase until 2030,
while about two thirds of the increase from
2030 to 2050 is due to the ECG.

Pension projections are based on the latest actuarial reports (2010) of the Offices of the Chief
Actuary for the CPP and QPP. For the CPP, they show that the legislated contribution rate of
9.9 percent is sufficient to fund future outlays while accumulating assets worth $275 billion (i.e.,
4.7 times the annual expenditures) up until 2020. The results for QPP show that the contribution
rate needs to increase in order to ensure long-term funding. We follow the recommendation of
the report and assume that contribution rates would be increased by 1.12 percentage points.

CANADA

Based on PBO projections, old-age security (OAS) spending is expected to reach 2.5 percent of
GDP by 2050 from 2.2 percent in 2010, after peaking at 2.9 percent in the mid 2040s.


Other. Spending on education and unemployment benefits is projected following the PBO, and
is set to decrease slightly over the long run given Canada’s population aging. Education
spending is expected to go from 5.5 percent of GDP in 2011 to 4.9 percent by 2050, while
unemployment benefits are set to reach 0.9 percent of GDP by 2050, from 1.1 percent currently.
Other spending chapters are assumed to remain constant as a share of GDP over the forecasting
horizon. Total general government revenues are projected to remain constant as a share of GDP
over the forecasting horizon, at about 37 percent of GDP.

2.
Based on these assumptions, the general government’s overall balance will deteriorate
from 2017 and the net-debt-to GDP ratio will reach 100 percent of GDP by end 2050. This is
entirely caused by the dynamic of the

ratio. While the string of primary surpluses is

expected to allow the federal government to
start accumulating assets by late 2030, the net-debt-to GDP ratio at the PTL level is expected to
reach about 140 percent of GDP in 2050. CPP and QPP are expected to accumulate assets of about
20 percent of GDP over the forecasting horizon. As a result, Canada’s general government net debt
is expected to reach 100 percent of GDP by the end of the forecasting horizon.
3.
The immediate and permanent increase in the primary balance needed to bring the
general government net debt to GDP ratio back to the current level by 2050, the so called
“fiscal sustainability gap”, is about 1.1 percent of GDP as of end 2011. Again, this is entirely the
result of a gap at PTL level (about 2.4 percent of GDP), as the estimate of the gap at the federal
government level is negative (-1.3 percent of GDP). This means that the federal government could
actually maintain its 2050 net debt ratio at the current level even if its primary balance were to be
reduced by 1.3 percent of GDP relative to the baseline projections every year in our forecast horizon.
4.
Making Canada’s net debt dynamics sustainable over the long run will require
containing health care spending growth. The projected fiscal deficit at the PTL level is mainly
explained by the increase in health care spending. As of 2011, PTL are responsible for 95 percent of
overall public health care spending. The Federal government provides funding for health care on an
equal per capita basis through the Canada Health Transfer (CHT)—the largest federal transfer
program to provinces and territories. While CHT transfers are set to grow at 6 percent until 2016–17,
40

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CANADA

starting from 2017–18 they will grow in line with the three-year moving average growth of nominal
GDP, with a minimum guaranteed increase by at least 3 percent per year. Given that long-term
nominal GDP growth is set to be around 4 percent for Canada, provinces will not only face rising
health costs but also lower growth in CHT.

The sharp appreciation of the Canadian
dollar contributed to Canada’s weak export
performance over the last decade. The
correlation between the Canadian exchange rate
(in real effective terms) and commodity prices has
increased over time (Chart). Staff analysis (Selected
Issues, Chapter 4) shows that the surge in
commodity prices accounts for three fourths of
the 25 percent appreciation of the Canadian real
effective exchange rate between 2000 and 2007,
and that this appreciation has been the primary
driver of the large loss of market share in the
United States, especially on manufacturing, over
that period.

3.
Increased competition from emerging markets has also been one of the key reasons for
Canada’s loss of market share in the United States. Increased competition from China (Selected Issues,
Chapter 4), in particular, hindered the ability of Canadian exporters to sustain its market share abroad. In
more recent years, Mexico is also becoming a stiffer competitor in some areas, like autos. Canada’s
response to these competitive pressures has been complicated by the widening of the productivity gap
relative to both advanced economies (e.g., the United States and Germany) and emerging markets (e.g.,
China and Mexico). At the same time, energy exports have been growing at a steady pace, but
infrastructure constraints (e.g., limited pipeline capacity) have put limits on volumes exported and on
prices received for Canadian oil−the spread between WTI and Canadian oil prices has increased
substantially.
4.
Large portfolio inflows have helped finance the deficit and may have also contributed to
sustain the Canadian dollar. Average net portfolio outflows from 2000–07 turned into inflows of some
4 percent of GDP as of Q3:2012. The recent net

Staff analysis indicates that the current account is weaker and the real exchange rate is
stronger than implied by medium-term fundamentals and policies. Based on the methodologies
used in the IMF’s new External Balance Assessment (EBA) (IMF, 2012 (www.imf.org)), staff estimates that in
the medium-term Canada’s current account (CA) should be between -1 and 1 percent of GDP, while the
exchange rate is between 5 and 15 percent above levels consistent with long-term fundamentals. In
particular


The EBA CA norm is estimated to be a surplus of 1 percent of GDP. This would imply a required
adjustment of about 5 percent of GDP, with about 1 percent attributed to the gap between
“recommended” and actual policies. At the same time, staff expects that the gradual U.S. economic
recovery will induce a 1¼ percent of GDP improvement in Canada’s CA position over the medium
term.



But a CA deficit of close to 1 percent of GDP would be enough to stabilize Canada’s NFA over the
medium term. To be sure, Canada has been able to sustain relatively large CA deficits for long periods
of its history, with the CA balance averaging –1½ percent of GDP over 1961–2010. A modest CA
deficit is also consistent with the traditional CGER model.

FSSA Participation and ROSC Assessments

Canada–Financial System Stability Assessment–
Volume II: Report on Observance of Standards in
the Financial System

www.imf.org

Summary: The FSSA report concluded that Canada has a stable and highly advanced
financial system, which is among the soundest in the world. Moreover, it is supported by
a well-developed regulatory system that shows a high degree of compliance with major
international standards. Nevertheless, the FSSA report made a few recommendations to
further strengthen the regulatory framework and financial system’s resilience, most of
which have already been addressed, including:


Introducing capital requirements for the guarantees in life insurance segregated
fund (completed by end-2001);



Tabling legislation granting the Office of the Superintendent of Financial
Institutions (OSFI) powers to remove a financial institution’s director or senior
officer if the person is deemed not suitable to hold that office based on a number
of criteria. The latter legislation brought Canada into broad compliance with the
Basel Core Principles;

Making significant progress in harmonizing securities regulation and improving
coordination among provincial securities regulators, including through a newly created
association of securities regulators, the Canadian Securities Administrators. Although
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 3

CANADA

there remain multiple regulators at the provincial level, a Senate commission was created
to develop specific recommendations on further harmonization and streamlining of
securities regulation.
Canada: Report on the Observance of Standards
and Codes—Fiscal Transparency Module

IMF Country Report No. 02/51,
03/12/02

Summary: The report found that fiscal management in Canada meets the requirements
of the fiscal transparency code, and in a number of instances represents best practice. In
particular, it highlighted the use of private sector economic forecasts. Fiscal management
was also commended for its statistical integrity, impartial tax administration, open
procurement, and a transparent regulatory process.
The report found several areas where further improvements would be desirable,
including: (i) the preparation of timely, current year estimates of federal and provincial
budgets on a comparable basis, (ii) a comprehensive account of the procedures for the
budget cycle and expenditure management system, (iii) systematic reporting of the use
of reserves for non-economic contingencies, (iv) resumption of publication of reconciled
national and public accounts forecasts of major aggregates over the forecast horizon,
and (v) publication by all governments of quasi-fiscal activities.
Many of these issues have been addressed, including: (i) the release by Statistics Canada
of consolidated data for federal and provincial budgets for 2001–02 (on a Financial
Management System basis); (ii) the publication of comprehensive descriptions of budget
and expenditure management procedures, including a joint document entitled
“Budgeting in Canada” by the Government and the OECD, detailed accounts of policies
and procedures on expenditure management at the website of the Treasury Board
Secretariat, and the explanation of the budget cycle and process in Budget and Update
documents; and (iii) publication of reconciled national and public accounts forecasting.
Canada: Report on the Observance of Standards
and Codes—Data Module

IMF Country Report
No. 03/328, 10/23/03

Summary: Canada’s macroeconomic statistics are comprehensive, timely, and accurate
and thus adequate to conduct effective surveillance of economic and financial policies.
Official institutions responsible for the compilation and dissemination of the
macroeconomic datasets are supported by adequate legal and institutional frameworks.
These frameworks protect confidentiality and ensure that statistical work is conducted
within a quality assurance program and with sufficient resources. Integrity is ensured by
the professionalism of the staff, transparency in statistical policies and practices, and the
provision of ethical guidelines for staff. Compilers generally follow internationally
accepted guidelines in the production of the macroeconomic statistics, which is wellsupported by excellent efforts to develop source data that facilitate a high degree of
accuracy and reliability. Statistics are generally relevant, well documented, available with

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CANADA

good frequency on a timely basis, and readily accessible to users, who trust them as
objective.
While recognizing the high quality of the macroeconomic data, the report makes
recommendations to further strengthen the statistical system, most of which are already
being addressed, including these priorities:


Articulate the roles of Statistics Canada and the Bank of Canada in producing
financial sector statistics and explore possibilities for more data sharing of monetary
and financial statistics;



Estimate consumption of fixed capital at replacement cost rather than historic costs
now used for the corporate sector in the Canadian System of National Accounts
(CSNA);



Disseminate information on the sources and methods used in compiling quarterly
public sector statistics for the quarterly CSNA; and



Reclassify certain transactions that are not recorded in line with the 5th edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5).

Canada: Report on the Observance of Standards
and Codes––FATF Recommendations for AntiMoney Laundering and Combating the Financing

IMF Country Report
No. 08/372, 12/11/08

Summary: Canada underwent a detailed FATF evaluation of its anti-money laundering
and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) framework in 2007. Shortcomings
were identified with respect to the scope of customer due diligence, AML/CFT
supervision, and the Canadian financial intelligence unit. Since then, a number of steps
have been taken to strengthen the framework in these three areas, resulting in significant
improvements.
Canada: Financial System Stability AssessmentUpdate

IMF Country Report
No. 08/59, 02/13/08

Summary: The FSSA update concluded that Canada’s financial system is mature,
sophisticated, and well-managed. Financial stability was underpinned by sound
macroeconomic policies and strong prudential regulation and supervision, and welldesigned deposit insurance and arrangements for crisis management and failure
resolution. The banking system appeared sound, with stress tests showing that the major
banks could withstand sizeable shocks, although they did faces some challenges related
to the global financial turmoil that started in mid-2007. Also, there were some concerns
about bank attempts to build on their secure domestic position, to enter highly
competitive foreign markets or complex activities.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 5

CANADA

The update reiterated the advantages of moving towards a single securities regulator,
including the streamlining of policy development, reductions in compliance costs, and
improved enforcement. However, it also recognized the significant improvements to the
regulatory system from the creation of the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA), and
the implementation of the passport system.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
The quality, coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of Canada’s economic data are considered to be
excellent both in the context of the Article IV consultation and for purposes of ongoing surveillance.
Canada has subscribed to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS), and its metadata
are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB). The data ROSC was
published on October 23, 2003.
Real Sector. Statistics Canada provides timely and adequate data in monthly, quarterly, and annual
frequency thereby facilitating the analysis of economic developments and assessment of policy
proposals within a quantitative macroeconomic framework. In May 2001, Statistics Canada effected
a smooth transition from Laspeyres methodology for estimating real expenditure-based GDP to
Fisher index formulae, which enabled more accurate comparison between Canada and other G-7
countries.
Fiscal Sector. Statistics Canada provides quarterly data (a Statement of Government Operations
along with a Balance Sheet) on the consolidated general government and its subsectors following
the Government Finance Statistics Manual, 2001 (GFSM 2001) recommendations. In addition, the
Department of Finance Canada provides monthly and annual data on the federal government’s
budget, tax policies, rules and regulations for Canada’s banks and other financial institutions,
according to the national presentation. The provided data enable adequate assessment of the
impact of fiscal policy measures on Canada’s economic performance.
Monetary Sector. The Bank of Canada provides timely and adequate coverage of daily, weekly,
monthly and quarterly data related to the monetary sector.
External Sector. Statistics Canada provides timely information on a quarterly frequency on the
balance of payments, external debt, and the international investment position (IIP).
Finance Canada provides monthly data on Official International Reserves in a format comparable to
the IMF’s reserve data template, thus enabling adequate surveillance. Data are published at

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with Canada
On February 11, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Canada.11
Background
After a strong rebound in 2010–11, the Canadian economy slowed in 2012 reflecting lower
growth of private domestic demand, continued external headwinds, and ongoing fiscal
adjustment. Slower growth of disposable income and consumer credit put pressure on
consumption. The housing sector cooled off somewhat, albeit from very high levels, and the
uncertain external environment weighed on business investment. The authorities moved ahead
with plans to return to balanced budgets over the medium term, so fiscal policy also held growth
in check. At the same time, weak external demand and the strong currency depressed exports.
Together with lower commodity prices, this caused a sharp widening of the current account
deficit, to around 4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).
Economic growth is expected to pick up again later in 2013, accelerating to around 2½ percent
by 2014–15. Private consumption and residential investment are expected to contribute less to
growth than in the recent past, as households deleverage and the housing sector continues to
cool off. But business investment and net exports will benefit from the expected strengthening of
the U.S economy. However, near-term adverse risks remain elevated, in particular from
continued uncertainty on U.S. fiscal policy, further turbulence from Europe, and a decline in
commodity prices driven by an economic slowdown in emerging markets. While high household
debt and still elevated house prices leave Canada more vulnerable to external shocks, a less
gradual unwinding of domestic imbalances than in staff forecasts could also lead to lower
growth.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with
officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this
summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in the summing up
can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
With regard to policy, fiscal consolidation continued in 2012. The federal government has led
the effort, but most provinces are also moving ahead with plans to restrain spending. As a
result, the general government’s cyclically-adjusted fiscal deficit fell by a cumulative estimated
1¾ percentage points over the last two years and net debt, at around 34½ percent of GDP, is
below most of its international peers. The federal authorities are targeting a balanced budget by
mid-decade with some policy flexibility in case the downside risks materialize.
With economic growth faltering, major downside risks still lingering, and well-anchored
inflationary expectations, monetary policy has remained accommodative. The inflation rate fell
to the bottom of the Bank of Canada target band in late 2012, reflecting weaker economic
activity, lower commodity prices, and the stronger currency. The target for the overnight rate
has remained unchanged at 1 percent since September 2010, and market expectations are for
monetary tightening to begin later in 2013.
Canadian financial markets have benefited from improved global financial conditions. Credit
conditions remains highly favorable and should help support business investment going
forward. Canada’s banks are well capitalized and profitable, but remain exposed to potential
spillovers from renewed distress in global financial markets which could lead to higher funding
costs and liquidity strains.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their sound macroeconomic and financial
sector management. They noted that, after recovering rapidly from the 2009 recession,
economic growth slowed in 2012. While growth is expected to pick up later in 2013, the balance
of risks remains tilted to the downside as the high level of household debt may amplify the
impact of adverse external shocks. In this regard, Directors noted that Canada’s main challenge
is to support growth in the short term while reducing the vulnerabilities that may arise from
external shocks and domestic imbalances.
Directors agreed that the current monetary policy stance is appropriately accommodative. They
noted that, given the negative output gap, well-anchored inflation expectations, and a
challenging global environment, the tightening cycle should start only when growth strengthens
again. Most Directors also agreed that there remains scope for further monetary policy easing to
support economic activity should growth prospects weaken significantly. A few Directors
believed, however, that further easing is unlikely to be effective and would exacerbate financial
risks posed by prolonged low interest rates. Directors concurred that further macro-prudential
measures are the first line of defense against the risks from high household leverage.
Directors supported the authorities’ medium-term fiscal consolidation plans, as this will allow
rebuilding key buffers against future adverse shocks. They agreed, however, that automatic
stabilizers should be allowed to work fully in the event economic growth weakens. Directors
stressed the importance of moving ahead with fiscal consolidation in some of the largest
provinces.

3

Directors noted that placing the general government debt on a sustainable long-term path would
require reforms that durably contain spending and boost revenues. Renewed efforts at the
provincial level to slow the growth of health care spending would be particularly important in this
regard. Publishing a comprehensive fiscal sustainability report covering all levels of government
and including a discussion of policy options would help gain the necessary public support for
reforms.
Directors considered the housing sector to be an important source of vulnerability, noting the
rising household debt-to-income ratio. They welcomed the authorities’ tightening of the rules for
government-backed mortgage insurance and mortgage lending standards, which has helped
slow the pace of increase in household leverage and house prices. Directors concurred that,
should the household debt-to-income ratio continue to rise, additional measures may be
needed.
Directors commended Canada’s strong financial regulation and supervision system, which has
helped maintain a well-capitalized and profitable banking system. They stressed the need to
remain vigilant against the risk of contagion from external shocks and the build-up of financial
vulnerabilities from the prolonged period of low interest rates. Directors welcomed the
authorities’ continued commitment to implement the international financial reform agenda, and
their decision to undertake an update of the Financial Sector Assessment Program in 2013.
Directors concurred that the strong endowment of commodities presents both opportunities and
challenges. They noted that the sustained improvement of Canada’s terms of trade, driven by
higher commodity prices, had a positive impact on economic growth and government revenues.
At the same time, structural changes associated with the growing commodity sector should be
managed by increasing productivity and opening up new markets. More generally,
improvements in productivity will be needed to increase Canada’s external competitiveness.
They also agreed that it would be useful for the authorities or resource-rich provinces to
consider adopting a fiscal framework that mitigates the transmission of commodity price
volatility to the broader economy.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
