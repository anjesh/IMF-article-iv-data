STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
January 9, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Inflation subsided in 2013 but preexisting and emerging macro-financial
vulnerabilities need to be tackled. After reaching a 15-year high in 2012, inflation is
coming back within the central bank’s target thanks to tighter monetary policy and fiscal
consolidation. However, a recent surge in credit and a new increase in public sector
wages call for continued caution over price stability. In addition, the economy’s
vulnerability to developments in the hydrocarbon sector is worsening. Declining
hydrocarbon production and surging domestic consumption are squeezing export
volumes, compounding the longstanding risk of lower oil prices. The policy mix will need
to remain geared towards maintaining macroeconomic and financial stability.
Despite the ongoing consolidation efforts, fiscal policy is not on a sustainable path.
Fiscal policy is de facto procyclical, and the deficit is well above its long-term sustainable
level, implying negative net public savings in the long run. Designing and implementing
a full-fledged fiscal rule—combining a realistic and smoothed budgeted oil price, a floor
on the primary balance, a drawing rule, and a sovereign wealth fund—would help
contain macroeconomic vulnerability and build savings for future generations. In the
meantime, policies to develop the hydrocarbon sector—with a view to extending the
lifetime of existing reserves and preserving fiscal revenue—would help achieve a
sustainable fiscal framework.
Wide-ranging structural reforms are required to accelerate nonhydrocarbon
growth and reduce unemployment. Measures are needed to enhance the business
climate, attract foreign investment, and improve Algeria’s integration into the world
economy. Public investment needs to be preserved, and its efficiency reinforced. The
financial sector is critical to the development of the economy; measures are needed to
support private sector credit, jumpstart capital markets, and ensure the compliance of
the financial framework with AML/CFT requirements. Finally, the job market needs to be
more inclusive to youth and women, who bear the brunt of unemployment.
Exchange rate regime. The de facto exchange rate regime is classified as “other
managed arrangement.” Algeria has accepted the obligations of Article VIII Sections 2(a),
3, and 4.

INTRODUCTION
1.
The economy stabilized in 2013. Following a rapid increase in public spending in 2011–12
to meet pressing social demands and to weather the recent regional turmoil, inflation spiked in
2012. It was subsequently reined in through monetary policy tightening initiated in May 2012 and
fiscal consolidation implemented in 2013. External and fiscal buffers are large, and the banking
sector is sound.
2.
However, long-standing vulnerabilities remain and new uncertainties are emerging.
Following large surpluses for most of the past decade, the current account balance is expected to
turn into a deficit in the medium term as fast-growing domestic consumption of hydrocarbons
squeezes exports. Despite recent fiscal consolidation, the fiscal stance remains unsustainable.
Economic growth continues to be overly dependent on public spending and vulnerable to a
protracted decline in oil prices. Unemployment is still high, especially among youth and women.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
3.
Growth and inflation. Real GDP growth increased to 3.3 percent in 2012 from 2.8 percent in
2011, led by strong growth in the nonhydrocarbon sector, driven by public sector spending, while
the hydrocarbon sector contracted for the seventh consecutive year. Inflation rose to 8.9 percent in
2012—the highest level in 15 years—following a surge in current spending that resulted in excess
liquidity. Inflation has decelerated thus far in 2013. Fiscal consolidation and monetary tightening
(both increased liquidity absorption and an increase in the reserve requirement rate) brought core
inflation to 3.7 percent in October from a peak of 5.9 percent in 2012. Food inflation has decelerated
more rapidly, helped by the fiscal and monetary policy mix, falling international prices, and better
domestic agricultural production. Overall inflation declined to 4.5 percent in October.

External position. The external position, though still very strong, has started to weaken. The
current account surplus narrowed to 6.0 percent of GDP in 2012 from 9.9 percent in 2011, as imports

increased sharply and hydrocarbon exports contracted slightly due to lower production levels and
increasing domestic consumption. The trend of weak hydrocarbon exports and rapid import growth
continued into 2013, with the current account recording a slight deficit through the first three
quarters of 2013. Capital inflows remain limited, with FDI falling to just $1.5 billion (less than
1 percent of GDP) in 2012. Official reserves rose to $191 billion in 2012 from $182 billion in 2011
(equal to nearly three years of imports of goods and services), but growth in reserves has since
slowed. External debt amounted to 1.9 percent of GDP at end-2012.
5.
The real effective exchange rate (REER) is on the strong side, despite a steady
depreciation in recent months. For the first six months of the year, both the REER and nominal
effective exchange rate (NEER) were relatively stable, appreciating by less than 1 percent. Between
June and October 2013, however, the REER depreciated 6.2 percent, reaching its lowest level since
mid-2011. The depreciation in the REER outpaced the depreciation in the NEER, reflecting lower
inflation in Algeria relative to its trading partners. Nevertheless, staff estimates suggest that the
REER remains somewhat on the strong side (Appendix 1).
6.
Public finances. The fiscal stimulus initiated in 2010 reached full steam in 2012. Current
spending in 2012 increased by 23 percent in nominal terms to 30.2 percent of GDP and 45.0 percent
of nonhydrocarbon GDP (NHGDP), as public sector

national oil company). This was the result of slower accumulation of NFA (7.4 percent, compared to
16.2 percent in 2011), and increased public savings that partially offset higher credit growth (credit
to the economy increased by 15.1 percent compared to 13.5 percent in 2011). Excess liquidity was
high at the start of 2012, but slowed as the central bank increased the reserve requirement ratio in
May 2012 and then again in May 2013, and upped the volume of liquidity absorption in May 2012.
Money growth has remained subdued in 2013 (7.1 percent increase through September compared
to end-December 2012), largely as a result of slower growth in NFA. Credit to the economy,
however, has been more dynamic than in 2012, reaching 22.3 percent through September, driven by
33.6 percent growth in credit to the public sector—an 11-year high. Credit to the private sector grew
by 16.9 percent, ahead of last year’s pace of 13.5 percent.
8.
Financial sector. The banking sector remains solvent and liquid. The overall capital
adequacy ratio in 2012 was 23 percent, little changed from the previous year. The ratio of
nonperforming loans (NPLs) declined to 11 percent, following government repurchases of stateowned enterprise (SOE) debt and the restructuring of the debts of viable small- and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs), and reflecting the growth in credit. Seventy percent of NPLs are provisioned,
bringing the net NPL ratio to 3.5 percent. Liquidity remained comfortable. Credit to the economy
increased somewhat, but access to finance remains low compared to other countries in the region
and to countries at a similar level of development. Financial markets remain underdeveloped, with
only one new listing on the stock exchange in 2013, bringing the total number of listed companies
to four, and two corporate bonds. In 2013, the Ministry of Finance announced that eight SOEs would
be listed, although no timeline has been defined so far.
9.
Employment. Over the years, Algeria has made significant progress in addressing
unemployment, with the overall

Box 1. Growth and Inequality
Economic growth in Algeria over the last decade has been relatively more favorable to the poor than
to the rich, helping to reduce inequality. An analysis of household survey data indicates that Algeria’s Gini
coefficient fell from 0.34 in 2000 to 0.31 in 2011, reflecting an increase in the share of spending by poorer
households relative to total household spending in the economy (Figure 1). On average across all
households, real spending increased by 6.4 percent over the period (Figure 2). The strongest growth was
experienced by the 10th and 30th deciles, while the slowest growth occurred in the richest decile.

Disparities remain stronger among rural households than among urban households. Although both
rural and urban areas saw a narrowing in inequality over the last decade, the Gini coefficient of rural
households (0.37) was twice that of urban households (0.18) in 2011. On average, rural households increased
their spending by 4.5 percent in real terms, while urban households experienced a 7.3 percent increase
(Figures 3 and 4). Among rural households, the lowest growth in spending occurred in the 60th and 70th
deciles.

Algeria’s pro-poor growth over the past decade coincided with a significant decline in unemployment
and increases in social spending. Between 2000 and 2011, the unemployment rate fell steadily, from
29.5 percent to 10.0 percent. Over the same period, per capita spending on health and education doubled in
real terms. Although further study is warranted before drawing definitive conclusions, these developments
may have disproportionately benefited the poorer segments of society.

Outlook



Growth and inflation. Real GDP growth is expected to slow to 2.7 percent in 2013 as fiscal
consolidation takes hold and as hydrocarbon exports remain weak. Nonhydrocarbon growth is
projected to decline from 7.1 percent to 5.9 percent, mainly reflecting a slowdown in
construction and government services. Real GDP growth should pick up in 2014, driven by a
recovery in the hydrocarbon sector, following higher investment, and by stronger external
demand as Southern Europe’s outlook improves. Inflation is projected to fall to 4.5 percent this
year as the government withdraws fiscal stimulus, monetary policy remains prudent, and food
prices soften.



External. The current account surplus is projected to narrow further in 2013, falling to 1.1 percent
of GDP. Lower oil prices and rising domestic consumption are expected to weigh on exports,
while imports continue to grow. Looking ahead, a small current account deficit is projected by
2015, on the assumption of lower oil prices and continued growth in domestic hydrocarbon
consumption.



Fiscal. The overall deficit for 2013 is expected to improve significantly to 0.2 percent of GDP
(34.3 percent of NHGDP). In 2014, spending is expected to increase slightly, by 1 percent of GDP,
mostly due to capital spending. On the revenue side, however, declining oil prices and broadly
stable export volumes will constrain hydrocarbon revenue, while nonhydrocarbon revenue is
projected to remain stable as a share of NHGDP. Consequently, the fiscal deficit is expected to
reach 2.1 percent in 2014. The deficit is projected to worsen in 2015 before improving somewhat
at the end of the projection period as current spending is contained and nonhydrocarbon
revenue improves. The nonhydrocarbon overall deficit is expected to improve slowly, from
34.3 percent of NHGDP in 2013 to 27.4 percent of NHGDP by 2018, but fall short of placing
fiscal policy on a sustainable path. In addition, the breakeven price of oil is expected to remain
above the market price over the medium term. Gross fiscal savings are expected to increase
further in DZD terms, stabilizing at 36.6 percent of GDP by the end of the projection period.
Gross public debt will remain low (Appendix II).



Monetary. Money supply is expected to grow by 8.6 percent in 2013, as higher fiscal savings
somewhat offset the fast growth in credit to the public sector. Credit to the private sector is
expected to increase by 1 percentage point of GDP but remain low at 22.6 percent of NHGDP in
2013. Absent structural reforms to support private sector growth and develop the financial
sector, private sector credit is only expected to increase slowly over the medium term.

11.
Risks. Risks are mainly tilted to the downside and are largely related to the oil dependency
of the country, while outward spillovers are likely to be limited (Box 2).


A prolonged decline in oil prices. Although still sizable, the accumulation of fiscal savings in the
FRR has been slowed by the financing needs created by consecutive fiscal deficits. The fiscal
breakeven oil price in 2014 is projected to be higher than medium-term oil prices, underscoring
the risks to fiscal sustainability should oil prices experience a sustained decline.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

ALGERIA



A worsening global environment. A deeper slowdown in emerging markets, or a protracted
period of slower growth in Europe, would negatively affect the balance of payments (through
lower hydrocarbon demand and prices) and the fiscal balance (through lower hydrocarbon
revenue), ultimately affecting growth. Risks to the financial sector are small, given the country’s
limited exposure to international financial markets.



Further pressure to use the hydrocarbon rent. Despite high levels of spending in 2011 and 2012,
and additional wage increases in 2013, social demands remain elevated and could further
increase ahead of the presidential election in 2014. Additional current spending to placate the
population would worsen the fiscal balance, increase reliance on the hydrocarbon rent, and fuel
inflation.



Intensification of regional tensions. Instability in neighboring countries and tensions in Egypt and
Syria create risks to security that could weigh on investments, notably FDI. On the other hand,
instability elsewhere in the region may lead to significantly higher oil prices, which could have a
positive net impact on the economy.

High. A further slowdown in growth in the euro area (Algeria's main gas export

hydrocarbon prices and lower demand, and the fiscal balance. A slowdown in
growth in the United States or emerging markets/China would also affect the
country through lower global demand and its potential impact on oil prices. In
all cases, spillovers through capital markets would be limited, given Algeria's
very limited exposure to international financial markets.

Medium
Medium

Medium/Low
Medium

Low. Algeria's capital account is not open, and risks related to both capital
outflows and inflows are marginal. Algeria is a net creditor, and its large
international reserves are mainly invested in high-grade sovereign bonds. A
stress on the international bond market would complicate the reserve
investment strategy.The financial sector is little exposed to the international
environment, and risks to financial stabiilty are unlikely to affect the country,
though second-round effects on the real sector would be possible.

Other risks
Short term : Global oil shock

Low

High. Algeria's fiscal and external sectors are heavily reliant on oil revenues.
A lasting decline in oil prices would worsen the fiscal balance absent
significant efforts to curb current spending and increase nonhydrocarbon
revenues. Conversely, an increase in oil prices would support both the current
account and fiscal balances.

Medium term : Distortions from
unconventional monetary policy

High

Low. Large swings in Algeria's main partners' currency values could
complicate the management of the exchange rate. Given Algeria's very limited
exposure to financial markets, the impact of market repricing or the side
effects from exit modalities is not expected to affect the country.

Medium term : Sustained decline in
commodity prices

Low

Low. Algeria is a net importer of nonhydrocarbon commodities and would
benefit from lower prices through an improved current account balance and
lower inflation.

Low

Low. Food price increases would put further pressure on the fiscal balance
through subsidies, and may feed inflation.

Short/medium term : Further demands on the
hydrocarbon rent

High

High. Despite large spending in 2011 and 2012, frustration remains elevated
in the population (inflation, lack of housing, unemployment) and the next
presidential election is looming (2014). Additional current spending would
further worsen the fiscal balance and increase Algeria's reliance on
hydrocarbon rents, and could fuel inflation.

Short/medium term : Intensification of
regional tensions (notably in Mali and Libya)

Medium

Algeria-specific risks
Medium term : Shocks to food prices (notably
wheat)

Short/medium term : Domestic political
instability

Low

High. Algeria's hydrocarbon infrastructure is located in the Southern part of
the country and is vulnerable to terrorist attacks. Further security concerns
may increase the risk premium of investing in the country.
High. Increased political instability could deter foreign investment and lead to
a deterioration of the fiscal position and a depletion of the oil stabilization fund.

Box 2. Algeria’s Inward and Outward Macroeconomic Spillovers
The limited openness of the Algerian economy significantly constrains the potential outward spillover
effects of a shock in the country to both the region and the rest of the world. With financial flows
restricted by the closed capital account, the current account is the main potential channel of shock
contagion. A domestic shock that would affect demand and imports from Algeria is unlikely to have any
significant outward spillover: Algeria’s imports from the Maghreb, at less than US$2 billion in 2012, represent
only 3.5 percent of the combined exports of Morocco and Tunisia. Imports from the EU, at about
US$25 billion in 2012, are less than 2 percent of this region’s non-EU exports. However, in the current tight
oil market conditions, a shock to Algeria’s oil production

spillovers.
Algeria

A decline in growth in Europe would have negative
spillover effects in Algeria, reflecting the large
dependence of the country on gas exports to the EU.
Nonhydrocarbon exports would also be negatively
affected, as Europe is also the main client for these.1

Lower hydrocarbon prices would also harm Algeria’s
fiscal balance and balance of payment, as reflected by
the simulation of a permanent US$ 25 decline in oil
prices under a no-policy-change scenario.

Discussions focused on the three main policy challenges facing the country. In the short
term, macroeconomic and financial stability will need to be consolidated. To ensure long-term fiscal
sustainability, the management of hydrocarbon wealth needs to be improved. Finally, Algeria needs
to raise the rate of economic growth and create more jobs.
Box 3. Authorities’ Response to Past IMF Policy Recommendations
The authorities generally agree with staff’s policy recommendations, but overall implementation is
sometimes held back by slow decision-making processes. Since the last Article IV consultation, progress
has been recorded in tightening monetary policy, implementing fiscal consolidation, and improving the
business environment. However, measures that would have implied a relaxation of the State’s control over
the economy—such as setting higher indicative FX ceilings for travelers, lifting the ban on consumer credit,
or revising the FDI ownership rules—have not been implemented.

THEME 1. CONSOLIDATING MACROECONOMIC AND
FINANCIAL STABILITY
13.
The surge in public spending prior to 2013 weakened the fiscal position and put
upward pressure on the equilibrium real effective exchange rate, raising Dutch-disease
concerns. The fiscal consolidation undertaken in 2013, combined with monetary policy tightening
and measures to ease supply constraints and foster competition, has helped to slow inflation. A mix
of fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policies should aim to pursue disinflation, put the fiscal stance
on a sustainable path, and improve the economy's external competitiveness.
14.
Staff and the authorities agreed on the need for the central bank to continue to guard
against inflation. Although inflation has declined substantially, the recent surge of credit to the
economy could fuel domestic demand, thereby generating inflationary pressures. Staff
recommended that the BA maintain a prudent monetary policy while introducing measures that will
bolster its effectiveness over time (Box 4).


Ongoing efforts to mop up excess liquidity would benefit from increased coordination with the
Ministry of Finance. The BA raised the reserve requirement rate from 11 percent to 12 percent in
May 2013, and maintained the volume of liquidity absorption. The BA should be prepared to
tighten the monetary stance to avoid any further buildup of excess banking liquidity. The need
to absorb liquidity would be significantly reduced if the financing need for the budget was
covered by debt issuance rather than by drawings on the FRR. Such a shift would need to be
accompanied by enhanced liquidity forecasting and more formal and systematic exchanges of
information between the BA and the Ministry of Finance regarding both treasury cash flows and
liquidity management operations, in order to ensure a smooth supply of liquidity to the
economy. The authorities saw merit to this approach, and underscored that coordination
between the BA and the Ministry of Finance was making progress. The Ministry of Finance
remained cautious, however, about increasing the level of public debt to support monetary
policy, insisting that the responsibility for price stability lay with the BA.



Staff recommended a more active use of interest rates to bolster the long-term effectiveness of
monetary policy. The recent decline in excess liquidity, supported by tight liquidity management,
should create the conditions for interest rates to become a more effective monetary policy tool.
The current monetary policy framework is marked by extremely low interest rates. The six-month
liquidity absorption window introduced in January 2013 carried an interest rate of only
1.5 percent, bringing the average interest rate on repurchase facilities to 0.95 percent. The
discount rate, which banks use as a reference to set loan rates, has not been adjusted since
March 2004. Amid limited supply of t-bills, and given regulatory requirements for insurance
companies to hold government securities, the three-month rate was only 21 basis points in late
October 2013, well below the BA's deposit rate of 30 basis points. The BA should signal its policy
stance more actively through interest rates (both the discount rate and deposit auction facilities),
while a more active t-bill and t-bond issuance policy should bring interest rates on government

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ALGERIA

debt securities to more normal levels. Although the authorities agreed that interest rates would
play a useful signaling role, they questioned the effectiveness of raising them in an environment
of excess liquidity. Nevertheless, they saw scope for more active monetary policy if excess
liquidity tapers as expected.
Box 4. Enhancing the Effectiveness of Monetary Policy Transmission Channels in Algeria
The 2012 surge in inflation highlighted the challenges faced by monetary policy in an environment of
excess liquidity and limited financial sector development. The BA has three policy instruments under the
current framework: liquidity management tools, the interest rate, and the exchange rate. Excess liquidity has
led the BA to give up using the rediscount rate as a signaling instrument, and to adjust only marginally and
infrequently the rates on deposit facilities. The exchange rate is assigned to preserving competitiveness, but
has been on occasion implicitly used to contain price pressures. Consequently, required reserves and deposit
facilities are the main policy instruments. An empirical analysis over 2001Q1–2013Q2 suggests that
transmission channels (credit, market rates, and money) are operative, but weak. This weakness results in
monetary policy impulses having only a limited impact on the BA’s final targets of growth and inflation.
To improve the effectiveness of monetary policy, wide ranging structural reforms are needed to:


Adapt the macroeconomic policy framework to an environment of excess liquidity: The major structural
impediment to an effective monetary policy lies in the combination of excess liquidity and a lack of
savings instruments. To reduce the supply of liquidity the national oil company could be allowed to hold
part of its resources in foreign exchange, either domestically or internationally. A more proactive
borrowing policy by the Ministry of Finance, perhaps backed by a full-fledged hydrocarbon savings rule,
would also help absorb excess liquidity, support the development of financial markets, bring liquid
resources back to the financial sector, and unclog the interest rate transmission channel.



Provide the right signals to the markets: The interest rate needs to be used more proactively. Changes in
the auction facilities rate should be accompanied by changes in the discount rate to ensure the passthrough of monetary policy through bank lending and borrowing rates. To improve the role of the
exchange rate as a transmission channel, measures should be taken to diversify the supply of foreign
exchange, notably by easing repatriation and surrender requirements and by lifting the tight de facto
required reserve ratio on banks’ foreign exchange deposits.



Create the conditions for financial sector deepening: Government intervention through interest subsidies
has increased significantly since 2009. This discourages capital market deepening by removing
incentives for enterprises to finance themselves outside of the banking sector. Subsidies should be
reviewed, the performance of subsidized credits carefully monitored, and provisions made for existing
schemes to lapse. The ban on consumer credit needs to be lifted, the development of credit registries
stepped up, and measures to facilitate access to credit by SMEs (such as an efficient guarantee system)
adopted. To curb the use of cash in the economy, the use of checks and electronic means of payments
in transactions with administration and public services and large payments should be mandatory. To
develop capital markets, the capital of large SOEs and state-owned banks should be opened. Corporate
bond issuance by large SOEs could also be encouraged, as a complement to banking credit, to finance
large investments.

15.
A larger supply of savings instruments is needed to curb inflationary pressures and
breathe life into the financial market. In 2012, the lack of savings instruments (aside from time
and current deposits), in the context of rapidly increasing household income following expansionary
fiscal policy, led to higher consumption and inflationary pressures. It is therefore important to
increase and diversify the supply of savings instruments, notably by developing housing savings—

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

ALGERIA

through the development of mortgage finance instruments and a retrenchment of State
intervention—and capital markets.
16.
The ongoing fiscal consolidation should be pursued beyond 2013. The draft 2014
budget law appropriately limits increases in current spending, while providing for higher capital
spending; however, the main shortcomings are the new increases in the wage bill and the
broadening of tax exemptions. The fiscal position remains vulnerable to a lasting decline in oil prices
and requires further consolidation that should be friendly to inclusive growth and more progressive
in terms of tax and spending.


Tax revenues need to be bolstered, including by eliminating or reducing the most costly tax
exemptions—particularly VAT exemptions. Staff commended the authorities for publishing, in
the context of the 2014 budget law, the cost of tax exemptions, although the methodology
needs to be improved. Staff also recommended that efforts to improve tax administration
continue. The ongoing computerization of the tax administration should also remain a priority.
The restructuring of tax control and collection offices into a smaller number of tax centers
(centres des impôts, CDI) and local tax offices (centres de proximité des impôts, CPI) is moving
forward, but must be accompanied by a strengthening of tax inspection capacities to expand the
tax base and improve collection efforts.



The growth in current spending needs to be contained. Staff recommended controlling wage bill
growth by stabilizing the size of the civil service and anchoring wage growth to productivity
improvements. Current transfers should be stabilized in real terms through subsidy reform
(see below) and improvements in the efficiency of public services. In this regard, the recent
move to set up contractual arrangements with public entities, particularly hospitals, is a step in
the right direction and should support this objective.



Subsidies represent a large share of GDP and should be reviewed, to improve their equity and
effectiveness and reduce their cost to the economy. International experience shows that
subsidies are often costly, inequitable, and a source of economic distortions. The cost of implicit
subsidies for hydrocarbon products amounted to an estimated US$22.2 billion in 2012, or
10.9 percent of GDP. Explicit subsidies cost an additional 5 percent of GDP in 2012. These
subsidies are highly inequitable, as they mostly benefit upper-income groups. Staff
recommended that the prices of subsidized items—particularly those that do not figure
prominently in the consumption basket of poor households—be progressively brought to
market levels. Similarly, the price of those services whose quality has improved through public
investment (such as water and electricity) should be adjusted to reflect these quality upgrades,
while efforts should be made to improve efficiency where needed. The authorities commendably
published the cost of implicit subsidies in the 2014 budget law. The cost of subsidies borne by
SOEs should also be recognized and included in the budget, particularly in light of the recent
increase in credit to SOEs and the history of episodic bailouts. Over time, subsidies should be
eliminated and replaced with a targeted cash-transfer system, which will require a fundamental
reform of the safety net system. The authorities felt the time was not ripe yet for an overhaul of
subsidies.

16

17.
Staff and the authorities agreed that the exchange rate policy should continue to aim
to keep the dinar in line with its equilibrium level. The fiscal consolidation undertaken this year
implies that the equilibrium REER level has depreciated compared to last year. Maintaining the dinar
in line with its equilibrium value therefore serves to enhance the external competitiveness of the
economy. Over the medium term, the deepening of the foreign exchange market would create the
conditions for a more flexible exchange rate.

framework for managing
hydrocarbon wealth does not ensure long-term sustainability. Indeed, the ratio of reserve
imports coverage is expected to decline over the medium term, though it will remain at a
comfortable level.



The foreign exchange market should be developed. To diversify the supply of foreign exchange on
the interbank market, where the BA is currently the main supplier, repatriation and surrender
obligations of export receipts should be relaxed, and the de facto high reserve requirement rate
on foreign currency deposits (100 percent for individuals and 30 percent for firms) should be
lowered. Similarly, the requirement that banks surrender to the BA foreign exchange associated
with inward foreign investment should be relaxed. These measures, combined with the
development of money and capital markets, would also help to establish a forward exchange
market. Finally, the authorities should examine the possibility of boosting competition on the
interbank market by allowing operators engaged in international trade to purchase foreign
currency outside of their paying bank.



Staff and the authorities concurred on the need to eliminate the parallel foreign exchange market
premium, which is a source of distortions in the economy. The dinar is fully convertible for
current transactions, but the existence of a premium for foreign exchange on the illegal parallel
market—which reached 40 percent in November 2013—indicates that a portion of demand is
met on the parallel market. To limit pressures on the parallel market, staff urged the authorities
to significantly raise the indicative forex ceilings for travelers to more realistic levels. In the
longer term, a gradual lifting of capital account restrictions should be envisaged.

18.
The financial sector appears healthy, but the authorities should be mindful of the risks.
The recent FSAP indicates that the financial sector is stable, with the main vulnerability lying in the
concentration of credit risk. The authorities should maintain their efforts to monitor financial
stability, particularly by improving the institutional framework and the quality of the annual report
issued by the BA, and to expand the framework of macro-prudential surveillance. Accelerating the
CAMELS rating exercise and completing it before the end of 2014 will foster the shift to risk-based

banking supervision. The authorities should also enhance financial sector safety nets and establish a
dedicated bank resolution regime. Finally, it is important to introduce a mechanism for cleaning up
old and fully provisioned NPLs.

THEME 2. IMPROVING THE MANAGEMENT OF
HYDROCARBON WEALTH
19.
Under current economic policies and trends, Algeria will deplete its financial savings in
the long term, leaving future generations worse off. Like other resource-rich countries, Algeria
faces the challenge of transforming finite resource wealth into other assets to support sustainable
development and preserve intergenerational equity. Although the country has accumulated
substantial fiscal and external buffers to date, the time horizon for hydrocarbon production is
relatively short, fiscal policy is on an unsustainable path, and the current account surplus is
shrinking. Under baseline assumptions, without policy adjustments, the country could become a net
borrower within 20 years (with a debt-to-GDP ratio above 100 percent by 2050)—or even sooner if
hydrocarbon prices experience a sustained fall.
20.
Staff advised adopting a rule-based fiscal framework to manage hydrocarbon wealth.
International experience suggests that a well-designed fiscal framework can make a significant
contribution to economic growth and stability in resource-rich countries. It can also help preserve
fiscal and external buffers, and protect against political pressure to increase public spending. It could
be particularly useful in Algeria, where fiscal policy has typically been pro-cyclical, reflecting
pressures to spend hydrocarbon wealth when oil prices are high. Under current projections, the
nonhydrocarbon primary deficit (NHPB) is projected to decline as a share of NHGDP, but further
consolidation is necessary to ensure fiscal sustainability and long-term savings for future
generations.1


Staff recommended the adoption of a full-fledged fiscal rule. The current framework, whereby
fiscal savings accumulate in the oil savings fund (FRR) based on a budgeted oil price of
US$ 37 per barrel, is incomplete, since there is no limit to the withdrawal of funds from the FRR
to finance spending, and no limit on the fiscal balance. To protect fiscal savings, an appropriate
fiscal rule should target a primary balance consistent with long-term sustainability and establish
a limit on drawings from the FRR.



Staff applied different models to determine possible paths to fiscal sustainability.2 Under the
permanent income hypothesis (PIH), fiscal sustainability is ensured when a country sustains a

Fiscal sustainability implies targeting a nonresource fiscal balance that can be maintained after resource revenue
runs out.
2

IMF staff has developed a toolkit for designing fiscal rules that aim to smooth revenue volatility and assess longterm fiscal sustainability in resource-rich countries. The toolkit includes intergenerational equity and price-based rule

constant nonhydrocarbon deficit equal to the implicit return on the present value of future
national resource revenue. When applied to Algeria, the PIH rule suggests that a NHPB deficit
equal to 11 percent of NHGDP on a permanent basis would ensure long-term sustainability and
adequate savings for future generations. The consolidation undertaken in 2013 leaves Algeria far
from the PIH benchmark. Indeed, the consolidation required under the PIH approach is
substantial and difficult to implement; therefore, while the PIH would be the first-best rule to
ensure intergenerational equity, a more practical approach is needed.


Another approach is to combine a backward-looking, five-year oil price formula with a 5 percent
floor on the “structural” primary balance and a cap on drawings from the oil savings fund.3 Such
an approach would help Algeria manage revenue volatility stemming from fluctuating
commodity prices, secure comfortable financial savings for the long term, and preserve real
wealth per capita.4 Moreover, it would provide space to increase government debt issuance,
thereby supporting the development of capital markets. Under this rule, placing the NHPB on a
path that converges with the PIH benchmark in 2026 would require (1) an additional
consolidation of 3 percent per year over the medium term and (2) continued fiscal consolidation
in compliance with the fiscal rule over the long term. A consolidation of this magnitude is
ambitious but feasible.

models. See IMF, 2012, “Macroeconomic Policy Frameworks for Resource-Rich Developing Countries,” (Washington
DC: International Monetary Fund).
3

A structural primary balance is defined as the primary balance excluding the cyclical component of resource
revenue. The choice of a price formula implies a trade-off between smoothing expenditures and adjusting to changes
in price trends. Budgets that rely on price formulas with a short backward-looking horizon will better track changes in
prices, but the formulas may result in more volatile spending. In contrast, budgets that rely on price rules with long
backward looking formulas will have smoother expenditure paths but might under- or overshoot actual revenues if
the price trend changes.
4

Staff considered several combinations of price-based rules and structural primary balance targets (see
accompanying selected issues paper). The combination presented here is one possible approach for achieving fiscal
sustainability and long-term savings. The results should be interpreted with caution, however, given uncertainties
regarding Algeria’s resource horizon, future oil prices, long-term GDP growth rates, and other variables. Setting a
primary balance floor greater than 5 percent would safeguard against these uncertainties, and help maintain the real
wealth per capita over the long term. It would also smooth spending at the end of oil production (assumed to be in
2032), after which the floor would need to be adjusted to -1 percent of NHGDP.



Staff recommended that the upcoming organic budget law include provisions for the new fiscal
rule. An automatic correction mechanism could be built into the rule to adjust for ex-post
deviations. An explicit set of escape clauses should also be included to allow for deviations from
the rule under exceptional economic circumstances and avoid amplifying the pro-cyclical
macroeconomic impact of severe shocks. The triggers for escape clauses should be strict, and a
process for reactivating the rule should also be provided for. The authorities agreed in principle
on the relevance of protecting fiscal savings, but they felt that the current price saving rule
served them well. Staff argued that the current rule could be useful, but only if coupled with a
structural primary balance target consistent with long-term sustainability.



A better management of fiscal savings appears possible. The FRR—currently a government
deposit in local currency at the BA—generates low effective average returns by international
standards. During 2008–11, the implicit average annual return, based on dividend payments
from the central bank to the government, was less than 2 percent. Staff suggested that the FRR
could be converted into a sovereign wealth fund, possibly managed by the BA, adhering to best
international practices, and targeting a range of objectives, including macro-fiscal management
and savings for future generations. The sovereign wealth fund resources should not be used for
off-budget and guarantee operations. The authorities, however, cautioned that Algeria lacks the
political buy-in and specific technical skills necessary to establish a sovereign wealth fund at this
time.

21.
Staff welcomed the progress in strengthening the fiscal framework to leverage the
hydrocarbon windfall. The medium-term budget framework (MTBF) and performance-based
budgeting are expected to come into effect in 2016, with a transition period beginning in 2015. Staff
encouraged the authorities to set up medium-term budget envelopes for line ministries and identify
performance-based programs as soon as the 2015 budget law, and agreed with the authorities that
it will be important to ensure consistency between the upcoming five-year public investment
program and the MTBF. Staff also welcomed the ongoing rationalization—and scheduled regular
updates—of program authorizations, which should improve the management of capital spending.

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ALGERIA

Similarly, consistent issuance of budget review laws within two years following the end of the fiscal
year is good practice that could be bolstered by shortening the complementary period. In support
of what has been achieved so far, the introduction of an integrated financial management
information system should be a priority for the budget office. Staff recommended that Algeria apply
principles of transparency and accountability on natural resource revenue similar to EITI principles.
The authorities were open to publishing a detailed account of hydrocarbon revenues in the draft
budget law report and listing them as executed in the budget review law.
22.

Structural reforms in the hydrocarbon sector would support a sound fiscal framework.



Extending the time horizon for hydrocarbon production and increasing exports will require more
foreign investment in the oil and gas industry. The last three oil and gas licensing rounds drew
limited interest from foreign investors. Since then, the authorities have adopted a new
hydrocarbon law with more favorable terms, but security concerns have increased following the
terrorist attack in January 2013, and the requirement that the state-owned oil company retain a
minimum 51 percent stake in any hydrocarbon project remains in place. To attract more
investment, reforms to improve the business environment are necessary, and careful preparation
is needed to ensure the success of the planned 2014 licensing rounds.



To support hydrocarbon exports growth, domestic consumption needs to be contained. Energy
subsidies should be progressively eliminated and energy efficiency strengthened. The use of
renewable energy sources would also help achieve this objective. Finally, the authorities should
develop a strategy for diversifying export markets, especially for gas.

findings pointing out that Algeria is lagging behind comparators in terms of capital
accumulation and productivity.5 It is therefore critical to preserve capital spending, while
enhancing its efficiency. Investment decisions should yield a positive rate of social return, while
ongoing efforts to improve the planning, implementation, monitoring, and maintenance of
public investment projects should be strengthened.


Efforts to improve competitiveness and the business climate need to be intensified. Algeria has
traditionally ranked low in competitiveness surveys, such as the World Economic Forum’s Global
Competitiveness Report and the World Bank’s Doing Business rankings. Reforms to the business
climate should be accelerated, particularly by streamlining administrative procedures,
introducing efficient "one-stop shops," and eliminating the requirement of a minimum
51 percent Algerian ownership in foreign investments—or at least limiting it to strategic sectors.
Staff also urged that measures be taken to address the country's competitive disadvantages in
other critical areas, including rapidly rising unit labor costs, onerous taxes on businesses, and
elevated import and export costs (Box 5).



To enhance economic growth, higher productivity is needed. Algeria’s limited economic openness
hampers technology transfers. Progress towards WTO accession is critical and needs to be
complemented by a more active export promotion policy and by measures to facilitate trade
transactions. Similarly, Algeria’s restrictive FDI regime undermines the country’s attractiveness to
FDI and limits technology transfers. In addition to measures geared towards more openness, the
authorities should design policies to improve the quality and relevance of education and
training, foster innovation and entrepreneurship, develop the ICT industry, and promote its
integration into the economy.

Box 5. Price Competitiveness in Algeria
Improving Algeria’s competitiveness is critical for developing a strong nonhydrocarbon sector.
Although Algeria has achieved macroeconomic stability thanks to prudent management of its natural
resource endowment, the dominant role of the hydrocarbon sector has led to a lack of diversification that
has exposed the economy to oil prices shocks and has failed to generate enough jobs to address high levels
of unemployment. Despite low domestic energy prices, Algeria’s economy is highly uncompetitive,
contributing to an underdeveloped private sector.
Implicit subsidies allow Algeria to maintain a competitive advantage with respect to the domestic
prices of hydrocarbon products. As part of a policy to share the country’s natural resource wealth, the
Algerian government has kept the prices of hydrocarbon products at levels below international market
prices. This policy of implicit subsidies has resulted in some of the lowest prices for hydrocarbon products in
the world. The advantages of cheap energy, however, must be weighed against the hidden costs, including
foregone revenue, increased domestic consumption of hydrocarbons, and smuggling.
Other indicators highlight areas where Algeria is at a competitive disadvantage. Over the period
2005–10, Algerian unit labor costs increased by 50 percent, exceeding gains in OECD countries (on average),
as growth in wages surpassed productivity gains. Starting a business is time-consuming and expensive, and
business taxes and other administrative costs are the most onerous in the region. Notwithstanding the
country’s advantageous location on the Mediterranean Sea, export and import costs are high. The
information and communication technology sector is relatively underdeveloped and costly, and
transportation costs are elevated.

in productivity. To reduce the cost of starting and operating a business, the government should streamline
administrative procedures, improve the efficiency of one-stop shops, and reform the TAP business tax, by
replacing it with excises, notably on high-rent sectors. Reducing export and import costs will require reforms
to lower port and terminal fees and streamline administrative procedures, including by creating one-stop
shops. To accelerate development and reduce costs in the ICT sector, the government needs to attract more
foreign investment and generate more competition.

34 years old, compared to 43 percent of the male
population, reflecting the relatively recent participation of women in the labor market. Most women are
looking for steadier work, and 15.5 percent are looking for a position that would better suit their skills
(compared to 8.3 percent for men), suggesting a possible higher skills mismatch for women, or higher
aspirations.
Improving labor market prospects for women would increase the supply of labor, with a positive
impact on potential growth. Low education, care duties, the lack of flexibility in working arrangements,
and the lack of preschool care are among the most common determinants of women under-employment. In
Algeria, progress in female education and relatively high preschool enrollment rates are supporting labor
force participation and employment, but other constraints should be lifted. Active labor market policies
should also include programs aimed at women, to improve their access to capital and employment.
Simulations suggest that cutting by half the number of stay-at-home women would add about 4 million
workers to the labor force. Assuming a gradual absorption over 10 years in the nonhydrocarbon sector, the
impact on nonhydrocarbon potential growth would be about 0.3 percentage points per year.

Employment data released in December 2013 indicate that female unemployment continued to decline
between 2011 and 2013 (by 0.9 points), while participation improved, to 16.6 percent.

Faster development of the financial sector is needed to support economic growth. Staff
urged the authorities to heed the main recommendations of the recent FSAP mission, which
identified priorities for financial sector development (Appendix III).


Staff encouraged the authorities to establish conditions for healthy growth of credit to the private
sector, notably to SMEs. The development of credit bureaus and their extension to households
should be stepped up. The ban on consumer credit should be lifted, and prudential measures
designed to prevent the build-up of risks for households should be implemented. More
generally, banking sector competition ought to be encouraged, to provide incentives for banks
to service SMEs and to diversify and expand the range of banking services. Progress in these
areas would be supported by improvements in the insolvency regime and by strengthening the
collateral and guarantees regime. Finally, the welcome expansion of housing finance would
further benefit from the government's withdrawal from housing purchase and lending programs.
The authorities expressed interest in options to contain the risks from consumer credit growth,
and indicated their intention to partially lift the ban on consumer credit. In their view, lack of
competition in the banking sector was not a major hindrance to the development of the
financial sector.



Microfinance programs are mostly government-operated and leave little room for the private
sector. These programs, which include ANGEM, ANSEJ and CNAC, have helped a large number of
micro-entrepreneurs start businesses. However, the programs should be reviewed to assess their
effectiveness and identify needs for adjustments, particularly with respect to NPLs. Moreover,
the authorities could introduce a framework to encourage private micro-finance.



Underdeveloped capital markets prevent large savings from being efficiently channeled to support
economic growth. Staff urged the authorities to swiftly implement their decision to list a number
of SOEs on the local stock exchange, which could jumpstart stock market development. Along
with stock market development, a more active use of sovereign bond auctions, as well as the
removal of existing disincentives to corporate securities issuance, would support the
development of both primary and secondary bond markets.



The authorities should take the necessary steps to remove Algeria from the FATF's gray list. In
October 2013, the FATF identified Algeria as a “jurisdiction with strategic AML/CFT deficiencies
not making sufficient progress” in addressing the shortcomings in its framework for combating
the financing of terrorism, and called upon its members to take into consideration the risks
associated with these deficiencies. The authorities have issued a decree freezing the assets of
persons on the UN Security Council's list, and have begun the process of amending
Article 87-bis of the Penal Code concerning the definition of terrorist acts. Staff urged the
authorities to step up the promulgation of this change in the law.

25.
Labor market reforms are necessary to address high unemployment rates among
youth and women. Employment rates remain low for these groups despite their access to
employment remaining a priority for the authorities. Policies are needed to promote private sector
growth, enhance the acquisition of relevant skills through the development of an education for

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

ALGERIA

employment plan, and reduce labor market rigidities, particularly in terms of employer
contributions. These policies should be complemented with active labor market policies to provide
incentives for employers to hire youth and women, support the retraining of the unemployed,
improve intermediation on the labor market, and help these groups to start their own businesses.
Moreover, given the high economic cost of low participation rates among women (Box 6), the
authorities should review the options for bolstering women's participation in the labor market.
These measures would contribute to consolidating the progress made over the past decade in
reducing inequality.

STAFF APPRAISAL
26.
The economy stabilized in 2013 but long-term vulnerabilities are materializing.
Inflation has subsided following monetary tightening and fiscal consolidation, external and fiscal
buffers are large, and the banking sector is solvent and liquid. However, the economy’s vulnerability
to developments in the hydrocarbon sector persists. Declining hydrocarbon production and surging
domestic consumption are squeezing export volumes, compounding long-standing risks from lower
oil prices. The economy is insufficiently diversified, and the conditions for high-productivity, private
sector-led growth are lacking. Policies should focus on consolidating macro-financial stability, better
managing natural resources, and undertaking structural reforms to accelerate economic growth and
job creation.
27.
The monetary and fiscal policy mix should guard against a renewed rise in inflation.
The recent surge in credit to the economy, as well as the planned increase in current spending in
2014, could revive inflationary pressures. The BA should stand ready to further mop up excess
liquidity and use interest rates more actively. New increases in current spending should be avoided,
and the Ministry of Finance should rely more on debt issuance and less on drawings from the FRR to
finance the budget deficit.
28.
The fiscal consolidation initiated in 2013 is welcome, but further efforts are needed.
The wage bill should be contained by freezing the size of the civil service. Subsidies should be
gradually phased out and replaced by a targeted cash-transfer system to protect the poor. Transfers
to public entities should be stabilized in real terms, and tax exemptions reduced. To protect
economic growth, capital spending should be preserved and its efficiency and effectiveness
enhanced.
29.
To better manage hydrocarbon revenue volatility and ensure fiscal sustainability,
Algeria should adopt a full-fledged fiscal rule. A fiscal rule based on a five-year average,
backward-looking oil price, combined with a limit on the structural primary balance, would ensure
savings for future generations and improve the management of volatile hydrocarbon revenue.
Transforming the oil fund into a sovereign wealth fund and setting annual ceilings for drawings from
the fund in the budget law would also support fiscal sustainability. Public financial management
needs to be improved. In this area, the authorities have committed to establishing a medium-term
budget framework as well as sector performance-based budget programs. Future reforms should

26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ALGERIA

include increasing the transparency of hydrocarbon revenue collection and developing an
integrated financial management information system.
30.
Enhancing net hydrocarbon exports is critical for fiscal and external sustainability.
Increasing hydrocarbon production and extending the time horizon of reserves will require more
investment. FDI restrictions should be relaxed, the business environment needs to be improved, and
the national oil company’s investment plans should be implemented without delay. Phasing out
implicit subsidies would help contain domestic energy consumption and support exports.
31.
The authorities should avoid exchange-rate overvaluation and deepen the official
foreign exchange market. Staff estimates the dinar to be somewhat on the strong side, despite a
sizeable depreciation of the currency in recent months. The authorities should continue to target the
equilibrium real effective exchange rate to protect the competitiveness of nonhydrocarbon exports.
The BA should deepen the inter-bank foreign exchange market by relaxing repatriation and
surrender obligations, and by reducing the de facto high reserve requirement rate on foreign
currency. The premium in the illegal parallel exchange market is detrimental to growth and should
be forcefully tackled by the central bank. Furthermore, the indicative foreign exchange ceilings for
travelers should be increased to more realistic levels.
32.
The financial sector is stable, but reforms are needed to support its development. The
authorities should build on the FSAP recommendations to preserve the stability of the financial
sector and foster its development. The authorities should prevent segmentation in the banking
sector, speed up the development of credit bureaus, revisit guarantee mechanisms, and strengthen
collateral and insolvency regimes. The ban on consumer lending should be lifted, and more space
provided for mortgage finance. Capital market development would benefit from more sovereign
debt issuance and the listing of well-performing state-owned enterprises on the stock exchange.
Disincentives to private sector debt and equity issuance should be removed. The authorities should
also take immediate steps to address deficiencies in their AML/CFT framework.
33.
Accelerating economic growth and job creation will require wide-ranging structural
reforms. Algeria’s macroeconomic stability is commendable, but economic growth is insufficient to
reduce unemployment, especially among youth and women. Broad structural reforms are necessary
to unleash private-sector led growth. These include improving the business environment, enhancing
cost competitiveness, and relaxing the restrictive FDI regime. Deeper trade integration through WTO
accession would create new markets for exports and foster competition. Reforms are needed to
increase labor market flexibility and ensure that job seekers are equipped with the right skills.
34.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

Appendix I. Real Effective Exchange Rate Analysis
The real effective exchange rate appears to be on the strong side, despite recent efforts to offset the
real appreciation incurred in 2012.
1.
The REER appreciated 8.3 percent
between April 2011 and June 2013, mainly
reflecting higher relative inflation in Algeria. The
REER increased sharply in the first half of 2012 as
inflation spiked to as high as 11.0 percent yearon-year in April. It reversed some of these gains
in the middle months of 2012, but resumed its
appreciating trend toward the end of the year. In
2013, the REER appreciated slightly in the first
half of the year before depreciating 6.2 percent
in recent months, reflecting the decline in
inflation as well as a depreciation of the NEER.

2.
The exchange rate is somewhat strong compared to Algeria’s macroeconomic
fundamentals. The REER was assessed using three complementary methodologies developed by
the Consultative Group on Exchange Rates (CGER). The results suggest that the dinar is somewhat
on the strong side.

In 2018 (percent of GDP).

3.
Macroeconomic balance approach. The macroeconomic balance approach calculates the
difference between Algeria’s underlying current account and an estimated current account norm
based on projected values of medium-term economic fundamentals. The exchange rate adjustment
that would eliminate this difference is then calculated using an estimated elasticity of the current
account with respect to the real exchange rate. Algeria’s current account norm using this approach
is estimated to be 4.4 percent of GDP. This compares to a projected current account deficit of
-2.5 percent of GDP in 2018, suggesting some overvaluation of the dinar.
4.
External sustainability approach. The external sustainability approach calculates the
difference between the underlying current account balance and the balance that would stabilize net
foreign assets (NFA) at some benchmark level. Using the same elasticity as in the macroeconomic
balance approach, the exchange rate misalignment is equal to the adjustment necessary to bring the

underlying current account in line with its NFA-stabilizing level. The current account balance
necessary to stabilize Algeria’s NFA-to-GDP ratio at its 2012 level (93 percent) is estimated to be
5.1 percent, suggesting once again that the dinar is somewhat on the strong side.
5.
Equilibrium real exchange rate approach.
The equilibrium real exchange rate approach
directly estimates an equilibrium exchange rate as a
function of medium-term fundamentals. The
exchange rate adjustment needed to restore
equilibrium over the medium term is then calculated
as the difference between the estimated equilibrium
real exchange rate and its current value. The REER in
October 2013 was 3.0 percent above its estimated
equilibrium value.

2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over German bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

B. Nonfinancial Relations
Exchange Rate Arrangement
6.
From January 21, 1974 to October 1, 1994, the exchange rate of the dinar was determined
on the basis of a fixed relationship with a basket of currencies, adjusted from time to time. On
October 1, 1994, the Bank of Algeria introduced a managed float for the dinar through daily fixing
sessions that included six commercial banks. This system has been replaced by an interbank foreign
exchange market as of January 2, 1996. On December 12, 2013, the average of the buying and
selling rates for the U.S. dollar was US$ 1 = DZD 78.21, equivalent to SDR 1 = DZD 120.15. No
margin limits are imposed on the buying and selling exchange rates in the interbank foreign
exchange market, except for a margin of DA 0.015 between the buying and selling rates of the Bank
of Algeria for the dinar against the U.S. dollar.
7.
The de facto exchange regime is classified as other managed arrangement with no
preannounced path for the exchange rate. Full surrender requirements are in effect on hydrocarbon
export proceeds. Limits on the making of payments for invisible transactions and current transfers,
which have remained in place since Algeria accepted the obligations of Article VIII, sections 2(a), 3,
and 4, in 1997, are indicative according to the authorities. Inward direct investment is generally free
of restrictions but a 49 percent foreign ownership limit has been introduced in December 2009;
controls are maintained on other capital account payments and transfers.
Latest Article IV Consultation
The discussions for the 2012 Article IV consultation with Algeria were held in Algiers during
October 29—November 11, 2012. The Staff Report (IMF Country Report 13/47) was discussed by the
Executive Board on January 16, 2013 and published on February 2013.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts: Following STA recommendations, the NSO is now compiling annual national
accounts (ANA) at prior year prices. The ANA broadly follow the 1993 SNA recommendations, but
nonprofit institutions serving households are not taken into account. Work is ongoing to compile
QNA.
Price Statistics: Data are published with a delay of less than one month.

Government finance statistics: Key shortcomings include insufficient institutional coverage
(coverage is limited to Budgetary Central Government, albeit in a wide sense, including the general
budget, the annexed budget, and the special treasury accounts), classification problems, long lags for
production of statistics, and lack of reconciliation of financing with the monetary accounts. Key
factors behind these weaknesses include the lack of financial resources allocated to the compilation
of statistics, insufficient interagency coordination, and concern about accuracy that give rise to
reluctance to publish provisional data.

Monetary statistics: Monetary statistics compiled by the authorities are largely in line with the
methodology in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual, 2000 and its companion Compilation
Guide, 2008. Timeliness of reporting by state-owned commercial banks has significantly improved
over the last two years; consequently, data on depository corporations—as well as finance
companies—are usually available within a period of two to three months. Reporting formats (balance
sheet and appendices) applied to commercial banks and finance companies were updated in 2009
and the updated version was enforced in 2010. All respondents now provide all requested data, thus
making the monetary statistics more meaningful than before. Data on insurance corporations are not
yet collected, but the Banque d'Algérie, with the continuing support of the IMF Statistics
Department, launched in 2009 a project to this end.

Balance of payments: Balance of payments statistics are generally of good quality. International
investment position data are not available, mainly because of capacity issues in compiling FDI stocks.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Algeria began participation in the General Data

No data ROSC is available.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Algeria
On January 27, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Algeria without a meeting.2
Economic performance in 2013 has been satisfactory. Inflation, which reached 8.9 percent last year,
has decelerated significantly in 2013 thanks to fiscal consolidation and prudent monetary policy. Real
gross domestic product (GDP) growth is expected to slow to 2.7 percent in 2013 from 3.3 percent in
2012, reflecting a continued decline in hydrocarbon sector output and lower public spending,
somewhat offset by the strong growth of private demand and investment by state-owned
enterprises. However, Algeria’s external position, though still very strong, has started to weaken. The
current account surplus is expected to narrow to 1.1 percent of GDP in 2013, as robust domestic
hydrocarbon consumption, together with declining prices, weighs on hydrocarbon exports and
import growth remains sizeable. Risks are tilted to the downside: Algeria is vulnerable to a prolonged
decline in oil prices, a worsening of the global environment, further pressure on the hydrocarbon
rent, and an intensification of regional tensions. Outward spillovers are likely to be limited. Algeria
faces a number of challenges. Despite stabilization in 2013, new inflationary pressures may arise
following the recent surge in credit and a new increase in public sector wages. Fiscal and external
vulnerabilities to developments in the hydrocarbon sector are worsening, as the domestic
consumption drag on export volumes is compounding the longstanding risk related to lower oil
prices. In addition, notwithstanding the ongoing consolidation, fiscal policy is not on a sustainable
path. It is de facto pro-cyclical, and the non-hydrocarbon primary deficit is well above its long-term
sustainable level, implying negative net public savings in the long run. Finally, shortcomings in
competitiveness and productivity are weighing on economic growth, which remains below its
potential and below the level required to significantly reduce unemployment, especially for youth

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.
2

Article IV consultations are concluded without a Board meeting when the following conditions apply: (i) there are
no acute or significant risks, or general policy issues requiring Board discussion; (ii) policies or circumstances are
unlikely to have significant regional or global impact; (iii) in the event a parallel program review is being completed,
it is also being completed on a lapse-of-time basis; and (iv) the use of Fund resources is not under discussion or
anticipated.

and women. Although stable, the financial sector is underdeveloped, constraining access to
financing, in particular for small- and medium-sized enterprises.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2013 Article IV consultation with Algeria, Executive directors endorsed staff’s
appraisal, as follows:
Algeria’s economic performance, marked notably by the decline in inflation, unemployment and
inequality, has been good. However, strong credit growth and another public sector wage increase
call for continued caution over price stability. In addition, the economy’s vulnerability to
developments in the hydrocarbon sector worsened, as declining hydrocarbon production and
surging domestic consumption are squeezing export volumes, compounding the longstanding risk
of lower oil prices. Finally, unemployment remained high among youth and women. Against this
background, the authorities are encouraged to take measures to consolidate macroeconomic and
financial stability, ensure long-term fiscal sustainability, and promote strong private sector-led nonhydrocarbon growth and robust job creation.
The decline in inflation brought about by monetary tightening and fiscal consolidation is welcome.
However, the recent surge in credit to the economy, together with the planned increase in current
spending in 2014, could revive inflationary pressures, and the Banque d’Algérie should stand ready
to increase liquidity absorption and raise interest rates if needed. Avoiding new increases in current
spending, and financing the budget deficit by issuing debt rather than by drawings from the oil fund,
would also help.
The fiscal consolidation initiated in 2013 should continue in order to ensure fiscal sustainability. This
implies containing the wage bill; gradually phasing out subsidies while establishing a targeted cashtransfer system to protect the poor; stabilizing transfers to public entities in real terms; and reducing
tax exemptions. To protect economic growth, it will be important to preserve capital spending and
enhance its efficiency and effectiveness.
Algeria should adopt a full-fledged fiscal rule to better manage hydrocarbon revenue volatility and
attain fiscal sustainability. A fiscal rule using a backward-looking average oil price and setting a limit
on the structural primary balance consistent with long-run fiscal sustainability would improve the
management of hydrocarbon revenue. Further, the oil fund could be transformed into a sovereign
wealth fund, and annual ceilings on drawings established to preserve financial savings. To improve
public financial management, the transparency of hydrocarbon revenue collection should be
increased and an integrated financial management information system developed.
Preserving fiscal and external sustainability would call for increasing hydrocarbon production and
extending the time horizon of reserves. It will be important to improve the business environment,
attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the hydrocarbon sector, and swiftly implement the national
oil company’s investment plans. Phasing out implicit subsidies would help contain domestic energy
consumption and support exports.

2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ALGERIA

The authorities should continue targeting the equilibrium real effective exchange rate to protect the
competitiveness of non-hydrocarbon exports. The premium in the illegal parallel exchange market is
detrimental to growth and should be forcefully tackled. Furthermore, there is a case for increasing
the indicative foreign exchange ceilings for travelers to more realistic levels.
The stability of the financial sector is welcome. To support its development, competition in the
banking sector should be fostered, the development of credit bureaus sped up, the guarantee
mechanisms revisited, collateral and insolvency regimes strengthened. The ban on consumer lending
should be lifted, and more space provided for mortgage finance. Issuing more sovereign debt and
listing well-performing state-owned enterprises on the stock exchange, while removing disincentives
to private sector debt and equity issuance, would support the development of capital markets.
Finally, immediate steps need to be taken to address deficiencies in the Anti-Money
Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism framework.
To accelerate economic growth and job creation, wide-ranging structural reforms are needed.
Improving the business environment, enhancing cost competitiveness, and relaxing the restrictive FDI
regime are of particular importance, together with deeper trade integration through WTO accession,
trade facilitation, and export promotion. Reforms are needed to increase labor market flexibility and
ensure that job seekers are equipped with the right skills.
