IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Samoa

The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has concluded the 2015 Article
IV consultation1 with Samoa on June 1.
The Samoan economy is recovering from two natural disasters. A tsunami in September 2009
and a cyclone in December 2012 caused major destruction in agriculture and tourism, the
mainstays of the economy, resulting in growth well below the average of the previous decade.
The reconstruction effort is estimated to have cost about 40 percent of GDP, aided in part by
grants and loans from development partners, including disbursements from the Rapid-Access
Component of the IMF’s Exogenous Shock Facility in 2010, and the Rapid Credit Facility in
2013.
Real GDP growth rebounded to around 2 percent in fiscal year 2013/14 (July to June), supported
by a recovery in agriculture, construction and an expansion of commerce and transportation
services. Consumer price inflation, which was negative for most of 2014, rose to around
6 percent towards the end of the year (yoy) on the back of higher domestic food prices, but
underlying inflation (excluding food, transport and communication) remained stable at around
2 percent. The current account deficit, which had narrowed considerably as economic activity
contracted after the cyclone, widened again to around 8 percent of GDP as imports recovered
while exports lagged. Gross international reserves rose to 4 months of prospective imports of
goods and services, an adequate level according to standard metrics, although low in comparison
to other Pacific island countries.
The banking system and public financial institutions were affected by the natural disasters.
Credit growth collapsed in 2012, but has recently recovered to around 6 percent as public
financial institutions extended loans to aid in the recovery and banks positioned themselves for

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

the entrance of a large regional competitor into the market. A recent financial sector assessment
program (FSAP) mission found that commercial banks are liquid and report high capitalization,
but non-performing loans are rising, and part of the banking system may be vulnerable to further
shocks. The mission also found that some public financial institutions are vulnerable to shocks
due to low asset quality and weak loan portfolios.
Real GDP growth is expected to rise further to 2.6 percent in fiscal year 2014/15, supported by
the hosting of the Third United Nations Conference on Small Island Developing States (SIDS)
which took place in Apia in September 2014. The rebuilding of the national airport, and the
decline in oil prices are also expected to support economic activity. Higher growth will support
the government’s efforts to begin to consolidate its fiscal position after years of reconstruction.
Higher revenues and a gradual containment of current expenditure are expected to bring the
fiscal deficit down to 3.6 percent of GDP from 5.3 percent of GDP in 2013/14. The current
account deficit is expected to narrow again, mainly due to a recovery in tourism and lower oil
import payments. A loose monetary policy has supported the recovery, and the nominal
exchange rate has been stable.
In the medium-term, the economy is expected to grow at around 2 percent, supported by an
expansion of agriculture and tourism. However, 2016/17 may see a contraction, as a major
manufacturing employer plans to close its harness assembly operation. The government is
expected to continue gradually reducing the fiscal deficit to around 0.5 percent of GDP, to bring
the public debt down from its current level of 55 percent of GDP to the target of 50 percent of
GDP by 2020. Fiscal consolidation and a pick-up in exports and tourism are expected to keep the
current account deficit at around 5 percent of GDP. The main risk to this scenario is another
natural disaster, but slower growth of Samoa’s main trading partners could also materially affect
the medium-term growth path. Failure to deal with vulnerabilities in public financial institutions
and banks could also lead to financial distress, especially in the event of another natural disaster.
Delays in implementing structural reforms could also lead to anemic growth in the medium term.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities for maintaining macroeconomic stability and
rekindling growth in the aftermath of two large natural disasters. Directors noted, however, that
growth is likely to remain moderate and subject to downside risks from Samoa’s susceptibility to
natural disasters and slower trading partner growth. Rising contingent liabilities in some public
financial institutions (PFIs) also pose a risk to fiscal and debt sustainability. Directors
underscored the need to bolster economic resilience and mitigate vulnerabilities by strengthening

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

the financial sector, boosting fiscal and external buffers, and implementing growth-enhancing
structural reforms.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to reduce the fiscal deficit, and called for
decisive actions to achieve consolidation and reduce the public debt to a more sustainable level,
in line with the target of 50 percent of GDP by 2020. They encouraged the authorities to restrain
current expenditure and to sustain recent improvements in revenue administration, with care
taken to safeguard priority health, social, and investment spending. Maintaining the reform
momentum to improve the performance of PFIs and state-owned enterprises should also help to
mitigate fiscal risks posed by sizeable contingent liabilities.
Directors considered the current monetary policy stance to be appropriate, but stressed that the
central bank should stand ready to adopt a tightening stance, if warranted. They noted that the
exchange rate is consistent with economic fundamentals, and that reserves appear to be adequate
according to standard metrics, although lower than in peer countries. Directors advised that a
higher reserve level would enhance economic resilience, achieved primarily through
competitiveness-enhancing structural reforms.
Directors were encouraged by the ongoing implementation of the recommendations of the recent
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), and supported the request for Fund technical
assistance in this regard. Reforms aim to improve on-site supervision, prudential regulations and
oversight, and bank resolution and crisis management. Efforts to strengthen the AML/CFT
framework should also continue.
Directors acknowledged the important role played by PFIs in the economic recovery, but
cautioned that past lending had compromised asset quality in some institutions, while also
contributing to government contingent liabilities. They agreed that as the economy strengthens,
the mandate of PFIs should more narrowly focus on key sectors of the economy, consistent with
their existing mandates. The governance and transparency of PFI operations should also be
improved to facilitate the development of private financial markets.
Directors emphasized that continued structural reforms would be vital to fostering private sector
development and economic diversification, and lifting Samoa’s growth potential. They
welcomed the authorities’ reform agenda, which focuses on developing agriculture, facilitating
business activity and tourism, and improving access to finance. Directors noted the particular
importance of making customary land more accessible for collateral use, and deepening financial
intermediation.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Outlook and risks. Growth is recovering gradually from natural disasters and inflation
remains subdued. The current account deficit is expected to narrow on lower
international oil prices and a planned fiscal consolidation. The main external risk is the
occurrence of another natural disaster in the presence of already high public debt and
vulnerabilities in financial institutions. The main domestic risks center around a delay in
rebuilding macroeconomic buffers, in particular through fiscal consolidation, reforms of
public financial institutions and financial oversight.
Improving financial resilience. A recent financial sector assessment program (FSAP)
mission identified risks in some commercial banks and public financial institutions (PFIs).
The role of PFIs needs to be refocused to reduce contingent liabilities for public finances
and to support the development of private financial markets. Regulation and supervision
of financial institutions needs to be improved to reduce the risk of an adverse feedback
loop from banks and PFIs to the public finances in case of another external shock.
Rebuilding macroeconomic buffers. A gradual fiscal consolidation is planned to
reduce public debt to the target of 50 percent of GDP by 2020, mainly through
improvements in revenue and a reduction in current expenditure. While there is no
significant evidence of misalignment, and reserves are adequate by standard metrics, a
stronger external position with higher reserves would provide greater resilience.
Boosting growth. The authorities’ structural reform initiatives emphasize a revitalization
of agriculture and food processing, tourism, and an enabling environment for business.
Reforms to SOE governance are beginning to bear fruit, but the government should stay
the course in planned privatizations and amendments to legislation to reduce the
burden of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) on the public finances. Improvements in
financial infrastructure will improve the flow and allocation of credit.

CONTEXT
1.
Samoa is one of the most remote Pacific islands, subject to natural disasters. It is
dependent on tourism, remittances and development aid. It has a strong record of macroeconomic
management, and before the global financial crisis was one of the fastest growing Pacific island
countries. A tsunami in September 2009 and cyclone Evan in December 2012 caused major
destruction, and prompted the government to request disbursements under the Rapid-Access
Component of the Exogenous Shock Facility in 2010 and the Rapid Credit Facility in 2013.
Reconstruction is estimated to have cost 40 percent of GDP and added about 15 percent of GDP to
Samoa’s external debt (Box 1).
2.
Macroeconomic stability has been maintained in the face of external shocks and
growth is recovering, but risks have accumulated. Debt (mostly external) rose rapidly from
30 percent of GDP in 2008 to 55 percent in 2014, well above the authorities’ medium-term target of
50 percent of GDP. In addition, a subsidized lending program through the public financial
institutions (PFIs) and government guaranteed debt in the state-owned enterprises (SOEs) represent
contingent liabilities for the public debt.
3.
A recent financial sector assessment program (FSAP) mission identified vulnerabilities
that could add to these risks. The mission found that commercial banks are liquid and report high
capitalization, but non-performing loans are rising, and part of the banking system is vulnerable to
further shocks. The mission also found that some PFIs are vulnerable to shocks due to low asset
quality and weak loan portfolios. Any distress in local commercial banks could require public funds,
further impacting the government debt.
4.
Policies are broadly in line with past Fund advice, although implementation was
interrupted by cyclone Evan in 2013. A fiscal consolidation was initiated in 2012/13, but was
delayed by a rise in expenditures related to reconstruction, and the public debt rose. The authorities
have now retaken plans for a fiscal consolidation to reduce the public debt. The exchange rate has
remained stable and monetary policy has supported the recovery. Structural reforms have moved
forward in some areas, including in the management of public finances and SOE reforms, and some
progress has been made towards laying the groundwork for the use of customary lands as collateral.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK AND RISKS
A. Recent Developments
5.
Growth is recovering and core inflation remains subdued. Real GDP expanded by around
2 percent in fiscal year 2013/14 (July to June), supported by reconstruction activities, a rapid
expansion in commerce and transportation services related to preparations for the United Nations
Small Island Developing States (SIDS) conference, which took place in September 2014, and a
recovery in agriculture (Figure 1). Inflation rose recently on the back of higher food prices, but
underlying inflation (excluding food, transport and communication) remains stable at around
2 percent.

Box 1. Samoa: Effect of Recent Natural Disasters on Debt1
Using a synthetic control approach indicates that
the tsunami in 2009 was responsible for an
increase in debt of 10 percent of GDP, while the
recent cyclone in 2012 led to another 5 percent
of GDP increase.
On average, Samoa has been hit by a major
natural disaster once every five years.2
Recent natural disasters in Samoa required
reconstruction costs of 40 percent of GDP
(23 percent of GDP for the tsunami in 2009 and
17 percent of GDP for cyclone Evan in 2012).

A synthetic control approach can evaluate the
impact of these natural disasters on external
debt.3 This approach uses a panel of countries that
have not been hit by natural disasters, but have
similar observable characteristics, to create a synthetic
comparator or control. By comparing changes in the
external debt-to-GDP ratio between Samoa and the
synthetic control, the methodology can assess the
impact of natural disasters.

external debt. The gap of the external debt–to-GDP
ratio between Samoa and the synthetic control hovers around 10 percentage points after the
tsunami in 2009 and widens to 15 percent after the cyclone. This suggests that, in order to create
a cushion for another natural disaster, Samoa’s debt target should aim at 40 percent of GDP over
the longer term, given the authorities’ medium-term debt ceiling of 50 percent of GDP.

The external current account deficit widened as the economy recovered, but reserves
remain adequate. Following cyclone Evan, the external current account widened to 8 percent of
GDP in 2013/14 as imports rose while exports lagged following damage to infrastructure and crops
from the cyclone (Figure 2). At the same time tourism and remittances remained largely flat
(although they have begun to pick up recently). Foreign inflows of capital grants and direct
investment helped boost reserves, which rose to 4 months of prospective imports of goods and
non-factor services in 2014.
7.
The authorities have run a very accommodative macroeconomic policy to cushion the
effects of the global financial crisis and two natural disasters. The fiscal deficit deteriorated
sharply after 2008 and has remained above 5 percent (except in 2012/13). For 2013/14, tax revenue
increased by 1 percent of GDP thanks to improved administration, but expenditure remained above
historical levels due to reconstruction efforts and preparations for the SIDS conference. As a result,
the fiscal deficit reached 5.3 percent of GDP in 2013/14 (GFS 2001) (Figure 3). Monetary policy has
also remained accommodative, with the policy rate at the zero lower bound since 2010. Samoa’s
exchange rate, which is pegged against a basket of major trading partner currencies, has remained
broadly stable.
8.
PFIs have become increasingly important suppliers of credit. Despite ample liquidity,
commercial bank credit growth was negative throughout most of 2012-14, as banks were repairing
their balance sheets after natural disasters. As a result, the government directed PFIs to refinance
SOE loans with commercial banks. More recently, bank credit has recovered due to a number of
large one-off transactions, but underlying growth remains anemic (Figure 4). PFIs have also supplied
credit to the economy for reconstruction. They control about 40 percent of all credit to the economy
and 42 percent of all assets in the financial system. While it is difficult to identify a relationship
between growth and bank credit, when PFI credit is included there is evidence that overall credit has
supported GDP growth in the period since the Global Financial Crisis (Box 2).
PFIs have a large and growing role

A second approach uses a financial conditions index (FCI) to
examine the relationship between finance and real GDP
growth. This analysis applies principal component analysis to
identify an unobservable common factor from a group of financial
indicators, including bank credit, PFI credit, interest rate spreads
(lending rate minus policy rate), and the nominal effective exchange
rate.3 The estimated FCI clearly shows the loosening of financial
conditions starting in 2008 in response to the global financial crisis
and subsequent external shocks. It tracks well with GDP growth and
has the largest correlation at a 6-month lead after 2006.

The VAR analysis suggests the PFI credit helped substitute for
bank credit and support growth after a 2012 cyclone. The
Granger causality test suggests both PFI credit and bank credit
Granger-cause growth, while REER does not. Historical
decomposition of growth indicates PFI credit has contributed to
growth after Cyclone Evan, making up for weak bank credit growth.

A vector auto-regression (VAR) analysis is estimated to
disentangle the effects of each financial variable on growth.
Casual empiricism suggests that there is a relationship between
total credit growth (commercial banks and PFIs) and real GDP
growth. To investigate this relationship further, this analysis
estimates a VAR with bank credit, PFI credit (both in real terms) and
real GDP and the real effective exchange rate (REER). All the
variables are in terms of the year-on-year percent change.2

B. Outlook and Risks
9.
Near term growth will be supported by one-off events. Growth is expected to be 2½
percent for 2014/15, supported by the SIDS conference (which took place in the first quarter of the
fiscal year), preparations for the Commonwealth Youth Games in September 2015, construction of a
new airport terminal, and lower fuel prices. Lower oil prices will also contribute to benign inflation.
The current account deficit is expected to narrow by about 1½ percentage points of GDP on the
back of lower oil prices and a gradual rebound in agricultural exports and tourism. Consistent with
this growth outlook, overall credit is expected to rise by 5½ percent, with commercial bank credit
growth at 6 percent, as the entrance of a new regional bank (Bank of South Pacific - BSP) results in a
drive to expand loan portfolios. PFIs are expected to continue expanding lending at around 5 percent, significantly lower than their historical growth rate, as lending resources have diminished.
10.
Medium-term growth is expected to converge to 2 percent, supported by the
expansion of agriculture and tourism. However, 2016/17 will see a decline as a major
manufacturing employer, Yazaki corporation, closes its harness assembly operation following the
exit of Toyota from auto production in Australia. Inflation is expected to remain between 2 and
3 percent as import prices remain stable and domestic agricultural supply continues to expand. A
gradual fiscal consolidation and a pick-up in exports and tourism are expected to keep the current
account deficit at around 5 percent of GDP. Medium-term credit growth is assumed to be in line
with nominal GDP growth.
11.
Risks to the outlook. The main external risk for Samoa is the occurrence of another natural
disaster (Appendix I). Samoa also faces risks of slow growth in major trading partners (Australia, New
Zealand and the US) and (indirectly) China. Domestic risks are centered around a delay in the policy
response to vulnerabilities in the financial sector and rebuilding buffers. In particular, a delay in fiscal
consolidation and further increases in public debt would reduce fiscal space to respond to natural
disasters and further affect confidence and growth. Other domestic risks include financial distress in
PFIs. While according to the FSAP the failure of a PFI would not have a systemic effect on banks, it
would cause the public finances to deteriorate. At the same time, distress in local commercial banks
could also require public funds. An external shock propagated through the financial system could
thus have a large impact on public debt, undermining confidence and growth. Delays in
implementing structural reforms, including policies to promote financial deepening, will result in
anemic growth. The near-term outlook assumes a moderate pick-up in commercial bank credit
growth, which could also constitute a downside risk to growth should it not materialize.
12.
Authorities’ views. The authorities broadly concurred with the outlook. They noted that the
risk of a down-turn in 2016/17 could be mitigated by a shift of activity of Yazaki corporation to
other types of business. They also saw an upside to growth from higher tourist arrivals after the
completion of a new airport and the reconstruction of major hotels. The authorities were aware of
the risks in PFIs and banks. They also recognize the level of public debt is high and their budget and
multi-year fiscal framework calls for a gradual fiscal consolidation.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
13.
Discussions centered around the need to improve resilience to natural disasters and
boost growth. Improving resilience requires addressing risks in PFIs and commercial banks, and
rebuilding macroeconomic buffers by lowering public debt and increasing reserves. In the mediumterm, structural reforms are necessary to boost growth, including to facilitate access to finance.

A. Improving Financial Resilience
Public Financial Institutions
14.
Policies are needed to contain the risk of contingent liabilities to the public finances
from PFIs, and to redesign their role to support private financial markets. The authorities have
used PFIs to supply credit for reconstruction in the face of two major natural disasters. But in some
cases PFIs compete directly with commercial banks in key sectors such as tourism, housing and
consumer lending, inhibiting the development of local finance (Box 3). The asset quality of the
Development Bank of Samoa (DBS) has deteriorated significantly in recent years, and failure of DBS
could constitute an important risk for public debt, growth and financial stability. Staff analysis
suggests that a failure of PFIs could add up to 7 percent of GDP to the public debt (mostly from
liabilities in the DBS to the government or explicitly guaranteed by the government), and further
defaults among SOEs could add another 17 percent of GDP, for a total of 24 percent of GDP. The
FSAP identified the following recommendations to contain risks and enhance the role of PFIs
(Appendix II):


Formulate a coherent policy framework for the PFIs. The role of PFIs should be redesigned to
provide development finance that is complementary to, rather than in competition with,
commercial bank products. In the process, weaknesses in asset quality and performance should
be addressed. In particular,
 Development Bank of Samoa (DBS). A large part of DBS’ loan portfolio has been
restructured, and the quality of assets is uncertain. To avoid further losses, new lending
outside of its original mandate should be halted, and a comprehensive restructuring of the
bank should be initiated. The current range and nature of operations should be narrowed in
line with its original charter to finance agricultural production and SMEs. In addition, urgent
reforms need to be put in place to address its operational inefficiencies and financial
weakness, including improved credit and risk management, strengthening recovery
procedures and accounting practices.
 Samoa National Provident Fund (SNPF). The risk of insolvency in the SNPF is low, as its
lending is covered by member contributions. Nevertheless, the high level of borrowing by
members depletes pension savings, which runs counter to the purpose of the fund. The fund
should gradually reduce lending against contributions, and diversify its investment portfolio,
including by increasing offshore investments. SNPF should also seek technical assistance to
conduct a comprehensive review of its actuarial soundness, including the investment of its
assets.

Box 3. Samoa: Public Financial Institutions
PFIs have been growing rapidly and moving increasingly into areas where they compete with commercial banks. Asset
quality has deteriorated and for some, liabilities are to government institutions (central bank) or government guaranteed.
Public Financial Institutions (PFIs) in Samoa have been growing rapidly and make up a substantial part of the
financial sector. Among the PFIs, the Samoa National Provident Fund (SNPF) and Development Bank of Samoa (DBS) are
the largest in terms of assets but both Unit Trust of Samoa (UTOS) and the Samoa Housing Corporation (SHC) have been
expanding rapidly.

seems substantially impaired, and it has offered a one year moratorium on interest and principal payments to a large
proportion of its clients.

Samoa National Provident Fund (SNPF). The SNPF was established in 1972 as a compulsory retirement savings scheme
in which a minimum 5 percent contribution is paid both by employees and employers. Public employees and those in
private formal employment contribute, covering 78 percent of the formally employed population. The SNPF concentrates
on loans to its members, for which it has natural collateral in their contributions. These loans are provided for up to 50
percent of members’ contributions. About 60 percent of its assets comprise loans to its members, and most members
borrow up to the entire 50 percent allowed. The SNPF also lends to other PFIs.
Unit Trust of Samoa (UTOS). UTOS is an open-ended private unit trust established in 2010 to provide opportunities to
small investors to participate in privatized SOEs, in particular the privatization of the state telecommunications monopoly.
In the absence of further privatizations, UTOS’ activities were diversified into a financing vehicle for SOEs: it issues capital
notes to SOEs, who in turn borrow from the Trust, backed by a limited general government guarantee. By intermediating
funds among SOEs and maintaining a leveraged position the Trust has generated high returns to unit holders.
Samoa Housing Corporation (SHC). The SHC was established in 1989 to facilitate access to housing and is also funded
by the central bank with government guarantees.

This box is largely based on the FSAP Technical Note on Public Financial Institutions (forthcoming).

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SAMOA

 Unit Trust of Samoa (UTOS). In the near-term, the mandate of the Trust needs to be
clarified and its increased risk to unit holders from leveraged positions needs to be fully
disclosed. The government should decide whether to convert UTOS into a policy bank or
deleverage it and continue as a conventional mutual fund. Going forward, credit risk
management and accounting practices need to be improved.


Enhancing the transparency and governance of the PFIs with improved accounting and
disclosure practices. An important first step will be to strengthen accounting, reporting and
disclosure standards making PFIs IFRS compliant.



Incorporating the PFIs under the supervisory and regulatory framework of the central
bank. All PFIs have recently come under the supervision of the Central Bank of Samoa (CBS), but
prudential and regulatory guidelines need to be issued for UTOS and Samoa Housing
Corporation (SHC), with UTOS being supervised as a bank. The CBS should improve the
collection and verification of data from PFIs and deepen off-site analysis, including through
stress-testing.



Refraining from conducting further policy lending through PFIs not financed directly
through the budget. This would enhance transparency and reduce the risk for the balance sheet
of the CBS.

15.
Authorities’ views. The authorities recognized the risks in the public financial institutions,
but see them (particularly DBS and UTOS) as instruments to supply credit for reconstruction during
crisis, and to lower interest rates. The authorities agreed with the need to reorient DBS’ lending to
the agricultural sector and SMEs. They also noted that there are plans to reduce the ratio of lending
against contributions at the SNPF from 50 percent to 40 percent over the next two years, and to
diversify its investments. The new Ministry of Public Enterprises, planned this year, will provide an
opportunity to review governance and reporting of PFI operations. The CBS is moving quickly to
improve financial oversight of PFIs, including through the issuance and revision of prudential
regulations (particularly the SHC and UTOS) based on FSAP recommendations, and the conduct of
on-site inspections this year.

Commercial Banks
16.
Improving regulation and supervision of commercial banks would reduce the risk of
an adverse feedback from another external shock. Banks have high and rising NPLs, and are
vulnerable to shocks, according to stress-tests conducted by the FSAP. There is also significant
uncertainty about the underlying data on asset quality and provisioning. These vulnerabilities could
lead to a major credit squeeze on the economy and a bailout by government in the event of another
natural disaster. Policies to address these vulnerabilities are thus critical for macro-financial stability.
The FSAP found that financial oversight, including regulation and supervision, needs to be
strengthened. The most important recommendations in this regard include (Appendix II):

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

SAMOA



Improving capacity for banking supervision and regulation. The CBS should hire additional
staff for financial oversight, as planned, and move to implement risk based supervision.



Conducting regular on-site supervision. Priority should be given in the short-term to local
banks. The CBS should conduct an asset quality review of potentially vulnerable banks, possibly
through appointing an external assessor.



Upgrading off-site supervision. Improving the collection, verification and analysis of bank data
for off-site supervision purposes.

17.
Authorities’ views. The authorities appreciate the FSAP, and are taking steps to implement
its recommendations. They took concerns about potential weakness in the banking sector seriously
and are planning to conduct on-site inspections this year. The CBS is also taking steps to modernize
its legal and regulatory framework for banking supervision, and reform the banking resolution and
crisis management framework. A review of the legal framework was completed and a technical
assistance mission was fielded in April, 2015. The authorities have also requested technical
assistance for on-site supervision, prudential data collection and verification, stress testing, bank
resolution and crisis management, and a program of technical assistance in these areas is being
designed in coordination with the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Center (PFTAC).

B. Rebuilding Macroeconomic Buffers
Fiscal Policy
18.
Samoa’s fiscal framework is anchored on a target debt ratio of 50 percent of GDP
specified in its medium-term debt management strategy. Given the vulnerabilities Samoa faces,
staff proposed a lower long-term public debt target of 40 percent of GDP, but supported the
authorities’ stated goal of reducing public debt to 50 percent of GDP by 2020. An updated Debt
Sustainability Analysis (Annex I) indicates that Samoa has moved from a high to a moderate risk of
debt distress. However, including contingent liabilities from PFIs and SOEs of 24 percent of GDP
mentioned above, the overall risk to public debt sustainability is higher.
19.
The authorities’ budget and medium-term fiscal framework includes a fiscal
consolidation to reach their debt target. The approach is based on sustaining recent
improvements in revenue administration and bringing current expenditure to pre-crisis levels,
mainly through the containment of personnel costs (limited to 45 percent of current expenditure),
while still keeping capital spending above its historical level to support growth. For 2014/15, current
expenditures related to reconstruction (required to restore public health and education services
after the cyclone) will be reduced as reconstruction is completed. A significant component of capital
expenditure will be investments in rebuilding the airport, financed by a loan from China of about
6 percent of GDP, which is expected to be disbursed evenly over three years. Under this scenario,
the overall fiscal deficit would fall from 3½ percent of GDP in 2014/15 to around 1½ percent of GDP
in 2016/17 (GFS 2001 format), and then to around ½ percent of GDP in the medium term. This
would be sufficient to bring the debt ratio to 50 percent of GDP by 2020. This is also consistent with

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SAMOA

a strategy of running primary surpluses in non-disaster years to finance periodic disaster costs.
Implementing further reforms identified in the recent Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA) assessment, including non-tax revenue reform, budgeting, accounting and
reporting, and managing fiscal risks from SOEs, will be important to support the authorities’ fiscal
consolidation.

20.
Care should be taken to ensure that consolidation does not affect spending on social
priorities. While extreme poverty is rare in Samoa, there are challenges related to basic needs
poverty, non-communicable diseases and the quality of education (Box 4).
21.
Authorities’ views. The authorities concurred with the 40 percent of GDP long-term debt
target and the intermediate goal of bringing debt to 50 percent of GDP by 2020 through a gradual
fiscal consolidation. They pointed out that personnel expenditures were already below their medium
term fiscal framework’s target of 45 percent of current expenditure. Planned implementation of
changes in non-tax revenue in 2015/16 (implementing fees for some public services) and a review of
the VAT could also support revenue.

Monetary Policy and Exchange Rate
22.
A supportive monetary policy is appropriate as long as underlying inflationary
pressures are absent. The policy rate has been at the lower bound for over four years, and bank
liquidity is high, but the transmission mechanism for monetary policy is weak due to a lack of
competition in commercial banks, weakness in some bank balance sheets, and structural
impediments to finance. As the economy recovers it will be important to improve the functioning of
monetary policy by reforms in these areas, particularly improving bank regulation and supervision,
and making customary lands more accessible for use as collateral (discussed below). It will also be
important to mop up excess liquidity and raise interest rates.
23.
Staff analysis and other indicators suggest no significant misalignment of the currency
(Box 5). The current exchange rate peg against a basket of major trading partner currencies has
served Samoa well, and reserves are adequate under the standard metric. There are signs that
tourism and some agricultural exports are recovering, and the decline in oil and other commodity

prices is expected to support the external position in the near term. Nevertheless, given Samoa’s
vulnerability to natural disasters, a strong external position with higher reserve buffers would
Box 4. Samoa: Recent Social Developments and Challenges
While extreme poverty is rare, basic needs poverty affects about one quarter of the population.
Pressing social challenges include maintaining public services for the poor, addressing noncommunicable diseases and improving the quality of education.
Samoa is in the process of updating its information on poverty. The latest estimates are from
the 2008 household income and expenditure survey (HIES). The survey was updated in 2014, but
the results are still in the process of being analyzed. While extreme poverty is rare, 26.7 percent
of the population experienced basic needs poverty in 2008, with the incidence highest in the
capital Apia and lowest in the less populated main island of Sava’i.
Samoa faces a number of important social challenges that need to be addressed to
continue to reduce basic needs poverty and improve the inclusiveness of growth:


Promoting the quality and accessibility of public services to the poor. The poorest
40 percent of Samoa’s population rely heavily on publicly-funded health and education
services, which account for about one-third of total government spending. Ensuring fiscal
sustainability and rebuilding buffers will be important to ensure these social expenditures
are insulated from future external shocks.



Addressing the growing prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). NCDs
(such as diabetes, heart disease and stroke) create significant social costs and account for
70 percent of all deaths in Samoa. An effective strategy to tackle NCDs will include
reorienting public expenditure towards prevention, curtailing the consumption of food
and drinks linked to obesity, and scaling up the Package of Essential Non-Communicable
Disease Interventions for Primary Health Care in Low Resource Settings (PEN Package),
which is currently being piloted in a sample of district hospitals.



Improving the quality of education. Samoa has made significant gains in education.
But, the government’s Education Sector Plan notes that “at all levels, the quality of
provision is the major problem”. Improving the quality of education will require
implementing professional standards, increasing training and on-going support to
teachers, and providing incentive for teachers to improve qualifications.

Box 5. Samoa: External Sector Assessment1
Staff’s overall assessment is that there is no significant indication of a misalignment of the current
exchange rate and reserves are adequate. Nevertheless, a higher level of reserves would provide a
valuable cushion in the case of another natural disaster.
A CGER assessment for Samoa presents mixed
results. While the macro balance approach indicates
18 percent undervaluation, other approaches show a
range of 1- 19 percent overvaluation. The equilibrium
exchange rate approach (ERER) suggests no significant
misalignment.
Other indicators point to no significant
misalignment. The medium-term current account
deficit is expected to be close to 5 percent of GDP.
Export growth and tourism are expected to recover as
reconstruction is completed and investments in hotels
and the airport mature. Samoa is a net importer of
fuel and the recent decline in oil prices is expected to
improve the trade balance by about 3½ percent of
GDP. Capital grants associated with reconstruction will
also decline in the medium-term, but foreign direct
investment flows will remain at their current level.
Reserves are adequate by the standard metric.
Reserves are slightly above the optimal level of
4 months of imports of goods and services estimated
by the optimal reserve approach. The results depend
on the long-term opportunity cost of holding
reserves, which is assumed conservatively at
3.8 percent based on the long-term average real bank
lending rate.

provide greater resilience. A first line of action is to support cost competitiveness in tradable goods
and tourism through comprehensive structural reforms. Staff also discussed the possibility of
exchange rate devaluation in case of an additional external shock, but noted this would have to take
place in the context of strong domestic policies and a robust financial system. While a devaluation
would improve price competitiveness, it could have adverse effects on debt sustainability, since over
90 percent of the public debt is in foreign currency.
24.
Authorities’ views. The authorities consider that current monetary policy is broadly
appropriate, and stand ready to adjust interest rates and liquidity as necessary. They broadly agreed
that structural impediments to finance affected the transmission of monetary policy, but noted that
high concentration in banking posed a particular challenge. They viewed the current level of
reserves as adequate, and noted the countercyclical role of grants and remittances during past
crises. They were willing to consider adjustments in the exchange rate if conditions warranted, but
agreed that a devaluation could have adverse effects on debt sustainability.

C. Boosting Growth
25.
The government’s structural reform agenda appropriately emphasizes agriculture and
tourism, revitalized exports and an enabling environment for business. In agriculture, the
government should continue to move forward with the World Bank to introduce import substituting
varieties of fruits and vegetables and light agricultural processing, as has been done in the coconut
industry. In tourism, efforts to negotiate new flights are welcome, but the government also needs to
concentrate on reforms to lower the cost of doing business, particularly the very high cost of
electricity. Reforms to SOE governance are beginning to bear fruit in the form of better performance
and oversight, but the government should stay the course in planned privatizations and
amendments to the Public Bodies Act.
26.
Structural improvements in the financial sector will also be important to support
private sector development, financial inclusion and growth. Samoa has a high level of access to
financial services by individuals and lower interest margins than most Pacific Island countries
(Figure 5). Nevertheless, its remoteness and small scale lead to a lack of competition and a high cost
of financial services, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises. Financing to SMEs is
provided by commercial banks and the DBS. There is also one microfinance institution which is
beginning to make loans to SMEs and a government guarantee scheme for SME loans (with funds of
0.4 percent of GDP). However, the high level of collateralization of loans, and the large share of
customary land that cannot be used as collateral are the main obstacle to credit, including for SMEs.
The absence of a credit bureau or movable collateral registry, and the absence of standard
accounting practices among SMEs, are also significant impediments. While recent data is limited, the
latest enterprise survey from 2009, and a SME market assessment from 2012, confirm that a majority
of SMEs experience financing constraints. It will thus be important to address these constraints to
credit to allow better financial access for SMEs and to support growth.

Authorities’ views. The authorities noted that they are pursuing diversification of
agricultural production and processing for export with the help of development partners, including
for niche markets (for example organic certification or gluten free products) where Samoa’s lack of
scale economies is less of a disadvantage. They also noted that there are solar and wind energy
investments poised to come on line which would help lower the cost of electricity. The authorities
agreed that development of essential financial infrastructure is a priority. While they see the
establishment of a credit bureau as a private sector investment, they noted that personal property
registry legislation is in place and implementation will be forthcoming, and agreed that the lack of
financial literacy among SMEs is an obstacle to credit.
28.
The authorities have been working with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to make
customary land more accessible for business transactions. A policy framework will be discussed
in Cabinet in the first half of 2015, with the aim of revising legislation before 2016 (after consultation
with major stakeholders) so that leases of customary lands can be used more easily and securely as
collateral for loans, while safeguarding the rights of customary land holders.

OTHER ISSUES
29.
Samoa’s economic statistics are broadly adequate for surveillance. Core macroeconomic
data are regularly reported to the IMF and published on official websites, including monthly and
quarterly statistics not often available in small island countries. The authorities recently rebased their
GDP series to 2009 (from 2002) and introduced public accounting on a GFSM 2001 basis.
Nevertheless there are shortcomings in national accounts, financial sector indicators and external
statistics. There is an ongoing program of technical assistance to improve statistics in these areas.

STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
The authorities should be commended for maintaining macroeconomic stability and
restoring growth in the face of multiple external shocks, but risks have accumulated. For the
current fiscal year, growth is expected at around 2½ percent, boosted by reconstruction and the
hosting of a major conference. But it is expected to decline in the medium-term as the effects of
one-off events dissipate and a major manufacturing plant closes. The external current account
deficit is expected to narrow on lower oil prices and the recovery of agricultural exports and tourism.
The main external risks to this outlook come from another natural disaster. On the domestic side,
with high public debt and the accumulation of contingent liabilities in PFIs and SOEs, another
external shock could result in pressures on debt sustainability. At the same time, the FSAP identified
potential weaknesses in the banking sector that could also lead to an increase in public debt should
another external shock materialize.
31.
In the face of these vulnerabilities, Samoa needs to improve the resilience of its
economy. This requires addressing weaknesses in the financial sector, rebuilding macroeconomic
buffers, and pursuing structural reforms to increase growth.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SAMOA

32.
The role of PFIs needs to be reviewed. PFI credit has played a role in the economic
recovery, but at the expense of higher contingent liabilities for the government. In addition,
subsidized credit from PFIs has crowded out private credit and inhibited the development of local
financial markets. While the role of PFIs in providing credit is justified in times of crisis, as the
economy recovers they should be brought back to their original mandates, and governance and
transparency of their operations improved. In particular, DBS should not provide any further policy
lending outside of its original mandate and a comprehensive restructuring should be initiated.
33.
Minimizing risks in the financial sector will also improve resilience. The CBS is cognizant
of the risks identified in the recent FSAP, and is moving to improve banking supervision and
regulation in line with recommendations. The CBS is also working to improve the legal framework
for the financial sector, and banking resolution and crisis management with technical assistance
from the IMF and PFTAC.
34.
The authorities recognize that rising public debt has to be addressed. Their budget for
2014/15 and their multiyear fiscal framework envisage a gradual consolidation consistent with the
goal of reducing the debt to GDP ratio to 50 percent by 2020. They plan to maintain recent gains in
tax revenue administration and improve non-tax revenue, while limiting current expenditure mainly
by containing personnel costs. Maintaining reform momentum on public financial management in
areas identified in the recent PEFA assessment will be important to support fiscal consolidation. In
addition, safeguarding public expenditures to maintain public services for the poorest of the
population, addressing the epidemic of non-communicable diseases, and improving the quality of
education, will be important for equitable and inclusive growth.
35.
Monetary and exchange rate policies are broadly appropriate, but foreign reserves,
while adequate, could be higher to enhance resilience. The authorities should stand ready to
tighten monetary policy if inflation begins to accelerate or external conditions weaken. CGER-type
analysis suggests no significant misalignment of the exchange rate, and reserves are adequate by
standard metrics. Nevertheless, they are low compared to many of Samoa’s peers, and a higher level
would enhance resilience against natural disasters. The first line of action should be aggressive
structural reforms. A managed adjustment of the exchange rate could help strengthen the external
position further.
36.
Decisively moving to implement structural reforms will help boost medium-term
growth. For Samoa to recover its growth potential will require concentrating on reforms in
agriculture, facilitating business activity, particularly in tourism, and improving access to finance. The
authorities are well aware of these constraints and are moving to address them. The inability to use
customary lands as collateral for business loans is a long-standing impediment to financial
deepening in Samoa, and the authorities should concentrate on reforms in this area.
37.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the current
24-month cycle.

years.

High/Medium
Prolonged slow growth in advanced
economies and emerging markets
would reduce exports and GDP
growth.

Expected Impact if Risk is
Realized
(high, medium or low)
High
Natural disasters can cause
widespread damage to
agriculture and
infrastructure, possibly
leading to a further
reduction in fiscal space.
Medium/High
A sharp decline in exports,
tourism earnings and
remittances would worsen
the current account balance.
It would also reduce fiscal
revenue and weaken the
reserves buffer.

Policy
Recommendations

A growth friendly fiscal
consolidation is necessary
to replenish buffers to
face future natural
disasters.
Implement a growth
friendly fiscal
consolidation to replenish
buffers to cope with
adverse shocks; accelerate
structural reforms to
improve competiveness.

Medium
PFIs play an important part in the
financial system, but asset quality has
deteriorated sharply in the wake of
recent natural disasters.

High
Financial spillovers will have
limited effects on banks, but
would significantly
deteriorate public finances
and eliminate an important
source of credit to the
economy.

Strengthen the financial
operations of the PFIs by
incorporating them under
the supervisory and
regulatory framework of
the CBS; enhance the
transparency and
governance of the PFIs.

Medium
The authorities need fiscal
consolidation to bring the debt
down to a more sustainable level.

Medium/High
Delay in fiscal consolidation
would undermine
confidence in public
finances with higher interest
rates and lower growth.

Implement a growth
friendly fiscal
consolidation that
maintains improvements
in tax administration and
current expenditure at
pre-crisis levels.

Medium
There is a strong need to move more
quickly on implementing domestic
structural reforms to improve
growth.

Medium
In particular, reforms to
improve the functioning of
the financial system and
access to credit are critical
for private sector growth
and exports.

Develop the institutional
framework for the finance
sector; unleash economic
potential in customary
lands; lower the cost of
remittances.

1/ The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize
in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline
(“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability
of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions
with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By

Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
Hoe Ee Khor and
and the International Development Association (IDA)1
Masato Miyazaki (IMF),
Satu Kristiina Kahkonen
(IDA)
This Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) shows the risk rating for debt distress for Samoa
has changed from high to moderate since the 2013 DSA, reflecting an increase in the
discount rate to 5 percent,2 and a rebasing of GDP.3 Samoa faces a moderate risk of debt
distress, based on an assessment of public external debt. This assessment does not change
when remittances are added to the denominators of the relevant ratios. Samoa faces a
heightened overall risk of public debt distress, reflecting contingent liabilities from
government guarantees and on-lending to public enterprises in public financial
institutions (PFIs) and state-owned enterprises (SOEs). These risks could materialize if the
government does not follow through on its plans to reduce risks in PFIs and undertake a
fiscal consolidation in the next few years.

1

This DSA was prepared jointly with the World Bank, in accordance with the Debt Sustainability Framework for
low-income countries approved by the Executive Boards of the IMF and the IDA. Samoa is rated as a strong
performer for its policies and institutions for the purposes of the IMF-World Bank low-income country DSA
framework. The DSA uses a 5 percent discount rate.
2
3

The discount rate was set at 3 percent in the 2013 DSA assessment.

GDP data have been rebased to 2009 prices (previously 2002), and coverage has been increased, with the
nominal GDP for 2012/13 increasing from SAT1.6 billion to SAT1.8 billion reflecting a wider sectoral coverage
through new censuses and surveys.

SAMOA

BACKGROUND
1.
Samoa’s public debt has increased significantly over the past six years. Overall public
debt rose from around 30 percent of GDP at end-2007/08 to about 55 percent of GDP at end2013/14, as a result of two natural disasters which required reconstruction and rehabilitation
expenditures. Recently the government has signed a U.S. $51 million loan with China, which if
disbursed over three years would bring the debt ratio to 56 percent of GDP in 2017. External debt
makes up 98 percent of the total, with most being concessional. Multilateral creditors account for
58 percent of total external debt (including 25 percent owed to the World Bank, 31 percent to Asian
Development Bank, and 2 percent to OPEC, IFAD and EIB). Bilateral creditors account for
approximately 42 percent of the total external debt (35 percent owed to China and 6 percent to
Japan). The grant element of external debt is 40 percent. There is no external private debt.
2.
The central government’s net domestic debt is small, amounting to 2 percent of GDP,
but domestic liabilities in public financial institutions and SOEs could add 24 percent of GDP
to the debt ratio. Much of the debt in public financial institutions enjoys an explicit government
guarantee, and in addition, SOE liabilities (also implicitly guaranteed by the government) represent a
fiscal risk (e.g. in 2013/14, the government took over the defaulted loan to the Pacific Forum Line of
around SAT 16 million provided by the Unit Trust Of Samoa (UTOS) with a government guarantee).
The government continues to support loss-making SOEs through soft loans or investments directed
through the public financial institutions.
3.
Samoa’s debt management, monitoring and reporting capacity is good relative to
other Pacific Island countries. Samoa has developed a medium-term debt management strategy
(MTDS 2013-2015) which establishes the government’s objectives, strategies and management of
public debt, and it regularly reports and publishes information on public debt. The MTDS limits
approval of external loans to those with a 35 percent grant element and a minimum positive
economic return to cover interest and repayments. It also introduces mechanisms to monitor the
risk of default from government guaranteed loans and monitor risks from the composition and
maturity profile of public debt.

UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS
4.
The economy is recovering from the effects of cyclone Evan which hit in 2012/13. Real
GDP growth was around 2 percent in 2013/14 led by a recovery in agriculture, reconstruction and
preparations for the United Nations Third International Conference on Small Island Developing
States (SIDS). Real GDP growth is expected to be around 2½ percent in 2014/15, boosted by the
hosting of the SIDS conference, the decline in oil prices and other one-off events. In the following
two years, growth is expected to fall as the exit of Yazaki corporation’s harness assembly plant, a
major employer, affects overall activity. The current account deficit widened to around 8 percent of
GDP in 2013/14 as recovery took hold, but is expected to narrow with the fall in oil prices and
recovery of agriculture and tourism. Box 1 summarizes the medium-term macroeconomic
framework underlying this DSA update.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SAMOA

EXTERNAL DSA
5.
The baseline scenario indicates that all external debt ratios stay well below the
indicative thresholds. Under the baseline, the present value (PV) of debt-to-GDP ratio remains
below the thresholds over the projection period (Figure 1a). Samoa’s public external debt service
ratios are also relatively low, reflecting that most of its public external debt is highly concessional.
6.
Stress tests show Samoa faces moderate risk of debt distress.4 Under the most extreme
shock scenario (“Non-debt flows shock”), a sharp decline in remittances or FDI would lead to a
breach in the PV of debt to GDP ratio in the near term. Over time, however, the debt dynamics are
projected to improve, as the one-off effects of the shocks wind down. Staff assumes the scenario is
plausible, given uncertainty of remittances (e.g. potential slowdown in source countries and
increasing costs related to anti-money laundering compliance requirements). Under an additional
natural disaster shock scenario, which assumes a disaster occurs within the next five years that
reduces real GDP growth by 4 percentage points and adds 10 percent of GDP to the public external
debt (based on a synthetic control exercise) Samoa’s external debt comes close to the indicative
threshold in 2017, but falls steadily thereafter.
7.
The results of this analysis do not change if remittances are added to the
denominators of the relevant ratios (Figure 1b). Including remittances affords an additional
buffer for the external debt indicators, but the relevant thresholds for the PV of debt-to-GDP and
the PV of debt-to-exports are still breached in the case of a most extreme shock scenario.

PUBLIC DSA
8.
The overall public debt dynamics are favorable, but there are risks stemming from the
fiscal-financial linkages and a failure to consolidate the fiscal position. Taking into account that
the government has assumed the defaulted loans of the SOEs in recent years, the baseline includes
the SOE liabilities and government on-lending to the SOEs (through the PFIs), which adds
24 percentage points to the debt ratio in 2014. Explicit government guarantees (e.g. on-lending
through the public financial institutions5) are estimated to amount to 7 percent of GDP at end-2014.
SOE liabilities6 are about 17 percent of GDP, excluding on-lent amounts (explicit guarantees) and
inter-SOE loans. Under this baseline scenario, the public debt burden remains at a high level over
the projection period, but still below the benchmark (Figure 2). However, a failure to consolidate the
4

Under the historical scenario, debt ratios will decline faster relative to the baseline, reflecting a more favorable
current account balance as well as capital grants. On the other hand, the historical scenario in the public DSA will
lead to a protracted breach due to a larger primary deficit.

5

For instance, the central bank has provided a credit line with government guarantees to the Development Bank of
Samoa (DBS) of SAT 65 million and Samoa Housing Corporation (SHC) of 14 million. The rest of explicit government
guarantees consists of loan to DBS (SAT 20 million) and Samoa Shipping Corporation (SAT 1.3 million) by the SNPF,
share capital advance to UTOS (SAT 7.9 million) and Small Business Loan Guarantee Scheme (SAT 9.6 million).
6

The SOEs debt stock is assumed to grow in line with nominal GDP.

SAMOA

fiscal position would lead to a protracted breach in the benchmark for the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio
starting in 2019, as shown in the alternative scenario (“Fixed Primary Balance”) for the public DSA. In
addition, under the most extreme shock scenario (“one time 30 percent depreciation”), there is a
protracted breach of the benchmark for the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio, however the debt ratio falls
back below the benchmark in 2020.

AUTHORITIES’ VIEWS
9.
The authorities agreed with the DSA findings, noting that the current risk of debt
distress is moderate, but fiscal consolidation is crucial for debt sustainability. They remain
committed to achieving the debt target of 50 percent of GDP by 2020, and agree that a long-term
debt target of 40 percent of GDP would be an appropriately safe level. In accordance with their
current debt strategy, they are committed to not take on additional external debt in the near term.
They will review their current strategy in the context of formulating their medium-term debt strategy
for 2016-2019 over the next year.

CONCLUSION
10.
Samoa’s Public and Publicly Guaranteed (PPG) external debt has moved from a high
risk of debt distress to a moderate risk of debt distress. However, the overall risk of public debt
distress is higher, due to contingent liabilities. Should contingent liabilities materialize and the
authorities delay fiscal consolidation, this could result in unsustainable debt dynamics. Thus the
government needs to adhere to its existing consolidation plans to reach its debt target by 2020,
while safeguarding social spending and economic growth.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SAMOA

Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions Underlying the DSA Update


Real GDP growth is projected at 1.5 percent on average over the medium term reflecting
the negative effects from a recently reported exit plan of an automobile parts assembly
plant, and to recover to 2 percent in the long run. Compared to the 2013 DSA, mediumterm growth has been revised down by ½ percentage point, reflecting a planned exit from
the country of Yazaki corporation’s harness assembly plant.



Inflation is expected to stabilize over the medium term at about 3 percent and is
maintained at this level in the long run.



The current account is projected to be around 5 percent of GDP on average over the
medium term, and to stabilize at this level in the long run. Relative to the 2013 DSA, the
medium-term current account deficit has narrowed by 7 percent of GDP due to lower
commodity prices and the rebasing of GDP.



The grant element of loans is expected to decline to around 35 percent over the medium term
and then stabilize at this level in the long run. As recovery from the cyclone takes hold, the share
of external financing provided on concessional terms is expected to decline to around 5 percent
of GDP over the medium term and then stabilize at this level in the long run.



The primary fiscal balance is estimated to be in balance on average in the medium term,
in line with the medium term fiscal framework which targets a public debt-to-GDP ratio at
50 percent by 2020. After 2020, the primary fiscal balance is projected to be a surplus of
around 0.4 percent of GDP during 2021-35.



Contingent liabilities comprise explicit guarantees of around 7 percent of GDP in PFIs
and implicit guarantees of around 17 percent of GDP in SOEs. The total amounts to
approximately 24 percent of GDP at end-2014.

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.
1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes development partner's capital grants; exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments.
For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Exchange Rate Arrangement
The exchange rate of the tala is pegged to a trade and payments weighted basket of currencies. The
pegged rate can be adjusted within a ±2 percent band. The basket is a composite of the currencies
of Samoa’s most important trading partners and countries that are major sources of tourism revenue
from abroad––New Zealand, Australia, the United States, and Euro countries. The exchange rate
regime is free of restrictions and multiple currency practices.
Article IV Consultations
The 2012 Article IV consultation discussions were held during April 10–20, 2012. It was concluded by
the Executive Board on June 15, 2012 (IMF Country Report No. 12/250). Samoa is on the 24–month
cycle.
Technical Assistance from Headquarters
The Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) has provided assistance on budgetary
management, tax administration, and financial sector supervision. MCM has provided assistance on
monetary policy operations, banking, and insurance supervision and other central banking issues.
STA has provided help with government finance statistics and balance of payments statistics, and
FAD with tax administration and LEG with central bank law. Following FSAP recommendations, MCM
and PFTAC plan to provide assistance on bank supervision and regulations, and STA will provide
assistance on monetary and financial statistics.
Safeguards Assessments
An update safeguards assessment of the CBS was completed in June 2014. The assessment found
some safeguards elements in place, but concerns over CBS autonomy and governance, audit quality,
and staff capacity need to be addressed. The bank has taken steps to improve its governance
structure and autonomy, including through legislative measures. However, implementation of the
assessment's recommendations has been slow. In addition, the CBS has not published its audited
financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2014, as required under the safeguards policy.
Resident Representative
The Regional Resident Representative Office for Pacific Island Countries based in Suva, Fiji was
opened on September 13, 2010 and the office covers Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Palau,
Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. Mr. Tubagus
Feridhanusetyawan is the current resident representative.

RELATIONS WITH THE PACIFIC FINANCIAL TECHNICAL
ASSISTANCE CENTRE
(As of March 2015)
Background
Samoa has faced a difficult macroeconomic environment in recent times. Following the global
economic crisis growth stagnated, remittances fell and fiscal revenues declined sharply. This was
exacerbated by a devastating tsunami in mid-2009. Samoa responded with a substantial fiscal
stimulus financed by domestic and external debt accumulation and also with monetary stimulus
including central bank lending to nonbank financial institutions. Growth has however been slow to
pick up and with fiscal deficits still relatively high and debt levels elevated, the authorities will
continue to face macroeconomic management challenges. Fortunately, with strong policy
frameworks, good donor dialogue and coordination and a number of large institutional
strengthening projects (ISP) already in place, Samoa is well placed to meet these challenges.
PFTAC has provided moderate technical assistance (TA) to Samoa in recent years mainly on
macro-fiscal planning and analysis and statistics. PFTAC TA was instrumental in setting up a
medium-term budgeting system and the development of quarterly national accounts in Samoa, both
of which are now supported by ISPs. Recent TA has been primarily in the macroeconomic area and is
focused on developing a more reliable macroeconomic framework for the budget. Support has also
been provided in Samoa’s modernization of its income tax legislation.
Strategy 2012–2014
PFTAC’s TA strategy is guided by the APD regional strategy note and is planned within the results
framework for PFTAC’s funding cycle. 1
PFTAC TA aims to support the authorities to sustain progress on fiscal consolidation and to
improve the macroeconomic environment. PFTAC will continue to focus on building
macroeconomic analysis capacity and delivering specific technical inputs in the context of larger ISPs.
One instance of this is expected to be support to assessing revenue potential.
In the Public Financial Management area, inputs are expected to be relatively small given the large
project-based support available to support the Ministry of Finance’s PFM reform plan. PFTAC will be
available to provide follow-up support to previous work to strengthen the medium-term budgeting
system (1.5). PFTAC is also assisting the authorities to implement a follow-up PEFA assessment (1.1).
Assistance in the macroeconomics will continue to be instrumental to the success of budget
reforms. PFTAC will continue assisting the Ministry of Finance to improve the accuracy and
1

The specific result in the framework that activities target is identified in italics in the section, for example cash
management is referred to as (1.6), where 1.6 is the code in the result framework in the program document.

sophistication of its revenue and GDP forecasting (5.1, 5.3) and to build capacity to produce its own
debt sustainability analyses (5.4). This work will continue to aim to build stronger links with the
Central Bank of Samoa (CBS)
In the revenue area, Samoa continues to make good reform progress with continued support
through PFTAC. Recently PFTAC provided technical assistance to the Samoa Ministry of Revenue
which included: (a) redrafting the Income Tax Act and Tax Administration Act (2.2); (b) a review of the
existing VAGST legislation (2.2); and (c) drafting legislation for a presumptive tax (2.2). To strengthen
overall compliance management PFTAC assisted in the development of a new Compliance
Improvement Strategy which adopts a more integrated functional approach to address top
compliance risks (2.5).
In statistics, Samoa is relatively well advanced against the overall results framework; based on PFTAC
advice, it produces quarterly National Accounts on two independent measures (4.1) with production
of a range of income indicators (4.3). Balance of payments statistics are now being developed
according to BPM6 standards (4.9). PFTAC is expected to resume TA in national accounts as support
from the International Strengthening Program has been phased-out. The IMF HQ projects on
balance of payments and government finance statistics are expected to wind down during financial
year 2016.
In financial sector supervision, PFTAC’s Resident Technical Advisor developed an on-site
examination program for Samoa. A Short Term Expert was engaged to assist the Central Bank in
performing two on-site examinations of local banks during the FY15. The program will include the
delivery of a workshop prior to each examination on a topic relevant to the examination process.
Representatives from the Central Bank of Samoa will also attend the annual meeting of the
Association of Financial Supervisors of Pacific Countries and associated workshops, sponsored by
PFTAC. Samoa will receive technical assistance with the oversight of Credit Unions, including the
drafting of a new Credit Union Act.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(As of March 31, 2015)
The World Bank Group’s engagement with Samoa as outlined in the March 2012 Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) focuses on supporting Government efforts to: i) rebuild macroeconomic resilience and
encourage inclusive growth; ii) generate opportunities from global and regional integration; and iii)
strengthen resilience against natural disasters and climate change. The CPS is closely aligned with the
Government’s Strategy for the Development of Samoa 2012-2016. The Bank’s currently active portfolio
consists of 10 projects with a total commitment of US$125.9 million. Samoa has an IDA-17 (FY15–FY17)
allocation of $24.5 million.

Development Policy Operation: Provided budget support to assist Samoa’s recovery from the
immediate impact of Cyclone Evan, and to help Samoa build resilience against such shocks in the future.
The operation included reforms to enhance recovery and resilience in disaster management, infrastructure
and housing, as well as public finance management reforms that supported improved management and
transparency around the use of public funds.
2)

Budget support

First Fiscal & Economic Reform Operation: Supports the Government of Samoa's efforts to strengthen
public financial management and establish the conditions for more robust private sector growth over the
medium term, including through reforms in the areas of debt management, procurement, revenue,
payments systems and remittances, tourism sector policy, and PPPs policy.
3)

Climate Resilience

Enhancing the Climate Resilience of West Coast Road: Focuses on ‘climate-proofing’ the West Coast
Road from the airport to Apia.
Enhancing the Climate Resilience of Coastal Resources & Communities: Provides training and support
in targeted communities to update and implement local Coastal Infrastructure Plans, and supports
activities that increase the resilience of coastlines, near-shore areas, and coral reefs. The project will also
help improve national climate information services and hazard mapping.
4)

Health Sector

Health Sector Management Program: Supports the Government’s reform program aimed at promoting
preventative healthcare, and ensuring equitable access to a modern, effective, efficient health service,
delivered in close collaboration with the private sector. Implementation uses a sector-wide approach, with
co-financing and close coordination with other health sector development partners.
5)

Agriculture Sector

Agriculture Competitiveness Enhancement Project: Aims to support fruit and vegetable growers and
livestock producers to improve their productivity and take greater advantage of market opportunities. The
project covers three components – (i) livestock production and marketing, (ii) fruit and vegetable
production and marketing, and (iii) institutional strengthening.
6)

Aviation sector

Samoa Aviation Investment Project: Aims to improve operational safety and oversight of international
air transport and associated infrastructure, including through improvements to runways, facilities, and
navigation aids at the main international airport.
The IFC has also been active in Samoa, particularly in the telecoms sector. The IFC has invested
substantially in Digicel, with market liberalization and increased competition helping to increase mobile
access in Samoa to over 80 per cent of the population. The IFC has also provided assistance to the tourism
sector, and has helped with the expansion of banking services to allow small and medium entrepreneurs
find capital to start and run their businesses.
In support of a significantly scaled up program, the Bank in November 2009 opened a joint liaison office
in Samoa, in conjunction with the Asian Development Bank.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of March 31, 2015)
The Asian Development Bank operations in Samoa started in 1966: As at year-end 2014, 35 loans
($186.19 million), 14 ADF grants ($90.42 million), and 93 TA projects for $30.43 million have been
provided to Samoa. Two loans ($75.15 million), 6 ADF grants ($58.50 million), and 1 TA project
($0.40 million) are active.
ADB’s country operations business plan (COBP) 2015-2017, adopts a harmonized approach to donor
assistance with other development partners and maintaining the focus of its Pacific Approach
targeting improvement of growth prospects and living standards, especially for disadvantaged
members of the community. The COBP is closely aligned with the Strategy for the Development of
Samoa (SDS).
Samoa has received support from the Pacific Infrastructure Advisory Center (PIAC) for infrastructure
master planning and has also participated in the PIAC initiative for strengthening of power and
water utilities. Samoa has received ADB regional technical assistance for economic management for
development results, energy efficiency, statistics and private sector development (including SOE
reforms and secured transactions). ADB continues to include Samoa in new regional TA activities.
ADB has also committed to provide technical assistance for the development of a masterplan for the
ports and implementation of new Competition law.
In December 2013 the Public Sector Financial Management Program (totaling US$14 million) was
approved for release in two tranches (US$10 million and US$4 million). ADB will also continue to
support reforms to promote economic use of customary land, build sustainable capacity for sound
economic and public sector management and implement state-owned enterprises reforms.
The Samoa AgriBusiness Support Project was approved in June 2014. The Project intends to facilitate
credit to agri-businesses by assisting with equity inputs (up to 25%) and credit guarantees (up to
25%) that may equate up to 50% of total project costs. A facility manager has already been
appointed but no projects have been funded as yet. The ANZ Bank, Westpac and Samoa
Commercial Bank have signed subsidiary financing agreements with the government.
ADB will assist Samoa in the development of its ICT sector through joint financing of the Samoa
Submarine Cable and continue with the implementation of the Renewable Energy and Power Sector
Rehabilitation Project along with a Community Sanitation Project and Education Sector Project that
are nearing completion.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
SAMOA—STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
(As of April 2015)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Core
macroeconomic and monetary data are regularly reported to the IMF and published on official websites.
However, there are weaknesses in national accounts, monetary and financial, and external sector
statistics.
National Accounts: National account statistics has been improved during the last three years. GDP is
compiled quarterly, predominantly using the VAT data. GDP was recently rebased from 2002 to 2009
constant prices. However, one third of GDP is “non-monetary,” and difficult to measure with any
precision (both levels and growth rates). The experimental estimate of GDP by expenditure is being
refined and hasn’t been released yet.
Price Statistics: The CPI is compiled monthly (August 2010=100). A quarterly import price index is also
published, coverage being limited to chapters 01-27 of the Harmonized System.
Government Finance Statistics: Samoa has participated in the JSA-funded regional 3-year GFS capacity
development project since April 2012. Assisted by the technical assistance provided under this project,
the authorities migrated their GFS data from GFS 86 to the GFSM 2001 format. Additionally, the Samoa
Bureau of Statistics (SBS) worked to improved data quality by: identifying and incorporating new data
sources and statistical estimation techniques in its GFS compilation processes; as well as increased data
confrontation with other macro-economic data sets. The authorities began publishing the improved data
in 2013 and, for the first time, submitting data for inclusion in IMF publications. Gaps remain in coverage
(general government is not yet compiled or published), instrument detail, and consistency across the
macro-framework; work is ongoing in Samoa to address these remaining deficiencies. Funding for the
regional project expires at the end of FY 15.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: Samoa reports monetary data to the IMF on a regular basis.
Monetary data for the Central Bank and other depository corporations are submitted in Standardized
Report Form (SRF) format. Samoa does not report data on other financial corporations (OFCs). In
November 2014, authorities requested technical assistance from STA to compile SRFs for OFCs.
Financial Sector Surveillance: Samoa does not report data on financial sector indicators.
External sector statistics: The quality of ESS is overall poor, mostly hindered by the frail data collection
framework; access to source data for the compilation of some of the most relevant ESS components is
limited.ESS coverage overall presents important limitations due to the omission of cross-border
transactions and positions of offshore enterprises. As a reference on the relevance of offshore centers in
Samoa, Samoan non-bank enterprises hold at least US$ 4.6 billion according to the BIS (Locational
Banking Statistics database). The CBS produces and disseminates the balance of payments of Samoa on a
quarterly basis, following the BPM6, but restricted to main aggregates and with poor coverage. The IIP is
not disseminated by the CBS. The CBS participated in the IMF’s Coordinated Direct Investment Survey
(CDIS) lastly in 2011, but reported data were highly underestimated.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Samoa is a participant in the GDDS since
September 2012.

No data module ROSC has so far been conducted
in Samoa.

Statement by Vicki Plater, Alternate Executive Director for Samoa
and Wonjin Choi, Advisor to Executive Director
June 1, 2015
Samoa is gradually recovering from two successive natural disasters with a cumulative
reconstruction cost of 40% of GDP. A small state of 190,000 people and vulnerable to
natural disasters, Samoa has been able to carefully manage through the consequences of the
2009 tsunami and 2012 cyclone Evan, containing the increase in public debt to a peak at
about 56% of GDP. Underpinned by the authorities’ reconstruction efforts, and supported by
the Fund’s Rapid Credit Facility, economic growth has been solid for the last two years and
inflation subdued. Such a solid recovery was largely possible due to the ample policy
headroom provided by the strong track record of prudent economic management. The
authorities have exerted considerable effort to overcome the crisis through a well articulated
recovery framework, including an expansionary monetary stance, various fiscal programs to
support recovery, and credit provision to the private sector through the public financial
institutions (PFI).
The authorities recognize that vulnerabilities have increased in certain areas including
as a consequence of the needed government intervention to support reconstruction. The
public debt-to-GDP ratio has increased due to widened fiscal deficits. The current account
deficit has worsened with reconstruction increasing demand for imported inputs. Asset
quality in both PFIs and commercial banks has deteriorated. These vulnerabilities expose the
economy to increased risks. The authorities remain vigilant and are developing policies to
contain and reduce these vulnerabilities over time.
Against this backdrop, the authorities consider the FSAP as well as the pilot application
of deeper macro-financial analysis1 in Samoa as timely and relevant. The Samoan
authorities appreciate the Fund extending professional expertise and resources to Samoa for
risk appraisal and policy advice at this important juncture. As a small developing state it is
extremely helpful to have access to the Fund's expertise through the FSAP, particularly given
the challenges of limited competition and shallow financial markets hampering financial
inclusion. The FSAP and macro-financial analysis have helped Samoa identify vulnerabilities
and develop policy responses to address weaknesses.
Staff's assessment and advice are broadly aligned with the authorities’ appraisal and
policy direction. With this in mind we offer the following updates and elaboration.

1

Samoa is one of the pilot countries for incorporating greater macro financial analysis in the Article IV,
following the recommendations of the 2014 Triennial Surveillance Review.

2
Recent developments and outlook
Economic growth is expected to remain solid through 2015/16 before weakening
somewhat and then returning back to potential of around 2 percent over the medium
term. The authorities expect real GDP growth to strengthen by 2.6% in 2014/15, up from
1.9% in 2013/14, supported by the recovery in tourism and remittances and the infrastructure
investment for reconstruction and in preparation for several major international events, the
UN Small Islands Developing State (SIDS) Conference in September 2014 and the
Commonwealth Youth Games in September 2015. Growth is expected to reach around 2.4%
in 2015/16 and then fall back in 2016/17 following the completion of investment for the
international events and as production at the Yazaki plant - a significant private employer winds down towards July 2016 (as its key Australian automotive production market closes).
The authorities have a more optimistic assessment than Staff of the impact of the Yazaki
close-down on 2016/17 growth primarily reflecting Yazaki’s efforts to identify and explore
potential investment opportunities in other commercial sectors in Samoa, which are expected
to mitigate the impact of the closure of Yazaki's harness manufacturing operations.
Inflation is expected to rise as economic growth takes hold, but will remain below the
CBS’ target - 3 percent - over the medium term, benefitting from subdued imported
inflation. The authorities expect headline inflation to rise to 1.8 percent for 2014/15, from
0.8 percent the previous year, mainly reflecting higher domestic inflation as imported
inflation is expected to be a subdued 0.7 percent (given the sharp decline in oil prices). For
2015/16 and later, headline inflation is expected to edge up to around 2.5 percent in the wake
of stronger economic activity.
While the current account balance has widened the authorities expect a gradual
rebalancing to a deficit of around 5 percent of GDP over the medium term as tourism
and agricultural exports strengthen. Recent developments have shown positive signs in
this direction: total exports of goods in the first six months of 2014/15 increased by 21.5
percent relative to the same period last year while total imports were down by 10.1 percent;
and total exports of services in the same period of time was 2.5 percent higher reflecting a
7.9 percent increase in tourism as well as gains in telecommunications services. A
strengthening of growth in Australia should further support this.
Fiscal policy
The authorities’ fiscal stance is geared at gradual consolidation to slowly lower debt
and maintain a budget deficit in the medium-term of not more than 3.5% of GDP. The
authorities well recognize the risks from the currently diminished fiscal policy room and
heightened fiscal vulnerabilities, including fiscal-financial linkages from government
guarantee to PFIs. The authorities' long-standing commitment to prudent fiscal management
remains and with the completion of all major infrastructure reconstruction works following
the recent natural disasters, there is now the opportunity to adopt a tighter fiscal stance.

3
The authorities note that the long-term debt target of 40 percent of GDP proposed by
staff is well aligned with the authorities’ stated goal of reducing public debt to 50
percent of GDP by 2020. To help bring down the debt-to-GDP ratio to 50 percent, the
authorities are continuing to implement the debt management strategy, the procedures for
contracting new loans and issuing new guarantees, and the improved legal framework
through, inter alia, amendments to the Public Finance Management Act to explicitly include
the government's borrowing purposes and debt management objectives, along with reporting
requirements to Parliament.
The authorities are pushing ahead with further SOE reform in light of SOEs’ potential
impact on fiscal sustainability. Parliament has recently approved amendments to the Public
Bodies Act 2001 to establish the Ministry of Public Enterprises, charged with responsibility
to ensure the performance and accountability of SOEs. Performance evaluations of boards of
directors of SOEs will be concluded this year, underpinned by TA by ADB. The manual for
directors is being revised to reflect the establishment of the new Ministry. Privatizations of
SOEs that have already been approved by Cabinet, including the Agriculture Store
Corporation, Polynesian Airlines Limited and Samoa Shipping Services, are proceeding as
planned.
Monetary policy and the exchange rate
The Central Bank of Samoa (CBS) will maintain its current monetary policy stance to
support economic growth but will remain vigilant to any risks to inflation. Given the low
inflation pressures, the CBS sees little need to tighten monetary policy in the foreseeable
future. However, should there be a shock that drives up inflation for a prolonged period of
time, the CBS stands ready to review and adopt a tightening stance to control inflation.
The CBS' policy priority is improving the effectiveness of monetary policy and its
transmission mechanism. The monetary policy transmission mechanism through the interest
rate channel is limited and the CBS believes market rates could be lower given current
monetary policy settings. The CBS considers that moral suasion, through the quarterly
meetings with the CEOs of the four commercial banks, has been a more effective means to
communicate the monetary policy stance, and is encouraging commercial banks to lend to the
private and public sector and thus support the economic recovery. Improving the functioning
of the monetary policy transmission mechanism is a key area for further work. The CBS is
encouraging inter-bank market activity to strengthen the domestic financial market.
The CBS’ exchange rate policy strives to achieve a good balance between maintaining
Samoa’s export competitiveness and minimizing imported inflation. The REER has
declined from the high levels seen in 2009 and 2011, generally reflecting the low inflationary
pressures and improvements in Samoa’s terms of trade. Compared to its main trading
partners, Samoa’s inflation has been lower in 2014, which helped drive the REER downward,
aside from the last quarter of the year.

4
The CBS considers the current level of the tala exchange rate appropriate. The
authorities’ own assessment found the REER to be only very modestly misaligned with its
equilibrium rate (by 2 percent) in the June quarter of 2014, without any indication of any
persistent deviation of the REER from its equilibrium level, which is consistent with the
Staff's view.
Financial sector
The financial sector in Samoa remains generally well capitalized, profitable and liquid,
although risks and vulnerabilities have built up in certain areas. Capital adequacy ratios
and ROE in the banking sector were generally comfortable at 28.7 percent and 7.1 percent
respectively at the end of 2014. However, non-performing loans edged up to around 7
percent. The FSAP has been a timely exercise as it has helped identify key areas that need
strengthening, especially with regards to financial sector supervision and regulation in order
to attain macro-financial stability and a sound external position.
The authorities welcome the recommendations from the FSAP and will work
concertedly to implement the recommendations; steps are already being taken in some
areas. The authorities are putting in place better coordination between the Ministry of
Finance (MOF) and the CBS as a foremost priority at both a strategic and at an operational
level. Key MoUs have been signed between the CBS and MOF. Coordinated contingency
plans have been drafted covering both the system as a whole and for individual systemic
institutions. Revisions to the CBS Act to reform governance and safeguards are well
advanced, and are consistent with IMF recommendations. Technical assistance will be
important to support the Samoan authorities implement the range of FSAP recommendations
in a way that is meaningful in the Samoan context.
International financial regulation and its sensible implementation also matters. Given
the significance of remittances to the Samoan economy (19 percent of GDP), it is also
important not to lose sight of the need for ongoing international efforts to reduce the cost of
sending remittances. The Samoan authorities are continuing to strengthen its anti-money
laundering and counter terrorism financing (AML-CFT) monitoring and supervision to
minimize and deter these illegal activities. The authorities also urge commercial banks
abroad to assess AML-CFT on a case by case basis, and not on a wholesale closure of money
transfer operators’ agents bank accounts abroad.
Total credit to the private sector increased significantly over the year to end December
2014, with commercial banks’ credit growth finally turning positive. Credit growth
reflected the preparations for the SIDS conference in September 2014 as well as a sharp
increase in foreign currency loans to the business sector. Annual average credit growth rose
to 5.9 percent at end December 2014 from 1.2 percent at end 2013, driven by growth in credit
to businesses (up 16.4 percent) and individuals (up 12.2 percent). Private sector credit is

5
expected to continue to increase in the last six months of 2014/15 but at a more moderate
pace.
We welcome staff’s assessment that overall credit growth, including credit from Public
Financial Institutions (PFIs), supported GDP growth in Samoa in the period since the
Global Financial Crisis. The authorities believe that CBS’s Credit Line Facility (CLF) to
stimulate the economy (particularly since 2013) has been the most effective of the CBS’
efforts to support growth by directly extending credit to the private sector. The CLF provided
relief financing to the priority sectors (tourism, manufacturing, agriculture and housing) and
has provided much needed competition to drive down commercial bank interest rates. Total
credit growth has increased as a result in recent months mainly stemming from credit
extended by PFIs while bank credit has been slow in comparison.
The authorities intend to closely review credit provision through PFIs and ensure that
PFIs’ operations return to their mandated roles over time. The authorities have a keen
interest to see the private financial sector playing an effective role as a facilitator of credit.
The credit guarantee support provided via PFIs to strengthen finance to the public and
business community is considered to be only a temporary measure given the special
circumstances, and is complementary to credit from commercial banks. As reconstruction
activities broadly wrap up and credit issued by commercial banks shows stable growth, the
authorities envisage that PFIs will withdraw from providing credit to the private sector
outside of their legislated role. The authorities are mindful of the need to limit any further
buildup in risks and exposures from PFIs. The CBS is strengthening its financial oversight of
PFIs, with revised prudential regulations planned, based on recommendations from the
FSAP. The PFIs will come under the auspices of the new Ministry of Public Enterprises,
which will further support transparency and accountability of these organizations.
One of the main constraints to private sector credit is the lack of acceptable collateral
available to many SMEs. In this regard, the use of customary land leases as acceptable
collateral is being developed. Also, a personal property security act is now in place to allow
individuals and business to use their moveable assets as collateral for loans. A centralized
asset registry is still being developed at the moment to bring this into effect. Further analysis
is underway of the relatively high lending rates, which are a deterrent to potential businesses
and those that are looking to improve and expand their domestic operations, to determine if
this is an issue for which a policy response would be appropriate.
Structural reforms
The authorities welcome the staff’s positive evaluation of the authorities’ structural
reform agenda and endorsement of the authorities’ policy direction. Lifting mediumterm growth remains a key challenge. The authorities are reviewing various options to
promote diversification of the economy, such as promoting processed food exports though
the establishment of plants for fish/cannery/virgin coconut oil processing. Enhancing the

6
business environment remains critical to this challenge. Given the importance of financial
inclusion for private sector development, research is underway on how to strengthen
financial access of SMEs including the possibility of introducing SME lending regulations
and a credit bureau. To help support tourism development, the authorities are examining
issues of market access such as increased airfares, the reduction of flights from a key source
market, and the lack of inter-connecting airline links from long haul and secondary source
markets.
On behalf of the Samoan authorities, we thank the staff for their constructive policy dialogue
with the authorities in both the Article IV and the productive FSAP discussions. The
authorities are also highly appreciative of the Fund's technical assistance from HQ and
PFTAC, and places high priority on further technical assistance to support capacity building
of key officials and implementation of the FSAP recommendations.
