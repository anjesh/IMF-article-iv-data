IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with El Salvador

On June, 20, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with El Salvador.
El Salvador continues to suffer from significantly lower growth than neighboring countries amid
low investment, high outward migration, weak competitiveness, and political gridlock. GDP
growth has averaged 2 percent over 2000-2014, well below the Central American regional
average of 4½ percent.
Low oil prices helped growth and the current account improve in 2015 alongside low headline
inflation. GDP grew 2½ percent in 2015, up from 1½ percent in 2014, supported by steady
growth in the US, robust exports to the rest of Central America, and a stimulus from lower oil
prices. Investment also increased significantly. Headline inflation was slightly negative (-0.7
percent). The current account deficit fell 1½ percentage points to 3½ percent of GDP.
The fiscal deficit fell by 0.1 percentage point to 3.4 percent of GDP in 2015. Fiscal expenditure
remained broadly constant as a percent of GDP, with conservative increases in wages and lower
energy subsidies. Capital expenditure remained subdued. Revenues were helped by the banking
transactions tax (BTT) but were lower than expected. New taxes on telecommunications services
and large enterprise profits were introduced in late-2015 to finance a needed increase in law
enforcement and security spending. However, fiscal risks are rising. Reflecting a parliamentary
impasse over approval to access external financing, domestic financing has risen sharply in 2015
and early 2016, pushing up yields on government short term domestic securities and raising the
prospect of disorderly adjustment if the impasse continues.
The financial sector is stable but is exposed to the rising sovereign risks. Banking sector capital
adequacy ratio remains substantially above the minimum statutory level of 12 percent.
Provisioning is adequate, and asset quality continues to improve while liquidity appears ample.
However, bank profitability is relatively low. Deposits and credit to the private sector grew by
around 6 and 5 percent, respectively, in 2015 as corporate credit picked up and household credit

slowed. Financial sector credit to the public sector, on the other hand, increased by nearly 15
percent and now accounts for about 35 percent of private financial system assets.
GDP growth is expected to be 2.3 percent in 2016 and 2.4 in 2017, falling over the medium-term
toward a potential growth rate of 2 percent. There is some near-term upside risk if several
significant investment projects get underway (notably a large gas project). However, US growth
is projected to decline over the medium term. Moreover, oil prices are expected to trend upwards
over the medium term, tempering the recent boost to demand and causing the current account
deficit to rise to 5½ percent of GDP by 2021. The fiscal deficit is expected to widen to 5½
percent of GDP over the medium term absent measures, reflecting pressures from wages, interest
payments, security-related expenses, and public investment. Alongside, public debt is expected
to exceed 70 percent of GDP by 2021.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They noted that while favorable
external conditions and low oil prices have contributed to some improvement in the economic
situation, El Salvador continues to suffer from low growth due to a host of complex issues,
including low investment, high crime and emigration, and weak competitiveness. Directors
underscored that ensuring fiscal and debt sustainability and raising potential growth will require
strong policies and far-reaching structural reforms supported by broad political consensus.
Directors generally emphasized that frontloaded fiscal consolidation is needed to reverse the
upward trajectory of public debt, entrench fiscal sustainability, and create space to fund the
lender of last resort (LOLR) facility and fully implement the authorities’ crime prevention
strategy. They highlighted that both revenue and expenditure measures will be important to
deliver the required adjustment while safeguarding social spending safety nets. Introducing lessdistortionary taxes will be helpful in this regard. Directors took note of the authorities’ initiatives
to reform the pension system and called for further steps to adjust the system to include changes
essential to ensure its long-run fiscal and social sustainability. A sound medium-term fiscal
framework will be essential going forward.
Directors noted that the authorities have made good progress in financial sector reforms and
encouraged them to implement the remaining reforms, including those aimed at addressing
liquidity risks. They also highlighted the importance of increasing annual budget allocations for
the LOLR facility and making further progress in risk-based supervision along with
comprehensive legislative reform to strengthen the bank resolution and crisis management
framework.
Directors emphasized that structural reforms will be key to increasing investment and fostering
inclusive growth. They encouraged the authorities to enhance the flexibility of wages and prices,
including by containing minimum wage increases, ease barriers to entry and competition, and
curb anti-competitive practices in key sectors and improving the effectiveness of the Competition

Agency. Efforts should also continue towards improving the business climate, developing human
and physical capital, and reducing crime and corruption.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with El Salvador will be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 1, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context: El Salvador continues to suffer from significantly lower growth than
neighboring countries amid low investment, high outward migration, weak
competitiveness, and political gridlock. Fiscal pressures remain substantial.
Focus: The consultation focused on policies to raise growth, underpin fiscal sustainability
while enhancing social safety nets, and strengthen financial sector stability, deepening,
and inclusiveness.
Main policy issues


Raising potential growth will require far-reaching structural reforms to foster
competitiveness and investment, supported by measures to reduce crime and
regulatory uncertainty.



The authorities should assertively target a front-loaded reduction in the fiscal
deficit of 3 percent of GDP over the next 3 years to ensure a sustainable budgetary
position. Successful fiscal consolidation will require both revenue and expenditure
measures, investing in a robust social safety net and reductions in distortionary
taxation. A sound medium term framework will be essential.



Meaningful pension reform proposal will require parametric changes—including
raising the retirement age, higher contributions, and more tightly linking benefits
to contributions— and the identification of non-contributory revenue sources to
match any residual actuarial imbalance in the pension system.



The banking system appears sound and well capitalized. However, there is a need
to upgrade the framework for crisis resolution and management, establish a
liquidity backstop, and enhance risk-based and cross border supervision. Financial
deepening and inclusion would help boost growth and mitigate poverty. The loss
of correspondent banking relationships has been manageable thus far, but there is
a need to undertake contingency planning to delineate the authorities’ response in
the event of a broader loss of correspondent banking relationships.

INADEQUATE GROWTH AND TOUGH CHALLENGES
1.
GDP growth has averaged 2 percent over 2000-2014, well below the Central American
regional average of 4½ percent (Figure 1). Alongside, GDP per capita has risen slowly and well
behind the frontrunners in the region.
2.
While the underlying causes of the low
growth are complex, a key channel through
which they are expressed appears to be low
investment. 1 El Salvador’s investment rate has
averaged only 15½ percent of GDP since 2000.
Data gaps preclude strong conclusions, but the
available evidence suggests that the likely culprits

However, along many of these dimensions El Salvador does not appear materially worse than its
faster-growing neighbors aside from the inter-related forces of high levels of outward migration and
violent crime. Most likely, it is the complex interaction of all of these factors that is at the core and,
as such, resolving low growth will require action along multiple fronts.

3.
The adverse effect of high emigration on growth goes beyond its impact on
investment. Emigration since the civil war, triggered in part by insecurity, reduced labor supply,
particularly among the more flexible and potentially productive young workers, restraining growth.
And while there was a concurrent surge in remittances that supported consumption, this also likely
raised reservation wages and limited competitiveness. Moreover, in recent years the growth of
remittances has been lower than in neighboring countries, reflecting the earlier start of migration
and more mature family unification process.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

4.
The low-growth feeds a number of vicious cycles. First, it hinders efforts to reduce the
high crime rate and improve educational attainment, which in turn deters investment and growth. It
also encourages emigration, which limits labor supply and in turn dampens growth. Low growth also
creates fiscal pressures, as social demands continue to increase while fiscal revenues remain
subdued. The resulting adverse trends in public debt increase macroeconomic instability and
undermine investor confidence. Breaking these vicious cycles will require strong concerted efforts.
5.
El Salvador’s competitiveness problem has
been exacerbated by the run-up in the U.S. dollar
(Annex III). Staff’s estimates using the three EBA-lite
methodologies suggest REER overvaluation close to
10 percent. International reserves are broadly
adequate by traditional metrics but fall short against
more suitable risk-weighted benchmarks that are
tailored to a fully dollarized economy. And after an
initial post civil war spurt El Salvador’s export
performance has been stagnant since 1998, with its
share of world goods and services exports flat at 0.03
percent.

6.
Political gridlock is an obstacle even to incremental reform. The authorities’ 5-year plan
puts growth as the overriding priority, and many growth-promoting measures have been pursued.
However, while there is broad agreement on the need to increase inclusive growth and public sector
efficiency, and to reduce crime and corruption, the main political parties are far apart on how to
achieve these objectives, resulting in legislative stalemate on many important initiatives.

DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
7.
Low oil prices helped growth and the current account improve in 2015 alongside low
headline inflation (Table 1). GDP grew 2½ percent in 2015, up from 1½ percent in 2014,
supported by steady growth in the US which increased remittances, robust export growth to the rest
of Central America, and a stimulus from lower oil prices. Investment also increased significantly,
helped by better corporate balance sheets (also in part a consequence of low oil prices). Headline
inflation was slightly negative (-0.7 percent), anchored by the fully dollarized regime and lower
energy prices. The current account deficit fell 1½ percentage points to 3½ percent of GDP (Figure
3).
8.
The fiscal deficit fell by 0.1 percentage point to 3.4 percent of GDP in 2015 (Figure 2).
Fiscal expenditure remained broadly constant as a percent of GDP. The wage bill increased slightly
by 0.1 percent of GDP, largely reflecting ingrained indexation in selected sectors, and the interest bill
Energy and Transport Subsidies (percent of GDP)
also rose marginally. However, the authorities took

The financial sector is stable but is exposed to the rising sovereign risks (Figure 4).
Banking sector capital remains high (17.2 percent of risk-weighted assets), substantially above the
minimum statutory level of 12 percent. Provisioning is adequate (nearly 115 percent of NPLs) and
asset quality continues to improve. Banking system liquidity appears ample. However, bank
profitability is relatively low due to a narrowing loan to deposit rate spread and high liquidity.
Deposits and credit to the private sector grew by around 6 and 5 percent, respectively, in 2015 as
corporate credit picked up and household credit slowed. Credit to the private sector nudged up to
nearly 45 percent of GDP. Financial sector credit to the public sector, on the other hand, increased
by nearly 15 percent and now accounts for about 35 percent of private financial system assets,
increasing the exposure of the financial sector to fiscal shocks such as a repricing of sovereign risk.
11.
GDP growth is expected to be 2.3 percent in 2016 and 2.4 percent in 2017, falling over
the medium-term toward a potential growth rate of 2 percent (Tables 2-7).2 There is some
near-term upside risk if several significant investment projects get underway (notably a large gas
project). However, US growth (with which Salvadoran growth is highly correlated) is projected to
decline over the medium term. Moreover, oil prices are expected to trend upwards over the medium
term, tempering the recent boost to demand. Inflation is expected to remain anchored by the fully
dollarized regime. Given the rise in oil import prices and difficult prospects to strengthen and
diversify exports the current account deficit is expected to rise to 5½ percent of GDP by 2021.
12.
The fiscal deficit is expected to widen to 4 percent of GDP in 2016, with further
increases over the medium term absent measures. While revenues are expected to increase,
reflecting full-year impacts of recent measures and rising import taxes as oil prices rise, expenditures
are projected to rise faster. In addition to wage pressures and higher interest payments, the
authorities plan additional security-related expenses of 0.6 percent of GDP over 2016–17 to counter
the recent uptick in crime. Public investment is also assumed to recover from recent lows. Alongside,
public debt is expected to exceed 70 percent of GDP by 2021 (see the DSA).
13.

Risks to the outlook are significant and tilted to the downside.



Increased global financial market turmoil could limit access or raise the cost of external fiscal
financing, adding to fiscal strains.



A surge in the US dollar could further undermine El Salvador’s competitiveness relative to nondollarized neighboring countries and weaken growth prospects. Also, the forthcoming
implementation of the Trans Pacific Partnership agreement may intensify competition from Asia.



Weaker than expected global growth would depress Salvadoran growth, particularly without the
exchange rate as a shock absorber (although lower oil prices that accompany weaker growth
would be a mitigant).

Chapter II of the accompanying Selected Issues Paper discusses the potential growth rate of El Salvador.



Increased de-risking by major international banks could increase intermediation costs and
hamper the flow of remittances to El Salvador, dampening consumption and growth.



Rising fiscal risks could undermine confidence and depress medium term growth below staff
estimates.



On the upside, lower energy prices would support the economy, suppress inflation and support
the balance of payments. Sustained strong implementation of public and private investment
projects would also create an upside to growth.

14.
The authorities were more optimistic about the outlook and balance of risks. In
particular, they believed that the pickup in domestic investment observed in 2015 would endure and
that the large investment projects in the pipeline, together with efforts to promote growth more
generally, would support an increase in potential growth above 2½ percent.

FISCAL STRAINS
15.
There was agreement that without assertive fiscal consolidation public debt will
continue to rise. A frontloaded primary balance adjustment of at least 3 percent of GDP over 201719 is the minimum needed to reverse the upward debt dynamics over the medium term, with more

pressures in pension and health spending. 3 Still
more adjustment would be needed to create fiscal space to fully implement the authorities’ crime
prevention strategy and credibly fund the authorities’ LOLR facility. Successful consolidation will
require both revenue and expenditure measures, and a stronger fiscal framework. The authorities
agreed in principle, and noted that their Medium-term Fiscal Framework targets adjustment of 2½
percent of GDP, although no specific set of measures have been agreed upon. However, they
considered that this adjustment, at least in non-pension fiscal accounts, was close to the maximum
feasible given low growth and pressing social needs.

3

The fiscal sustainability gap is the total amount of fiscal measures that (if immediately implemented) would assure a
non-explosive path for government debt over the long run. Kanda (IMF WP/11/164) describes the methodology
underpinning the estimates.

The authorities were supportive of property, wealth and progressive individual income
taxation. However, they believed that the distortionary effects of the BTT and telecom tax were
modest and indicated that raising VAT would be politically difficult because of its effects on the
poor. They were however optimistic about the yield from several administrative initiatives that were
underway to strengthen tax collections.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

EL SALVADOR

18.
The authorities agreed that durable consolidation will require addressing the sources
of expenditure pressures. Recent revenue-based consolidation has largely been offset by increased
spending, notably on the wage bill which has risen by 1 percent of GDP in the past 5 years, and is
projected to rise by a further one percent of GDP by 2021 without measures. Addressing wage
pressures will require eliminating the generous wage indexation mechanism (escalafon) in the health
sector, limiting general wage indexation to increases below the rate of inflation, and curbing
nontransparent bonuses. Also, hiring in all sectors—except security—should be significantly
reduced. There is need to strengthen the efficiency of expenditure across a range of functions
(notably reducing the fragmentation of the health system and improving the targeting of school
assistance programs to protect the needy). There is scope for further rationalizing LPG and electricity
subsidies. However, public investment should be increased to alleviate infrastructure bottlenecks,
and the social safety net should be enhanced. The authorities were open to considering measures in
all these areas, but were not yet prepared to commit to specific steps along those lines.
19.
The authorities are continuing efforts to upgrade the fiscal framework to support
consolidation efforts, including developing a fiscal responsibility law (FRL). 4 El Salvador’s fiscal
framework: (i) has incomplete coverage of different government levels; (ii) allows higher spending
with routine legislative approval if new financing becomes available; (iii) has highly rigid spending
(80 percent of spending is deemed rigid); (iv) incompletely identifies general government financing
needs and sources in the annual budget (excludes short-term debt, tax refunds, and some future
debt issuances and repayments); (v) lacks a medium-term (MT) orientation, and (vi) is typically based
on optimistic macroeconomic projections. These problems have contributed to an upward drift in
spending, high deficits, and periodic financing strains.
20.

A draft FRL is currently under discussion and should:



Adopt strong procedures to increase transparency and comprehensiveness of budget
presentation, improve forecasting and spending control, and reduce the upper limit on LETES
issuance. Ideally, the regular budgetary process should also include the pre-approval of all the
necessary financing for the budget year, thereby reducing the probability of financing crunches.



Include a formal numerical target. One option could be a budget balance rule with
countercyclical properties, incorporating a clear link to a prudent debt objective and corrective
mechanisms to achieve it, which appears appropriate for El Salvador’s political and economic
circumstances. An expenditure-based rule, or a combination of expenditure and deficit-based
rules, could also be options should they command bipartisan support.

The authorities’ current draft FRL contains many of the above elements, including a combination of
deficit-based and expenditure-based rules. However, it still lacks clarity on the hierarchy of
procedural and numerical rules and, as currently framed, the draft does not garner broad political
and societal support.

Pension reforms are essential to ensure fiscal and social sustainability. 5 The transition
to a fully funded defined contribution (DC) system has sputtered due to inadequate asset returns
that have led the government to periodically top up and guarantee pension benefits. The pension

this going forward.
22.
Faced with a difficult political environment, the authorities’ pension reform proposed
in February seeks to buy time but does not secure the long run sustainability of the system.
The proposal would (i) reverse some of the recent benefit top-ups, (ii) transfer to the public sector
over half of contributions and private pension system assets (reducing measured deficits and debt),
and (iii) offer lower-income contributors a flat pension. However, preliminary calculations suggest
that it would not materially reduce the NPV of future unfunded pension liabilities, while introducing
legal risks given public opposition to nationalization of private assets.
23.
There is an urgent need for the following additional steps to secure the sustainability
of the pension system in the face of looming population aging pressures:


Parametric reforms to increase the retirement age and contribution rates (key to supporting
long-term fiscal sustainability in the PAYG component and social sustainability in the DC
component). Steps to better-align the number of years of contributions with benefits would also
be important, especially if they are accompanied by measures to encourage formal employment.



Greater coverage through an expansion of the means-tested basic universal pension and
incentive schemes and other steps to encourage labor force formalization.



A credible commitment to fund projected pension deficits from general revenue sources. The
evolution of pension deficits over the long run would depend on the strength of the parametric
reform package and coverage objectives.

FINANCIAL SECTOR STABILITY, DEEPENING, AND
INCLUSION
24.
Stress tests suggest that financial buffers are adequate to contain most risks. The
largest banks are international banking groups, which currently enjoy access to foreign financing,
and the system is characterized by very limited interbank exposures, which reduces the risk of
internal contagion. At the same time, this structure exposes the sector to external risks. The central
bank (BCR) and the Financial Superintendent (SSF) have run credit and liquidity risk sensitivity tests
which suggest adequate resilience of the system to stress scenarios.
25.
The authorities have made good progress on implementing the financial reforms
recommended in the 2010 FSAP, the 2014 Financial Stability Strategy, and other TA reports
but a substantial agenda remains.


Emergency liquidity backstops. While dollarization helps contain currency and interest rate risks,
it can amplify liquidity risks. Importantly, in the absence of sufficient lender of last resort (LOLR)
capacity and robust bank resolution structures, institution-specific liquidity shocks could have
systemic repercussions. And relying on high institution-specific buffers reduces the capacity of
banks to lend to the economy. A plan for a liquidity fund based on a partial pooling of the
banks’ liquid assets is nearing completion, which could be helpful in addressing non-systemic
liquidity needs, but coordination and governance issues need to be fully resolved. Staff
encouraged the authorities to credibly increase annual budget allocations to the LOLR, revive
and expand an IDB credit line for the LOLR that has expired, and resolve the remaining hurdles
to establishing the liquidity fund in consultation with stake-holders. Also, given the key role of
the central bank in the operation of the LOLR its financial position should also be protected.



Regulation and supervision. Coordination between the financial supervisor and the central bank
has improved. Risk-based supervision is being implemented, and the implementation of Basel III
has been initiated. The process of extending the supervisory perimeter to smaller and
cooperative banks and savings and loans associations (to encompass 90 percent of deposits in
that sector) is ongoing and will need to be completed.



Bank resolution and crisis management. In line with staff advice the authorities are finalizing a
strategy to mitigate weaknesses while comprehensive legislation that thoroughly addresses the
key challenges is developed. Staff encouraged the authorities to expedite progress in both areas,
noting that the legal reforms should make the Systemic Risk Committee permanent, strengthen
crisis prevention and bank resolution authority and procedures, clarify procedures for the
cooperative financial institutions, abolish the three-day notification to a bank before taking
resolution measures, and strengthen legal protection for supervisors. Also, domestic interagency
coordination as well as cross-border cooperation should be strengthened with clear and
comprehensive MoUs between relevant agencies. The preparation of contingent bank-by-bank
recovery and resolution plans should be accelerated. Finally, the deposit insurance agency

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

EL SALVADOR

should be strengthened by increasing bank contributions and clarifying protocols for its role in a
crisis.
26.
There was agreement that financial deepening and advancing financial inclusion could
have a meaningful impact on both growth and poverty (Figure 5). 6 Household access to financial
services is relatively low with only 34 percent of individuals holding bank accounts. Steps to increase
mobile banking and improve dispute resolutions mechanisms could boost the penetration of
banking services, and in this regard staff welcomed the recent passage of the Financial Inclusion
Law. However, staff also stressed that recent legal changes limiting the acquisition, transfer, and
storage of debtor information in credit bureaus increase credit risks and intermediation costs in the
financial system, and should be reconsidered. A modern law and improved corporate financial
reporting standards are needed to support the expansion of the securities market, which could help
pension funds increase returns and improve pricing and liquidity of government debt.

To date the loss of correspondent banking relationships has been manageable. Some
larger international banks have left, but have been replaced by other, regional, banks, with the
overall nominal value of the correspondent lines broadly unchanged thus far. The authorities
continue to work to maintain sound AML/CFT standards, and maintain active engagement with the
US Treasury in this area. A recent bank collapse in Honduras amid money laundering charges by the
US government appears to have had no impact on El Salvador, but has heightened concerns and
increased regulators’ supervisory vigilance. Staff argued for quickly undertaking contingency
planning to delineate the authorities’ response in the event of a broader loss of correspondent
banking relationships.

The authorities broadly concurred that investment and inclusive growth can be
improved by forging social consensus around sound policies that:


Enhance the flexibility of wages and prices, given the fully dollarized economy. In this context,
staff recommended that it would be advisable to contain minimum wage increases until there is
clear evidence of rising productivity. The authorities responded, however, that a balance would
have to be struck given the need to increase incomes of the poor and rural populations.



Ease barriers to entry and competition, curb anti-competitive practices such as price fixing in key
sectors, including air transport, pharmaceuticals, iron, and agricultural markets such as sugar,
rice and fertilizers, and improve the staffing and sanctions effectiveness of the Competition
Superintendent. Lowering entry barriers in transport and electricity sectors would help reduce
utility and logistics costs.



Boost educational attainment (particularly for secondary and vocational education) by creating
the necessary fiscal space and improving accountability for results.



Reduce crime and corruption (including by effectively implementing the AML/CFT and anticorruption frameworks)—the authorities’ plan “For a Safe El Salvador” unveiled in early 2015,
and recent follow-up plans, lay out a comprehensive strategy, but financing (estimated at 1.7
percent of GDP annually) is a key bottleneck.

Staff encouraged the authorities to press on with their 2014–19 plan which targets potential growth
of 3 percent, taking advantage also of the FOMILENIO II grant from the U.S. and the funding for the
“Northern triangle” countries to raise productivity and competitiveness.

STATISTICS

Data provision is adequate for surveillance. Staff encouraged the authorities to publish
revised national accounts in line with their public commitment and best practices. The technical
work is nearing completion and the authorities have requested Fund assistance in crafting an
appropriate communication strategy ahead of publishing the improved data.

STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
El Salvador continues to suffer from significantly lower growth than neighboring
countries amid low investment, high crime and emigration, and weak competitiveness. Several
factors appear to be contributing to the low growth rate, but along many dimensions El Salvador is
not materially different from neighboring countries except for the interrelated forces of high crime
and emigration. Most likely, the low growth is the result of the complex interaction of several factors
that reduce the expected return to investment, reduce labor supply, and increase uncertainty, and as
such resolving low growth will require action along multiple fronts. The low-growth in turn feeds a
number of vicious cycles: it hinders efforts to reduce the high crime rate and improve educational
attainment; encourages outward migration and weakens labor force participation; and creates fiscal
pressures (as social demands continue to increase while fiscal revenues remain subdued). Moreover,
political gridlock is an obstacle to even incremental reform.
31.
Strong efforts are needed to address rising fiscal risks. Without a resolution of the
parliamentary impasse blocking external financing, the authorities are likely to reach the limits of the
domestic system to finance the budget toward the end of this year, raising the prospect of
disorderly adjustment. Moreover, substantial frontloaded fiscal adjustment is needed to reverse the
upward trajectory of public debt, entrench fiscal sustainability, and create space to credibly fund the
public LOLR and the authorities’ crime prevention strategy over the medium term. In addition, the
authorities’ current pension reform proposals should be adjusted to include parametric changes
essential to ensure the long run fiscal and social sustainability of the system as the population ages.
32.
The authorities have made good progress in financial sector reforms, but there
remains an important unfinished agenda. While dollarization helps contain currency and interest
rate risks, it can amplify liquidity risks. Thus, annual budget allocations for the LOLR should be
credibly increased, and the IDB credit line for the LOLR facility revived and expanded. Also, the
hurdles to establishing the bank liquidity fund should be resolved in consultation with stake-holders.
Progress in risk-based supervision should continue, and the supervisory perimeter extended to
smaller financial institutions. The bank resolution and crisis management framework should be
strengthened as soon as possible by a comprehensive legislative reform to address various
weaknesses, clarifying the authority, protocols, and legal protections of regulators.
33.
Investment and inclusive growth can be improved by forging social consensus around
sound policies that: enhance the flexibility of wages and prices (including by limiting increases in

sectors, including air transport, pharmaceuticals, iron, and agricultural markets, and improve the
effectiveness of the Competition Agency; create fiscal space and improve accountability to boost
secondary and vocational educational attainment; reduce crime and corruption; and reduce utility
and logistics costs by allowing greater competition in those sectors.

Staff recommends that the next Article IV Consultation be held on the standard 12month cycle.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to
materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks
surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30
percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of
concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities.

Annex I. Implementation of Fund Policy Advice
The 2014 Article IV Consultation focused on reaching social and political consensus to enhance
growth and social objectives, while pursuing a much needed fiscal adjustment and reforms to
improve the investment climate. Directors recommended:
 Reaching broad political and social consensus to address economic inequalities and low
economic growth. While there is broad consensus on the objectives of reducing inequality and
increasing underlying growth, there is little political agreement on the means to achieve these
aims. Political intransigence is obstructing short- and medium-term reforms to support stability
and growth.
 Implementing fiscal consolidation while protecting social spending to lower the deficits by
3.5 percentage points of GDP in 2015–17 to stabilize the public debt ratio. Consolidation efforts
have not been sufficient with the 2014–15 deficits falling cumulatively by around 0.7 percent of
GDP reflecting lower current transfers and capital expenditures.
 Promoting a better investment climate to achieve higher, private-sector lead growth.
While progress on diversifying the energy mix and improving security (in recent months) has been
made, the political gridlock is preventing meaningful progress on expanding investment and
creating sustainable fiscal space to achieve security and social objectives, as well as making
meaningful progress on reducing red tape.
 Improving the financial institutional framework for the banking sector, including the legal
framework and appropriate safety net for banks. Risk-based supervision is being implemented
and short-term legal fixes have been identified while a new banking sector law is being prepared.
A bank liquidity pool decree is nearly complete but progress on financing LOLR capacity has not
been made.

Annex II. El Salvador: Debt Sustainability Analysis (Higher Scrutiny Case)
The debt stock is estimated at around 61 percent of GDP at end-2015 and is set to rise to 73 percent of
GDP in 2021 under current policies.7 The drivers for the increase include relatively high fiscal deficits,
low growth, and rising interest rates. While the gross financing requirement is not high compared to
other emerging markets, it is elevated for a fully dollarized economy. Susceptibility to growth shocks is
an additional risk. Shortcomings in pension system design and uncertainty over the proposed pension
reform are sources of significant long-term risks that are exacerbated by population aging over the
next few decades. Vulnerabilities are moderated by a relatively high maturity of existing debt, a stable
investor base, and the fact that some of the public debt (14 percent of GDP) was issued to pre-finance
future pensions obligations.

A. Key Assumptions
Debt definition. El Salvador’s public debt is defined as the sum of gross debt of nonfinancial public
sector (including explicit pension-related debt) and the external debt of the central bank (currently
about ½ percent of GDP). This definition aims to better capture quasi-fiscal liabilities (relating to
public enterprises and the public financial sector) due to the large role of a fiscal backstop under a
dollarized economy’s funding constraints. The definition of the nonfinancial public sector debt as
reported by the Ministry of Finance excludes liabilities of municipalities and some public enterprises.
Growth. The baseline reflects the estimated growth potential of around 2 percent. Susceptibility to
shocks (including natural disasters and external economic shocks) is a downside risk.
Fiscal policy and financing. The baseline scenario assumes no fiscal adjustment and no pension
reform, with the primary deficit rising gradually largely reflecting generous public wage indexation
for certain key sectors. The headline deficit would increase above 5 percent of GDP in the medium
term, also due to the higher interest bill from rising debt and (US LIBOR-dependent) servicing costs.
The scenario assumes that unidentified financing gaps are filled with long-term loans from official
and private creditors. Alternatively, the debt profile could become riskier from the financing
perspective, reflecting a growing share of short-term debt. The proposed pension reform has
significant implications for short-term headline debt and deficit dynamics, but a relatively minor
impact on long-term debt sustainability.

B. Results and Assessment
Baseline results. The public debt ratio would reach 73 percent of GDP in 2021, staying on an
upward trajectory thereafter. The gross financing needs would average 8–9 percent of GDP,
increasing to 11 percent of GDP in 2019 due to a Eurobond repayment that year.

7

Staff estimates public debt threshold for El Salvador within the 40–50 percent range (see IMF Country report 15/13).

32

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

EL SALVADOR

Drivers. The upward debt dynamics are driven by real interest rates and primary deficits
(contributing about 2¼ and 1¼ percent of GDP on an annual basis respectively). Real GDP growth
would reduce the ratio by less than 1½ percent of GDP annually.
Assessment. Most standard debt profile characteristics are of concern (see heat-map). Moreover,
the heat-map on balance may understate risks: (i) the threshold for gross financing (15 percent of
GDP) does not take into account funding constraints of full dollarization; and (ii) the measured share
of “foreign currency” debt (close to zero) reflects the legal adoption of the US dollar, not the implied
benefits of issuing an own-currency.
Mitigating factors. Unlike many countries, El
Salvador has pre-funded some of its future pension
liabilities (but the overall assessment of the pension
system is less reassuring (see below)). Existing debt
has a relatively long average debt maturity (12 years)
and a stable investor base (over one-half of the debt
is held by domestic pension funds and official
creditors) – in the latter aspect, the heat-map may
overstate risks from “nonresident holdings.”
Remittances are over 16 percent of GDP. The
authorities believe that GNDI would be a better
denominator than GDP, and have provided alternative
calculations.

Stress tests. Real GDP, interest rate, and contingent liability shocks have a relatively significant
impact. Hence a “combined macro-fiscal shock” would be particularly challenging. The vulnerability
to a rise in global interest rates has been recently reduced with the interest rate on pension bonds
being de-linked from LIBOR in February 2016, though this has increased interest payments in the
baseline scenario. If there is greater recourse to short-term borrowing (assuming that one-half of
the projected financing gaps is filled with short-term borrowing), public gross financing needs
would rise to 15 percent of GDP in 2021.
Idiosyncratic risks and issues. These include: (i) a potentially substantial one-off downward revision
of nominal GDP; (ii) pension-related liabilities, estimated at around 100 percent of GDP in NPV terms
(there is also the need to recognize as public debt recognition bonds already issued equivalent to
6 percent of GDP); (iii) potential assumption of enterprise debt; (iv) municipal debt that is not
officially recorded as public debt (around 2 percent of GDP); and (v) contingent liabilities from future
PPP projects (the PPP law is relatively new, adopted in 2013).
El Salvador’s pension system would be a key additional driver of the long-term debt dynamics.
Under current rules, the system would increase spending over the next 15 years by about ½ percent
of GDP relative to the assumption of constant primary balance, as the actuarial deficit is projected to
increase over the next few years. After 2030, fiscal pension spending burden is expected to ease, but

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

33

EL SALVADOR

this assumption would depend on the pension system surviving in the current form, and the
proposed pension reform would change this conclusion. Significant long-term population aging8 is
expected to put an additional burden on pension and health expenditure, not least due to pressures
of significantly increasing the low coverage in both systems.

8

El Salvador is so far in a demographic “sweet spot,” but the share of population over 64 is projected to increase
from 7 percent now to 16 percent in 2050 and 29 percent in 2100. Emigration of the young population can
exacerbate those trends.

1/ Public sector is defined as non-financial public sector, including external central bank debt.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over U.S. bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Annex III. External Assessment
El Salvador’s real effective exchange rate (REER) is assessed to be moderately overvalued. Non-price
indicators also point to diminished competitiveness.

Since 2001, the CPI-based REER has appreciated by 6
percent. This appreciation is due to a 10 percent real
appreciation vis-à-vis the U.S. (El Salvador’s largest
trading partner buying 47 percent of exports), while a real
depreciation with respect to Guatemala and Honduras (the
second and third largest trading partners accounting each
for 14 percent of exports) offset somewhat this
appreciation.

IMF’s multilaterally consistent estimates suggest that El Salvador’s REER is moderately weaker
than the level consistent with medium term fundamentals and desirable policies:

percent of GDP in 2015).
The EBA-lite External Sustainability (ES) estimate compares projected medium-term CA
with the level that stabilizes the external position (i.e., IIP) at its current level (-60 percent of
GDP) or at somewhat improved level (-50 percent of GDP). This approach suggests an
overvaluation of 11 percent of GDP, if the IIP position is to be stabilized at -50 percent of
GDP.

The EBA-lite REER estimate based on existing fundamentals and desirable policies that
would affect the REER directly or indirectly through changes to the CA balance points to a
REER which is broadly in line with fundamentals and desirable policies.

El Salvador’s investment climate faces multiple
challenges. According to the World Bank’s Doing
Business indicators, El Salvador ranks poorly relative
to other countries in Central and Latin America in
starting a business, dealing with construction permits,
access to and cost of electricity, protection of
investors, and paying taxes. El Salvador ranks 125 (out
of 189 countries) in terms of regulations on starting a
business. It has a very low new business entry density
compared to the LA-5 and other CAPDR economies.
According to the Global Competitiveness indicators,
El Salvador lags behind other CAPDR and LA-5
countries in terms of the institutional and macro
environment, labor market efficiency, financial
market development, higher education, and
innovation. The WB-OECD Product Market
Regulation indicators also suggest that there are
certain barriers to entrepreneurship (e.g. license and
permits system), and to trade and investment. In
addition, state control in certain sectors may hinder
market entry and a level playing field for all
enterprises. According to Salvadoran think tank
Fusades business surveys, uncertainty and
crime/extortion are the most important factors
explaining the weak business confidence in El Salvador.

El Salvador’s labor costs are on the rise. Labor costs
have been rising since 2008, and, if the recent
government-proposed increase of 118 percent in
minimum wage in agriculture (and around 20 percent
in other areas) passes and is binding, that would entail
significant increases in labor costs that would erode
the competitiveness of businesses.

Gross financing needs are large. While the oil price fall contributed to reduce the current account
deficit, the external gross financing requirements were still high at 14 percent of GDP in 2015. In the
medium term, gross financing requirements are projected to peak at 17.5 percent of GDP in 2019
and stabilize at 15.5 percent of GDP, reflecting high current account deficits and an increase in the
amortization on private sector external debt (and amortization of public long-term bonds in 2019).
The net international investment position (IIP)
IIP Composition, by Instrument
(in percent of GDP, based on IIP data from EWN database)
remains significantly negative. In 2015, the net
IIP was -64 percent of GDP and is projected to
worsen further to -80 percent of GDP in the
medium term. Large current account deficits are
backed by a rapid accumulation of private and
public sector liabilities, mostly concentrated in FDI

Exchange Rate Arrangement. The U.S. dollar is legal tender and circulates freely. The dollar is used
as a unit of account and a medium of exchange, with no limitations. All payments may be made in
either dollars or colones. The BCR has the obligation to exchange colones for dollars upon request
from banks, at a fixed and unalterable exchange rate of C8.75 per U.S. dollar. As a result, El Salvador
has an exchange rate arrangement with no separate legal tender category. El Salvador has accepted
the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system that is free
of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
1.
Collaboration. In the context of the joint management action plan (JMAP) for Bank-Fund
collaboration, the IMF team led by Daniel Kanda met on several occasions with the World Bank team
comprising Mrs. Manuela Francisco (Program Leader) and Mr. Fernando Im (Senior Country
Economist) to discuss El Salvador’s main macroeconomic challenges, identify macro-critical
structural reforms, and coordinate the work of both teams.
2.
Macroeconomic challenges. The teams have agreed that the challenges facing El Salvador
are to safeguard fiscal sustainability, deepen financial reforms, and boost growth and shared
prosperity. The priority is to place the public debt-to-GDP ratio on a declining path and reduce the
government’s financing needs. Improvements in competitiveness and the business climate are
needed to unleash the growth potential of the dollarized economy and elevate standards of living.
3.
Structural reforms. Based on this shared assessment, the teams have identified four macrocritical structural reform areas:

6



Fiscal sustainability. The fiscal consolidation strategy should comprise expenditure and
revenue reforms to lower the fiscal deficit, while raising infrastructure, security, and other
social spending. In particular, the increase in current primary spending ratio recorded since
the global crisis of 2008-09 should be reversed, including subsidies and wages, and the tax
effort should be aligned with country peers. The pension system should also be put on a
sound financial footing. A fiscal responsibility law, a modernized medium-term fiscal
framework, and improved tax and customs administration could usefully underpin the fiscal
adjustment strategy.



Public financial management. The focus should be on: (i) adopting a medium-term
expenditure framework; (ii) introducing a unified budget for the nonfinancial public sector;
(iii) broadening coverage of autonomous and decentralized institutions; and (iv) improving
cash and public debt management. By resolving these weaknesses, the authorities’ ability to
control public expenditure, and execute investment and other priority spending will improve.



Financial system. The priority should be to strengthen its crisis preparedness and increase
financial intermediation by: (i) making operational the central bank’s lender-of-last-resort
facility and setting up an additional liquidity fund; (ii) shifting to risk-based supervision and
improving cross-border consolidated supervision; (iii) addressing deficiencies in bank
resolution procedures and strengthening the deposit insurance scheme; (iv) improving the
legal framework for El Salvador’s capital markets; and (v) promoting broader financial
deepening.



Competitiveness. There is a need to boost domestic investment in El Salvador, which for
many years has remained low in terms of GDP and compared to regional peers. Weaknesses
in areas such as security, education, and innovation, and lack of private participation in large
infrastructure projects weigh on investment and growth.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

EL SALVADOR

4.
Division of labor. Based on this assessment, the IMF and the World Bank agreed to support
the authorities’ efforts in the following areas:

5.

6.



Fiscal sustainability. The IMF (the Fund) will continue to provide advice on macro-fiscal
issues, including fiscal consolidation, and technical assistance (TA) to strengthen tax
collection and reduce evasion. Building upon previous TA on tax policy, the Fund support
will focus on improving control of large taxpayers and enhancing auditing capacity, as well
as strengthening customs control while facilitating trade through risk-management
schemes.



Public financial management. The Fund will further assist the authorities in implementing
medium-term expenditure framework, setting up a treasury single account, and enhancing
capabilities in debt sustainability analysis, and the analysis of fiscal implications of pension
reforms. The World Bank is planning to undertake a public expenditure review. The two
institutions will collaborate on improving budget procedures, including in the context of the
fiscal responsibility law.



Financial system. The Bank and the Fund will continue to cooperate as needed in assisting
the authorities in implementing the 2010 FSAP Update and 2014 Financial Stability strategy
advice. The Fund will provide assistance with norms and procedures to shift to risk-based
supervision, cross-border consolidation supervision, and the liquidity policy of the central
bank. The Bank completed a mission on the Developmental FSAP module in March 2016 and
will continue to provide assistance in these areas, including financial sector infrastructure,
public and development banks, capital markets, and insurance. The two institutions will
collaborate on the financial sector aspects of the pension system and financial inclusion.



Competitiveness. The Fund will also assist the authorities in strengthening the framework
for public-private partnerships and managing potential fiscal risks through regional
seminars. The World Bank has also been working to strengthen the legal framework for
public-private partnerships and to improve the investment climate. The World Bank is in
addition providing TA to build the institutional capacity for technology and innovation.

Information sharing. The teams have agreed to share information on progress in the above
macro-critical structural reform areas.
Work programs. The following table lists the teams’ work programs.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of May 2016)

A. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts: National accounts data are based on 1990 weights and compiled under the
1968 SNA, although a project is underway to transition to the 1993 SNA and the most important
recommendations of 2008 SNA for the country, with 2014 as new reference year. The project also
envisages the publication of quarterly national accounts by expenditure, which are currently
available only on an annual basis.

B. Data Standards and Quality
El Salvador is a subscriber to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since 1998.
El Salvador is taking a flexibility option for the periodicity of the labor market and wages/earnings
data category and will continue at this time to publish annual data with a timeliness of one quarter
after the end of the reference year. A data ROSC was published in December 2004.

EL SALVADOR

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
11

Statement by Mr. Jimenez Latorre, Executive Director for El Salvador
and Mr. Pacheco, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director
June 20, 2016
The Salvadoran authorities thank staff for the constructive and frank engagement on the
occasion of the Article IV consultation. They consider the report objective and clear in
depicting the main economic and social issues the country faces. In fact, they coincide with
most of the assessment of the different sectors and policies with some nuances on the
approach and timeliness of the report.
The authorities concur that insecurity and low investment are relevant factors to explain El
Salvador’s low potential growth. They believe any fiscal consolidation plan should take into
account at least three key particularities of the Salvadoran economy. First, dollarization has
helped maintain inflation under control but has eliminated the scope to undertake monetary
and exchange rate policies and has also reduced flexibility to face external shocks as well as
natural disasters. Second, the scarcity of development funds constrains a smoother
consolidation path. Finally, a series of negative cycles between low growth, fiscal imbalances
-including pension system- and low development, poverty, inequality and social inclusion.
Recent Developments
The country is enjoying the windfall from low oil prices and the U.S. economic recovery
which was reflected in the decrease of the current account deficit from 5.2 percent of GDP in
2014 to 3.6 percent in 2015. Electricity price has gone down markedly which is helping
business competitiveness and families’ income. Inflation continues under control at
0.86 percent (Apr. 2016). Driven by investment (private and public) and consumption, growth
is on track to end 2016 within a range of 2.3-2.6 percent. This projection is reinforced by the
behavior of other variables: (1) Credit to private sector has grown at 5.3 percent, similar to
2015, with corporate credit growing at 6.9 percent (Apr. 2016), faster than consumption
credit. (2) Public investment at USD230.5 million (Jan.-Apr. 2016) has grown at 33.9 percent
compared with the same period last year. (3) Remittances are growing at 6.8 percent (Jan.Apr. 2016) compared with the same period last year.
While political gridlock has been a constant barrier for needed reforms, the recent approval of
USD152 million earmarked to strengthen domestic security proves that political agreement
can be achieved and sends a positive signal for the oncoming reform agenda.
Fiscal Policy
The authorities concur on the need to pursue fiscal consolidation and agree that without
measures debt could rise to unsustainable levels. They are planning a fiscal adjustment of
2.5 percent of GDP -close to staff’s recommendation- balanced between revenues and
expenditures measures. A large adjustment might jeopardize country stability since cuts on key

2
social expenditure and investment would be needed. The authorities find the adjustment period
(2017-2019) proposed by staff tight, given El Salvador’s known low-growth problem and that
fiscal uncertainty is not the main factor in explaining it –as rightly asserted in the report.
Absent of financing to smooth the adjustment period, growth would be markedly hurt.
The authorities concur that, given the need to increase growth, efficiency on taxation is a
relevant issue. They will continue looking for options to introduce less-distortionary
progressive taxation. Unlike staff, the authorities consider that the yield of taxes on bank
transactions and telecommunications is not negligible and their distortionary effects are not
currently extreme. In the case of the telecommunication tax, it is levied on consumers who
currently own 11 million mobiles. (Salvadorans own almost two mobiles each on average.)
Proceeds from this tax are earmarked to increase law enforcement and security spending which
is key to counter recent uptick in crime. The bank transactions tax is relevant to the treasury
(USD80 million) while credit to business grew at 6.9 percent during the first four months of
the year.
The government and staff share most of the measures on tax policy. They agree on the
importance to introduce less-distortionary progressive taxation to wealth, property, and high
inequitable pensions. They also concur on increasing personal income tax rates for the highest
earners and reduce the corporate tax rate while broadening the base. In the case of increasing
the VAT rate they would use it as a last-resort measure given its well-known regressive
effects and above-mentioned recession risk.
With regard to the expenditure control measures, the authorities in principle agree with the idea
laid out in the report to limit wage indexation to increases below the rate of inflation.
However, they are examining options for the lower-income tiers since minimum wages are
about USD250 per month and the low-income consumer basket grows at a higher rate than the
CPI. They need to protect this segment of the population in order to avoid impact on poverty
and exacerbate income inequality. The authorities have taken advantage of low oil prices to
reduce subsidies in transport, electricity and LPG. They agree there is space to continue
strengthening the energy subsidies targeting. The government is analyzing other ways to create
fiscal space in order to strengthen security and social spending.
In addition, the authorities are negotiating a pension reform initiative in order to reduce the
short-term financial gap. They recognize that further reforms would be needed to restore
long-run sustainability of the system, including parametric changes, but further political
support is still needed.
Financial Sector
Current levels of financial buffers are sufficient to contain mayor risk, as demonstrated by
the different sets of stress tests run by the central bank and the financial superintendent.

3
Despite growing credit to the public sector, credit to the private sector has been showing
healthy rates of growth. The withdrawal of correspondent banking relations has been
manageable; while some international banks have left, they have been replaced by large
regional banks. Most of the risks are self-contained by the sector’s structure or alleviated by
the authorities’ actions. International and large regional banks maintain a strong presence, in
fact, currently about 90 percent of the remittances flows pass across these banks. Supervisory
vigilance has been tightened and the authorities keep close collaboration with international and
bilateral initiatives on tax compliance. The AML/CFT framework keeps improving and
fulfilling international standards and the authorities are ready to act should any regulatory gap
persist or new international standards are brought up.
The authorities continue working on the establishment of the lender-of-last-resort facility
(LOLR) with the support of MCM Department’s technical assistance. There is agreement
that the central bank should coordinate and manage the facility so final details are being
worked out.
Finally, the report characterizes the current political scenario generally as one of gridlock and
polarization, mentioning this as a constrain even to incremental reform. The authorities would
have preferred a more cautious approach to the domestic political environment to better serve
the dialogue to advance needed structural reforms. The government is working on building
political consensus, they are negotiating a financial plan with the main opposition party in order
to swap short-term domestic bonds (LETES) for Eurobonds and to attain Congress’
endorsement of external loans. Agreements were also reached on security funds, as described
above.
