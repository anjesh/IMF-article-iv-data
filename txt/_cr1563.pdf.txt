STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND FOURTH AND FIFTH REVIEWS UNDER THE EXTENDED
CREDIT FACILITY ARRANGEMENT AND REQUEST FOR
WAIVER OF NONOBSERVANCE OF PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
AND MODIFICATION OF PERFORMANCE CRITERIA

KEY ISSUES
Context: Recent economic outcomes have been adversely impacted by exogenous
shocks: below average rainfalls lowered agricultural production, while the unfavorable
security situation in neighboring countries disrupted trade across borders and required
significant fiscal expenditures. Growth is estimated to rebound to 6.5 percent in 2014,
from 4.1 percent in 2013, but with population growth at 3.9 percent a year, poverty
remains pervasive. Presidential elections are expected in mid-2016.
Program: Performance under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) program (approved on
March 16, 2012 in an amount of SDR 78.96 million, 120 percent of quota) has been
mixed. All performance criteria (PCs) were met at end-December 2013 and end-June
2014, except for the PCs on domestic financing which were missed at both test dates, as
a result of a shortfall in external financing and unexpected security and food
expenditures. At end-December 2013, the indicative targets (ITs) on domestic arrears
reduction, basic fiscal balance, and revenues were met with large margins, but spending
on poverty reduction was missed. A number of fiscal ITs at end-June 2014 were missed
due to unforeseen security and food expenditures. The structural reform agenda
continues to advance, albeit with further delays in implementing some measures to
strengthen public financial management.
Article IV consultation: Discussions focused on the inclusive growth agenda, in
particular on: (i) enhancing food security, (ii) improving trade flows to enhance growth
and food security; (iii) promoting the middle class for inclusive growth; and
(iv) improving financial intermediation and inclusion.
Outlook and risks: The medium-term outlook appears favorable, with robust growth
benefitting from important natural resource sector investments. However, the outlook is
vulnerable to risks from both domestic and external environments, including potential
spillovers from the security situation in the region and climatic shocks. New borrowing
arrangements will need to be managed prudently to contain debt vulnerabilities.

NIGER

Staff views: Staff supports the authorities’ request for waivers for the unmet PCs on
domestic financing on the basis of corrective actions aimed at improving revenue
collection and containing spending. Staff recommends the completion of the fourth and
the fifth reviews under the ECF-supported program. Completion of the reviews will result
in disbursement of an amount equivalent to SDR 11.28 million.

CONTEXT
1.
The political and security situation remains fragile, with high domestic vulnerabilities.
Spillovers from conflicts in neighboring countries and the increasing presence of terrorist groups
along the 1,500 km border with Nigeria and across the country continue to place substantial strains
on socio-political stability and required a reallocation of fiscal spending toward security. Security
risks are compounded by continued widespread food insecurity exacerbated by a fast growing
population—the economy still largely depends on subsistence agriculture where frequent drought,
flooding, inadequate irrigation, and limited modern inputs hold back productivity growth.
Development indicators are improving somewhat, including a significant reduction in child mortality
rates in the last several years, but poverty remains pervasive. Niger is ranked last in the UN Human
Development Index for 2013. Presidential elections are expected in 2016.
2.
The authorities have advanced their reform agenda, drawing on staff’s advice during
the 2011 Article IV consultation. In line with staff’s advice to improve the business climate, efforts
have been stepped up. These led to the drafting of a decree establishing a one-stop-shop dealing
with the advantages in the investment code and the recommendation of an Administrative Arbitral
Committee for Fiscal Litigations in the 2015 budget law, a bureau to advice small- and medium-size
enterprises on access to business financing was established, a public-private partnership law was
adopted and supported by a related technical coordination unit and that on the tax and accounting
system governing public-private partnerships. Some progress has also been made in strengthening
debt management: Quarterly reporting on debt flows and stocks is underway; the Inter-Ministerial
Committee on Debt Management met twice and is working on internal working rules and charting a
debt management strategy. However, progress has been slow in formulating a medium-term fiscal
framework.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK AND RISKS, AND
PROGRAM PERFORMANCE
A. Recent Developments
3.
Economic activity slowed in 2013, but has rebounded in 2014. GDP growth for 2013 is
estimated at 4.1 percent, as below average rainfall and the regional security situation1 held back
growth despite the rapid expansion of oil production, reaching an average of 18,000 barrels per day
from 13,000 barrels per day in 2012. Growth is estimated at 6.5 percent in 2014, largely driven by
agriculture and government infrastructure projects, while inflation remains subdued (Table 1).

4.
Government food programs helped alleviate the impact of the poor harvest in 2013,
with inflation remaining low. Government food programs designed to alleviate food insecurity
were effective in offsetting the poor harvest in 2013. These programs include the creation of cereal
stocks, the sale of subsidized cereals, the targeted distribution of free food, and the 3N initiative (les
Nigeriens Nourrisent Les Nigeriens) mainly aimed at fostering agricultural production. The authorities
estimated the total cost of domestic food programs in 2013 to be around CFAF 112 billion, of which
about only CFAF 13 billion were covered by donors. The authorities reported that donors’ support
fell short because of competitive demand at the international level (Syrian, Libyan, Central African
Republic crises). Inflation, dominated by swings in food prices, was contained to 2.3 percent in 2013
(Table 1) and 1.3 percent in June 2014.
5.
The fiscal deficit narrowed in 2013, reflecting under-execution of expenditures, but
the fiscal position has deteriorated in 2014. Despite a shortfall in uranium fiscal receipts, total
revenue increased by 1.2 percentage points of GDP in 2013, mainly reflecting progress in revenue
administration and exceptional revenue from the oil sector (approximately CFAF 20 billion,
0.6 percent of GDP).2 To compensate for higher security-related spending (CFAF 38.9 billion in 2013,
1.1 percent of GDP), the authorities contained the increase in capital expenditures (Tables 2, 3). The
overall fiscal deficit (commitment basis, including external grants) was 2.7 percent of GDP compared
with the program projection of 5.6 percent, mainly reflecting under-execution of capital expenditure.
The authorities reduced domestic arrears by CFAF 22.4 billion or 0.6 percent of GDP in 2013.
Reflecting continued expenditure pressures and weak revenues at end-June 2014, the basic fiscal
deficit has widened, but arrears reduction was CFAF 9.5 billion.
6.
To address critical vulnerabilities, the authorities have sought to scale up
infrastructure spending through increased borrowing. Scheduled bond issuances on the regional
market amount to CFAF 275 billion in 2014-2016. Bond issuance receipts will be partly used for
additional infrastructure investments to reduce flooding risks and food insecurity, for increased
capacity in the education and health sectors, and to offset revenue shortfall from the security
situation in neighboring countries and the resulting terrorist activities adversely affecting trade
flows. Amounts of CFAF 93.3 billion (2.3 percent of GDP) were already issued in 2014. The remainder
of the bonds will be issued in the next two years, of which CFAF 121 billion in 2015 and
CFAF 61 billion in 2016. A master facility of US$1 billion was signed with China EximBank on
September 30, 2013 and approved by the National Assembly; the facility is earmarked for
infrastructure projects.
7.
Growth in monetary aggregates slowed in 2013, but increased at end-June 2014,
reflecting improved economic activity (Table 4). The expansion of broad money and credit to the
economy decelerated considerably in 2013, driven by lower GDP growth and a reduction in
short-term credit. At end-June 2014, broad money increased by 10.7 percent relative to end-2013,

reflecting continued accumulation of foreign assets as well as a strong increase in net domestic
assets driven by an increase of private sector credit. This evolution of the external position mainly
depicts the level of repatriation of export earnings from mining and oil, mobilization of external
financing and subscriptions by regional banks for securities issued by Niger on the regional bond
market and the recovery of recorded fund mobilization by mining companies. Inflows were however
tempered by outflows for payments of imports of goods and services and debt service. At the end
of June 2014, domestic credit increased by 11.9 percent relative to December 2013; credit has been
mainly allocated to trade, transport and telecommunications, public works, and manufacturing,
including water and electricity.
8.
The current account deficit remains large. The current account deficit (excluding grants) is
estimated at 17.9 percent of GDP in 2013 (compared to 18.7 percent in 2012—Table 5). This reflects
the fact that the growth of exports was outpaced by the rise in imports of goods and services
related to investment projects in the extractive industries and public works. The overall balance has
resulted in a large surplus owing to high foreign direct investments and project grants and loans
leading to an increase of Niger’s contribution to the net foreign assets of the West African Economic
and Monetary Union (WAEMU). End-June 2014 monetary survey suggests a surplus of the balance
of payments of CFAF 26.6 million.

B. Outlook and Risks
9.
Niger’s development strategy—as laid out in the Plan de Développement Economique
et Social (PDES)— envisages leveraging its natural resource wealth into a dynamic and
balanced sustained inclusive growth process. Implementation of the strategy requires large-scale
investments to overcome longstanding obstacles to growth (SIP—Natural Resource Boom for Niger:
From Public Investment to Sustained Economic Growth) : ongoing projects to complete the Kandadji
hydroelectric dam and the exploitation and processing of coal from Salkadamna are designed to
address deficiencies in energy supply; and the launch during this period of the regional rail loop will
provide a strong and lasting link between Niger and its neighbors, with an historic opportunity to
provide a permanent solution to the country’s isolation. Challenges are clearly numerous and
diverse, but four stand out: (i) food security; (ii) security and governance; (iii) development of
human capital; and (iv) infrastructure development.
10.
Under this development strategy, the medium-term outlook looks favorable. Growth is
expected to average 5.6 percent in 2014-16 and 8.5 percent in 2017-19 as two large natural resource
projects—crude oil export and uranium production—are scheduled to begin in 2017/18 and late
2019, respectively. In 2017, oil and mining output and exports are expected to increase significantly,
and natural resource-related fiscal revenue should increase sharply (Table 3).3 On the external side,
3

Contract negotiations with AREVA, the largest uranium mine which has been operating since 1971, were completed
in May 2014 and are consistent with the provisions of the 2006 mining code, including the mines becoming subject
to customs duties, the payment of VAT, and being managed by a Nigerien. The impact on fiscal revenues may,
however, be modest due to the sharp decrease in uranium price, to US$38 per pound in 2014 versus US$148 per
pound in 2008.

the decline in oil prices in the second half of 2014 will increase the current account deficit over the
medium-term relative to previous estimates (about 0.7 percent of GDP in 2015), resulting in a lower
but still significant accumulation of deposits at the BCEAO (Table 5).
11.
Risks to the outlook stem from both internal and external sources (Table 14 RAM). The
main near-term risks are a further deterioration in the security situation in the region, which could
severely impact FDI inflows, private sector activity, and fiscal outcomes. The timing, financing, and
feasibility of government involvement in projects in the extractive industry pose particular risks, due
to their inherent elevated uncertainty and the authorities’ limited implementation capacity given
difficulties in the oversight of the sector. Finally, Niger remains vulnerable to climate shocks,
commodity price volatility and limited predictability in donor support and low project execution
rates. Although the (PDES) financing gap was almost closed (96.6 percent), donors indicated that
less than 30 percent of resources were mobilized, due to the slow pace of project execution. Though
Ebola-related risks are so far contained, they could be disastrous, should they materialize.
12.
The exchange rate remains broadly in line with fundamentals, but structural indicators
suggest competitiveness concerns. Model-based assessments do not suggest significant current
account disequilibria or real effective exchange rate misalignments (SIP—External Stability
Assessment) (Text Table). However, broader measures of competitiveness point to persistent
weaknesses in the business climate: The 2014 Doing Business report ranks Niger 176 out of 189
countries as Niger moved two notches down compared to the 2013 ranking. For instance, Nigerien
firms face more severe challenges than average WAEMU and SSA in (i) trading across borders;
(ii) starting a new business; (iii) resolving insolvency; and (iv) dealing with construction permits.
WAEMU’s gross international reserves are adequate at around 5 months of imports of goods and
services at end-December 2013.4

C. Program Performance
13.
Program performance was mixed, partly reflecting the impact of external shocks. All
PCs were met at end-December 2013 and end-June 2014, except that on domestic financing, which
was missed at both test dates on account of unexpected security and food expenditures and a
shortfall in external financing (Tables 6, 7). At end-December 2013 all ITs were met, except the floor
on poverty reduction.5 For end June-2014, the ITs on the basic fiscal balance and total revenues
were missed as the budget responded to adverse security shocks, underperformance of customs
revenues, and lower donor support. The floor on poverty reduction spending was also missed. This
missed IT mainly reflects the reorientation of spending to address pressing security needs as well as
a shortfall in external financing.
14.
The structural reform agenda is advancing, but with some delays on key measures to
improve public financial management (Tables 8, 9). In particular:
•

Treasury Single Account: The survey of bank accounts for the Treasury Single Account (TSA)
undertaken in 2012 helped identify most inactive or irregular bank accounts, but this survey
became obsolete (MEFP, ¶ 35). Staff and the authorities propose to replace the existing
structural benchmark on TSA implementation with intermediary steps in line with the
recommendation of an upcoming IMF short-term TA mission on the design of the TSA after the
authorities complete the update of the Treasury accounts census (Table 10).6

•

Exceptional spending: Slippages were observed in limiting exceptional spending, which
reached 5.3 percent of committed expenditures (0.3 percentage point more than the structural
benchmark at end-December 2013), due to unexpected expenditure for medical evacuation
mission fees. However at end-June 2014, the exceptional spending limit was largely met,
representing only 1.5 percent of total spending.

•

Budget execution: An action plan was put in place to speed up budget execution, including
decentralizing the procurement system and implementation authority to line ministries, and to
facilitate timely and better circulation of information on the status of the bidding processes.
However, the execution of total expenditure is still low: at end-June 2014 only 33 percent of
annual expenditure was executed, though timeliness of budget allocation releases has improved:
In 2014, the Budget Office released in the first month of each quarter, the credit of the quarter.
Steps have also been taken to produce quarterly cash and commitment plans and to
computerize the expenditure approval process system (MEFP, ¶ 35).

5

Spending on poverty reduction is composed of priority sector spending such as education (around 50 percent),
agriculture (14 percent), health (13 percent) and transportation (11 percent).
6

In addition, work remains to be done to complete the legal framework allowing the transfer of credit balances to
the single account.

Debt management: Quarterly reporting on debt stock and flows is underway. The
Inter-Ministerial Committee on Debt Management has met twice and is charting a strategy for
debt management and internal working rules for the committee; and the General Directorate of
Debt Management published the third quarter report on Debt Management in November.

STRENGTHENING FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY AND
ADVANCING THE INCLUSIVE GROWTH AGENDA
In the context of mixed program performance due to exogenous shocks, and policy implementation
problems, policy discussions focused on strengthening fiscal stability through more sustainable budgets
in 2014 and 2015, while advancing the inclusive growth agenda.
15.
Ranked last in the UN Human Development Index and facing regular significant
external shocks, Niger faces significant development challenges. Medium-term economic
prospects look favorable, but hinge on the uncertain returns from resource sector and infrastructure
projects and fiscal institutions remain weak. Recently contracted loans significantly affected the debt
profile. To address these issues, policy discussions focused on near-term policies to strengthen fiscal
sustainability and medium-term policies to take opportunity of the resource revenues to advance
the inclusive growth agenda.

Near-Term Policies
A. 2014 Fiscal Policy
16.
New spending pressures have required adjustments to the 2014 budget and fiscal
program design. Specifically, a revised budget approved by the National Assembly in August 2014,
provided conservative revenue estimates, and accordingly expenditures were adjusted. However the
basic balance has been relaxed by 1.3 percent (compared to the last review) to accommodate higher
spending financed by regional securities issued on the regional markets; this implies a modification
of the ceiling of domestic financing (Table 7). Specifically:
•

Revenues: Overall revenues were reduced by 5.5 percent of GDP7 largely due to delays in
implementing new telecom taxes and shortfalls in customs revenue that were adversely
impacted by regional security. Potential telecom revenues of CFAF 216 billion (5.5 percent of
GDP) included in the initial budget did not materialize. Customs revenues have underperformed
due to deteriorated security conditions at the borders which disrupted trade flows. The revised
framework includes additional nontax revenues and financing of CFAF 16 billion (0.4 percent of
GDP) of royalties and signature bonus related to the sale of oil exploration rights in the Agadem
block and CFAF 34 billion from the sale of a 3G telecom license to a telecom operator. In view of

7

However, the net reduction is around 4.1 percent as nontax revenue from a sale of a telecom license came late in
the year to temper a potential decrease.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGER

the increase of exceptional revenues and to address future exogenous shocks, staff and the
authorities agreed to increase the buffers at the BCEAO to CFAF 38.7 billion, from
CFAF 13.6 billion in the second and third reviews.
•

Spending: Current budgetary spending was increased slightly to accommodate additional
security expenditures, with a significant increase in investment. Additional spending of
0.4 percent of GDP, is envisaged on goods and supplies related to Niger’s new regional military
commitments:8 1.2 percent of GDP to meet needed infrastructure investments to mitigate food
insecurity and flooding risks; and an allocation of 0.4 percent of GDP to cover mandatory
National Retirement Fund costs. Increased investment will be financed by domestic
sources—with the support of BCEAO, the authorities have issued CFAF 93.3 billion (2.3 percent
of GDP) in 2014 on the regional security market—and increased budget assistance from the
World Bank and the European Union. However, given limited capacity reflected in significant
under-execution of capital expenditure in the first half of the year, the revised fiscal framework is
built on a more conservative target on capital expenditure than the authority’s revised budget
proposal. Reflecting the higher performance observed in the reduction of domestic arrears (in
the amount of CFAF 9.5 billion) in the first half than the program target, the authorities have
increased their annual target of domestic arrears reduction to CFAF 10 billion.

17.
The authorities also recently replaced a 36-year old presidential plane. Documents
provided to staff suggest an allocation of CFAF 21 billion (0.5 percent of GDP) for the purchase of
the plane in the 2013 budget. However, given slower procurement procedures than expected, cash
payments started in 2013, and the remainder was paid in 2014 (albeit recorded in the 2013 budget),
financed by residual balances of the 2013 budgetary allocation that had been transferred to a
special deposit account at the BCEAO (MEFP, ¶ 9). However, as payments have been inappropriately
expanded beyond the complementary period in 2014, the authorities have been taking corrective
measures with regard to the respect of the complementary period and on stopping commitments
on time (MEFP, ¶ 42). For 2014, the Minister of Finance issued an order stopping all budgetary
commitment by the end of November. In addition, over the medium term, the authorities
committed to improve the investment management system by speeding up implementation of the
action plan of the 2012 organic law on public finance laws (MEFP ¶ 42). The adoption of this organic
law is also part of Niger’s commitment to implement provisions aimed at strengthening regional
integration by harmonizing budget reporting.

B. The 2015 Budget and Fiscal Policy
18.
The authorities are keen to address priority needs in education, health, and
infrastructure. This needs to be balanced with implementation capacity and resource availability. A

series of priority sector projects9 has been identified encompassing both externally financed ones
(though requiring some domestic financing), as well as solely government financed projects to boost
agriculture production. Execution of these projects would result in larger domestically financed
investment by about 0.9 percent of GDP in 2015, compared to the second and the third reviews’
program targets. Some risks may still arise from budget execution as the amount provisioned for
food insecurity appears low given preliminary estimates for the food deficit.10
19.
The strategy aims at containing the basic fiscal deficit11 to 3.7 percent of GDP in 2015.
In line with the government’s aim to diversify the economy, Niger’s fiscal strategy is predicated on
three main pillars: (i) macroeconomic stability; (ii) structural and public financial management
reforms; and (iii) investment in priority sectors (MEFP, ¶ 29). To that end, the government will sustain
its fiscal efforts to increase revenues while exercising restraint in current spending in order to move
gradually to a zero basic deficit, consistent with the WAEMU convergence criteria. In 2015, however,
to ensure room for continued high level of public investment to meet priority spending, the basic
fiscal deficit is projected to rise slightly to about 3.7 percent, consistent with debt sustainability.
•

Revenues: The agreed framework reflects enhanced tax collection efforts which result in an
increase of tax revenues from 16.9 percent in 2014 to 17.7 percent in 2015, while it sets a more
prudent nontax revenue baseline at 0.9 percent of GDP. Exceptional revenues are expected from
the sale of another 3G license and other bonuses from oil exploration permits, and capital
investments have been identified that would be undertaken once those revenues materialize.

•

Expenditures: The authorities are seeking to further accelerate public investments in priority
sectors. Expenditures will gear more toward capital spending (health, education, and
infrastructure), while current spending would decrease slightly. The agreed fiscal framework
envisages a 0.4 percent of GDP increase in capital spending relative to 2014, thereby
sequestering a portion of discretionary spending. The framework targets more realistic externally
financed capital expenditure than the draft budget given the low execution rate of capital
spending.

•

Financing: External financing needs are projected at CFAF 512 billion (excluding amortization
and debt relief), which is anticipated to be met by CFAF 222 billion in loans and CFAF 290 billion
in grants, including CFAF 109.4 billion in budget support (MEFP, ¶ 30). Domestic financing would
largely come from bonds issuance on the regional market of CFAF 121 billion (2.9 percent of
GDP), consistent with the issuance schedule agreed with the BCEAO.

9

Projects are linked to the 3N initiative implementation, and the large infrastructure projects such as a regional
railroad, the Kandadji dam, and a power project at Salkadamna.
10

Preliminary estimates by the authorities of food deficit are around CFAF 45 billion (1.1 percent of GDP), while the
budget provision seems to cover around 50 percent of this amount.

Realization of the 2015 fiscal objectives requires effective implementation of revenue
administration measures. The authorities noted that key tax administration measures are already
well advanced: the General Tax Administration (DGI) will reinforce tax audits and the tax registration
system, and step up efforts to resolve disputed tax payments; customs revenues will increase due to
ongoing reforms (including the establishment of a single interconnection server linking up regional
offices) and reinforced administrative measures in controlling exemptions under a new performance
contract; loopholes of tax exoneration will be limited; and to enhance accountability, performance
contracts are also being set between the Ministry of Finance and the Direction Générale du Budget
(DGB), the Direction Générale du Trésor et de la Comptabilité Publique (DGTCP), the Direction
Générale des Douanes (DGD), and the Direction Générale des Impôts (DGI) (MEFP, ¶ 33,34).
21.
Important reforms in customs administration are also underway. Steps have been taken
to accelerate the migration to ASYCUDA WORLD and thus allow for improved revenue collection
and oversight of exemptions. The authorities have obtained a no-objection from the World Bank,
which will enable the start of work with UNCTAD to implement the project before the end of 2016.
They intend to implement by the middle of 2015, an intermediate, locally developed application for
the control of exemptions; and enhance the electronic transit system and cooperation with transit
countries.
22.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ efforts to increase spending for priority sectors.
(SIP—Fiscal Policy and Development: Spending priority in Niger). Over the last three years (2011-14),
the authorities have increased allocations to priority spending—specific targets were established in
March 2011 for health (10 percent of total mobilized resources), education (25 percent), water
(10 percent), food security (15 percent), and infrastructure (10 percent). However, actual allocations
have fallen short of expectations, with only so far 17 percent of the budget allocated to education,
while that of food security was around 12 percent, health (7.74 percent), water (4 percent), and
infrastructure (7 percent).
23.
Staff urged an increased focus on the
efficiency of spending. While acknowledging the
existence of significant infrastructure gaps, staff
noted that the envisaged level of capital spending
was very high—relative to capital spending levels
either in Niger or elsewhere in the region. Therefore
staff emphasized the need to place more focus on
efficiency of such spending. Particular concerns are
uncertainties in budget allocation and execution for
priority sectors. The authorities agreed that the
quality of spending (especially in the social sectors)
is critical for promoting growth and improving social
performance. To this end, they expressed the need

for further technical assistance in implementing a program budget and in applying new fiscal
strategies to better manage natural resource revenues, while noting their commitment to strengthen
project management capacity (MEFP, ¶ 41).

Medium-Term Policies
24.
Niger’s main challenge is how to use expected resource revenues for development.
Addressing development needs should be done while moving gradually to zero basic balance over
the medium term, consistent with the WAEMU criterion (SIP—Fiscal Policy and Development:
Priority Spending in Niger). The development strategy should respond to longstanding food
insecurity, high population growth which has resulted in an increasing share of school-age
population, and geographical proximity to conflict-affected fragile countries. Key priorities include
strengthening fiscal institutions to maximize the returns from Niger’s natural resource wealth,
promoting inclusive growth and mitigating vulnerabilities. These priorities are in line with those
defined in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and PDES.

C. Management of Natural Resources
25.
The critical role of natural resource wealth in realizing Niger’s broader development
agenda places a focus on ensuring a strong institutional framework. A new mining code—which
for example raised mining royalties from 5.5 percent to 12 percent, depending on profitability—was
introduced in 2006. In addition to its regulatory role, the government has also sought strategic
investment opportunities in the natural resource sector.
26.
Following the agreement in May 2014 with the French group Areva, all mining
companies now operate under the 2006 mining code. Under this agreement, the production
contract (for the uranium mines SOMAIR and COMINAK) which has been in operation during the
last ten years has been renewed for five more years and is subject to the 2006 mining code. It was
agreed that while this may not have a significant impact on revenues in the near term due to the
decline in uranium prices, bringing all producers into compliance with the 2006 mining code
represents an important step forward in the management of the natural resource sector, such as
preserving an ownership stake in the major uranium mines.
27.
Unfavorable market conditions have resulted in a delay of the start of production from
the new uranium mine Imouraren. The Imouraren mine, which would more than double Niger’s
output of uranium to around 9,000 tons a year, was scheduled to start production at the end of
2015. Niger’s government and Areva, however, have recognized that the mine would not be
profitable at current uranium prices12 and agreed to create a strategic committee to decide on a
timetable for the mine start up, should market conditions improve.

12

Following the financial crisis and the incident in Fukushima, the price of uranium has declined dramatically, passing
from CFAF 175,000 in 2007 to CFAF 35,000 in 2014.

14

28.
In the petroleum sector, additional measures are needed to put the SORAZ refinery on
a solid financial footing (SIP—Energy Sector Challenges in Niger). Improved commercialization of
refined products in neighboring countries and the elimination of unjustified costs helped the
refinery record a surplus at end-2013; the level of these positive results has not however been
sufficient to compensate the deficit recorded in 2012. The commercial viability of the refinery could
be strengthened through actions that have an impact on both the revenue and cost sides, including
a revision of the pricing of domestic-refined petroleum product sales. In restructuring, the
authorities intend to focus mainly on cost reduction and have identified several options, including
the possibility to replace Chinese workers with Nigerien workers. The authorities are also trying to
reduce debt service costs through the refinancing of the loan to build the refinery (US$880 million)
on concessional terms.
29.
Niger may become an exporter of crude oil. As oil reserves of the Agadem block are
estimated to exceed the production capacity of the refinery, the authorities have embarked on a
project for the export of crude oil. For this purpose a new transportation company (Niger Oil
Transportation Company—NOTCO) will be created in the coming months, with the government
participating in the capital of the company with a 10-15 percent share. Work on the construction of
a pipeline that will connect the fields of the Agadem block to the Chad-Cameroon oil pipeline that
was expected to start in 2014 is delayed for technical reasons and environmental disputes. The
project, with an estimated cost of about US$850 million, will be financed mostly through foreign
direct investments (FDIs).

D. Debt Management
30.
Despite the increased debt stock, the DSA suggests a moderate risk of debt distress13
(Niger: 2014 Debt Sustainability Analysis). Niger’s debt exposure has increased significantly since
2009, principally a result of government involvement in the financing of projects in the natural
resources sectors. The refinancing loan for the construction of the SORAZ refinery (in the amount of
CFAF 437.4 billion) included in the revised budget, if approved by the Chinese authorities in 2014,
would replace the existing private non-concessional funding of the refinery (which was 40 percent
guaranteed by the State), thereby leading to a steep increase in the stock of public external debt
(including guarantees) from 22.8 percent of GDP at end-2013 to a projected 32.7 percent of GDP at
end-2014. The master facility agreement contracted with China EximBank is earmarked for
infrastructure projects with higher economic rates of return, increased debt exposure and the overall
amount of the facility is expected to be disbursed within 8 years. Total external debt (including
private debt) will increase from 49.5 percent of GDP at end-2013 to 53.7 percent of GDP at
end-2014. Despite the increased exposure, the updated DSA suggests that the risk of debt distress
remains moderate.
13

The authorities’ own DSA covering the period 2014-34, prepared in August 2014 shows similar results: external
debt ratios remain below thresholds in the baseline scenario, but there are some breaches under alternative shock
scenarios.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

NIGER

31.
Staff and the authorities agreed on the next steps to further strengthen debt
management. The process of strengthening debt management was initiated earlier this year, with
the creation of the Inter-Ministerial Committee by the order of the Prime Minister in December 2013
to prevent the recurrence of non-concessional borrowing, covering both loans with non-traditional
borrowers and other non-concessional loans. The Committee has met twice this year due to lower
loan activities. The authorities expressed strong commitment to improve the functioning of this
Committee and to produce the periodical quarterly report on debt management. The authorities
committed to continue strengthening the database of public and private debt to improve their debt
management strategy.

E. The Inclusive Growth Agenda
Ensuring Food Security
32.
Repeated food crises have adversely affected Niger’s poverty, inflation, terms of trade,
and fiscal performance (SIP—Niger, Food Security for Macroeconomic Stability and Inclusive
Growth).14 Given Niger’s continued reliance on rainfed subsistence agriculture, climatic shocks result
in volatile food production and prices (Figure 1b), impacting food security, child malnutrition, and
poverty, making the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals less likely. Low yields and
high population growth aggravate grains deficit levels. Government policies have had limited impact
in reducing output and price volatility, with markets playing an increased role in shaping food prices
across countries (Figure 1c). Annualized fiscal costs were estimated at around 0.7 percent of GDP
between 2006 and 2008, among the highest in a group of 31 countries. Niger launched the
3N initiative of US$2 billion for 2010-15 to address food insecurity and improve agriculture
production and trade.

Prior to the 1980s, droughts were recorded on average every ten years, over the last 20 years they took place every
five years. Over 1997-2004, there were three crises, and over 2005-10 there was one bad year and a semi-bad one.

33.
Food security continues to have a substantial macroeconomic impact. The authorities
estimated the food deficit had amounted to 373,000 tons in 2013-14, almost equivalent to that of
the crisis years (2005 and 2010). Addressing such a deficit level required mobilizing the government
food program, in particular its different social safety nets (cash for work, moderate price sales, free
food) as support from the donor community fell short because of competitive demand at the
international level (Syrian, Libyan, Central African Republic Crises): only 10 percent was provided by
donors, this time. Staff noted the potential market distortions from government intervention, but
the authorities indicated that government purchases are usually made at competitive prices to
provide incentives for higher agricultural production, albeit in the short run there could be cases of
depressed food prices. In addition, the authorities highlighted the role of the Office des Produits
Vivriers du Niger (food operational government arm) in increasing accessibility and availability of
food products to landlocked areas. In turn higher access and availability help communities to remain
in place, thereby improving access to education and other public services.
34.
Staff stressed the need to address structural causes of food insecurity. Staff agreed with
the authorities that the current food program is well targeted to address short-term issues such as a
food crisis, but does not address the structural dimension of food insecurity. Therefore, staff advised
to leverage the anticipated expansion in resource revenues over the medium term to enhance
investment aimed at addressing food insecurity. In that regard, staff inquired on the progress of the
3N initiative and urged the authorities to step up resilience to food insecurity through increased
food production by targeting investment in irrigated agriculture and support of small-scale food
producers in line with the PDES. The authorities concurred that revenue windfalls from natural
resources should contribute to increase infrastructure investment in agriculture, in particular to
speed up the 3N initiative.
35.
The authorities are seeking to accelerate agriculture development and reinforce food
security. The authorities are examining options for accelerating the implementation of the
3N initiative, following completion of its review in November 2014. In addition, the government is
finalizing its national program for social and economic development (PDES) for the period 2016-20
that will also support progress in these areas. Staff strongly supported those objectives and
encouraged the authorities to improve coordination between the PDES and the 3N initiative to
improve efficiency and maintain long-term sustainability of public finances, while diversifying the
economy and reducing its dependency to non modern agriculture and vulnerability to weather
related shocks.

Enhancing Trade to Improve Growth
36.
Increased grain trade with neighboring countries could spur growth and enhance food
security. Niger has both formal and informal trade ties with neighboring countries, chiefly Nigeria,
that meet around 60 percent of Niger’s food deficits (SIP—Regional Trade and Food Security: Food
Crises in 2005 and 2010). Niger’s imports from Nigeria consist mainly of food and animals, while
Niger’s exports to Nigeria are sizeable with respect to GDP (6.3 percent on average in 2008-10).
Food trade flows have been limited by scarce information on grain markets, though Niger has made

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

NIGER

progress in improving the Early Warning System (EWS).15 Progressive integration of markets through
the reinforcement of regional integration mechanisms has also positively affected trade flows.
37.
The authorities recognize that expanding regional trade could foster inclusive growth.
Niger shares a long border with Nigeria, with the two populations having traditional ties and sharing
cultural values. The resulting proximity facilitates important official and non-official trade flows.
Niger exports onions, and livestock to Nigeria, and Nigeria’s trade flows to Niger are mainly grains,
helping to stabilize stocks and markets in Niger. The authorities stressed the missed opportunities
incurred as grains from Niger are bought by Nigerians at harvest time and later exported back to
Niger at higher prices. At the same time, the authorities stressed that as most of Niger’s exports are
raw materials (sesame, livestock), there are opportunities to move up the value chain through
investments in small processing units for exports. They also emphasized that the different cycles of
harvest of Nigeria and Niger bear opportunities for larger trade exchanges. However, they stressed
that the inconvertibility of the Naira to the CFAF franc constitutes an obstacle for a full development
of the commercial relationship between Nigeria and Niger.
38.
Staff emphasized the need to improve trade policies. Improved trade policies could help
to smooth movement of goods and lessen the need for higher costly stocks. Accordingly staff
stressed the need to minimize the costs associated with maintaining the Réserve Alimentaire
Stratégique, and the opportunity costs of the Stock National de Sécurité, albeit they play important
roles as Niger faces weather related shocks. To that end, staff urged the authorities to complement
food buffers by better circulation of goods through continued improvement of markets. In that
regard, the authorities reported that since December 30, 2013, the government has been
implementing policies to reduce non-trade barriers: (i) reduction of customs check points; (ii) better
definition of categories of control at check points; (iii) more leeway to get a fair arbitration in case of
abuse; and (iv) reduction of required supporting documents for exports and imports from 8 to 4 and
10 to 6 respectively. They stressed however, the need to preserve food buffers given the magnitude
of the shocks Niger faces, and the potential impact on food availability and accessibility of uncertain
trade policies in neighboring countries, particularly at times of regional shortages or due to regional
security events. The authorities also indicated the need to build a regional trade buffer as suggested
by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).

Promoting the Middle Class
39.
Niger’s middle class is small relative to sub-Saharan African (SSA) peers. Budget and
household surveys show that Niger’s steady growth over the past decade has helped reduce
poverty, lifting a number of previously poor households into the middle class (SPI—Inclusive Growth
Ahead of Oil Production)—estimated at 14 percent of the total population in 2010. With growth
driven by the natural resource sector and agriculture with private sector development constrained
15

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGER

by poor infrastructure and business environment, the middle class—a key sector for sustaining
growth—has been slow to emerge. In addition, well-paid jobs with good benefits are still scarce; and
social safety nets for education attainment, healthcare, and housing are still weak (SIP—Driving
Factors of Middle Class’ Bulge: A Cross-Country View).
40.
There are a range of estimates for the size of the middle class. The authorities recently
estimated the middle class at 45 percent of the total population against staff’s estimate of
14 percent. The differential reflects methodology: the authorities consider middle class as the
segment of the entire population that is neither poor nor belongs to the wealthiest segment of
society (usually defined as the richest 10 percent). Most of the middle class identified however is in
the floating class, 39 percent, and only 6 percent are in the core middle-class, closer to staff
estimates.
41.
Expanding the middle class can be achieved through accelerating economic
diversification. Based on international experiences on middle-class development, staff urged the
authorities to address key bottlenecks preventing the emergence of the private sector, including a
better business climate and broader financial inclusion (SIP—Financial Inclusion, Accessibility and
Development). Staff also stressed the need to develop human capital and to strengthen efficiency of
public investment and promote its integration into the budget. Staff highlighted that the concept of
middle class was only a partial indicator of the success of Niger’s development efforts as Niger’s
middle class mainly reflects the prevalent inequalities. A recent Niger budget-consumption survey
estimates show that concentration of household consumption is higher in urban areas, where the
consumption ratio between the wealthiest 10 percent and the poorest 10 percent is 6.3 percent as
compared to 3.7 percent in rural areas. However, the inequality between urban and rural areas is
equally larger: a poverty rate at the national poverty line of 55 percent in rural areas in contrast to
18 percent in urban areas (source: authorities based on the 2011 poverty survey).

Financial Sector Reforms
42.
Niger’s financial system and financial inclusion lag behind those of its peers (SIP-Niger:
Financial Sector Profile). Financial depth,
Figure 1d. Niger: Sectoral Credit Distribution and
proxied by M2 to GDP, is among the lowest
Contribution to Growth in 2013
in the world at 24 percent in 2013 against an
average of 37 percent in SSA and 30 percent
in the WAEMU. Credit to the private sector is
dominated by large corporations, while
agriculture, livestock, forestry and fisheries
sectors (which account for more than
40 percent of GDP) receive less than
1 percent of total bank credit (Figure 1d).

averages.

43.
Financial soundness indicators show that the overall banking sector is broadly sound.
Average capital adequacy ratios improved steadily during 2010-2013, reflecting government
injections of capital into state owned banks and (to a lesser degree) private capital injections, and at
end-2013 generally exceeded the regulatory threshold of 8 percent. However, one bank is not in
compliance with the new minimum capital requirement of CFAF 5 billion and four of the ten banks
do not meet liquidity norms as at end-August 2014. Credit concentration on the five largest
borrowers is very high at 128 percent of regulatory capital at end-June 2014, representing a major
source of risk.
44.
The limited development of the financial sector reflects a number of structural
constraints. The main factors are: (i) the limited monetization of the informal agriculture sector,
(ii) the incapacity of banks to discriminate among borrowers (due to imperfect information and lack
of formal documentation); (iii) limited savings reflecting extreme poverty; (iv) the recourse to lenders
in the informal sector; and (v) cultural/religious reasons. In this context, and considering the limited
excess liquidity in Niger’s banks, the increased borrowing activity of the government on the regional
market may cause further crowding out of the private sector.
45.
A financial development strategy has been adopted, seeking to address these issues.
The five-year development plan was drafted in 2012 drawing on the recommendations of the 2008
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) report prepared by World Bank and Fund staffs. The
authorities noted that the action plan, adopted in November 2014, prioritizes measures aimed at
increasing access, such as measures to broaden the territorial coverage of banks and microfinance
institutions, and to develop new financial products targeting the agriculture sector. The plan also
envisages measures to improve the functioning of the judicial system and enhance financial literacy.
The plan was recently updated and approved by the government (structural benchmark).

PROGRAM DESIGN, AND IMPLEMENTATION RISKS
A. Program Design
46.
The sixth and seventh reviews of the ECF arrangement will be based on the proposed
PCs and the structural benchmarks for end-December 2014 and end-June 2015, respectively
(Tables 7-10). Staff is proposing a modification of end-December ITs and end-December PCs
(1.4 percent of GDP for the PC of domestic financing at end-December 2014) in light of the
end-March outturn and the consequent increase in domestic financing to compensate revenue
shortfall and increased security and infrastructure spending.
47.
Niger’s capacity to repay the IMF remains adequate (Table 11), but there are risks to
program implementation. The major risks concern the regional security situation and its continued
spillover on Niger, rising debt burdens, and weather-related shocks.

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGER

B. Implementation Risks
48.
Risks to program implementation have risen. With local elections slated for 2015, and the
presidential and legislative elections in 2016, it is important to ensure that the fiscal stance and
other policies are not influenced by the election cycle. Security risks have yet to abate and are
placing substantial strains on the socio-political situation.
49.
In accordance with the safeguards policy requirements for regional central banks, a
quadrennial safeguards assessment of the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) was
completed in December 2013. The assessment found that the bank continued to have a strong
control environment and has, with the implementation of the 2010 Institutional Reform, enhanced
its governance framework. Specifically, an audit committee was established to oversee the audit and
financial reporting processes. Consequently, transparency has increased with more timely
publication of the audited financial statements, and the BCEAO is committed to International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) implementation by end-2014. The assessment also identified
some limitations in the external audit process and recommended that steps be taken to ensure its
adequacy.

STAFF APPRAISAL
50.
Despite many challenges, the Nigerien economy delivered positive growth in 2013 and
2014, with favorable medium-term growth prospects. Economic activity has been somewhat
resilient, given the very challenging and unfavorable security and climatic environment. Continued
efforts to increase the resilience of the economy to these shocks are important to ensure lasting
improvements in development outcomes. Inflation remains contained. In the face of a difficult
external environment with an increasing presence of terrorist groups and pressure on security
spending, major challenges remain to make growth more inclusive so as to reduce unemployment
and poverty over the medium term in the presence of a strongly growing natural resource sector.
51.
Ensuring fiscal sustainability, while addressing development and security spending
needs will require further strengthening of the fiscal framework. The government’s continued
commitment to contain borrowing and ensure that revenues materialize is critical, including through
the full implementation of the ongoing initiatives to improve tax policy and administration, reform
customs administration, and curtail exemptions. Steps to enhance public financial management
need to be sped up, including through reducing exceptional spending, but additional efforts are
also needed to significantly strengthen cash management. In strengthening the fiscal framework,
prudence should be exercised in including exceptional revenues in the budget and in undertaking
spending only as revenues materialize. Continued shortfalls in priority spending are regrettable and
call for strengthened prioritization of spending and improvements in budget execution.
52.
Establishing strong institutions and policy frameworks to manage revenues related to
the extractive industries is a key priority. The challenge for the fiscal framework is to strengthen
the prudent management of natural resources, taking into account commodity price cycles and the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

NIGER

need to ensure the efficiency of spending. The framework will also need to respond to the need to
devote more resources for infrastructure and reduce social gaps over time to help curb
unemployment and poverty. Continued efforts to enhance transparency in the sector are crucial. The
recent adoption of the 2006 mining code is a welcome step to increase government intake in
resource revenue, but more needs to be done to strengthen governance in the oil sector.
53.
Enhancing food security, leveraging on regional trade to increase growth, and
promoting the middle class could increase economic resilience. The government food program
to address food deficit is welcomed but more needs to be done and accelerating implementation of
the 3N initiative could support this by increasing investment in irrigated cropping, and other
support for small-scale producers. Removing trade barriers could also help to improve trade
relationships with partners as a source of additional growth, and promoting the middle class can be
a good way to accelerate inclusive growth. Given Niger’s vulnerabilities to food supplies and related
repeated shocks to the budget, adequate provisions to tackle food insecurity should be included in
the budget, and the structural causes of food insecurity tackled including through the 3N initiative.
54.
The exchange rate remains broadly in line with fundamentals, but structural indicators
suggest competitiveness concerns. Staff’s estimates do not suggest significant current account
disequilibria or real effective exchange rate misalignments. However, broader measures of
competitiveness point to persistent weaknesses in the business climate. WAEMU’s gross
international reserves are adequate at around 5 months of imports of goods and services at
end-December 2013.
55.
Niger’s macroeconomic statistics are broadly adequate for surveillance. Data provision
has some shortcomings due to lack of capacity, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Niger
participates in the harmonization WAEMU statistical methodologies and is part of a regional process
to strengthen national accounts; these projects have the support of the WAEMU Commission and
AFRITAC West. Staff encouraged the authorities to go forward, along these initiatives, in improving
the quality of statistics.
56.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ commitment to implement financial sector reform. The
recent approval of the decree needed to implement the financial sector development strategy,
elaborated with the assistance of the World Bank and other donors, is an important step and staff
encourages the authorities to speed up its implementation.
57.
Given the increase in external and domestic borrowing, establishing sound debt
management practices and efficient public investment is fundamental. While the improvement
in capital budget execution in 2013 was welcome, investment spending should be scaled up
cautiously, in order to ensure value for money and to contain debt vulnerabilities. In this connection,
recent institutional reforms to strengthen debt management should be pursued and the inner
working of the debt management institutions be made more efficient; this would in turn help
promote the efficiency of investment. Staff urges the authorities to urgently develop a medium-term
debt management strategy to guide its annual borrowing plan; this will be particularly important
given Niger’s plans for increased issuances of regional bonds. Investment spending should be

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGER

closely aligned to the implementation of the PRSP and its management improved through the
implementation of the action plan elaborated with FAD support in 2013 in that regard.
58.
Staff recommends the completion of the fourth and the fifth reviews. Based on the
corrective actions that have been taken, staff supports the waivers for the nonobservance of the
performance criteria on net domestic financing at end-December 2013 and end-June 2014,
modification of performance criteria of the end-December 2014, and the disbursement of the fifth
and sixth tranches under the arrangement for a total amount of SDR 11.28 million.
59.

It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the 24-month cycle.

In 2014, this includes a new project loan of CFAF 437.4 billion (11.1 percent of GDP) to refinance the loan for the construction of the SORAZ refinery.
The new loan was initially expected to be signed in 2013 but it has been delayed to 2014. The loan had previously been contracted by the refinery directly
and partly guaranteed by the government. The government will on-lend it to the refinery.

The special accounts include the financing on the National Retirement Fund, Priority Investments Fund, and Fund for Continuous Professional Development.
In 2014, this includes a new project loan of CFAF 437.4 billion (11.1 percent of GDP) to refinance the loan for the construction of the SORAZ refinery.
The new loan was initially expected to be signed in 2013 but it has been delayed to 2014. The loan had previously been contracted by the refinery directly
and partly guaranteed by the government. The government will on-lend it to the refinery.
Revenues minus expenditure net of externally-financed capital expenditure.

In 2015, CFAF 49 billion in exceptional revenue from the telecom and petroleum sectors is excluded from nontax revenue and an equivalence in domestically
capital spending is also excluded. Those spending will be executed only if the exceptional revenue materializes.

In 2014, this includes a new project loan of CFAF 437.4 billion (11.1 percent of GDP) to refinance the loan for the construction of the SORAZ refinery. The new loan was
initially expected to be signed in 2013 but it has been delayed to 2014. The loan had previously been contracted by the refinery directly and partly guaranteed by the
government. The government will on-lend it to the refinery. Projections of FDI for 2015-16 are based on the construction of a pipeline expected to come on stream in 2017.

Appendix I. Letter of Intent

Niamey, December 03, 2014

Madam Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington D.C., 20431
Madam,
1.
Niger continues to perform well despite the security situation in the sub-region and unstable
performance of the agricultural sector as a result of changing rainfall patterns. The security situation
in neighboring countries and the terrorist activities in Niger in 2013 exerted considerable pressure
on the country's socio-economic stability. As a result, the country was forced to commit troops to
support military interventions in the sub-region and enhance security within the country and its
borders. The military involvement weighed on the level of spending at the expense of social
priorities. Furthermore, a deficit agro-pastoral season, combined with these security developments,
had a direct impact on economic activities. Nonetheless, security measures undertaken by the
government, short-term remedial economic policies, the implementation of the Plan de
Développement Economique et Social (PDES) programs, as well as policies aimed at enhancing
irrigated agricultural production as part of the 3N Initiative (Nigeriens Nourish Nigeriens), continued
to support economic growth, estimated at 4.1 percent in 2013 and projected at 6.5 percent in 2014.
2.
Despite these difficult situations, the implementation of the ECF-supported program
progressed. Owing to security related spending in the context where external grants and loans were
lower than initially anticipated under the program, it was necessary to mobilize additional domestic
resources particularly on the regional financial market. Consequently, the performance criterion on
net domestic financing was not observed at end-December 2013 and end-June 2014. Nevertheless,
at end-December 2013 and end-June 2014, the performance criteria on payment of domestic
arrears and on new agreements for external loans were met. On the other hand, indicative targets
regarding the basic balance and total revenue were only met at end-December 2013 mainly due to a
shortfall in customs revenue. Similarly, the poverty reduction expenditure indicator was also missed
at end-December 2013 and end-June 2014, although the gap was low at end 2013.
3.
The government is determined to achieve the program objectives. The policies and
measures outlined in the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) hereto appended
should help achieve the program's objectives. In particular, structural reforms in revenue policy and
administration, and budget execution, the gradual normalization of the security situation, and the
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

conclusion of the negotiations with AREVA, and the subsequent signing of agreements governing
mining operations for the next five years providing more visibility to mining activities. These factors
are expected to enhance program implementation.
4.
The government is also committed to enhance debt management to ensure its sustainability.
In this regard, the government will implement measures required to develop an annual external
borrowing plan based on the status of preparation of ongoing projects. Furthermore, to strengthen
institutional coordination of loan agreements and investment program management, the
government will continue to improve the functioning of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Debt
Management (where the offices of the President, Prime Minister, Ministry of Finance and Ministry of
Planning are represented) to review and approve prior to signing, all external loan contracts with
non-traditional creditors, as well as non-concessional loans. In this regard, the government will
continue to implement the recommendation that calls for all new non-concessional loan
agreements to be signed jointly by the Minister of Finance and Minister of Planning. Close
adherence to these measures should foster compliance with the continuous criterion on
non-concessional borrowing.
5.
Improving budget execution will be strengthened. Considerable progress in budget
execution has been achieved with the deployment of financial comptrollers to various ministries, the
submission of 2012 and 2013 financial discharge bills to the National Assembly, and timely release
of budget allocations. The government is committed to undertake within the next three years, the
necessary steps for effective implementation of program budgeting as required by the 2012 organic
law and a number of other laws in order to enhance budget efficiency and transparency and to
support the government’s program to accelerate public investments. The government will request
technical assistance in this area from the IMF.
6.
In light of the corrective measures adopted to address the exogenous shocks that led to the
non-compliance with the performance criterion on net domestic financing at end-December 2013
end-June 2014, we request a waiver. The implementation of the measures outlined in the
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies should improve domestic resource mobilization,
which will in turn minimize recourse to bank financing.
7.
The Government of Niger appeals to the IMF to conclude the fourth and fifth reviews of the
ECF program so as to release the fifth and sixth disbursements under the ECF agreement for an
amount of SDR 11.28 million. We will consult with the IMF on our own initiative or upon request
prior to adopting any additional measures and if any changes were to be made to the policies
contained in this Memorandum. The Government of Niger will continue to cooperate with the IMF in
order to achieve the objectives of the ECF program.

Attachment I. Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies of the
Government of Niger
INTRODUCTION
1.
The present Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) updates the
Memorandum of the second and third reviews conducted in March 2014. It describes recent
economic developments, implementation of the ECF-supported program, macroeconomic outlook
and policies. The priorities and objectives of the ECF program focused on: (i) maintaining
macroeconomic stability; (ii) replenishing deposits in the Central Bank to enhance the economy’s
resilience to shocks; (iii) improving budget execution, including stepping up efforts to collect tax
revenue, and improving debt management; (iv) increasing transparency in the mining and oil
sectors; and (v) supporting private and financial sector development. These objectives are in line
with the Renaissance Program, the Government’s General Policy Statement, the 2012-15 Plan de
Développement Economique et Social (PDES) and the main objectives of the PDES 2016-20 which will
be specified after the formulation of the Niger Vision 2035 (SDDCI).

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
2.
The poor crop harvests experienced in the 2013/2014 crop year and the security
situation in the sub-region adversely affected economic performance in 2013, but the
situation improved considerably in 2014. In 2012, impressive real economic growth was recorded
at 11.1 percent, largely driven by macroeconomic stability, the start of oil production and the vitality
of the primary sector including subsistence agriculture and livestock. However in 2013, less favorable
rainfall combined with the security situation in the region and the effects of the terrorist attacks on
the Somair uranium production facilities, had a direct impact on economic growth estimated at
4.1 percent. Inflation was contained at 2.3 percent in 2013, in part due to the government food
program of selling cereals at moderate prices contributing to limit the increase of food prices.
Therefore, during the first semester of 2014 the price evolution was contained. Year on year inflation
was around minus 1.3 percent at end-June 2014. With a better distribution of rainfall in 2014,
agricultural production is expected to rebound and economic growth is projected at 6.5 percent in
2014 with an annual inflation of minus 0.8 percent, on average, and 0.9 percent, year on year.
3.
External sector accounts performed relatively well. In 2013, the current account balance
(including grants) was expected to record a deficit of 15.7 percent of GDP, a deterioration of about
0.4 percentage point of GDP, compared to 2012. This deterioration is largely due to deficits in the
balances of primary and secondary income. Growth in exports outstripped the growth in imports in
2013, resulting in a slight improvement in the trade balance. Preliminary data suggest a stronger
deterioration in the current account balance in 2014, arising from increased public works and
construction of the Niamey-Cotonou railway line.
4.
Following a decline in economic activity, monetary expansion decelerated in 2013. In
2013, the evolution of monetary aggregates was marked by strong growth in net foreign assets,
expansion of broad money, and a decline growth in domestic credit. Net foreign assets increased by

44

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGER

CFAF 102.4 billion driven by the net foreign assets of the Central Bank (CFAF 46.2 billion) and banks
(CFAF 56.2 billion). Net domestic assets fell by 5.8 percent, as a result of an improvement in the Net
Position of the Government (NPG), offset by an increase in credit to the economy.
5.
During the first half of 2014, the evolution of monetary aggregates maintained the
trend recorded in 2013. By end-June 2014, broad money grew by 10.7 percent compared to end
2013. This was due to a CFAF 43.3 billion accumulation in foreign assets, combined with a
CFAF 51.2 billion increase in net domestic assets arising out of increased credit to the economy and
an improvement in NPG.

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL PROGRAM AS AT
END-DECEMBER 2013 AND END-JUNE 2014
6.
Faced with numerous shocks to the budget execution, the implementation of the
program was mixed. Budget execution was impacted by additional security spending, shortfall in
customs revenue and low disbursement of external aid. The poor performance of customs revenue
was explained by among others, the return to administrative values in February 2013, the security
situation, especially in Nigeria, Mali, and Libya, as well as the slow pace in implementing reforms in
the customs administration. The former negatively affected trade flows and led to the reduction of
imports of certain high revenue generating products such as cigarettes and building materials.
Uranium production was also temporarily halted at the beginning of 2014. This situation of budget
execution required further recourse to domestic financing.
7.
However, all performance criteria at end-December 2013 and end-June 2014 were
met, except the one on net domestic financing (Tables 1, 2). The criterion on the reduction of
domestic arrears was met with a large margin throughout the period. At end-December 2013 and
end-June 2014, the government met its commitments regarding foreign debt, the continuous
performance criterion on external arrears accumulation and the continuous performance criterion
on new agreements on external loans contracted or guaranteed by the government with a maturity
of less than one year. Indicative targets on the basic balance and total revenue were met at
end-December 2013, but were missed at end-June 2014.
8.
Nevertheless, budget execution as at end 2013 remained broadly satisfactory. The
overall fiscal balance (commitment basis, including grants) recorded a deficit of 2.7 percent of GDP,
against the program target of 5.6 percent. Expenditures on net lending to refinance the Société de
Raffinage de Zinder (SORAZ) refinery, amounting to CFAF 437.4 billion (or 11.1 percent of GDP), for
which the approval of the Chinese authorities was not obtained by end 2013, were postponed to
2014. Accordingly, the basic balance, excluding grants, stood at minus 2.1 percent of GDP.
9.
Part of the 2013 budget execution included the purchase of a presidential plane. An
amount of CFAF 21 billion (0.5 percent of GDP) was included in the 2013 budget for this purpose. In
line with our procurement code, the process selected for the purchase was to award a direct
contract after reviewing competitive tenders. Four suppliers were thus consulted. The tenders were
examined by an ad hoc tender evaluation commission. All expenditure related to the plane went

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

45

NIGER

through the required phases (commitment, clearing and authorization). After the authorization had
been issued, because delivery of the plane was delayed, the funds were transferred into a holding
account on the books of the Treasury at the Central bank (BCEAO), in line with existing regulations.
A portion of the payment was made in 2013. The remainder was settled in two payments made in
2014. The use of this budgetary procedure to finalize payments in 2014 was justified by the fact that
certain provisions of the 2012 organic law on finance laws are not yet in force. With the assistance of
the IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD), we have already drafted an action plan that is currently
being implemented to improve our investment management system, by enforcing the organic law
on finance laws (see structural reforms and benchmarks). In addition, technical assistance is provided
by the World Bank to help strengthen our ability to select investment projects, financing sources,
debt sustainability and planning. Technical assistance also aims to support several reforms in
investment planning for the country. It also includes mechanisms for managing and monitoring
investments. In this context, a project to strengthen the capacity and the service delivery of US$40
million was negotiated with the World Bank.
10.
Spending on poverty reduction fell below the program objectives. Thus, at the end
2013, the indicative benchmark was missed by a margin of 1.8 percent of the program target
(0.18 percent of GDP); the spending specifically targeted the sectors of agriculture, infrastructure,
health, and education, as part of the government’s policy to support vulnerable groups. The target
was missed by 12.5 percent of the program objective (0.75 percent of GDP) at end June-2014 as a
result of delays in the disbursement of some budget support and project aids, below target revenue
performance and the continued demands for security spending.
11.
Furthermore, measures have also been taken to accelerate the implementation of the
structural reform program (Table 3). We have drafted quarterly budget execution and debt
management reports. Budget allocations for each quarter are now released before the end of the
first month of the quarter. Regarding the quarterly debt management report, the first and second
reports for end June 2014 and end-September 2014 have already been published. In line with the
circular issued by the Prime Minister, aimed at limiting expenditures executed without prior
authorization in all ministries, the ratio of such expenditures to total authorized expenditures has
stabilized at around 5.3 percent at end-December 2013, compared to a target of 5 percent and
1.5 percent at end June-2014.
12.
In the oil sector, the study to determine the route of the pipeline has been completed
and the option to go through Chad was chosen.
13.
Considerable progress has been made in implementing measures to establish a
Treasury Single Account (TSA): (i) identification of 1,954 accounts held in various commercial
banks (including 1,787 accounts of public administrative entities and 167 for public industrial
entities), representing total assets equivalent to CFAF 52.9 billion; (ii) issuance of an order by the
Ministry of Finance calling for the closure of irregular and dormant accounts; (iii) continuation of the
ongoing case-by-case review, in order to meet the benchmark regarding a Treasury Single Account.
The order concerning the transfer of these accounts to the BCEAO is yet to be taken (see section on
reforms). The survey of public bank accounts in the banking system needs to be updated, since the
46

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGER

last survey was carried out in 2012. We therefore intend in the coming months, to update the survey
using the experience of other West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) countries.
14.
We also intend to accelerate reforms in customs administration. While acknowledging
that the customs reform has been delayed, steps have been taken to accelerate the migration to
ASYCUDA WORLD and thus allow for improved revenue collection and oversight of exemptions. We
have obtained a no-objection of the World Bank, which will enable us to begin to work with
UNCTAD to implement the project before the end of 2016. Nevertheless, towards the middle of
2015, we shall deploy an intermediate, locally developed application for the control of exemptions;
and enhance the electronic transit system and cooperation with transit countries.

OUTLOOK FOR 2014 AND 2015
15.
The ECF program objectives are in line with the 2012-15 PDES. Indeed, the program will
allow the government to (i) provide basic infrastructure in energy and transport sectors, which
would help Niger overcome challenges associated with being landlocked and boost
competitiveness; (ii) implement public policies geared towards diversifying production, including the
establishment of development zones/centers; and (iii) build human and institutional capacities. In
line with the three-year economic and financial program for 2012-15, the ECF-supported program in
2014 has focused largely on ensuring macroeconomic stability, restoring economic growth and job
creation.

A.

Implementation of the Program in the Third Quarter of 2014

16.
Program implementation improved somewhat in the third quarter of 2014, compared
to the first two quarters and we intend to continue with these efforts during the rest of the
year. Through improved mobilization of nontax revenue, improved tax collection by the tax
directorate (DGI) and customs authorities, total revenue amounted to CFAF 523.4 billion at
end-September 2014, against a program target of CFAF 522.8 billion. During the same period,
expenditure and net lending amounted to CFAF 820 billion against the program target of
CFAF 782.7 billion. Compared to the expenditure in the revised budget law, there is an
under-performance of 7 percent at end-September. This consists of current expenditure amounting
to CFAF 444.1 billion and capital expenditure amounting to CFAF 375.9 billion.
17.
Consequently, the overall deficit (cash basis) deteriorated compared to the program
objective, standing at CFAF 300.7 billion against CFAF 263.6 billion in the program. The deficit
was mainly financed by external resources amounting to CFAF 214.9 billion and domestic resources
of CFAF 85.9 billion. For all external financing, grants accounted for CFAF 92.9 billion, including
CFAF 6.6 billion of budget support. Loans amounted to CFAF 131.5 billion, consisting primarily of
project loans. Domestic financing amounted to CFAF 85.9 billion, consisting of domestic bank
financing amounting to CFAF -11.1 billion and non-banking financing amounting to
CFAF 96.9 billion.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

47

NIGER

18.
We also fast-tracked the implementation of structural reforms. The implementation of
the structural reforms continues and the government is committed to fast-track the implementation
of the action plans to improve the execution of the reform program (see section D below): the third
quarter 2014 report on debt was published in November. Budget allocations were released before
July 14, while allocations for the last quarter of 2014 were released on October 10. The call for
international tenders for the selection of a company to construct the pipeline has been delayed as
negotiations on the terms of construction and operation are ongoing between Chad, Cameroon,
Niger, Exxon, and CNPC.

B.

Macroeconomic Outlook for End 2014 and 2015

19.
The short and medium term macroeconomic prospects are positive, even though
subject to various internal and external risks. The macroeconomic framework for 2014 and
beyond is based on an assumption of strong economic growth, underpinned by continued
expansion in the natural resource sector, increased public investment in infrastructure, and
implementation of the plan to accelerate the 3N Initiative (Nigeriens Nourish Nigeriens) all in the
context of an improved security situation. Thus, real GDP growth is expected to be around
6.5 percent in 2014 and 4.6 percent in 2015, and should reach an average of 5.6 percent in 2014-16
before accelerating to an average of around 8.5 percent over 2017-19. This growth dynamic reflects
the delay in the start of uranium production and exportation under the Imouraren project, which is
now expected in 2019 (when uranium prices are expected to recover) following the recent
agreement between the Government of Niger and AREVA.
20.
The current account is expected to deteriorate in 2015-18 as a result of the increase in
imports of goods and services related to the extractive industry and other development
projects. In terms of inflation, the continued decline in food prices following recent good harvests is
expected to bring down inflation to an average of about minus 0.8 percent in 2014. Inflation is
however expected to rise to about 1.6 percent in 2015. The macroeconomic outlook however
remains vulnerable to risks related to the regional security environment and climate shocks.

C.

Fiscal Policy and External Financing for 2014

21.
The 2014 budget adopted by the government aimed at supporting economic growth.
This budget orientation should help speed up the implementation of poverty reduction policies by
creating jobs and generating additional income. It should also help accelerate the implementation
of the PDES 2012-15. On the revenue side, the budget took into account additional revenue
expected from the telecommunication sector, estimated at CFAF 216 billion. Spending on priority
sectors such as education, health, and agriculture was expected to increase by nearly 47 percent,
while spending on infrastructure projects was expected to increase by 22.7 percent, based on the
initial budget. However, the budget does not take into account expenditure on net lending
amounting to CFAF 437.4 billion for refinancing the SORAZ refinery, initially scheduled for 2013 but
deferred to 2014, pending approval by the Chinese authorities. The overall fiscal deficit including
grants, but excluding the SORAZ loan is 5.6 percent of GDP, down from 2.7 percent of GDP in 2013.

22.
The non-realization of revenue from the telecommunications sector led us to adopt a
supplementary budget in order to neutralize and adjust expenditure. The expenditure
neutralization is consistent with our commitments in the second and third reviews. Nonetheless,
based on the technical progress made so far in the implementation of the project, we revised the
expected amount of revenue from the telecommunications sector downward to CFAF 40 billion. We
had undertaken to carry out this capital expenditure exclusively and only within the limits of the
revenue generated by the telecommunications sector. Accordingly, quarterly budgetary
appropriations to the various governmental agencies will be strictly based on revenue, excluding
that from the telecommunications sector. The supplementary budget also took into account the
CFAF 437.4 billion project loan for refinancing of SORAZ. It will still remain focused on the
government's objective of devoting a substantial share of resources to capital investments to drive a
dynamic economic recovery. The overall balance (commitment basis, including grants but excluding
the refinancing of the SORAZ refinery) should represent 5.6 percent of GDP with an increase in
government deposits at the central bank amounting to CFAF 38.7 billion to increase Niger's
resilience to shocks.
23.
Under the revised budget law, we have also launched our bond issuance plan for the
2014-16 period. In recent years, due to the security threats, the government has had to cut down
spending on priority sectors such as health, education, and infrastructure in favor of spending on
military equipment to support efforts to enhance security within the country and at our borders. We
intend to increase spending to priority sectors in the rest of 2014 and in the medium to long-term.
Consequently, like other members of the WAEMU, and with the support of the WAEMU’s unit in
charge of bond issuance, we have drafted a program to issue medium to long-term bonds
amounting to CFAF 275.6 billion spread over 2014-16. For 2014, we increased the Treasury bond
issuance from CFAF 25 billion (in the second and third reviews) to CFAF 93.3 billion to meet
additional capital expenditures and food security spending following poor harvests, and to cushion
the shortfall in customs revenue (see section on fiscal revenue). In 2015 and 2016 in line with a
sustainable path of the basic balance, domestic financing will include bond issuances of
CFAF 121 billion and CFAF 61.3 billion, respectively.
24.
The bond issuance plan will be in line with the debt sustainability thresholds; we will
speed up reforms to improve project management and absorptive capacity. In preparation for
the implementation of the bond issuance plan, we are undertaking reforms with support from
various partners to enhance our capacity to design, select, implement and evaluate investment
projects. Future bond issuance will depend on the success of implementation of these reforms. We
will speed up ongoing reforms to improve public procurement procedures and public finance
management, in order to enhance the capacities of our administration in project management.
25.
With the increased bond issuance in 2014, neutralization of revenue from the
telecommunications sector and increased efficiency in tax collection by the revenue
administration agencies, the revised budget will be consistent with the objectives of the
ECF-supported program. In the 2014 budget, fiscal revenue is estimated at 19.1 percent of GDP. At
the DGI, a significant improvement in revenue is expected with the organizational reforms and the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

49

NIGER

policy to reduce tax exemptions. The control of exemptions has already started to bear fruit: in 2013,
the level achieved was CFAF 73.6 billion against a target of CFAF 99 billion and a noticeable
improvement has been realized in the first half of 2014 (CFAF 45.2 billion against the target of
CFAF 108 billion). Combined with the organizational reforms of the tax administration, which is
already underway, the implementation of regulations for enforcing administrative measures should
significantly increase revenue generated by the DGI. For the DGD, the shocks arising from the
security situation in the sub-region on trade flows should result in revenue losses, estimated at
CFAF 10 billion.
26.
The underperformance of customs revenue observed during the first half of 2014 is
expected to be contained through the ongoing reforms: (i) the implementation of an electronic
customs transit system would increase revenue by approximately CFAF 1.8 billion; (ii) the
strengthening of ex-post control of customs declarations; (iii) the establishment of a customs office
at SORAZ; (iv) the improvement in customs cooperation with Togo, Burkina Faso, Benin, Côte
d'Ivoire and Ghana should strengthen the control of rules of origin within and outside the Union.
Taxes on goods and services should also increase significantly with the adoption of the new
threshold for VAT and the implementation of tax audits.
27.
For 2014, we expect to mobilize CFAF 137.6 billion in external budgetary financing in
the form of grants and concessional loans. CFAF 104.2 billion will be mobilized in the form of
grants including: CFAF 36 billion will be provided by the World Bank, CFAF 40.3 billion by the
European Union (including CFAF 8.2 billion for food security), CFAF 6 billion by the French
Development Agency, CFAF 13 billion by AREVA and CFAF 6 billion by other multilateral and
bilateral donors. Loans represent CFAF 33.4 billion, including CFAF 8.4 billion from the African
Development Bank and CFAF 25 billion from the Republic of Congo.

D.

The 2015 Budget

28.
For 2015, the Council of Ministers has adopted a budget aimed at supporting
investment, while containing current expenditure. The Government thus intends to continue to
speed up implementation of its poverty reduction program through job creation. In terms of
revenue, the budget includes exceptional revenue expected from the renewal of a 2G license and
the sale of a 3G license to one telecommunications operator and bonus from the sale of an oil
exploration permit.
29.
In terms of expenditure, emphasis has been put on priority sectors, including
infrastructure. The budget is geared towards enhancing the living standards of the population by
allocating resources to priority sectors such as (i) security of persons and property, (ii) urban, village,
and pastoral water supply, (iii) the 3N Initiative, including food security, (iv) infrastructure and
energy, and (v) education and health. Spending on education, health and agriculture is expected to
increase by 6.5 percent, while spending on infrastructure projects is expected to remain at about the
same level as in 2014. The overall budget deficit, (including grants but excluding net lending) would
be 6.6 percent of GDP, compared to 5.5 percent of GDP in 2014, the basic fiscal balance, excluding
grants will be 3.7 percent of GDP, and including grants will be 1.8 percent of GDP. Given that this is

50

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGER

in line with the agreed fiscal framework and we (the Government) commit to execute the 2015
budget in line with the program. We will adjust expenditure in line with the realization of
exceptional fiscal revenue, taking into account the absorption capacity.
30.
We hope to obtain grants and concessional loans from our development partners.
Budget support is thus estimated at CFAF 109.4 billion. Of this total grants amount to
CFAF 92.1 billion, comprising of the following: CFAF 37.3 billion from the European Union, of which
CFAF 8.5 billion to support food security, CFAF 6.5 billion from the AFD, CFAF 3.3 billion from the
ARTP Investment Fund, CFAF 35 billion from the World Bank and CFAF 10 billion from other
multilateral and bilateral donors. Loans, particularly from the African Development Bank (AfDB) are
estimated at CFAF 17.3 billion.
31.
The government commits to execute the budget using the basic balance as the anchor
in line with the framework agreed with the IMF. In order to meet the program target and in the
light of the concerns raised by the IMF regarding uncertainty related to the CFAF 49 billion
(CFAF 34 billion from a telecoms license and CFAF 15 billion from the sale of a petroleum block) in
exceptional revenue, the government commits to neutralize these revenues and an equivalent
amount of investment expenditure pending the realization of the exceptional revenue. Thus, of the
expected CFAF 49 billion, the government commits to carry out investment expenditure only to the
tune of the amounts actually collected. The materialization of these windfalls will be confirmed by
the BCEAO and the Treasury department upon receipt, to the IMF before its incorporation into the
TOFEs.

STRUCTURAL REFORMS
32.
The achievement of the aforementioned macroeconomic objectives will require
enhancing the implementation of the ongoing structural reforms and the implementation of
new structural reform measures. The public policies that we intend to put in place will focus on
strengthening domestic revenue mobilization, improving public finance management and the
business climate.
33.
In terms of fiscal revenue efforts, we intend to mobilize additional resources
equivalent to 0.8 percentage point of GDP in 2015. To achieve this objective, we will implement a
comprehensive restructuring of the revenue collection and administration agencies. One of the key
measures will include an establishment of a Performance Contract (PC) between the Minister of
finance on one side and authorities of the Budget Directorate (DGB), Treasury and Public Accounting
Directorate (DGTCP), Tax Directorate (DGI) and Customs Directorate (DGD) on the other.
34.
The established PC will outline the responsibilities of each party, setting specific
revenue and budget execution targets. This reform is principally aimed at overhauling the
expenditure chain and enhancing the efficiency of revenue collection agencies. In implementing
these measures, we shall seek technical assistance from the IMF. For example, the tax administration
reforms will include streamlining of the income tax system, making it more efficient and appropriate
for medium-sized businesses and for the control of exemptions. Reforms of the customs directorate

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

51

NIGER

should result in improved governance, better monitoring of the flow of goods and exemptions, and
enhanced control.
Public Finance Management
35.
The implementation of the action plan for public finance management will be
pursued, including through the following actions:


Limiting expenditure without prior authorization to a maximum of 5 percent of
authorized expenditure (This is a structural benchmark for each quarter): In the first half
of 2014, this expenditure was 1.5 percent of total expenditure compared to the target of
5 percent. These exceptional expenditures are mostly related to travel and medical
evacuation. We shall continuously remind all government departments and agencies to
strictly comply with this requirement.



Accelerating the pace of budget execution: The execution of expenditure, particularly
capital expenditure tends to be slow because of delays in procurement procedures and
other bottlenecks related to the project cycle. The government will accelerate the
implementation of measures to address constraints in the execution of the investment
budget, undertake reviews of expenditure programs, consolidate the activities of the budget
regulation and government cash flow monitoring committee, and establish a budget
committee to select priority expenditure items in order to improve efficiency of budget
allocations. Already during the 2014 fiscal year, significant progress has been made in the
release of credits; the credits for the first quarter were made available on January 16, in the
second and third quarters, credits were made available on April 14 and July 14 respectively.
For the last quarter credits were made available on October 10. In addition, the government
will take the necessary measures for the implementation of the plan to speed up the
utilization of investment credit allocations.



Implementing a Treasury Single Account (TSA): Progress has been made in this area: the
case-by-case review of dormant and irregular bank accounts will continue, with a view to
gradually closing them. To this end, following the inventory1 and the order of the Ministry of
Finance, the government had started to close some public bodies' accounts in commercial
banks. In addition, the government has developed administrative capacities (by training
officials in charge of the TSA project) to accelerate the implementation of the TSA.
Nonetheless, there are challenges related to the absence of a legal framework for
transferring of the account balances to the BCEAO.



Establishing a single account, updating the inventory of accounts and designing the
structure of the Treasury Single Account: The inventory of accounts is now obsolete and

1

The survey identified 1,954 accounts in different banks locally (including 1,787 for Public Administration
Organizations (EPAs) and 167 for Industrial Public Organizations (EPI) with a total asset value of CFAF 52.9 billion.

52

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGER

will need updating, given that the first inventory of accounts was conducted in March 2012.
The government commits to update the inventory of accounts based on the experience of
other African countries.


Improving the budgetary process: Parliament has approved the bill on fiscal transparency
to improve and strengthen expenditure tracking. In addition, we will continue to prepare
quarterly reports on budget execution on the basis of commitments, authorizations and
payments (quarterly structural benchmark) and a schedule of poverty reduction
expenditures. These documents will be submitted to the IMF within six weeks after the end
of each quarter.



Strengthening institutional coordination between the Ministry of Planning and the
Ministry of Finance: We expect significant progress in improving the flow of information
between the two ministries, particularly by making the Inter-Ministerial Debt Management
Committee operational, and ensuring the proper functioning of the budget regulation and
cash flow monitoring committee and the joint macroeconomic framework and budget
committee.



Improving liquidity management: Following our commitment to develop quarterly
liquidity management and commitments plans, (the first and second quarter plans will be
submitted to the IMF) the government adopted a decree transforming all divisions in charge
of public procurement into Public Procurement Directorates within the various ministries.
Similarly, to improve the rates of credit use, during the December 20, 2013 meeting of the
Council of Ministers, the government adopted as specific measures, the recommendations
arising from the study on bottlenecks in the execution of the public capital spending
(quarterly structural benchmark). Liquidity management plans have already been developed
in Q1 and Q2 of 2014 and copies will be made available to the IMF.

36.
In line with the general reform plan, we shall continue to build capacities at the
customs administration to ensure implementation of its strategic plan. The customs
administration is fine-tuning the reforms that have already been initiated: including (i) the
establishment of two regional directorates at Diffa and Agadez and creation of three fully fledged
offices at key mining and oil production locations. The office at the SORAZ refinery has officially
been commissioned. The offices for the Agadem oilfield and Imouraren uranium mine will be set up
when these units become operational; (ii) the adoption of the Information Technology Development
Plan; (iii) tracking the management of exemptions and other economic regimes. The customs
administration intends to deploy an application for managing exemptions around June 2015.
37.
The customs administration intends to implement the following reforms aimed at
improving its performance: (i) the establishment of an electronic transit system; (ii) early clearance
of goods; (iii) making customs documentation secure, (iv) establishment of a single interconnection
server linking up various offices; (v) enhancing administrative assistance with Benin, Togo and
Burkina Faso through interconnection and secondment of customs staff at ports level; and (vi) the
migration from ASYCUDA++ to ASYCUDA World. In February 2014, a funding request was

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

53

NIGER

submitted to the World Bank, with a favorable opinion. The World Bank recently issued a
no-objection to the draft terms of reference and the customs administration will proceed to work on
the effective migration with UNCTAD. The process is expected to last 24 months.
38.
During the 2015 fiscal year, the DGI will enhance reforms in the area of regulations
and establish partnerships with economic agents with a view to simplifying tax legislation.
The reforms included in the 2015 finance law are aimed at meeting the following three objectives:
(i) consolidate existing legal instruments; and (ii) harmonize the fiscal framework with new provisions
of the West African accounting system, SYSCOA. The DGI also wishes to modernize its partnership
with civil society. In addition to organizing seminars on streamlining legislation, taxation litigation
will be reorganized with the imminent establishment of a tax arbitration committee (CARF), aimed at
enhancing and accelerating the efficiency of taxation processes. In terms of income tax (ISB), a new
measure has been introduced to take into account SYSCOA accounting framework. It enables
companies to breakdown the components of fixed assets for purposes of depreciation. In terms of
excise duties, we will raise tax rates on alcoholic beverages and tobacco from 45 percent and
40 percent to 50 percent and 45 percent, respectively.
39.
Organizational reforms are also underway in the directorates of the General Tax
Administration (DGI). The categories of taxpayers managed by the various bodies of the DGI have
been reviewed to better define the target population covered by each directorate. A circular was
issued setting out the thresholds for categorizing businesses as small, medium and large-sized. The
2013 Finance Law raised the turnover threshold from CFAF 30 million to CFAF 50 million for a
company to be liable for VAT. Nevertheless, there is still room for improvement with regard to the
control of exemptions. The government recently reorganized the Small and Medium Enterprises
Directorate into a Medium Enterprises Directorate (for businesses with a turnover between
CFAF 50 million and CFAF 500 million) with regional directorates (for businesses whose turnover is
less than CFAF 50 million), while maintaining a Large Enterprises Directorate for businesses with a
turnover above CFAF 500 million (up from the previous CFAF 300 million threshold). This will allow
for specific focus on medium-sized businesses that can help generate tax income.
40.
A number of other measures are planned to reorganize the DGI’s fiscal control office.
A new organizational structure is aimed at boosting the efficiency of the units, in particular those in
charge of research. The establishment of regional investigation and research brigades in the eight
regional directorates will ensure effective control throughout the national territory. The entire
administration is to be fully computerized, with the deployment of a new integrated application
called computerized taxes and taxpayers monitoring system (SISIC). All these organizational
measures are expected to generate at least CFAF 12 billion in revenue during the year.
41.
The DGI will continue with its efforts to improve internal controls as follows: improve
quality of accounting in partnership with the Treasury (DGTCP) and the Court of Accounts, monitor
the activities of tax collectors, publish procedural guides, and professionalization of the inspectorate
unit.

54

Improving public investments management and observance of the complementary period
42.
The government intends to enhance public investment management on the basis of
the reform program suggested by the IMF Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD) mission in April
2013 and taking into account other existing initiatives, including at the World Bank and GIZ.2
The government is therefore committed—on the basis of the conclusions of the 2013 IMF technical
assistance mission and the constraints identified in the areas of existing public investment projects
selection, budgeting, implementation monitoring and ex-post evaluation processes, and following
the suggested action plan— to design and implement a specific action plan to deal with identified
constraints and develop budget management capacities between 2015 and 2017. The government
will thus implement the following measures:


In the short term: (i) the Ministry of Finance will issue a circular3 recalling the provisions
regarding the termination of commitments in relation to the complementary period; (ii) line
ministries will draft scalable public procurement and credit commitment plans, to enable the
Ministry of Finance to prepare more realistic commitment and cash flow plans, thus avoiding
concentrating expenditure towards the end of the year; (iii) the DGB will meet with the line
ministries at the end of each quarter to prepare the release of credits;



In the medium term, the government will request technical assistance from the IMF to help
with the establishment of the institutional mechanism of the 2012 budget law and preparing
an action plan for effective implementation of budget programs by 2017 with the objective
to ensure compliance with the 2012 organic law so that authorization commitments and
payment credits are budgeted under the finance law (structural benchmark).

Debt Management
43.
We are committed to improving the management of the public debt. In that framework,
we will improve the information sharing and data transmission. To this end, we will revitalize and
strengthen the status and role of the National Committee on Public Debt Management (CNGDP)
within the administration. We are now, also committed to provide it with any new agreements
regarding government loans and guarantees, including funding in the natural resource sector to
ensure detailed analysis of public debt sustainability. We intend to continue to send to the IMF
semi-annual detailed reports on outstanding public debt, new commitments and borrowings
(including disbursements), and public debt service. These reports will also provide an analysis of the
costs and risks associated with the external and domestic public debt portfolio.
44.
We remain committed to pursuing a prudent debt policy to fund our investment plans
while ensuring debt sustainability. In this context, we will continue to limit government

3

A copy of the letter will be sent to the IMF.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

55

NIGER

guarantees and carefully assess the impact of new borrowing on debt sustainability. We intend to
finance investment projects with concessional resources. The loans will be limited to high-return and
properly-assessed projects. Where concessional resources would not be sufficient to finance
high-return projects, we will consult with the IMF to consider the scope for amending the financial
program to include non-concessional loans, provided that such loans meet the requirements of debt
sustainability.
45.
We are currently negotiating with China EximBank to secure a loan of US$880 million
(CFAF 437.4 billion) on more favorable terms to replace the current loan for the SORAZ oil
refinery. A credit line amounting to US$1 billion with EximBank of China (about 13 percent of GDP)
was contracted in September 2013 and approved by the National Assembly in June 2014 and the
legal non-objection from the Constitutional Council was issued on October 10, 2014. This credit line
will be used to finance major infrastructure projects and highly profitable industrial projects. The
general terms of this credit line—earmarked for specific transformative projects—are 25 years
maturity, with a grace period of 8 years and an interest rate of 2 percent.
46.
Steps are being taken to improve coordination of loan agreements. By order of the
Prime Minister dated December 17, 2013, we set up an Inter-Ministerial Committee to enhance
public debt management procedures and eliminate the risk of non-compliance with the criterion for
new agreements on non-concessional loans and containing the impact of new loans on public debt
sustainability. This order also established joint signatures by the Minister of Finance and Minister of
Planning for non-concessional loans and loans with non-traditional partners. The Inter-Ministerial
Committee’s mandate is to ensure effective debt policy and review terms and conditions of
non-concessional loans and loans from non-traditional partners. The order of the Prime Minister
also defined mechanisms for information sharing among all partners, including the IMF. The
government will take steps to improve and enhance the full functioning of the Inter-Ministerial
Committee. The Committee has held two meetings in the last four months and is currently drafting
its rules of procedure and considering a debt management strategy, with the support of partners.
Natural Resources Management
47.
We shall continue to implement measures aimed at enhancing sound natural resource
management. In May 2013, the findings of the recent audit of the refinery were made public. Like
the audit of the production of the Agadem block, the audit showed that costs could be significantly
reduced. Based on these findings, the refinery’s control committee is implementing cost reduction
measures to enhance performance control. Moreover, the process of refinancing the US$880 million
(CFAF 437.4 billion) loan to the SORAZ refinery at better terms is about to be completed.
48.
In the uranium sector, we will continue to implement measures to increase the
government’s share of income derived from the uranium mining. The mining agreements
between the companies of the AREVA group and the government will be renewed as per the Mining
Code contained in the Mining Act No. 2006-26 of August 9, 2006. The decree authorizing the
signing of new agreements between the government and SOMAIR and COMINAK was adopted by
the Council of Ministers on October 10, 2014. Two audits contributed greatly to pushing the

56

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGER

negotiations ahead. One was financed by AREVA and assessed the impact of enforcing the 2006
mining code tax regime and the other was funded by development partners. In order to increase the
government’s share of incomes from mining, we are striving to diversify the investor base and to
this end, a number of exploration permits have been granted to new companies. To better defend
the interests of Niger in mining projects, we are enhancing the role of the Société des Patrimoines
des Mines du Niger (SOPAMIN), which is in charge of managing the public investment portfolio in
mining companies. We will ensure that international best practices are observed and that the total
amount of dividends is paid back to the Treasury.
49.
In 2013, production of the SORAZ refinery and exports increased. The technical
challenges that affected production in the first year of operation were resolved and production
reached 18,000 barrels/day in 2013. Nevertheless, while it was expected that the refinery would
reach full capacity of 20,000 barrels/day in 2014, because of the maintenance work in late 2014,
production will only reach about 18,000 barrels a day. Commercialization of refined petroleum
products by the Société Nigérienne de Produits Pétroliers (SONIDEP) has improved and exports to
neighboring countries have increased.
50.
We have conducted feasibility studies to assess both the feasibility and the
profitability of the project to export crude oil, which is expected to come on stream in 2017. A
recent study conducted by CNPC has revised estimates of oil reserves in the Agadem block in favor
of production of 80,000 barrels/day for an estimated 25 years including 60,000 barrels/day for
export. The government and CNPC expect to be able to begin exporting crude oil from 2017. We
also conducted a comparative cost analysis of various export projects. Of the five (5) potential routes
identified for transporting crude oil, the Government of Niger has selected the route through Chad.
A restricted tender will be launched among CNPC subsidiaries to recruit an operator in charge of
constructing the pipeline. At the same time, the government plans to set up a company in charge of
managing the pipeline. Niger's participation in the project is expected to be in the form of a holding
company whose terms are being defined.
51.
The government is determined to continue to ensure transparency in the extractive
industries sector. The report of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) on tax
revenues generated by extractive industries for 2011 was published in November 2013.
Financial Sector
52.
Despite progress made in the recent years, financial sector development remains
inadequate, compared to other countries in the region. Overall, the banking sector is
appropriately capitalized and prudential indicators have improved in recent years. However,
heterogeneity between banks still exists.
53.
We will pursue our efforts to develop the financial system with a view to ensuring that
it effectively contributes to the development of the Nigerien economy. The government's
development program for this sector, which takes the form of a document entitled “Financial Sector
Development Strategy 2014-19”, was revised in July 2014 to include comments from the Council of

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

57

NIGER

Ministers and development partners. This version was adopted on October 13, 2014 by the Cabinet
Council and has been approved by the Council of Ministers on November 14, 2014. This plan is a
comprehensive framework that aims to: i) improve stability and transparency; ii) deepen financial
intermediation in every sector of the economy; iii) strengthen the legal and judicial system, and
iv) improve regulation and supervision of the sector.
54.
To ensure business continuity for a number of banks deemed important or playing a
strategic role, the government has invested equity in three institutions under restructuring.
According to the government, the survival of these banks is vital to the economy. Contacts have
therefore been established with private investors who have expressed interest in acquiring the
government’s shares in BIA (Banque International pour l’Afrique). Following these contacts, the
government has identified a strategic partner, namely the Morrocan Banque Centrale Populaire
(BCP) Group. BAGRI (Banque Agricole), which had been placed under temporary administration for a
period of 9 months ending on April 1, 2014, is now undergoing restructuring. A new board of
directors has been established with a new Managing Director appointed. The government continues
to seek buyers for its shares. The Banque Régionale de Solidarité (BRS) has been restructured
through a merger and acquisition by BRS Côte d’Ivoire. BRS Côte d’Ivoire was then sold to the West
African Development Bank (BOAD) 44 percent of the shares and to the ORABANK Group
(ORAGROUP) for the remaining 56 percent of shares.
Business Climate
55.
We acknowledge the need to diversify our economy beyond agriculture and natural
resources. To this end, it is necessary to create an enabling environment for the private sector and
attract more foreign direct investment. In our efforts to improve the business climate, we have
created a dedicated Ministry of Trade and Private Sector Promotion to promote the private sector.
56.
We shall also continue to implement the following measures: (i) the renewed activities of
the National Council for Private Investors (CNIP), which provides advice to the authorities on ways to
promote the private sector and provides a framework for dialogue between the government and the
private sector; (ii) the establishment of a permanent dialogue and framework for cooperation
between the private sector (represented by the Chamber of Commerce) and the Ministry in charge
of trade; (iii) the creation of a Business Promotion Center (Maison de l’Entreprise) with a one-stopshop whose mission is to facilitate business creation and to support the Centre des Formalités des
Entreprises (CFE) and the Center for Investment Promotion (CPI); (iv) the establishment of an
institutional structure (the Doing Business committee) to improve business climate indicators; (v) the
launch of a program to integrate trade into development strategies (integrated framework) together
with the establishment of a management unit; (vi) the drafting of a decree establishing a
one-stop-shop dealing with the advantages enshrined in the investment code; (vii) the adoption of a
public-private partnership law, as well as the establishment of a technical coordination unit. In this
context, the government has already adopted the law on the tax and accounting system governing
public-private partnerships and the consultation on business access to financing.

58

PROGRAM MONITORING
57.
The IMF Board of Directors will continue to monitor the program biannually, based on
quantitative monitoring indicators (Tables 1, 2), the structural benchmarks and prior actions (Tables
3, 5). These indicators are defined in the attached Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU).
The biannual reviews will be supported by data at end-June and end-December. The authorities will
send to the IMF statistical data and information contained in the attached Technical Memorandum
of Understanding, as well as any other information deemed necessary or asked by staff for
monitoring purposes. During the program period, the government will refrain not only from
introducing or increasing restrictions on payments and transfers on the current international
transactions without prior approval by the IMF, but also from introducing any practices of multiple
exchange rates whatsoever; from concluding bilateral agreements that are not compliant with Article
VIII of the Articles of Agreements of the IMF, and from introducing or tightening restrictions on
imports for balance of payment purposes.
58.
The program will be subject to biannual reviews, and performance will be assessed on
the basis of the performance criteria and the indicative targets included in the fiscal
framework agreed with the IMF. The sixth and seventh reviews are scheduled to be completed
respectively on or after June 2015 and on or after November 2015 on the basis of the targets at
end-December 2014 and end-June 2015 respectively.

Attachment II. Technical Memorandum of Understanding
1.
This technical memorandum of understanding defines the performance criteria and
indicative targets of Niger’s program under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement
for the period 2012–Q1 2015. The performance criteria and indicative targets for end-June and
end-December 2013 are set out in Table 1 of the attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial
Policies (MEFP) dated December 17, 2013. This technical memorandum of understanding also sets
out data-reporting requirements for program monitoring.
DEFINITIONS
2.
For the purposes of this technical memorandum, the following definitions of
“government,” “debt,” “payments arrears,” and “government obligations” “will be used:”
a) Government refers to the central government of the Republic of Niger; it does not include
any political subdivision, public entity, or central bank with separate legal personality.
b) As specified in point 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to External
Debt in Fund Arrangements adopted by the Decision No. 6230-(79/140) of the Executive
Board of the IMF, as amended effective December 1, 2009, debt will be understood to mean
a current, i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual arrangement through the
provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which requires
the obligor to make one or more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or
services, according to a specific schedule; these payments will discharge the obligor of the
principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the contract. Debts can take a number of
forms, the primary ones being are as follows: (i) loans, i.e. advances of money to the obligor
by the lender made on the basis of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in
the future (including deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans, and buyers' credits)
and temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans, under
which the obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing
the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase agreements and official swap
arrangements); (ii) suppliers' credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to
defer payments until sometime after the date on which the goods are delivered or services
are provided; and (iii) leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided that the
lessee has the right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually
shorter than the total expected service life of the property, while the lesser retains the title to
the property. For the purpose of this guideline, the debt is the present value (at the
inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the period of the
agreement, excluding those payments necessary for the operation, repair, or maintenance of
the property. Under the definition of debt set out above, arrears, penalties, and judicially
awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual obligation
that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not
considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt.

66

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGER

c) External payments arrears are payments due but not paid. Domestic payments arrears
are domestic payments owed by the government but not paid. They include authorized
fiscal year expenditure that is not paid within 90 days.
d) Government obligation is any financial obligation of the government accepted as such by
the government (including any government debt).
Quantitative Performance Criteria

A.

Net Domestic Financing of the Government

Definition
3.
Net domestic financing of the government is defined as the sum of (i) net bank credit to
the government; (ii) net nonbank domestic financing of the government, including government
securities issued in CFAF on the WAEMU regional financial market and not held by resident
commercial banks, proceeds from the sale of government assets, and privatization receipts.
4.
Net bank credit to the government is equal to the balance of government claims and
debts vis-à-vis national banking institutions. Government claims include cash holdings of the
Nigerien Treasury, secured obligations, deposits with the central bank, and deposits of the Treasury
(including regional offices) with commercial banks. Government deposits with commercial banks are
excluded from government claims insofar as they are used solely to finance externally financed
capital expenditure.
5.
Government debt to the banking system includes assistance from the central bank
(excluding net IMF financing under the ECF arrangement and the CFAF counterpart of the
2009 General SDR Allocation), assistance from commercial banks (including government
securities held by the central bank and commercial banks), and deposits with the CCP (postal
checking system).
6.
The scope of net bank credit to the government as defined by the BCEAO includes all
central government administrations. Net bank credit to the government and the amount of
Treasury bills and bonds issued in CFAF on the WAEMU regional financial market are calculated by
the BCEAO.
7.
Net nonbank domestic financing includes (i) the change in the stock of government
securities (Treasury bills and bonds) issued in CFAF on the WAEMU regional financial market and not
held by resident commercial banks; (ii) the change in the balance of Treasury correspondents’
deposit accounts; (iii) the change in the balance of various deposit accounts at the Treasury; and
(iv) the change in the stock of claims on the government forgiven by the private sector. Net
nonbank financing of the government is calculated by the Nigerien Treasury.
8.
The 2014 quarterly targets are based on the change between the end-December 2013
level and the date selected for the performance criterion or indicative target.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

67

NIGER

Adjustment
9.
The ceiling on net domestic financing of the government will be subject to adjustment if
disbursements of external budgetary support net of external debt service and external arrears
payments, including disbursements under the ECF arrangement, fall short of program projections.
10.
If, at the end of each quarter of 2014, disbursements of external budgetary support
fall short of the projected amounts at the end of each quarter, the corresponding quarterly
ceilings will be raised pro tanto, up to a maximum of CFAF 15 billion.
Reporting requirement
11.
Detailed data on domestic financing of the government will be provided monthly,
within six weeks after the end of each month.

B.

Reduction of Domestic Payments Arrears

Definition
12.
The reduction of domestic payments arrears is equal to the difference between the
stock of arrears at end-2013 and the stock of arrears on the reference date.
13.
The Centre d’amortissement de la dette intérieure de l’État (CAADIE) and the Treasury
are responsible for calculating the stock of domestic payments arrears on government
obligations and recording their repayment.
Reporting requirement
14.
Data on the stock, accumulation (including the change in Treasury balances
outstanding), and repayment of domestic arrears on government obligations will be provided
monthly, within six weeks following the end of each month.

C.

External Payments Arrears

Definition
15.
Government debt is outstanding debt owed or guaranteed by the government. For the
program, the government undertakes not to accumulate external payments arrears on its debt
(including Treasury bills and bonds issued in CFAF on the WAEMU regional financial market), with
the exception of external payments arrears arising from debt being renegotiated with external
creditors, including Paris Club creditors.

68

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGER

Reporting requirement
16.
Data on the stock, accumulation, and repayment of external payments arrears will be
provided monthly, within six weeks following the end of each month.

D.

External Nonconcessional Loans Contracted or Guaranteed by the Public Sector

Definition
17.
The government and the public enterprises listed in ¶21 will not contract or guarantee
external debt with an original maturity of one year or more and having a grant element of
less than 35 percent. For program purposes, a debt is concessional if it includes a grant element of
at least 35 percent, calculated as follows: the grant element of a debt is the difference between the
present value (PV) of debt and its nominal value, expressed as a percentage of the nominal value of
the debt. The PV of debt at the time of its contracting is calculated by discounting the future stream
of payments of debt service due on this debt.1 The discount rate used for this purpose is 5 percent.2
18.
This performance criterion applies not only to debt as defined in point 9 of the
Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to External Debt in Fund Arrangements
adopted by Decision No. 6230 (79/140) of the Executive Board of the IMF, as amended
effective December 1, 2009, but also to any obligation contracted or guaranteed for which no
value has been received. However, this performance criterion does not apply to financing provided
by the IMF and to debt rescheduling in the form of new loans.
19.
For the purposes of the relevant criteria, the guarantee of a debt arises from any
explicit legal obligation of the government to service a debt in the event of nonpayment by
the debtor (involving payments in cash or kind).
20.
For the purposes of the relevant performance criterion, external debt is defined as
debt borrowed or serviced, or requiring repayment, in a currency other than the CFA franc.
This definition also applies to debt among WAEMU countries.
21.
For the purposes of this performance criterion, the public sector includes the
government, as defined in ¶2 above, and the following public enterprises: (i) Société
Nigérienne d'Electricité (Nigelec); (ii) Société de Construction et de Gestion des Marchés (Socogem);
(iii) Société de Patrimoine des Eaux du Niger (SPEN), (iv) Société Nigérienne de Charbon (Sonichar),
(v) Société Nigérienne des Produits Pétroliers (Sonidep), (vi) Société Nigérienne des
1

The calculation of concessionality will take into account all aspects of the loan agreement, including maturity, grace
period, payment schedule, upfront commissions, and management fees.

2

On October 11, 2013, the Executive Boards of the IMF and the World Bank adopted a new methodology setting a
single, unified discount rate to calculate the grant element of individual loans. The new unified discount rate is set at
5 percent (see http://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/conc/calculator/.)

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

69

NIGER

Télécommunications (Sonitel), (vii) Société de Patrimoine des Mines du Niger (Sopamin); and
(viii) Société Hôtel Gaweye (SPEG).
Reporting Requirement
22.
Details on all external public sector debt will be provided monthly, within six weeks
after the end of each month. The same requirement applies to guarantees granted by the
central government. The Ministry of Finance will regularly forward to Fund staff a list of loans in
process of negotiation. It will also prepare semiannual reports on any external debt contracted or in
process of negotiation and the terms thereof, as well as on the borrowing program for the next six
months, including the terms thereof, and will forward them to Fund staff.

E.

Short-Term External Debt of the Central Government

Definition
23.
The government will not accumulate or guarantee new external debt with an original
maturity of less than one year. This performance criterion applies not only to debt as defined in
point 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to External Debt in Fund
Arrangements adopted by Decision No. 6230-(79/140) of the Executive Board of the IMF, as
amended effective December 1, 2009, but also to any obligation contracted or guaranteed for which
no value has been received. Short-term loans related to imports are excluded from this performance
criterion, as are short-term securities issued in CFAF on the regional financial market.
Reporting requirement
24.
Details on all external government debt will be provided monthly, within six weeks
following the end of each month. The same requirement applies to guarantees granted by the
government.
Quantitative Targets

F.

Definitions

25.
Total revenue is an indicative target for the program. It includes tax, nontax, and special
accounts revenue, but excludes proceeds from the settlement of reciprocal debts between the
government and enterprises.
26.
The basic fiscal deficit is defined as the difference between: (i) total tax revenue as
defined in ¶22; and (ii) total fiscal expenditure excluding externally financed investment
expenditure but including HIPC-financed expenditure.
27.
The basic fiscal deficit, WAEMU definition, is defined as the basic balance defined in
paragraph 26 increased by the budgetary grants.

70

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND FOURTH AND FIFTH REVIEWS UNDER THE EXTENDED
CREDIT FACILITY ARRANGEMENT AND REQUEST FOR
WAIVER OF NONOBSERVANCE OF PERFORMANCE
CRITERIA AND MODIFICATION OF PERFORMANCE
CRITERIA—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

Approved By
David Robinson and
Peter Allum (IMF) and
John Panzer (IDA)

Prepared by the Staffs of the International Monetary Fund
and the International Development Association.

The previous Debt Sustainability Analysis was conducted at the time of the First Review
under the Three-Year Arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (Country Report
No. 13/104, April 2013). The medium-term economic framework underpinning the
analysis has been updated to reflect recent developments, consistent with the baseline
scenario in the 2014 Article IV and Fourth and Fifth Reviews Under the Extended Credit
Facility Arrangement. The large additional oil revenues that are expected after 2017 will
significantly strengthen the fiscal and external accounts. As a result, the various debt
measures remain below the relevant thresholds in the baseline scenario, but the present
value (PV) of the debt-to-export and the PV of debt-to-GDP ratios breach the threshold
under the most extreme stress test. On this basis, Niger’s risk of debt distress continues to
be considered as moderate.1

Niger’s three-year average CPIA (2011-13) is estimated at 3.4, which is in the average performance category.

BACKGROUND
1.
This joint IMF-World Bank debt sustainability analysis (DSA) updates the DSA of the
external and total public debt of Niger completed at the time of the first review under the
ECF. It is based on preliminary end-2013 data, using the standard debt dynamics template for
low-income countries. The debt data cover external and domestic debt of the central government,
debt of public enterprises and parastatals, state guarantees and private external debts. Domestic
debt includes arrears, debt to the central bank (Banque Centrale des Etats de l’Afrique de
l’Ouest-BCEAO) resulting from statutory advances and the special drawing rights (SDR) allocation
and government securities.
2.
The previous DSA assessed Niger’s risk of debt distress to be at a moderate level,
largely on account of the government’s debt contracts to support the development of the
natural resource sector. Niger reached the completion point under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative in
April 2004 and in 2006 benefited from MDRI assistance from the African Development Fund,
International Development Association (IDA), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The debt
relief contributed to a reduction of nominal external debt from over 90 percent of GDP at end-2000
to about 17 percent of GDP at end-2010. Niger’s public external debt exposure has increased
significantly after 2010, up to 22.8 percent of GDP at end-2013, as a result of government’s
involvement in the financing of projects in natural resources.1

UNDERLYING DSA ASSUMPTIONS
3.
Staff has updated the medium- and long-term projections for Niger. Revenue
projections have been revised upward to reflect new developments in the petroleum sector and
ongoing improvements in revenue collection. The higher oil revenue is expected after 2017 when
the new crude oil project will come on stream. The increased revenues will enable an expansion in
public investment, while current expenditures should be gradually contained.2 The average GDP
growth projection is revised downward in the short-term and stabilizes to its steady state growth
rate at 5.5 percent, lower than projected in the 2013 DSA. The 2014 DSA assumes conservative
growth of exports of goods and services in particular for non-resource export compared with the

1

In 2011, the government contracted a Yuan 650 million loan for the financing of its share in the construction of the
new Azelik uranium mine, followed by a state guarantee of 40 percent of a US$880 million loan to the SORAZ
refinery.
2

This expenditure rationalization objective requires stepping up efforts in the reform of public financial management
(PFM) as suggested in the latest PEFA assessment (March 2013) and in IMF technical assistance reports on PFM. The
authorities approved the law on fiscal transparency in March 2014 and efforts are underway to strengthen
institutional coordination between the Ministry of Planning and the Ministry of Finance to improve the flow of
information and to enhance expenditure monitoring. The ECF program also envisages improvements in expenditure
controls by limiting resort to the use of exceptional procedures for authorizing spending, accelerating the pace of
budget execution, and developing quarterly cash and commitment plans as the structural benchmark to strengthen
the capacity in budget planning and execution.

2013 DSA. However, public investments in agriculture and infrastructure are expected to help
promote export-oriented growth and efficiency gains in the long-run.
4.
External public grants and loans are projected to decline gradually as natural resource
revenues increase. Besides debt creating flows and FDI, the current account deficit is expected to
be financed by significant flows of project grants, and private capital flows.

5.
The macroeconomic outlook remains subject to various risks. The country is very
vulnerable to exogenous shocks, including frequent weather-related food crises and fluctuations in
commodity prices. The deteriorating security situation in the region is another factor adding fiscal
costs and economic vulnerability to Niger.

EXTERNAL DSA
6.
Niger’s debt exposure has increased significantly since 2009 as a result of government
involvement in the financing of projects in the natural resources sectors. The refinancing loan
for the construction of the SORAZ refinery (in amount of CFAF 437.4 billion), if approved by the
Chinese authorities in 2014, would replace the existing private non-concessional funding of the
refinery (which was 40 percent guaranteed by the State), as a result, the stock of external public debt
(including guarantees) will increase from 22.8 percent of GDP at end-2013 to a projected
32.7 percent of GDP at end-2014. Total external debt (including private debt) will increase from
49.5 percent of GDP at end-2013 to 53.7 percent of GDP at end-2014. The rate of external public
debt accumulation is expected to remain broadly stable but then decline gradually in the outer years
after the new natural resource projects are operational and planned key infrastructure investments
are completed (Figure 1).

7.
In the baseline scenario, the external debt ratios remain below their policy-dependent
thresholds throughout the projection period (2014−34). The present values (PV) of debt-to-GDP,
debt-to-exports and debt-to-revenue ratios are expected to remain at levels below the relevant
thresholds over the medium term.3 As in the previous DSA, upon the approval of the refinancing
loan for the SORAZ, the existing non-concessional loan with a 40 percent state guarantee will be
terminated, causing a one-off spike in the debt service ratio in 2014. After 2014, debt service
indicators would remain well below their thresholds for the entire projection period. The stress test
under the historical scenario also shows sustainable trends of external debt ratios (Figure 1).
8.
The baseline scenario assumes that the US$1 billion credit line from EximBank of
China4 will be disbursed in the period of 2015-22. US$50million of the Chinese master facility is
assumed to be disbursed in 2015, US$100 million in 2016, US$100 million in 2017, and the rest of
US$750 million is assumed to be equally disbursed in the following years. Given that the credit line
is fully used by 2022, the PV of public external debt to export ratio will approach the threshold in the
medium-term.
9.
Under the most extreme scenario, the debt-to-export and the debt-to-GDP ratios
breach the relevant thresholds. (Figure 1). For both indicators, the most extreme stress test
assumes lower level of non-debt capital flows (FDI) in 2015 and 2016, kept at historical average
minus one standard deviation, which results in higher debt indicators relative to the baseline.
However, even in this scenario, the debt burden indicators are expected to stabilize at sustainable
levels over the medium term.
10.
In the alternative and customized scenarios, the external debt ratios mostly remain
below the threshold level although a fast accumulation of less concessional external debt
could elevate the level of debt distress. Two alternative scenarios are performed (Table 2a). Under
historical scenario (A1 key variables are fixed at their historical averages throughout the projection
period), the debt indicators remain at the level far below the relevant thresholds. Another scenario
assuming fast accumulation of less concessional external debt (A2), could elevate the risk of external
debt distress, which calls for the authorities’ action in limiting the accumulation of non-concessional
external debt. In light of the uncertainties about prospects for crude oil production and exports, a
customized scenario with lower crude oil production and exports was also added, which

See IMF (2013) “Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the Joint Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability Framework:” for
details on relevant debt thresholds and benchmarks.

This line of credit, considered as a facility in total of US$1 billion, was signed in September 2013 and several loan
agreements could be negotiated under the facility between the government of Niger and China. Under the master
facility agreement, individual loans are subject to 2 percent interest rate, 25 years maturity, and 5 years grace period.
Any contracts under the facility are tied to the Chinese supplier and are earmarked for infrastructure projects with
higher economic rate of return. Any potential projects need the preliminary approval of Eximbank of China about
their eligibility.

demonstrates that external debt indicators will remain at sustainable level under the lower oil export
scenario.5

PUBLIC DSA
11.
The increase in bond financing from the regional market would raise domestic debt
stock in the short-term. Niger’s domestic debt is currently at a low level (3.5 percent of GDP at
end-2013, see Table 1b) which is projected to rise in 2014 to 5 percent of GDP due to the new
issuance of regional bonds in the amount of CFAF 93.3 billion.6 The baseline scenario assumes that
the authorities continue to cover fiscal financing needs through the issuance of government
securities on similar terms as the 2014 regional bonds, but with lower amounts issued annually in
the medium-term. Consequently, domestic public debt is projected to fall over the medium term. In
2013, the bulk of domestic debt is comprised of non-interest bearing arrears, which are projected to
be fully repaid by 2017, so that the average nominal interest rate on domestic debt is low.
12.
Public debt ratios remain below the relevant threshold level, but can approach the
policy-dependent threshold level under alternative scenarios with higher primary fiscal deficit
and lower GDP growth. Under the extreme case with no improvement in fiscal situation, the
primary fiscal balance remains at the 2014 level of -4.8 percent of GDP, which leads to the
accumulation of public debt. Consequently, the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio would approach the
policy-dependent threshold level of 56 percent (Figure 2, Table 2b). When the permanently lower
GDP growth shock is assumed, the PV of debt to GDP will reach 58 percent. The PV of public
debt-to-GDP ratio and the PV of public debt-to-revenue ratios will stabilize to sustainable levels
under baseline and other stress tests including the one with 30 percent real depreciation of
exchange rate (i.e., the most extreme shock scenario).

PRIVATE EXTERNAL DEBT DYNAMICS
13.
The current DSA includes identified private debt flows, linked to the large natural
resource projects. The main private debt flows are related to the large oil and uranium projects. It
incorporates the contracts of a loan by the refinery SORAZ (60 percent privately owned) and a loan
of about 1.4 billion euro to finance the new uranium mine Imouraren. Including this debt, the stock
of external private debt is 26.7 percent of GDP in 2013 (amortization of this loan is projected to start
from 2017).
5

The assumptions are that the value of oil exports would increase by 80 percent (about a half of the baseline growth
rate of 165 percent) in 2017 and then would increase by 8.3 percent in 2018 and 4 percent in 2019; crude oil
production is adjusted accordingly. This has also been done for the public DSA.
6

The terms of the regional bonds are a 6.25 percent interest rate, 5 years maturity and 1 year grace period. By
August 2014, CFAF 93.3 billion was already issued, among which CFAF 19 billion was taken up by domestic banks and
CFAF 74.3 billion was taken up by banks in the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA).The authorities
intend to additionally issue new regional bonds (CFAF 121 billion and CFAF 61.3 billion of bonds are expected in
2015 and 2016, followed by continuous issuance of bonds over the medium-term to diversify the financing sources)
which is also captured in the baseline scenario.

CONCLUSION
14.
On the basis of the updated DSA, Niger remains subject to a moderate risk of debt
distress. In comparison with the previous DSA, the large oil project is expected to generate net
revenue and lead to an improvement in the fiscal and external accounts. In the baseline scenario, the
external and public debt indicators remain below their policy-dependent thresholds throughout the
projection period. However, the expected refinancing loan to SORAZ refinery, individual loans
contracted under the Chinese master facility, and the uptick in borrowing from regional market
would increase the public debt stock. Consequently, the PV of debt-to-export and debt-to-GDP
ratios could breach the threshold level under the most extreme scenario. The country’s level of
external debt keep Niger vulnerable to adverse shocks, as demonstrated by the deterioration of the
debt indicators in the most extreme scenario.
15.
Niger’s continued risk of debt distress calls for the authorities’ continued commitment
to strengthen debt management. The Inter-Ministerial Committee, which was created by order of
the prime minister in December 2013, must play an active role in preventing the recurrence of
non-concessional borrowing and in limiting the accumulation or external and public debt to
maintain fiscal and debt sustainability. Any loans contracted under the Chinese master facility
agreement should be used for high-yield infrastructure projects that will generate sufficient
government revenue to cover debt service related to the projects. Implicit earmarking of specific
project fiscal revenues, however, should not justify exception in contracting loans, because it is not
guaranteed that such revenues will necessarily contribute to improving spending allocations or
reducing debt ratios. The authorities also need to build buffers to cope with exogenous shocks, and
strengthen revenue administration and expenditure prioritization to align with short-term and longterm spending needs.
16.
The Nigerian authorities have indicated their agreement with the conclusions reached
in this DSA. They provided inputs on the disbursement profile of the master facility; this information
has been incorporated. The authorities have also stated that the result of moderate debt distress
level, as well as staff recommendation in strengthening debt management, are consistent with their
regular debt sustainability analysis conducted by the Inter-Ministerial Debt Committee.

Box 1: Baseline Scenario Assumptions
The baseline macroeconomic scenario for 2013−34 is based on the following assumptions:
-

Real GDP growth will increase to an average of 7.8 percent a year in 2016-19, higher than assumed in the
2013 DSA, reflecting production developments in oil sector. The growth rate remains at an average of
5 percent a year in 2020-34, reflecting higher non-resource GDP growth, as Niger continues public
investment and makes progress in improving the business climate. Inflation is projected to remain stable
at about 2 percent over the projection period, as own agricultural and oil production will keep inflationary
pressures in check. The export price of crude oil is assumed to be 85 percent of the international oil price
that follows declining price trend during 2017-19 as assumed in the World Economic Outlook (October
2014), followed by gradual price increase afterwards.

-

Total revenue-to-GDP ratio will rise from about 17.2 percent in 2013 to 22.1 percent in 2034, higher than
assumed in the 2013 DSA, reflecting rising revenue from natural resources, ongoing improvements in the
revenue collection effort, and higher custom revenues from export-oriented growth.

-

Primary fiscal expenditure (excluding interest payments) is expected to reach about 31 percent of GDP in
2019, driven by large spending needs for security expenditure and expenditure in priority sectors such as
food security, infrastructure, and education. While current expenditure is expected to be gradually
contained from about 15 percent of GDP in 2014 to 13 percent of GDP in 2034, capital expenditure is
expected to remain at high level due to an increase in infrastructure spending, and as a result, primary
fiscal expenditure will be at 29.5 percent of GDP in 2034. The basic balance (the fiscal balance net of
grants and externally-financed capital expenditure) will gradually converge to zero (complying with the
WAEMU regional convergence criterion). The overall fiscal deficit (cash basis) will also decline from
11.6 percent of GDP in 2013 to 7.6 percent of GDP in 2034.

-

The non-interest current account deficit is projected to gradually decline to 8.5 percent at the end of the
projection period. Export volume would increase, mainly driven by much larger export volume growth of
crude oil (after oil production comes on stream in 2017) than was assumed in the 2013 DSA. The export
volume of non-resource products is also expected to grow as a result of the expected impact of gradual
economic diversification. Imports would slow down initially, in line with the decline of FDI-related
imports, before rebounding as imports increase with higher GDP per capita. An improvement in overall
fiscal balance and higher private saving contributes to the decline in current account deficit.

-

Net FDI is projected to increase from about 9 percent of GDP in 2013 to about 14 percent of GDP in 2016
for the construction of new oil pipeline. As assumed in the 2013 DSA, it is expected to decrease over the
medium-term as large investment projects come to completion, and the newly-established natural
resource companies reimburse FDI loans received from their parent companies; these payments lead to
an FDI outflow.

-

The average interest rate on external debt is projected be around 2 percent. Total external financing is
expected to decrease during the high growth period of 2017-19 due to the reduction in borrowing needs
and the expected increase in per capita GDP. Total external financing needs are expected to decline to
9 percent of GDP in the medium term reflecting higher domestic revenues. The analysis assumes
continuous inflow of grants and loans from donors of about 5 percent and 4 percent of GDP on average,
respectively. Grants represent about 60 percent of total external financing amount over the period. The
discount rate is 5 percent, a higher rate compared to the previous DSA rate of 3 percent.

-

The domestic debt profile assumes that the outstanding stock of domestic arrears is paid off by 2017 and
that there is no new accumulation of arrears. It includes the issuance of regional bonds in April 2014 in an
amount of CFAF 93.3 billion followed by further issuance of new bonds under same terms (i.e.,
6.25 percent interest rate, 5 years maturity and 1 year grace period).

Includes both public and private sector external debt.
Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline
level after the shock (implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Decision point - point at which the IMF and the World Bank determine whether a
country qualifies for assistance under the HIPC Initiative and decide on the amount of
assistance to be committed.
Interim assistance - amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision
and completion points, up to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the
assistance committed at the decision point (or 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in
exceptional circumstances).
Completion point - point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its
assistance committed at the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of
interest income as defined in footnote 2 above. The timing of the completion point is
linked to the implementation of pre-agreed key structural reforms (i.e., floating
completion point).
Implementation of Post-Catastrophe-Debt-Relief (PCDR)
Not Applicable
Safeguards Assessments
The Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) is a common central bank of the countries of the
West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAMU). In accordance with safeguards policy
requirements for regional central banks, a quadrennial safeguards assessment of the Central Bank of
West African States (BCEAO) was completed in December 2013. The assessment found that the
bank continued to have a strong control environment and has, with the implementation of the 2010
Institutional Reform, enhanced its governance framework. Specifically, an audit committee was
established to oversee the audit and financial reporting processes, transparency has increased with
more timely publication of the audited financial statements, and the BCEAO is committed to
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) implementation by end-2014. The assessment
also identified some limitations in the external audit process and recommended that steps be taken
to ensure its adequacy.
Exchange Arrangement
Niger is a member of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The union’s common currency,
the CFA franc, is pegged to the Euro at a rate of CFAF 655.957 = EUR 1, consistent with the official
conversions rate of the French franc to the Euro and the previous fixed rate of the CFA franc to the
French franc of CFAF 100= F 1. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange arrangement of the WAEMU
countries has been reclassified to the category of conventional pegged arrangement from the
category of exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is based on
the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was based on the lack of a
separate legal tender. The new classification thus only reflects a definitional change, and is not
based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change in the exchange regime or other
policies of the currency union or its members. The exchange system common to all member
countries of the WAEMU is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international
transactions subject to Fund jurisdiction.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
A. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Niger
participates in the WAEMU’s harmonization of statistical methodologies through the multilateral
surveillance process, seeking regional improvements in national accounts, with the support of the
WAEMU Commission and AFRITAC West.
Real sector statistics: The economic accounts are compiled on an annual basis by the National
Institute of Statistics (INS), in accordance with the System of National Accounts 1993 (SNA93).
Although the national accounts compilation follows best methodological practice, the ROSC
assessment found that national accounts data originate mainly from administrative sources and
the household and informal sector surveys are not up-to-date. For several years, the INS has been
engaged in a process of renovation of its national accounts, following the SNA93 methodology
and using the ERETES software, with the assistance of AFRITAC West. This project is behind
schedule as the new base year 2006 was finalized in 2009, and national accounts for 2010 have
been finalized in 2013 only. Work has just started on the 2011 national accounts. Meanwhile, the
INS is continuing to issue an up-to-date series of national accounts with a methodology adjusted
to the SNA93. In concert with other WAEMU member countries, the INS has been compiling and
publishing a harmonized consumer price index (CPI) for Niamey on a monthly basis since early
1998. The CPI was rebased in 2008, with a new basket of products and revised weights.
Government finance statistics: Monthly government finance statistics are compiled by the
Ministry of Finance (MF) with a one- to four-month lag, based on information provided by the
budget, customs, tax, and treasury directorates. The MF prepares a monthly reconciliation of
spending commitments made by the budget directorate and payments made by the treasury, but
the data are not disseminated to the general public. Data are limited to the operation of the
budgetary central government that covers the general budget, special funds, and operations of
the treasury special accounts, but not the social security administration. As part of the process of
economic integration within the WAEMU, the country has made significant progress in bringing
its fiscal data in line with the common framework that has been developed with technical
assistance from the IMF (the harmonized table of government financial operations—TOFE). The
authorities plan to adopt the Directive nº10/2009/CM/UEMOA on the TOFE, which will imply
migrating from Government Finance Statistics Manual 1986 (GFSM 1986) to the GFSM 2001.
Monetary and financial statistics: Monetary statistics are generally based on the Guide to
Money and Banking Statistics in IFS (1984 Guide). Preliminary monetary data are compiled by the
national agency of the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) and released officially by
BCEAO headquarters. The authorities report monetary data on a regular basis, with a lag of about
three months.
Balance of payments: The balance of payments statistics are compiled in conformity with the
Balance of Payments Manual, Sixth Edition (BPM6). The national agency of the BCEAO is
responsible for compiling and disseminating the balance of payments statistics, and the BCEAO
headquarters for delineating the methodology and calculating the international reserves
managed on behalf of the participating countries. Since the statistics in this area are published
with a significant lag, the quantitative analysis in this sector should be taken with caution.

IMF Executive Board Completes Fourth and Fifth ECF Reviews, Approves US$16.52
Million Disbursement and Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Niger

On December 17, 2014 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund completed
the fourth and the fifth reviews of Niger’s economic performance under a program supported
by an Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement. The decision enables the disbursement of
SDR 11.28 million (about US$16.52 million, 17 percent of quota), bringing total
disbursements under the ECF arrangement to SDR 56.40 million (about US$82.62 million,
86 percent of quota)
In completing the reviews, the Executive Board approved the authorities’ request for waivers
for the performance criterion related to net domestic financing at the end of December 2013
and June 2014, and the modification of performance criteria of the end of December 2014.
The ECF arrangement for Niger was approved on March 16, 2012 (see Press Release No.
12/90).
Following the Executive Board’s discussion, Mr. Naoyuki Shinohara, Deputy Managing
Director and Acting Chair, made the following statement:
“Niger’s overall macroeconomic performance has been broadly satisfactory. After the
economic slowdown in 2013 due to the regional security situation and adverse climatic
conditions, economic growth has rebounded in 2014. Inflation has been contained, in part
due to the government’s efforts to improve food security and the functioning of food
markets. However, program performance has been mixed, as a combination of unexpected
security and food expenditures and a shortfall in external financing have strained fiscal
management. The structural reform agenda is advancing, although with delays in
implementing some key public financial management measures. Significant progress has
been made on the limitation of exceptional expenditure and timely release of quarterly
budget allocations.

2

“In the near term, containing the fiscal deficit through measures to improve tax policy and
administration, reform customs administration, and reduce exemptions is essential to ensure
sustainability. Medium-term prospects appear favorable, but depend critically on the
authorities’ ability to leverage Niger’s natural resource wealth into sustained inclusive
growth. Critical in this regard will be further strengthening debt and public financial
management, the management of natural resource wealth, and the business climate. The
Inter-Ministerial Committee on Debt Management is an important step forward and should
play an increasing role in ensuring the public investment efficiency. Establishing a treasury
single account would significantly improve cash management and budget execution.
“Further structural reforms to improve the business environment are critical. In this context,
swift implementation of the recently approved financial sector development strategy would
support economic growth by increasing financial stability and transparency as well as
financial deepening. Strengthening the resilience of the economy through steps to enhance
food security; removing trade barriers, including for food products; and improvements in the
legislative environment could all promote stronger and more inclusive growth and alleviate
poverty.”
The Executive Board also completed the 2014 Article IV Consultation1 with Niger.
Niger’s overall macroeconomic performance has been satisfactory. Economic growth slowed
to 4.1 percent in 2013 largely due to the regional security situation and adverse climatic
conditions on agricultural production despite a significant increase in oil production. Inflation
was contained at 2.3 percent in 2013 as food prices fell thanks to the government’s efforts to
improve food security and the functioning of food markets. Growth is estimated to rebound
to 6.5 percent in 2014, driven by agriculture and inflation to remain subdued. Reflecting
continued expenditure pressures and weak revenues, the basic fiscal deficit has widened but
arrears were significantly reduced. The external current account is expected to widen in 2014
because the growth of exports was outpaced by the rise in imports of goods and services
related to investment projects in the extractive industries and public works. Limited
government resources and project implementation capacity continued to weigh on public
investment.
Macroeconomic prospects look favorable. Growth is expected to average 5.6 percent in
2014-16 and 8.5 percent in 2017-19 as two large natural resource projects—crude oil export
and uranium production—are expected to begin in 2017/18 and 2019, respectively. On the
external side, the decline in oil prices in the second half of 2014 will lower the current
account over the medium term, resulting in a lower but still significant accumulation of

reserves. The main near-term risks relate to further deterioration in the regional security
situation, which could severely impact foreign direct investment, trade flows, and fiscal
outcomes. The economy also remains vulnerable to climatic shocks, commodity price
volatility, and limited predictability of donor support. The timing, financing, and feasibility
of government involvement in projects in the extractive industry pose particular risks, due
their inherent elevated uncertainty and the authorities’ limited implementation capacity.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They noted that despite the
unfavorable security situation and adverse climate shocks, which have complicated program
implementation, Niger’s economy delivered positive growth in 2013 and rebounded in 2014.
While the medium-term outlook is favorable, it is vulnerable to domestic and external risks,
and poverty remains high. Against this backdrop, Directors welcomed the authorities’
commitment to their economic program and stressed the importance of continued efforts to
improve the resilience of the economy, strengthen fiscal sustainability, and foster inclusive
growth.
Directors underscored the importance of further strengthening the fiscal framework to ensure
fiscal sustainability while addressing development needs and security challenges. They called
for measures to improve tax policy and administration, reform customs administration, and
reduce exemptions. Welcoming the authorities’ intention to prioritize spending in key
sectors, Directors encouraged prudence in budget planning and continued efforts to improve
budget execution. Investment spending should be scaled up prudently, supported by reforms
to improve the efficiency of spending and absorptive capacity. Directors welcomed the
authorities’ commitment to undertake additional capital spending only as revenue
materializes.
Directors acknowledged the authorities’ efforts to strengthen the debt management
framework through better coordination of relevant ministries and regular reporting of debt
stocks and flows. They urged the authorities to develop a medium-term debt management
strategy to guide prudent borrowing plans and safeguard debt sustainability.
Directors noted that the medium-term economic outlook will depend critically on the
authorities’ ability to leverage expected natural resource revenues for advancing the inclusive
growth agenda. In this context, they emphasized the importance of further strengthening the
fiscal and institutional frameworks. Priorities are the enhancement of public financial
management, including the establishment of a treasury single account, and improved

governance and transparency of natural resource management in order to provide room for
increased social and infrastructure spending.
Directors emphasized the need for further structural reforms to improve the business
environment. They welcomed the recent approval of the decree to implement the financial
sector development strategy and encouraged the authorities to speed up its implementation.
The strategy aims at increasing financial stability and transparency as well as financial
deepening and inclusion, and would improve the legal and judicial framework. Directors also
noted that enhancing food security through investments in agriculture and fostering regional
trade would promote stronger and more inclusive growth and faster poverty reduction.

Statement by Mr. Ngueto Tiraina Yambaye, Executive Director for Niger
And Mr. Ousmane Mamadou, Alternate Executive Director for Niger
December 17, 2014
On behalf of my Nigerien authorities, I would like to express my deep
appreciation to the Executive Board and Management for their continuous
support to Niger’s policy efforts. I also wish to thank staff for the constructive
dialogue with my authorities held in Niamey during the fourth and fifth reviews
under the ECF arrangement and the 2014 Article IV Consultations discussions.
Despite the challenging regional security situation compounded by the
continued effects of the 2013 poor agricultural production, the Nigerien economy
delivered a positive growth in 2013, and rebounded in 2014. The Nigerien
authorities have also proven their commitment to the objectives of the program
and to the underlying reforms, in particular, in the areas of public financial
management, revenue mobilization and debt and natural resources management.
Program performance remains broadly satisfactory in spite of the distorting
effects of the two unforeseen shocks mentioned above. Based on the corrective
measures taken by my authorities in order to contain expenditures and
strengthen revenue collection, they request waivers for the missed performance
criteria on domestic financing at end-December 2013 and end-June 2014, as well
as the completion of the fourth and fifth reviews under the ECF program.
Recent Developments, Outlook, Risks and Program performance
After a strong economic performance in 2012, with real GDP growth rate
reaching two digits (11.1%), the economic activities contracted sharply to an
estimated GDP growth of 4.1 percent in 2013. This was due to a turnaround in
agriculture production due to poor weather conditions led to a sizeable decline in
economic activities in 2013. Likewise, unexpected developments in the regional
security situation led to a significant increase in expenditure to address, security,
humanitarian and refugee issues. However, the economy rebounded in 2014
with real GDP estimated to grow by 6.5 percent on account of better weather
conditions for agriculture production, spending on infrastructure projects, as well
as expansion of oil production. Inflation was kept under control at 2.3 percent in
2013 and at 1.3 percent at end June 2014, thanks to the government’s successful
food programs, which helped contain the strong food demand pressures.
Fiscal developments were positive. However, these outcomes reflect to some
extent expenditure restraints aimed at accommodating security and food related
spending. The fiscal deficit was reduced by more than half in 2013, and was

2

contained far below the program target of 5.6 percent. However, the estimated
data for the first semester of 2014 point to continued expenditures pressures and
weak revenue, which led to an increased basic fiscal deficit. However to
strengthen the record of public financial management, my authorities have
reduced domestic arrears by CFAF9.5 billion, mostly in favor of private sector
entities. For the coming years, my authorities envisage to make similar budget
efforts each year until the complete clearance of the existing stock of arrears.
Developments on the monetary and financial front in 2013 and 2014 reflect
broadly the aforementioned rebounding of the economy. There was a
contraction of broad money and credit in relation to the poor performance of the
agriculture sector in 2013, and an expansion of monetary aggregates reflecting a
pick up in the mining and oil sector during the first semester of 2014 along with a
mobilization of funds in the regional financial market.
The current account deficit, as expected, increased in 2013 reflecting the growing
import activities in the extractive sector as well as the progressive
implementation of some of the important infrastructure projects described in the
authorities’ development program, including that pertaining to the construction
of the railway system. However, strong foreign direct investments, and the
positive impact of export expansion for oil and uranium caused the overall
external balance to show a significant surplus, leading to an increase of Niger’s
contribution to the net foreign assets of the West African Economic and
Monetary Union (WAEMU).
OUTLOOK AND RISKS
My Nigerien authorities agree with the staff’s assumptions, which should lead to
a rebound of economic growth, and sustained growth going forward. These
assumptions are based on the positive outlook for the natural resources sector,
the greater emphasis on the strategy to address food insecurity and increased
irrigated agricultural production through the 3 N initiative and the authorities’
resolve to pursue steadfastly the implementation of their public investment
infrastructure projects, which are consistent with the priorities set out in the PRSP
and in their Plan de Development Economique et Social( PDOES).
While they take good note of the favorable medium-term outlook, my authorities
are fully aware of the significant challenges facing the country, notably with
regard to the risks associated with the regional security situation, and that
pertaining to weather conditions. As regards the security situation, my Nigerien
authorities believe that progress in this matter requires a two-stage response to

3

be conducted at both the international level and the regional level. At the
international level, several security and defense cooperation initiatives have
already produced successful results in terms of strengthening peace and security
at the three most affected Nigerien borders. At the regional level, my authorities
are cooperating with others in peace keeping initiatives, and this is also having
positive result. With regard to the recurrent vulnerability of Niger to climate
shocks, my authorities consider that the best alternative to overcome the issue of
food insecurity is to increase investment in agriculture. In this regard, while they
agree with the need to address the structural dimension of food insecurity in
Niger, as suggested by staff, they share staff’s view recommending to leverage
natural resource revenues to increase investments in agriculture sector.

Program implementation
As noted above, program implementation is broadly satisfactory. All PCs at end
December 2013 and also at end June 2014 were met. The only exception is
related to the PC on domestic financing, which was breached because of the
negative impact of insecurity on the revenue collection, shortfalls in external
financing, and the need for emergency food assistance. Apart from the floor on
poverty reduction, all indicative targets for end 2013 were observed. This target
was also missed at end June 2014 along with the basic fiscal balance and the total
revenue. Despite some delays in the area of public finance management reform
measures, the structural reform agenda is advancing, as highlighted in paragraph
13 of the main report by the progress recorded in budget execution, debt
management and exceptional spending limitation.
A - Fiscal Policy
The fiscal framework for 2014 has been adjusted to accommodate for higher
spending due to the unexpected shocks. To that end, the basic balance has been
relaxed by 1.3percent of GDP compared to the previous reviews. For 2015, the
authorities' conservative approach, which targets a basic fiscal deficit of
3.7 percent of GDP with the goal of attaining gradually a zero basic balance over
the medium-term, is a clear indication of their commitment to fiscal
consolidation. In this regard, steps will be taken to raise the total revenue from
16.8 percent in 2014 to 17.6% of GDP in 2015. To that end, my authorities will
implement all the envisaged revenue administration measures notably, the
reinforcement of tax audits and tax registration at the General Tax Administration,
the establishment of a single interconnection server linking up offices, a better

4

control of exemptions and a limitation of loopholes of tax exoneration at the
custom administration.
In order to enhance accountability with the view to meet the fiscal objectives, my
authorities subscribe to the proposal of setting performance contracts between
the ministry of finance and all the Directorates having in charge revenue
collection and expenditure execution. Drawing from the lesson of 2014, my
authorities agree with staff’s suggestion not to include the identified exceptional
revenues in the framework until they materialize. On the expenditure side, my
authorities are making further efforts to increase capital spending in health,
education and infrastructure while decreasing current expenditure. They are also
exploring ways, including technical assistance, to improve the efficiency of
spending. They remain also favorable to the recommendation aimed at exerting a
more realistic external-financed capital expenditure estimate, in line with the
trend of an effective disbursement of external aid.
B - Management of Natural Resources
Regarding the management of resources, my authorities are exploring ways to
help reconcile the projected natural resource wealth, on one side, and the
pressing development needs and the establishment of a fiscal framework, which
sets up gradual objectives toward a zero basic balance over the medium-term, on
the other side. A number of actions aimed at maximizing the returns from natural
resource sector are being implemented. These include the recent decision
compelling all mining companies to operate under the new mining code, which
raised mining royalties from 5.5 to 12 percent, the initiation of cost reduction
measures, including the revision of the pricing of domestic refined petroleum
sales, the replacement of foreign workers with Nigerien workers and the
refinancing of the loan to build the refinery on concessional terms. The initiatives
underway aimed at starting crude oil export, including the establishment of the
transportation company and the participation in the capital of this company are
other additional steps toward achieving the objective of increasing natural
resource returns.
C - Debt Management
In spite of their determination to use the unique opportunity given by the
country’s natural resource endowment to speed up the economic transformation,
my Nigerien authorities remain cognizant of the impact of their investment
decisions on debt dynamics. In this regard, they highly appreciate the valuable
advice given by the Fund staff on the need to adopt a more cautious approach,

5

suggesting a deeper prior analysis on future public financial burden before
embarking on any new debt contract. This advice has helped improve the
monitoring of loan agreements, in particular with regard to the loan for the
construction of the refinery, SORAZ and that related to the master facility agreed
with Eximbank of China. The stable qualification of moderate risk of debt distress
for Niger’s 2014 DSA, despite the recent developments on debt, reflects the
authorities’ efforts in debt management and commitment to ensure debt
sustainability. The ministerial committee created last year is a concrete
illustration of their commitment to strengthen and improve their debt
management strategy.
Inclusive Growth Agenda
My authorities’ ultimate goal is to remove the numerous obstacles constraining
the development of economic activities, while creating favorable conditions to
promote inclusive and broad-base growth, consistent with the need to build
infrastructures, improve social indicators and meet the MDGs. Niger’s social
indicators are among the lowest in sub-Saharan Africa, and Niger’s middle class is
small. Its financial system lags behind peers and its annual fiscal cost of
government food support is among the highest in a group of 31 countries. Food
security remains a major problem. These different constraints call for decisive
policy-actions which are being implemented or designed currently by the
authorities. With regard to the financial sector, a development strategy has been
prepared since 2012 with its main strategic targets designed to increase stability
and transparency in the financial sector, deepen the sector and improve the legal
and judicial framework.. The action plan designed to facilitate the implementation
of that strategy was recently updated and will be approved by the authorities
shortly. As regards agriculture, the authorities are seeking ways to increase
agriculture production to an extent that outpace the outcomes recorded with the
3N initiative. To that end, the Plan de Development Economique et Social
(PDOES) 2016-2020, which is being finalized, will include this objective as a
priority. Finally, in order to foster regional trade, several actions are being
implemented, including the reduction of custom check points and supporting
documents for exports and imports and the definition of categories of control at
check points. Over the medium-term, these actions will support any initiative
tending to move forward with the implementation of the proposed regional trade
buffer by ECOWAS.

6

Conclusion
Niger’s medium and long term outlook have improved significantly in light with
the expected returns from the development of the natural resource sector.
Important achievements have been made over the recent years in terms of
macroeconomic stability, revenue mobilization, public finance, and debt
management. However, considerable challenges still lay ahead, in particular, the
need to achieve sustained growth, less dependent on weather conditions and
consistent with their poverty reduction strategy and development needs. My
authorities are taking steps to address these challenges, in particular, by paying
close attention to the implementation of structural reforms in the areas of natural
resources management and public finance management.
Based on the strong commitment shown and the corrective actions taken by the
authorities, I would request Directors’ support for the requested waivers and the
proposed decisions.
