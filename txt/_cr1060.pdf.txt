Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2010 Consultation with the Czech Republic
Approved by Juha Kähkönen and Aasim M. Husain
February 5, 2010
This report is based on discussions held in Prague during January 14–25, 2010.
The mission team comprised Ms. Murgašová (head), Ms. Muñoz, Mr. Tchaidze,
Ms. Westin (all EUR), and Mr. Giustiniani (MCM). Mr. Kiekens (Executive Director)
and Mr. Kollár (Advisor to the Executive Director) also joined some of the discussions.
The mission met with Prime Minister Fischer, Czech National Bank Governor Tůma,
Deputy Finance Ministers Chrenko, Hájková, Hejduk, and Zídek, Deputy Minister
of Education Matesová, and other officials, as well as representatives of the Parliament,
financial and business community, academia, and the media.
Political Background: After the ruling three-party center-right coalition lost a
nonconfidence vote last March, an interim government headed by Prime
Minister Fischer is in power until the general elections in May 2010.
Exchange Rate Regime: The exchange regime is classified as a free float
(Informational Annex). The Czech Republic has accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions
on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.

I. STAFF APPRAISAL
The macroeconomic position was very strong before crisis
1.
Prior to the global financial and economic crisis, the Czech Republic benefited from
integration with the EU, supported by strong macroeconomic policies. Large foreign direct
investment inflows (FDI) fostered trade integration, underpinning an export-led expansion.
Higher initial standard of living contained consumption convergence pressures. An improved
fiscal performance contributed to the comfortable external position. This, combined with
credible inflation targeting, resulted in generally low inflation and interest rates. A liquid and
conservative banking sector limited the build-up of balance sheet vulnerabilities.
But spillover effects have taken their toll
2.
The highly open Czech economy has been significantly affected by the global crisis.
A downturn in the euro area—especially in Germany, the main trading partner—depressed
exports and output fell by 4⅓ percent in 2009. A drop in FDI and the tightening of domestic
banks’ lending standards hit the corporate sector, leading to a decline in investment. Private
consumption held up in spite of rising unemployment, reflecting a supportive fiscal policy.
3.
The external position remained robust despite a sharp decline in capital inflows. The
drop in exports was offset by a larger fall in imports, improving the trade balance. FDI more
than halved and no longer fully finances the current account deficit, but rising inflows of
EU funds filled the gap. The initial depreciation of the Czech koruna was subsequently
reversed, and the real exchange rate remains in line with fundamentals. Overall, market
sentiment vis-à-vis the Czech Republic remains relatively favorable, reflecting limited
vulnerabilities.
4.
The Czech banking sector has weathered the global financial turmoil relatively well.
Healthy capital and liquidity buffers, strong retail funding, and limited exposure to foreign
currency risk eliminated the need for the authorities to undertake bank recapitalization or
other exceptional measures to shore up financial sector stability. However, liquidity in the
interbank market and trading activity in the domestic bond market remain below pre-crisis
levels.
The policy response was adequate
5.
Monetary and fiscal easing provided a sizeable stimulus. The Czech National
Bank (CNB)—the first central bank in Europe to start easing monetary policy
in August 2008—cut the policy rate by a total of 275 basis points through December 2009.
Although the effectiveness of the traditional monetary transmission mechanism has
weakened, such easing—combined with well-timed verbal interventions—kept inflation
largely in positive territory, though well below the target. Automatic stabilizers and fiscal

4
measures helped cushion the decline in growth, increasing the overall fiscal deficit by some
4 percentage points of GDP.
The short-term recovery will depend on external demand
6.
The revival of the Czech economy is expected to be gradual and dependent on the
global recovery. GDP is projected to grow by 1½ percent in 2010, supported by exports and a
buildup of inventories, while fixed capital formation will likely remain depressed. Consumer
spending is expected to decline reflecting still-rising unemployment, a slowdown in wage
growth and the unwinding of fiscal stimulus. Risks to the short-term outlook seem balanced.
The monetary policy should shift to tightening once the economy recovers steadily
7.
The inflation environment will remain benign in the near future. The
recently-approved VAT and excise hikes are expected to push average headline inflation to
over 1½ percent in 2010, still below the new inflation target of 2 percent that came into effect
in January 2010. The easing cycle of monetary policy seems to have come to an end. The
supportive monetary policy stance remains appropriate for now, but should shift to tightening
as the recovery gathers momentum.
The crisis has highlighted the urgency of fiscal adjustment
8.
The crisis took a major toll on the fiscal position. During the years of rapid economic
growth the opportunity for more fundamental fiscal consolidation was missed. The crisis led
to a sharp widening of the overall deficit in 2009, a rapid accumulation of debt, and an
increase in interest rate spreads. In the absence of additional adjustment measures, the budget
deficit is projected to remain above 5 percent of GDP over the medium term, with the level
of public debt doubling to 60 percent of GDP in less than a decade. We estimate that a
structural adjustment of at least 0.7 percent of GDP per year will be required to achieve a
deficit of below 3 percent of GDP in 2013 mandated by ECOFIN. This, however, will not be
sufficient to achieve debt sustainability over the long term, in particular given spending
pressures of population aging.
9.
The 2010 fiscal budget appropriately balances the objectives of fiscal sustainability
and supporting economic recovery. With the projected recovery in the trading partners,
growth is expected to pick up in 2010 in the Czech Republic. Given very low fiscal
multipliers in the highly open Czech economy, additional fiscal stimulus would have limited
effect. At the same time, starting fiscal consolidation would help lower borrowing costs and
likely aid economic recovery by crowding in private investment. The budget—a first marked
step to reverse the deteriorating fiscal position—mostly relies on permanent indirect tax
increases and, to a lesser degree, on temporary expenditure cuts that will expire in 2011. In
this regard, pressures to approve increases in spending in the pre-election period should be
resisted.

5
10.
The government that will be formed after the May general elections will need to
propose a credible and durable plan for fiscal consolidation. Broad support among the social
and political partners, with a wide range of views on the appropriate strategy, will be crucial
for its successful implementation. Fiscal consolidation during 2011–13 should focus on both
expenditure and revenue measures. International experience suggests that expenditure-based
fiscal consolidations tend to be more durable.


Expenditures. Rationalizing mandatory expenditures and the generous welfare system
is unavoidable. Re-organizing public institutions and positions would help reduce the
overall wage bill without reducing wage levels. Introducing means-testing would
improve targeting of social benefits, yield savings, and enhance work incentives.
There is scope for improving efficiency of public services delivery and public
procurement.



Revenues. The tax base needs to be expanded by eliminating exemptions and
loopholes. VAT rates should be unified at the higher rate and taxation of real estate
property be based on market value. While the scope for raising additional revenues
from direct taxation is likely to be limited during the nascent recovery, the current
corporate income tax rate could be reconsidered as it is below the OECD average.
Improving tax administration could improve efficiency of revenue collection.

Demographic trends heighten the need for sustainable pension and health care reforms
11.
A longer-term fiscal challenge arises from the projected rapid aging of the Czech
population and the related increase in social spending. While the pension and health care
systems remain largely unreformed, with limited private participation, the associated
spending is expected to increase by 6 percentage points of GDP over the next 50 years,
bringing total age-related spending to about one quarter of GDP.
12.
Pension reforms should make the public pension scheme sustainable over the long
term and promote the development of a complementary sound private pension system. While
the significant parametric changes to the current PAYG system effective January 2010 are
mostly welcomed, there will be a need for further changes. Additional changes should be
aimed at better linking contributions to benefits and further increasing the effective
retirement age (for example by moving forward to 2020 the increase in the statutory
retirement age to 65 and reducing the period for early retirement back to 3 years). Over the
medium term, consideration should be given to moving to a fully funded second-pillar
private pension scheme, and to prefunding additional reserves to finance future deficits of the
PAYG scheme (or transition deficits if moving toward private pension funds) through
upfront fiscal consolidation measures or any privatization revenues.
13.
Fundamental health care reforms are equally important. The user fees, introduced
in 2008, were a first step in the right direction and could usefully be made means tested.

6
Given the sheer complexity of health care reform, there is a need to establish a working
group with broad representation to lead the reform efforts on:


Institutional reform—reduce the broad coverage of publicly provided and insured
services and allow greater scope for private sector provision of health services, in turn
introducing more competition among insurers and providers.



Financing reform—introduce voluntary insurance, personal health accounts, and
choices in health benefits plans to ensure long-term financial sustainability of the
health care system.

Structural reforms are needed to support long-term growth in the post-crisis environment
14.
The adverse effects of the crisis are likely to be long lasting. A collapse in investment
and slowdown in total factor productivity growth reduced dramatically the growth rate
in 2009–10. Looking ahead, growth is not expected to reach pre-crisis levels due to abating
convergence process, worsening demographic trends, and uncertainties regarding global
long-term growth as a result of the crisis.
15.
Against this background, the swift implementation of growth-enhancing structural
reforms becomes critical. The focus should be on increasing productivity and labor
participation, and improving the quality of the labor force and the business climate to attract
foreign direct investment. The array of measures includes further promoting work incentives
through changes to the tax-benefit system, improving labor market flexibility and the quality
of education, and further reducing barriers to business entry and exit.
Domestic capital markets should be developed further
16.
Local bond markets are not functioning in an efficient way and capital markets
remain underdeveloped. Despite steps taken by the CNB to improve the liquidity of the local
currency government bond market, trading remains thin due to the opaqueness of public debt
management. Capital market development is hampered by poorly-targeted subsidies and tax
exemptions on certain savings products, and old regulations regarding private pension funds.
Further measures should be taken to support the smooth functioning of these markets:


Enhance the transparency of the government bond market by, for example, adhering
to the announced size of bond issuances, to enable accurate pricing by dealers.



Rationalize subsidies and tax exemptions for deposits in building societies and
contributions in voluntary third-pillar pension funds.



Improve the regulation regarding the third-pillar pension funds.

7
Credit quality is a challenge, but banks’ financial health bodes well for credit recovery
17.
The economic downturn has started to take its toll on the banking sector. The share of
banks’ nonperforming loans is expected to rise, thus exercising pressure on banks’
profitability, though the private sector’s moderate debt levels and low interest rates may be
mitigating factors. High single-borrower concentration in the corporate sector and
commercial real estate exposure require high vigilance. Against this background, further
improvements in cost efficiency will become key for the Czech banks. The CNB should
continue closely monitoring developments in banks’ profitability, so as to preserve adequate
capital buffers and liquidity positions. Banks' soundness, low loan-to-deposit ratio, and
parent banks' commitment to the market bode well for banks' ability to resume lending as the
economic outlook improves.
18.
The Czech Republic has a sound financial supervisory and prudential framework. The
framework was further strengthened by the recent widening of the array of remedial
measures to deal with weak credit institutions and systemic risk. Important reforms of the
deposit insurance framework, in line with EU agreements, are pending in parliament. Given
the shortening of the pay-off period of insured depositors, the timeliness and periodicity of
basic information sharing between the CNB and the Deposit Insurance Fund need to be
reviewed. The CNB should continue its efforts in: (i) improving macro-prudential analysis by
taking into account the interaction among liquidity, market, and credit risks; and
(ii) enhancing the integration between macro-prudential analysis and supervision activity.
19.
Given the virtually complete foreign ownership of banks, intensive supervisory
coordination with cross-border authorities remains crucial.
20.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultations take place on a standard
12-month cycle.

8
II. AUTHORITIES’ VIEWS
21.
The authorities agreed with most of staff’s assessment and recommendations,
including the analysis of the crisis impact, prospects for the recovery, the need for fiscal
adjustment and structural reforms, the strategy for monetary policy, and the broad assessment
of financial sector issues. The authorities’ views differed from staff’s with respect to the
specific strategy for pursuing medium-term fiscal consolidation, the feasibility of proposed
pensions and health reforms, and impediments to capital market functioning and
development.
Fiscal consolidation
22.
While the authorities agreed with the need to design a credible policy for a
sustainable medium-term fiscal consolidation, they pointed out that the lack of broad political
consensus on the appropriate strategy made developing specific policy proposals difficult.
They cautioned that some of the proposed measures, in particular on the unification of the
two VAT rates and on the property tax, were unlikely to find support in the near future. They
also noted that despite its limited mandate, the current caretaker government was
spearheading preparation of an Exit Strategy from the Crisis—an options-based approach for
fiscal consolidation combined with other growth-supportive policies. This document could
help in the formulation of fiscal strategy by the new government after the May general
elections.
Pension and health reform
23.
While the problems stemming from population aging and its adverse impact on the
future fiscal balances are widely known, the social sensitivity of pension and health issues
are likely to limit the scope for reforms of these systems in the foreseeable future. The
authorities pointed to the significant parametric changes to the existing first-pillar pension
system (PAYG) that are currently being implemented, but agreed that these changes would
not be sufficient to ensure the sustainability of the pension system. They thought that having
a complementary fully-funded second pillar system was beneficial by creating a more
diversified pension system, but expressed concerns that a voluntary opt-out would mainly
involve wealthier individuals, thus further worsening the financial situation of the PAYG.
The authorities noted that some reserves for funding future pension deficits have already
been created, but questioned the feasibility for building up further significant reserves, in
particular given that no further privatizations were likely.
Financial sector and capital markets
24.
The authorities generally agreed on the imperfect functioning of the domestic
government bond market and the need to develop capital markets further. They noted that
enhancing transparency of government debt management and improving functioning of the
government bond market would be beneficial, but pointed out that the debt management

9
strategy was clear. The MOF agreed that the system of subsidies and tax exemptions on
certain savings products (deposits in building societies and contributions to third-pillar
pension funds) created market distortions, and saw them as impediments for capital market
development in the Czech Republic. Also, the authorities believed that abrupt elimination of
these savings incentives would not be politically feasible and could generate instability in the
financial system. Rather, they saw merits in reviewing and gradually rationalizing these
incentives. Amendments to the law regulating private pension funds, aimed at making these
institutions financially sound in the long term, are pending in Parliament, though their
approval was far from certain.
25.
The CNB was of the view that high single-borrower concentration in the corporate
sector and commercial real estate exposure did not represent a particular source of concern at
the current juncture, but agreed that this issue required adequate monitoring and further
analysis.
26.
The authorities agreed on the need to review the timeliness and frequency of basic
information sharing between the CNB and the DIF in light of the shortening of the period for
paying off depositors.
27.
While supporting closer cooperation and collaboration among home/host supervisors,
the authorities expressed concerns about an EU-wide cross-border bank crisis and resolution
framework since fiscal responsibilities remain at national levels. Moreover, harmonization of
national insolvency and commercial laws would be required.

III. BACKGROUND—STAFF ANALYSIS
A. Impact of the Global Financial and Economic Crisis
1.
The Czech Republic’s macroeconomic position was very strong prior to the
global financial crisis. Growth stood above 6 percent during 2005–07 before slowing
in 2008. Large foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows fostered trade integration,
underpinning an export-led expansion. Higher initial standard of living than most other
countries in the region contained consumption convergence pressures. An improved fiscal
performance contributed to the comfortable external position. Credible inflation targeting
helped maintain low inflation, with the exception of a short-lived spike in 2008 mainly due to
supply shocks and one-off tax increases. With domestic interest rates lower than in the euro
area until recently, private sector borrowing in foreign currency has been quite modest. A
liquid and conservative banking sector limited the build-up of balance sheet vulnerabilities
(Box 1).
2.
Despite its very strong fundamentals, the Czech real economy—highly open to
trade and investment flows—has been impacted by spillover effects from the global
crisis both through a decline in foreign demand and in overall risk tolerance
(Figures 1 and 2).


Global recession, and especially in the main trading partner Germany, depressed
Czech output by 4⅓ percent largely through falling exports (which account for almost
80 percent of GDP) and FDI-financed investment. Private consumption grew
modestly despite rising unemployment, fuelled by low inflation and stable net
incomes that benefited from fiscal automatic stabilizers and discretionary measures.
High frequency indicators point to a recent stabilization of both investment and
exports.



Escalating global risk aversion at the outset of the crisis led to a considerable liquidity
tightening in the Czech interbank market, a slowdown in trading activity in the
government bond market, rising funding costs, currency depreciation, and more
stringent credit conditions. However, overall market sentiment has largely recovered
since then. Risks in the banking system were contained, allowing the economy to tide
over an extended political gridlock and the global market turmoil with relatively low
banking and exchange rate losses.

Box 1. Why Did the Czech Republic Have Less Financial Vulnerabilities than its Peers?
Before the outbreak of the global financial crisis, many economies in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE)
experienced an economic boom fuelled by buoyant credit growth to the private sector. Supported by large capital
inflows, private sector lending was often denominated in foreign currency, thereby breeding vulnerabilities in both
the external and banking sectors. Yet the Czech Republic is an exception in those aspects even compared to its
closest CEE peers—Poland and Hungary. A number of factors help explain this difference:
Higher initial income in the early 1990s has led to lower convergence pressures. In terms of per-capita income
valued at purchasing-power-parity prices, the Czech Republic had a smaller gap vis-à-vis more advanced European
countries (proxied by the euro area). Therefore, the consumption catch-up by households towards European living
standards (particularly durable goods) has been less significant than in Poland and Hungary, as reflected in lower
borrowing and lower external current account deficits.
The low-inflation and low-interest environment has made borrowing in foreign currencies less attractive. The
Czech Republic had no history of hyperinflation, and the monetary overhang in the beginning of the transition
period was minor. The early shift to inflation targeting provided a critical anchor to monetary policy, increasing its
credibility. Persistent currency appreciation helped achieve a low level of inflation fairly rapidly. Fiscal policy was
also prudent, with low deficit and public debt burden. In addition, positive supply-side shocks helped contain
inflation. The Czech Republic was one of the first-wave countries in expanding low-cost, high-efficiency retail
sector during 1997-2005, which lowered distribution margins (the so-called “Wal-Mart effect”). Overall, the low
inflation environment resulted in negative interest spreads vis-à-vis the euro area. This, together with households’
risk-adverse attitudes, made foreign currency borrowing less attractive for households compared with the other
CEEs, despite the appreciating exchange rate.
The Czech banking sector is characterized by high liquidity buffers and conservative retail-oriented business
model. It is funded domestically and has a low loan-to-deposit ratio. These features are the result of a combination
of factors: (i) the bank restructuring process in the late 1990s (which led to the privatization of the sector) removed
bad assets from banks’ balance sheets and transferred them to a (state-owned) special asset management agency in
exchange for government bonds, while preserving the entire depositor base; (ii) large capital inflows in the 1990s
added liquidity into the system, which have been partially absorbed by the CNB through regular open-market
operations; and (iii) the conservative behavior of households, combined with government incentives to save, helped
establish a sound deposit base. More generally, the hard lesson learned during the 1990s banking crisis has led
banks to manage the risk-profile of their activities prudently during the boom years (reflected in a relatively low
risk-weighted-to-total asset ratio).

Inflation remained largely positive in 2009, although well below target. Against
the central bank’s target of 3 percent (+/-1 percentage point band), both headline and core
inflation fell sharply due to weakening domestic demand and falling commodity prices that
more than offset the increases in regulated prices. Moreover, the lagged effects of the rapid
appreciation of the koruna in the first half of the year turned inflation negative in
October 2009. The disinflation trend was reversed in late 2009.

The Czech National Bank (CNB) eased monetary policy significantly through the
use of conventional measures. The CNB, the first central bank in Europe to start the easing
cycle in 2008, gradually cut the policy rate by a total of 275 basis points, combined with
occasional well-timed verbal interventions. However, the effectiveness of the traditional
monetary transmission mechanism has weakened, and market rates have been less responsive
to monetary policy than before the crisis. Retail lending rates have not followed the decline
in policy rates, especially for the household sector. The CNB considered alternative options
for further monetary easing if conventional measures proved insufficient. Although interest

22
rates are the preferred instrument of monetary policy, direct foreign exchange interventions
were seen as the most viable alternative monetary policy option, should the need arise.
5.
Credit to the economy has decelerated dramatically. Total private sector credit
growth slowed to 1½ percent year-on-year in November from 23 percent the year before,
mainly as a result of a contraction of corporate credit. This decline reflects both unfavorable
investment sentiment and tighter credit conditions. Household credit, however, continued its
double-digit growth but slowed down due to uncertainty about households’ future income.
Mortgage lending has performed relatively well, but nonperforming loans of the nonfinancial
corporations are rising faster owing to declining economic activity.
Banks slowed lending activity broadly in line with

The global financial turmoil also spilled into asset prices, but the resulting
second round impact on the real economy was limited (Figure 3).

Real housing prices declined by 10 percent in the first half of 2009 but have since
stabilized. 1 The impact of the asset price decline on the real economy has been mitigated by
the relatively low household indebtedness.

Czech Republic: Credit to the Private Sector
(Y-on-y, percent change)

Real housing prices started to grow later than in other advanced European countries, and the sharp increase
since 2007 was mostly due to the availability of low-interest mortgage loans and the expected VAT hikes in the
construction sector.



Equity markets fell sharply in line with other European stocks through March 2009,
partly recovering later. Yet negative wealth effects arising from equity are small since
less than 4 percent of households own stocks directly.



The koruna, historically a funding currency for carry trades, became temporarily a
high return currency due to near-zero rates in the US and unwinding of previous
positions, contributing to its strengthening in mid-2009. Since late 2009, the koruna
was used again as a funding currency towards higher-yield neighboring countries.



Tightness in money markets started to ease as evidenced by a declining PRIBOR,
although term structure spreads remain high.2 Both financial entities and the
government have been able to issue bonds in foreign currency over the last year.3

7.
The external position remains solid, even though capital inflows have plunged.
The drop in exports has been accompanied by an even larger fall in imports, improving the
trade balance despite the real appreciation. Lower dividend payments reduced the current
account deficit. FDI inflows more than halved and no longer fully finance the current
account, but rising inflow of EU funds filled the gap. Other investments declined as banks
subsidiaries repaid loans to parents abroad, although the flows reversed somewhat in the
second half of the year. Portfolio investment, however, increased reflecting the government
issuance of the Eurobond. International reserves rose slightly to $41 billion (about 4 months
of imports), partly due to the SDR allocation. The real exchange rate remains in line with
fundamentals (Box 2). External debt was modest at 37 percent of GDP at end-2008.

2

The repo facilities introduced by the CNB in October and November 2008 to improve the distribution of
liquidity were not widely used by the banks, partly because of the structural liquidity surplus in the market.

The government issued a €1.5 billion Eurobond on April 28, 2009.

Box 2. External Competitiveness Assessment

On the back of the global financial crisis, the real
effective exchange rate (REER) depreciated sharply.
Rising uncertainty in the foreign exchange markets and
weakening cyclical conditions led to REER depreciation
of about 11 percent. These trends started to reverse in
the second quarter of 2009 due to the improvement in
market sentiment towards the region.

After significant weakening in 2008, export
profitability improved. Margins of Czech exporters to
its main trading destinations recovered from the erosion
of competitiveness in early 2008 caused by the lagged
effects of a strong koruna and rising labor costs, but
deteriorated again in part due to exporters’ over-hedging
caused by the uncertainty in exchange rate
developments. Export shares, however, have continued
to increase after falling in 2008.

B. Macroeconomic Outlook: Gradual Recovery, Though with Risks
9.
The revival of the Czech economy is
expected to be gradual and closely linked
to the global recovery. Staff projects growth
of 1.7 percent of GDP in 2010 driven by the
pickup in foreign demand, especially in
Germany, that will support exports and
inventories. However, fixed capital formation
and corporate credit growth are projected to
remain depressed, while consumer spending
will suffer from a decline in disposable
income due to still rising unemployment, low
wage growth, and the withdrawal of fiscal
stimulus.

without consolidation measures the deficit
would remain above 5 percent of GDP,
with public debt rising to 48 percent of GDP by 2014. The deficit target of below 3 percent of
GDP, mandated by ECOFIN, is to be achieved by 2013 and according to staff’s calculations
will require a structural adjustment of at least 0.7 percent of GDP per year, starting in 2011.
This, however, will not be sufficient to achieve debt sustainability over the long term, in
particular given spending pressures associated with population aging.

14.
The 2010 budget appropriately balances the objectives of preserving fiscal
sustainability and supporting economic recovery. With the economic cycles historically
closely linked to those of the trading partners, in particular Germany, and the projected
recovery in those countries, the growth of the Czech economy is expected to pick up in 2010.
Given very low fiscal multipliers in the highly open Czech economy,7 additional fiscal
stimulus would have limited effect. In this regard, poorly-targeted spending initiatives (such
as the 13th month pension) in the pre-election period should be resisted, as they are likely to
result in higher imports and not stimulate the domestic economy. Furthermore, monetary
policy is likely to continue to be supportive. At the same time, starting fiscal consolidation
would help lower borrowing costs and likely aid economic recovery by crowding in private
investment.8
15.
Beyond 2010, further consolidation will be needed. The government that will be
formed after the May general elections will need to propose a credible and durable plan for
fiscal consolidation for 2011–13. Mustering broad support among the social and political
7

According to 2009 OECD Economic Outlook Interim Report, “Government spending multipliers are
negatively correlated with openness, and the OECD estimate of the multiplier for Poland is indeed about
2.5 times that for the Czech Republic.”
8

The announcement of the Austerity package in September of 2009 helped reduce the spreads on long-term
government bonds, which nevertheless remain above the pre-crisis levels. More broadly, staff’s calculations
suggest that a worsening of the fiscal position could lead to a large increase in the cost of borrowing both via
higher debt levels and higher interest rates on account of large fiscal expansion (an increase of 20 basis points
for a worsening of 1 percent of GDP in the primary fiscal balance) and fast population aging (additional 10
basis points). See “The State of Public Finances Cross-Country Fiscal Monitor: November 2009”
http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/spn/2009/spn0925.pdf

32
partners, who represent a wide range of views on the appropriate strategy, will be crucial for
its successful design and implementation. International experience suggests that expenditure
based consolidations tend to be more durable. In the Czech Republic, medium-term
adjustment should cover expenditures measures, and particularly reduce the high mandatory
spending (about 70 percent of total). At the same time, there is scope to raise revenues and
improve efficiency of the tax system. Since direct taxation tends to restrain growth to a larger
degree, the emphasis should be put on indirect taxes. The following measures were proposed
by staff:


Expenditure measures. Rationalizing mandatory expenditures and the generous
welfare system is unavoidable. Re-organizing public institutions and positions would
help reduce the overall wage bill without reducing wage levels. Introducing means
testing would improve targeting of social benefits, yield savings, and enhance work
incentives. There is scope for improving efficiency of public services delivery and
public procurement.



Revenue measures. The tax base needs to be expanded by eliminating exemptions and
loopholes. VAT rates should be unified at the higher rate in order to eliminate the
across-the-board subsidization of certain goods (that could instead be replaced with
direct means-tested cash subsidies). Taxation of real estate property, currently
generating about one fifth of the OECD average, should be based on market values.
The combination of social security and personal income taxation results in low work
incentives for those with low and middle incomes and thus could be revisited. While
the scope for raising additional revenues from direct taxation is likely to be limited
during the nascent recovery, the

Moreover, long-term age-related
spending pressures underscore the need for
fundamental pension and health care
reforms.9 The Czech population is projected

countries, with the old-age dependency ratio
set to triple to 61 percent over the next
50 years, and the elderly accounting for one

14 percent in 2007. Meanwhile, the pension and health care systems remain largely
unreformed, with only limited private participation. As a result, total age-related public
spending is projected to increase by close to 6 percentage points of GDP over the next
50 years based on current policies, reaching 23½ percent of GDP by 2060.
17.
Pension reforms will need to focus both on further changes to the PAYG system
in the near future and systemic changes over the medium term. Effective January 2010, a
number of parametric changes were introduced to the current first-pillar pension
system (PAYG) aimed at increasing the effective retirement age, including: a gradual
increase in the retirement age to 65 by 2030; a gradual lengthening of the required insurance
period from 25 to 35 years of work; a further reduction in old-age pensions when retiring
early; and a tightening of the criteria for disability pensions. Meanwhile, the gradual
extension of the period for early retirement from 3 to 5 years will have a negative impact on
the effective retirement age. Looking ahead, there will be a need for further parametric
changes to the PAYG system to boost its sustainability, such as better linking contributions
to benefits, moving forward the introduction of the increase in the retirement age to 65 to
year 2020, and reducing the period for early retirement back to 3 years. Over the medium
term, the authorities will need to consider moving to a fully funded second-pillar private
pension scheme, as well as additional prefunding of reserves to finance future deficits of the
PAYG pension scheme (or transition deficits if moving toward private sector funds) through
upfront fiscal consolidation measures, or any forthcoming privatization revenues.
18.
Comprehensive health care reform will also be essential for fiscal sustainability
over the medium term. The introduction of the user fees in 2008 was a first step in the right
direction; looking ahead, such fees could usefully be made means tested. Over the
medium term, there is a need for both institutional and financing reforms, to enhance the
efficiency of the system and ensure its long-term sustainability. Such reforms could build on
the 2006–08 government health care proposal and focus on: reducing the current broad
coverage of publicly provided and insured services and allowing greater scope for private
sector provision of health services, in turn introducing more competition among insurers and
providers; and introducing voluntary insurance, personal health accounts, and choices in
health benefits plans. Given the sheer complexity of health care reforms, a working group
with broad representation should be established to lead the reform effort.
Monetary Policy Should Shift To Tightening Once the Economy Recovers Steadily
19.
The supportive monetary policy stance remains appropriate for now, but should
shift to tightening as the recovery gathers momentum. Staff’s baseline forecast implies
that the inflation environment will remain benign in the near future. The recently-approved
VAT and excise hikes are expected to push average headline inflation to over 1½ percent
in 2010, still below the new inflation target of 2 percent that came into effect in January 2010
(Box 3). Moreover, the fiscal package will somewhat contain domestic demand and suppress
monetary-relevant inflation, and second-round effects of indirect tax increases will be

34
negligible in a context of surplus capacity. Still, the easing cycle of monetary policy seems to
have come to an end and monetary policy should switch to tightening as the recovery starts
gaining momentum.

No target date has been set for euro adoption. An announcement of the euro
adoption date was scheduled for November 1, 2009, but was postponed until after the
elections in the spring of 2010 since the interim government does not have the mandate to
determine the date. Poll results among domestic analysts show that the majority believe 2015
is the earliest realistic target date for euro adoption.

Box 3. Challenges Facing Monetary Policy in the Aftermath of the Crisis
Simulations using the IMF’s Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal model1/ suggest the need for
further monetary policy easing if various exogenous shocks were to occur. These simulations indicate
how the formulation of monetary policy would need to take into account the impact of shocks, abstracting
from the projected gradual economic pickup in staff’s
1.00
baseline projections. The shocks considered include: fiscal

further appreciation of the exchange rate.
Appreciation
0.00

The fiscal package will slightly dampen inflationary
pressures as well as output growth. The tax increase
(mostly VAT)2/ is set to push inflation up, but not influence
the monetary–policy relevant inflation (inflation adjusted for
first-round effects of changes to indirect taxes). The reaction
of monetary policy to the tax hike would be muted because
the monetary authorities would not react to the increase in
indirect taxes, with the reaction to cuts in expenditures
ranging from 20 to 25 basis points. The ensuing slowdown
in consumption due to the VAT hike would be temporarily
compounded by the decrease in social expenditures, pushing
down GDP growth by ¼ percentage point. Second-round
effects of indirect tax increases will be negligible in a
context of weak demand.
In the event of a prolonged collapse in foreign demand,
additional cut in the policy rate would be needed.
Weaker-than-projected export markets causing a double dip
fall in growth of 1–2 percentage points in the first half
of 2010 could result in rapid disinflation.
A koruna appreciation of 2 percentage points would
generate more than ¾ percentage point additional
disinflation, as imports would become cheaper. Although the
koruna slowed its appreciation trend at end-2009, unexpected
strengthening in 2010 could warrant additional interest rate
decreases as well.

Maintaining Financial Stability
21.
The Czech banking sector has so far weathered the global financial turmoil
relatively well owing to healthy capital and liquidity buffers, strong retail funding, and
limited exposure to foreign currency risk (Figure 5). Czech banks, which are mainly
foreign owned, follow a traditional retail-oriented business model and hence have virtually
no exposure to opaque structured products. Their solvency and leverage ratio have been
broadly in line with that of their peers. However, contrary to other banking sectors in the
region, Czech banks fund their activities mainly through domestic retail deposits and display
good liquidity with a loan-to-deposit ratio well below 100 percent. Moreover, the share of
lending in foreign exchange, and hence the implicit vulnerability stemming from currency
mismatch, is minimal.10 As a result of all these factors, Czech banks have been less
vulnerable to the upheavals in their foreign parents’ financial conditions and to the vagaries
of global financial markets. Similarly, risks of contagion from any potential financial shocks
in the region looking ahead appear, at this stage, limited.
22.
As a result, the Czech Republic has been one of the few advanced countries

However, local bond markets are not functioning in an efficient way and capital

As of end-2008, the share of foreign currency loans was virtually zero for bank lending to households and

of the local currency government bond market, trading remains thin due to the opaqueness of
public debt management. Capital market development is hampered by poorly-targeted
subsidies and tax exemptions on certain savings products and old regulations regarding
private pension funds. Further measures should be taken to support the smooth functioning of
these markets: (i) enhance the transparency of the government bond market by, for example,
adhering to the announced size of bond issuances, to enable accurate pricing by dealers;
(ii) rationalize subsidies and tax exemptions for deposits in building societies and
contributions in voluntary third-pillar pension funds; (iii) improve the regulation regarding
the third-pillar pension funds.
24.
Although the Czech banking sector continued to post good profits in 2009, the
economic downturn has started to take its toll. The economic contraction and the
consequent increase in unemployment have fostered a relatively rapid deterioration in the
quality of banks’ loan portfolio, particularly in the corporate segment. During the first part
of 2009, the sharp drop in trade flows together with the weakening of the exchange rate
affected the financial conditions of export-oriented firms, some of which turned out to be
over-hedged due to the uncertainty regarding foreign exchange earnings. Banks have reacted
by tightening lending standards, to some extent reflecting parent banks’ policies,
restructuring the hedging operations of over-hedged firms, and more generally reducing the
risk profile of their assets. As of end-September 2009, still positive growth of banks’ net
operating income has been partially offset by increasing provisioning on nonperforming
loans (NPLs), which have reached almost 5 percent of total loans. The coverage provided by
loan loss provisions has, however, declined to about 60 percent from 70 percent at end–2007,
mainly due to composition factors. The return on equities has declined by less than 2 percent.
Czech banks reduced the risk profile of their balance sheets while NPLs increased.

In 2008, owing to adverse developments in bond and equity markets, Czech
nonbank financial institutions suffered significant losses, which were partially
recuperated during 2009. During the crisis the profit and capital buffers of insurance
companies and pension funds were dented by portfolio investment losses and withdrawal of
funds, which have reflected households’ increased liquidity preference and low returns.

experienced sizeable net redemptions,
which represented a major turnaround compared to 2007. The recent rebound of equity and

risks associated with off-balance
sheet operations remain limited since derivative instruments are mainly used for hedging
exchange and interest rate risk rather than for speculative purposes. Further improvements in
cost efficiency, which already compares well with peer banking sectors, will become key for
the Czech banks. Against this background, the CNB needs to (i) continue monitoring high
single-borrower concentration in the corporate sector and commercial real estate exposure
and, more generally, developments in banks’ profitability so as to preserve adequate capital
buffers, as well as banks’ liquidity positions; (ii) further improve macro-prudential analysis

27.
Although the weak operating environment may constrain banks’ willingness to
lend, some factors bode well for banks’ ability to resume lending once the economic
outlook improves. Czech banks display healthy capital buffer, which, on average, the CNB
estimates to be sufficient to withstand stress scenarios.12 Parent banks have shown strong
commitment to the market, which should mitigate the risks stemming from global deleveraging; albeit slowly, they are working out their problems: some have raised fresh capital
from either private or public sources, while others are in the process of disengaging from
public support. The low loan-to-deposit ratio leaves room for new lending, the growth of
which will remain tied to deposit generating capacity.
28.
The Czech Republic has a sound financial supervisory and prudential
framework, which has been further strengthened by enriching the array of remedial
measures to deal with weak credit institutions and systemic risk. A recent study
conducted at the request of the EU Commission concluded that the Czech Republic has fully
implemented the Capital Requirement Directive, which translates Basel II into a European
regulatory framework.13 A recent amendment to the Act on Banks, effective September 2009,
allows the creation of a bridge bank (which can be fully owned by the state) in order to take
over ailing credit institutions; entrusts the special administrator of a bank in conservatorship
with the powers to carry out purchase-and-assumption (P&A) transactions; and streamlines
the procedures for increasing a bank’s capital. The amendment also strengthens the CNB’s
oversight powers on banks’ liquidity and it enables the CNB to temporarily prohibit or

40
restrict some banking activities across-the-board, including branches of foreign banks, in
case the stability of the banking and financial system as a whole is in jeopardy.
29.
However, further improvements in the deposit insurance and bank resolution
techniques can be considered. The section of the Act on Banks regarding the resources of
the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF), which in the Czech Republic acts as a mere paybox, is
currently under review. The main amendments concern the shortening of the depositors’
pay-out period, the establishment of a target for the DIF’s resources, the temporary increase
in credit institutions’ contributions and the potential recourse to financial assistance from the
state budget in case the DIF were unable to borrow from the market. A financially sound DIF
would shore up depositors’ confidence. However, there is also the need to ensure the DIF’s
access to timely and accurate information on insured deposits in order to meet its obligations
to depositors promptly.14 To this end, the information sharing process between the CNB and
the DIF needs to be reviewed. While preserving the role of the CNB as unified supervisor,
consideration could be given to further strengthen the bank resolution framework by
envisaging the potential use of the DIF resources in carrying out “assisted” P&A transactions
(provided that the “least-cost-solution” principle is satisfied).
30.
Since the Czech banking sector is virtually foreign-owned, intensive supervisory
coordination with cross-border authorities is crucial. In this context, the ongoing revision
of the EU financial sector supervisory framework should be viewed by the Czech authorities
as an opportunity to strengthen the liaison with home-country supervisors and contribute to
the development of a strong cross-border resolution framework.

14

Pursuant to the revision of the EU Directive, the payout delay is going to be reduced to twenty working days;
this period can be extended by additional ten days only under exceptional circumstances.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
The currency of the Czech Republic is the Czech koruna, created on
February 8, 1993 upon the dissolution of the currency union with the
Slovak Republic, which had used the Czechoslovak koruna as its currency.
From May 3, 1993, to May 27, 1997, the exchange rate was pegged to a
basket of two currencies: the deutsche mark (65 percent) and the
U.S. dollar (35 percent). On February 28, 1996, the Czech National Bank
widened the exchange rate band from ±0.5 percent to ±7.5 percent around
the central rate. On May 27, 1997, managed floating was introduced. In
the Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions,
the de facto exchange rate regime of the Czech Republic is classified as a
free float. Since 2002, the CNB has not engaged in direct interventions in
the foreign exchange market. International reserves have been affected by
the off-market purchases of large privatization receipts and EU transfers
and the sales of the accumulated interest. On December 31, 2009, the
exchange rate of the Czech koruna stood at CZK 18.368 per U.S. dollar.

3
The Czech Republic has accepted the obligations of Article VIII and
maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions. The Czech
Republic maintains exchange restrictions for security reasons, based on
UN Security Council Resolutions and Council of the European Union
Regulations, that have been notified to the Fund for approval under the
procedures set forth in Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51).

The 2008 Article IV consultation with the Czech Republic was concluded on
February 6, 2009. The staff report and PIN were published on April 14, 2009.

FSAP Participation and ROSCs:
An FSAP was carried out in late 2000/early 2001. The Financial System Stability

concurrently with the staff report for the 2001 Article IV Consultation. ROSCs

APPENDIX II: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision is adequate for surveillance. The Czech Republic subscribed to the Special
Data Dissemination Standard in April 1998, and metadata and annual observance reports
for 2006–2008 are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
(http://dsbb.imf.org).
Data on core surveillance variables are available to the Fund regularly and with minimal lags
(reporting to STA is less current, especially for foreign trade and the national accounts).
Exchange rates and interest rates, set by the Czech National Bank (CNB), are reported daily
with no lag. Gross and net international reserves are reported on a monthly basis with a oneweek lag, as well as on a 10-day basis (with the CNB’s balance sheet) with a one-week lag.
Consumer prices, reserve money, broad money, borrowing and lending interest rates, central
government fiscal accounts, and foreign trade are reported monthly with a lag of between one
and four weeks. Final monetary survey data are available with a lag of about one month.
GDP and balance of payments data are made available on a quarterly basis with a lag of two
to three months; trade balance data are available monthly, with a two–month lag. Annual data
published in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook cover all operations of the general
government, including the extrabudgetary funds excluded from the monthly data. These
annual data are available on a timely basis. Monthly fiscal data published in International
Financial Statistics (IFS) cover state budget accounts and are available with a two- to threemonth lag.
While data quality is generally high, some deficiencies remain in certain areas, and the
authorities are taking measures to improve data accuracy.


National accounts data are subject to certain weaknesses. Value added in the
small-scale private sector is likely to be underestimated, as the mechanisms for data
collection on this sector are not yet fully developed and a significant proportion of
unrecorded activity stems from tax evasion. However, quarterly estimates for small
enterprises (less than 20 employees) have been improved recently using
administrative data on social insurance. Discrepancies between GDP estimates based
on the production method and the expenditure method are large and are subsumed
under change in stocks. There are swings from quarter to quarter in some seasonally
adjusted series that need to be corrected by smoother trend-cycle data.



Recently, revisions to procedures for processing export data have brought external
trade statistics close to the practice in the EU.



Monetary survey data provided to the European Department are generally adequate
for policy purposes. However, large variations in the interbank clearing account float,

6
especially at the end of the year, require caution in interpreting monetary
developments. The CNB has made a major effort to identify the causes of these
variations and adjust the data. In 2002, to meet EU statistical conventions, the CNB
implemented the European Central Bank’s (ECB) framework for collecting,
compiling, and reporting monetary data. The data published in IFS are based on
monetary accounts derived from the ECB’s framework. The same set of accounts also
forms the basis for monetary statistics published in the CNB’s bulletins and on the
website, which are thereby effectively harmonized with the monetary statistics
published in IFS, although the presentation in IFS differs somewhat from the CNB’s.


Annual fiscal data on ESA-95 basis has been prepared by the Czech Statistical Office.
Quarterly data for non-financial accounts have also been compiled and quarterly
financial accounts are being prepared. The Ministry of Finance uses the ESA-95
methodology for the Convergence Program targets. The ESA-95 methodology differs
from the national (fiscal targeting methodology) in terms of the coverage of the
institutions (for example, the Czech Consolidation Agency is included in the central
government under ESA definition) and inclusion of financial transactions and other
accrual items (for example, called guarantees). The Ministry of Finance participated
in the Fund’s pilot project to transition to the statistical methodologies outlined in
Government Finance Statistics Manual, 2001.

Statement by the Staff Representative on the Czech Republic
February 22, 2010
This statement provides information on economic developments since the staff report was
issued (SM/10/30). The new information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.
The recently released data are in line with staff expectations. According to flash
estimates, the Czech economy contracted by 4.3 percent in 2009. Unemployment continued
to increase, reaching 9.8 percent in January, up from 9.2 percent a month earlier. Inflation
remains benign, with the year-on-year CPI increase at 0.7 percent in January, compared to
1 percent in December.
2.
As expected, the central bank kept its key policy rate unchanged at 1 percent in
its February 4 meeting. According to the latest Inflation Report, the CNB expects inflation
to remain subdued in the first half of the year and to reach the 2 percent target in the first half
of 2011.
3.
On February 8, the government approved the new Convergence Program. The
program aims to reduce the budget deficit to 4.2 percent of GDP in 2012. This would require
an additional adjustment of 1.2 percent of GDP in 2013 to meet the target mandated by
ECOFIN. The program acknowledges the need for significant reductions in current (and
particularly mandatory) expenditures, with the new government having to identify specific
measures. To a lesser extent the program emphasizes revenue increases and proposes one
new measure (introduction of a second PIT rate of 31 percent for incomes exceeding the
social security ceiling).
4.
Rising concerns about debt sustainability in the euro zone have led to some
increase in interest rates on government debt. The authorities have not encountered any
problems attracting financing, but the average yield at the latest bond auction on February 10
was some 40 basis points higher than at the previous auction in December 2009. Although
overall demand was twice the amount offered, the authorities decided to sell only about
60 percent of the offered bonds.
5.

The general elections have been scheduled for May 28–29, 2010.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
Czech Republic
On February 22, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Czech Republic.1
Background
The Czech economy’s fundamentals were strong prior to the global economic and financial
crisis. Nevertheless, due to its highly open nature, the economy was hit by spillover effects. A
downturn in the euro area depressed exports, while investment declined due to a drop in FDI
and the tightening of banks’ lending standards. Monetary and fiscal easing provided helpful
stimulus, thereby cushioning the economic downturn. Between August 2008 and
December 2009 the Czech National Bank cut the policy rate by 275 basis points, while
automatic stabilizers and fiscal measures widened the budget deficit by 4 percent of GDP
in 2009. The real output decline is estimated to be 4⅓ percent in 2009.
The recovery of the Czech economy is expected to be gradual. GDP is projected to grow by
1½ percent in 2010, supported by exports and a buildup of inventories, while fixed capital
formation will remain depressed and consumer spending is expected to decline reflecting
still-rising unemployment, a slowdown in wage growth, and the unwinding of fiscal stimulus.
Furthermore, the adverse effects of the crisis are likely to be long lasting. A collapse in
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

2
investment and slowdown in total factor productivity growth reduced dramatically the output
growth rate in 2009–10, and over the medium-term growth is not expected to reach pre-crisis
levels. Risks to the short-term outlook seem balanced.
The tax hikes approved as part of the 2010 budget are expected to push average headline
inflation to over 1½ percent in 2010, but still below the target of 2 percent. The external position
remains solid, as the drop in exports has been accompanied by an even larger fall in imports,
thus improving the trade balance despite the real appreciation.
Credit to the economy has decelerated dramatically reflecting both unfavorable investment
sentiment and tighter credit conditions. Household credit, however, continued its double-digit
growth and mortgage lending has performed relatively well. Overall, the banking sector
weathered the turmoil relatively well, owing to healthy capital and liquidity buffers, strong retail
funding, and limited exposure to foreign currency risk. This helped avoid the need to implement
bank recapitalization from public funds or use other exceptional measures to shore up financial
sector stability.
Executive Board Assessment
The Executive Directors noted that the Czech Republic entered the crisis from a strong
macroeconomic position, bolstered by integration with the EU and sound policies. However,
spillover effects have taken their toll on the highly open Czech economy.
Directors viewed the authorities’ policy response to the crisis—monetary and fiscal easing—as
appropriate. The external position remains robust and the real exchange rate is in line with
fundamentals. The banking sector has weathered the global financial turmoil relatively well
without the need for the authorities to undertake bank recapitalization or other exceptional
measures to shore up financial sector stability.
Directors expected that the revival of the Czech economy would be gradual and dependent on
the global recovery, supported by exports and a buildup of inventories. They considered that the
supportive monetary policy stance remains appropriate for now, but should shift to tightening as
the recovery gathers momentum.
Directors agreed that the main challenge for the authorities will be to reverse the recent
widening of budget deficits in a sustainable manner. They viewed the 2010 budget as
appropriately balancing the objectives of attaining fiscal sustainability and supporting economic
recovery, and cautioned against any additional spending prior to the May general elections. The
new government will need to propose a credible and durable plan for medium-term fiscal
consolidation in order to achieve debt sustainability, including in light of spending pressures
from population aging. The new plan should draw and expand on the recently approved
Convergence Program. A number of Directors called for greater focus on expenditure
reductions than in the past, including measures to improve the efficiency of public services.
Directors supported the need to cut expenditures, in particular mandatory spending, as well as
to expand the tax base, unify VAT rates, and improve tax administration. While Directors viewed

3
reconsidering the Corporate Income Tax (CIT) rate as a possibility, a number of Directors did
not favor raising it. It will also be crucial to tackle the longer-term fiscal challenges of pension
and health care reforms, which will need a broad political consensus. Improved monitoring of
budget execution will be important.
Directors considered that the adverse effects of the crisis are likely to be long lasting, and that
growth is not expected to reach pre-crisis levels owing to the abating convergence process and
worsening demographic trends. They called for swift implementation of growth-enhancing
structural reforms to increase productivity and labor participation, and to improve the business
climate.
Directors noted that capital markets development has been hampered by poorly-targeted
subsidies, tax exemptions on certain savings products, and old regulations regarding private
pension funds, and suggested that further measures be taken to support the smooth functioning
of these markets.
Directors considered that further improvements in cost efficiency would become key for Czech
banks as the economic downturn affects banking sector profitability, and encouraged the
authorities to closely monitor developments. Still, Directors thought that banks' soundness, low
loan-to-deposit ratio, and parent banks' commitment to the market bode well for banks’ ability to
resume lending as the economic outlook improves.
Directors welcomed the strengthening of the financial supervisory and prudential framework
through an array of remedial measures, and expressed support for the Czech National Bank’s
continued efforts to improve and enhance the integration of macro-prudential analysis and
supervision activity. Given the virtually complete foreign ownership of banks, intensive crossborder supervisory coordination remains crucial.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Mr. Willy Kiekens, Executive Director for the Czech Republic and
Mr. Miroslav Kollar, Advisor to the Executive Director
February 22, 2010
We thank staff for their papers and constructive approach during the mission. The Czech
authorities broadly agree with the staff’s appraisal, especially with respect to the need for
fiscal consolidation. The authorities welcome staff’s call for reforms in the pension and
health care system. They observe that a fundamental reform in these areas requires wide
political consensus.
Political background
The current caretaker government, which was set up in early 2009 after the collapse of the
previous coalition government, has a limited political mandate and is therefore constrained
with respect to fundamental fiscal or other reforms. The next general elections will be held in
May 2010. The two major political parties have somewhat different approaches for fiscal
consolidation. While the social democrats of the CSSD generally prefer tax increases, the
civic democrats of the ODS favor cuts in mandatory expenditures, especially the benefits
system, and increase in effectiveness of the tax system and tax collections. With respect to
pension and health care system reforms, neither of the major political parties has made any
strong commitment yet.
Economic background
The Czech economy has been severely hit by the global economic and financial crisis.
According to preliminary data released by the Czech Statistical Office on February 12, 2010,
real GDP fell by 4.3 percent y-o-y in 2009, driven mainly by a decline in external demand
and investments. GDP contracted by 4.2 percent in 4Q 2009. Industrial production declined
by 13.4 percent y-o-y in 2009.
The unemployment rate reached 6.8 percent in 2009. The Czech National Bank (CNB)
estimates that unemployment may reach a peak of 8.9 percent in 2010/2011.
The extent of the Czech economy’s decline was similar to other Western European
economies but was less severe than in some of the Eastern European economies. The Czech
economy’s decline reflects its strong trade linkages to Western Europe, especially Germany.
The future course of economic growth in the Czech Republic largely depends on the growth
dynamics in Western Europe. The Czech authorities expect some improvement in economic
activity in 2010, with a more sustained economic rebound expected in 2011. The end of the
cash-for-clunkers program in Germany and the weaker than expected economic growth in
Western Europe in 4Q 2009, which suggests only a gradual and uneven recovery of foreign
demand, are the main external risks to economic growth in the Czech Republic. The CNB

2
expects GDP to grow by 1.4 percent in 2010 and by 2.1 percent in 2011. The Czech Ministry
of Finance (MoF) is somewhat more optimistic as it expects GDP growth of 2.6 percent
in 2011. The main drivers of GDP growth in 2010 will be net exports while household
consumption will be quite week this year.
With a deficit of 6.6 percent of GDP in 2009, the fiscal position worsened significantly but
remains comparable to a number of Western European countries and more favorable than in
some other Eastern European countries as well as in some euro area countries.
Monetary policy and the banking sector
CPI inflation bottomed in 2009, reaching 0.2 percent in 3Q 2009. The CNB started to
decrease its policy interest rates already in August 2008, from 3.75 percent to 1 percent
currently. The February 2010 forecast of the CNB sees inflation returning to its new
2 percent target in the first half of 2011, suggesting that the cycle of interest rates easing may
have probably ended. The main drivers of inflation in 2010 will be tax changes, a rise in
regulated rents, growing gasoline prices and a modest recovery in food price growth. There
are no apparent fundamental inflationary pressures in the economy at the moment, even
though there is uncertainty associated with the nominal wage growth. The transmission
mechanism of the monetary policy is improving and remained operational even during the
crisis. The CNB did not have to rely on any truly non-conventional monetary policy
measures. The measures introduced during the crisis (i.e. liquidity-providing repo operations
with fixed rate, full allotment and collateralized by Czech government bonds), were used by
the banks only to a very small extent. Monetary policy performed well during the crisis and
retained its credibility. Inflation expectations remain anchored. The CNB regards the current
level of the CZK/EUR exchange rate as broadly in line with fundamentals and believes that
the trend of equilibrium real appreciation will resume in the medium to longer term. Foreign
investors perceive the Czech economy as stable with a relatively low public debt level.
With respect to enhancing the integration between macro-prudential analysis and supervision
analysis, the CNB established a macro-financial panel taking place before each monetarypolicy meeting of the Central Bank Board. This panel gathers representatives from both the
monetary policy department and the supervision and financial stability departments to
discuss e.g. current macro-prudential issues and results the banking sector stress-tests.
The Czech banking sector proved largely resilient to the crisis. Czech banks operate in a
conservative business model and have relatively healthy balance sheets. As staff pointed out,
the share of foreign exchange loans is very low, banks are well capitalized and funded
domestically mainly from deposits. The economic downturn is causing an increase in nonperforming loans and default rates, especially loans to corporations. Nevertheless, even the
most pessimistic scenarios of the CNB’s stress-tests show that the banking sector is able to
withstand even a significant increase in default rates without any intervention from the

3
government or central bank. The future course of the banks’ lending will be conditioned on
the economic growth prospects both at home and in Western Europe.
With respect to the staff appraisal of the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF), the authorities
believe that the role of the DIF should be limited to a pay-box.
Fiscal policy
Fiscal policy is the main challenge for the next Czech government. During the current
economic crisis, the fiscal position significantly worsened. According to the January 2010
numbers from the MoF, the overall budget deficit in 2009 reached 6.6 percent of GDP and is
projected to reach 5.3 percent of GDP in 2010. Public debt increased from 30 percent of GDP
in 2008 to approximately 35.2 percent of GDP in 2009. With more than 70 percent of
government expenditures being mandatory and quasi-mandatory, the structural problems of
public finances are obvious and existed already before the crisis. The overall budget deficit
worsened during the crisis because of both automatic stabilizers and anti-crisis measures. The
austerity package approved by the current government attempts to bring the deficit down
in 2010. Even though the current government has a limited mandate and tenure, it tries to act
responsibly and prepare the ground for the next government with respect to fiscal
consolidation. The Czech Republic has been one of the first European countries to start fiscal
consolidation. There was a shift from direct to indirect taxation in 2010, which is in
accordance with staff’s proposal. The MoF’s long-term goal is to unify the VAT tax rate. In
the medium term, it plans to move more goods from the lower tax rate to the higher tax rate.
The MoF is currently working on reviewing the tax base and minimizing the occurrence of
exemptions by 2011. The MoF agrees with staff that social benefits system is too generous
and should be better targeted. In cooperation with the World Bank, the MoF plans to
establish one collecting agency for all taxes (except of tariffs) by 2013. The MoF is also
aware of the fact that more efforts should be made in improving the entrepreneurial
environment and the competitiveness of the Czech economy.
The authorities believe that the government bond market is slowly recovering from the crisis.
On the primary market, investors’ demand for government bonds is still strong. The MoF
regards its debt management to be transparent, rooted in its publicly available debt
management strategy and sees no troubles for refinancing in 2010.
On February 8, 2010, the government approved the Convergence Program – a medium-term
budget plan that should lead to compliance with the fiscal Maastricht convergence criterion
by 2013. The budget deficit should be reduced to 3 percent of GDP by 2013. All political
parties respect this commitment and agree that without necessary fiscal consolidation
measures, this goal cannot be achieved. The Convergence Program sets out the goal and
sketches possible solutions to reduce the budget deficit to 3 percent by 2013. The concrete
measures will need to be approved and taken by the new government. An appropriate

4
legislative framework needs to be prepared in advance for the 2011 budget measures. The
Convergence Program was sent to the European Commission.
On February 8, 2010, the government also approved its exit strategy. The consolidation of
public finances and the fight against corruption are at its forefront, with a proposal to
harmonize the tax base for the calculation of personal income tax and social and health
insurance, to reduce wages in the public sector, confirmed doubling of the real estate tax, and
other temporary changes or increases in indirect taxes and personal income tax. Additional
proposed measures include improving the business environment, reducing administrative
burden on companies and a wide array of concrete steps in the energy industry, housing
policy, tourism, EU funds administration, transport policy, export policy, social policy,
employment policy, agriculture, and environmental policy. These government proposals
received mixed feedback from the political parties but could serve as a guideline for the
future government.
Structural issues
The current government welcomed the reform call by staff in the pension and health care
systems, though admitted that these two areas are the most sensitive issues in the Czech
Republic. Their reform will require a broad political consensus. Both of these areas are
largely affected by the rapidly ageing Czech population. For the pension system, a number of
smaller changes have been already approved both to the pay-as-you-go system and the
voluntary pension pillar. Last January, the Minister of Finance together with Minister of
Labor and Social Affairs re-established the so-called Bezdek Committee for the pension
reform. This advisory body should evaluate its findings from 2004-2005, based on the
current economic environment and recommend the most suitable scenario and future reform
steps.
With respect to the health care reform, there is no platform set up to discuss possible reform
proposals yet, but all political parties envision a need for a deeper structural reform of the
health care system.
