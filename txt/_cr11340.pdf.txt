STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
October 5, 2011

KEY ISSUES
Context. The economy is projected to expand modestly in 2011, with inflation up
somewhat from low levels, due mostly to higher fuel and food prices. Consistent with a
continued improvement in the terms of trade, the external current account deficit would
remain at around 3 percent of GDP, with the reserve cover at about 3 months of imports
by year-end. Liquidity in the banking sector is ample, but nonperforming loans remain at
a high level. At the same time, potential growth has fallen, with weaker business and
social indicators. Within the relatively weak policy framework, these factors have
heightened Belize’s vulnerability to shocks.
Fiscal Consolidation. The current fiscal strategy is insufficient to place the public debt
ratio firmly on a downward trajectory, and to address the large financing needs that are
projected to emerge over the medium term. Fiscal policy should thus be strengthened to
rebuild macroeconomic buffers in the context of rising rollover risks and emerging
contingencies.
Safeguarding financial sector and monetary stability. Credit risks remain elevated,
warranting continued and close monitoring by the central bank. The authorities are using
the recommendations of the recent FSAP mission to guide financial sector reforms.
Boosting growth and reducing poverty. Boosting growth will require removing key
infrastructure bottlenecks and improving the environment for doing business. While the
authorities have strengthened their anti-poverty policies, greater efforts are needed in
monitoring and evaluating existing programs relative to their targets and cost
efficiencies.

Authorities’ Views
13.

The authorities noted that the

economic slowdown, increased poverty, a
surge in crime, and the associated need for
increased citizenry security constrained
their efforts at more aggressive fiscal
consolidation. They explained that their
reform efforts had thus far have been
concentrated in the areas of revenue
administration, public financial management,
and better coordination of capital spending
across ministries. They also indicated that they
had not been able to press ahead as decisively
as expected in reforming the public sector
systems because of a lack of adequate
resources. They also identified the areas of
public financial management and tax system
for future reforms.
14.

In the area of revenue

administration, the authorities’ strategy has
been to focus on improving the
enforcement of existing tax rules. This
strategy, closely supported by technical
assistance (TA) from CARTAC and the CDB, has
involved four elements. First, modernization of
the customs and excise departments, including
with the introduction of ASYCUDA (Automated
Systems for Customs Data World). Second,

practices and organization, including with the
adoption of a code of conduct for staff. The
authorities, however, recognize that further
operational efficiency gains can be attained,
including through integrating the domestic tax
departments, and plan on doing so through a
gradual process; this would involve a
time-consuming process of restructuring units
and retaining qualified staff. The authorities
explained that further enhancement of these
measures could yield up to ½ percent of GDP
over the next six months, which could allow for
a better primary surplus. Fourth, strengthening
the legislative framework. In this area, new
legislation governing customs, GST and
income tax areas is scheduled to be passed
into law in early 2012.
15.

In the area of public financial

management, the focus has been on
modernizing financial legislation. In
FY 2010/2011, the Fiscal Transparency and
Responsibility Regulations were passed by
parliament under the Finance and Audit
(Reform) Act of 2005. These regulations will
increase the transparency and clarity of
government’s fiscal policy objectives within the
context of the multiyear budget framework.
They will also provide a basis for assessing
fiscal outcomes against publicly announced
targets on a regular basis. This framework, in

The authorities stated that they are

company was profitable and that the financial
position of the electricity distribution company

The authorities plan to use the dividends from
these companies for the servicing of a bond
that would be issued in compensation to the
former owners. They indicated that they would

obligations on the government books) once

policy, they have requested TA for an
assessment of the existing tax regime,
including its fairness and efficiency, before
contemplating any further adjustments to
existing taxes. More broadly, they are also
currently negotiating with the CDB a policy
based loan, which would help to finance a
number of reform initiatives, including
strengthening public financial management
practices.

While near term prospects are

moderately positive, Belize’s medium
outlook remains uncertain. Against the
backdrop of a slow global recovery, the pace
of growth has been sluggish while inflation has
picked up somewhat, driven by higher food
and fuel prices. The external position has
stabilized, supported mainly by favorable
terms-of-trade. Under current policies, gross
financing requirements would continue to rise
over the medium term, and securing such
financing abroad will be a challenge. The
accumulation of contingent liabilities has
further reduced the space for policy maneuver.

Box 1. Belize: Gross Contingent Fiscal Liabilities
Staff estimates that contingent liabilities stand at 17 percent of GDP. There is still a great deal of
uncertainty about the valuation of nationalized companies as the entire process is being challenged in
courts.
Contingent fiscal liabilities, which have caused
fiscal problems for Belize in the past, are now
rising again. In 2007, the obligations of the stateowned Development Finance Cooperation had to be
assumed by the central government, as part of an
overall restructuring of government’s external debt
obligations. The authorities also had to pay the debt
obligations of domestic private enterprises when
guarantees were called. In 2011, total fiscal
contingent liabilities are estimated at 17 percent of
GDP, with only 0.7 percent of GDP recorded in the
official debt statistics. Contingencies comprise four
main sources: (a) contingencies arising from
nationalized assets, including BTL and BEL;
(b) cancelled contracts, including with foreign
investors; (c) loan guarantees to the private sector;
and (e) pending court judgments, mainly associated
with foreign investors (Table).

The government of Belize has also accumulated
some contingent fiscal assets. For 2011, staff
estimates contingent fiscal assets at approximately

12.6 percent of GDP. These comprise two key
categories: (i) the net value of nationalized assets
(12.5 percent of GDP), including BTL and BEL; and
(ii) outstanding tax obligations from the private
sector (0.1 percent of GDP), including those of
NEWCO (airport concession).
The authorities have taken some actions to
address risk associated with fiscal contingencies,
but more needs to be done. First, a qualitative
fiscal framework and strategy has been adopted to
guide medium term fiscal policy. Second, the
Finance Act has been strengthened, with severe
sanctions for non-compliance. Third, some efforts
have been made to record the explicit loan
guarantees in debt statistics. Fourth, the proceeds of
the partial reprivatization of the BTL have been
sequestered to facilitate eventual compensation of
the former owners. In addition, the authorities are
participating in the Caribbean Catastrophe Insurance
Facility (CCRIF), which provides rapid pay outs for
covered natural events, including hurricanes and
earthquakes meeting a specified intensity threshold.
To fully protect the budget, however, the
authorities would need to do more. This would
include: (i) extending the qualitative fiscal framework
to monitor fiscal risks and measure benefits
associated with contingent fiscal liabilities, including
integrating its management with conventional debt;
(ii) integrating the fiscal risks, including contingent
liabilities in the budget process and presenting it in
the annual budget documents into a single
statement of fiscal risks; and (iii) establishing clear
guidelines for issuing government guarantees,
including limiting the scope and duration of
contingent liabilities, through time and terminating
clauses for contingent claims.

Box 2. Belize: Illustrative Medium-term Scenarios
This box compares the authorities’ fiscal policy stance vis-à-vis the enhanced policy framework
recommended by staff. Under the recommended framework, public debt would gradually decline from
80 percent of GDP to 45 percent of GDP by the end of the decade.
In the baseline scenario, policies are those
announced in the 2011/12 budget. This scenario
projects growth of about 2.5 percent over the mediumterm, but with increasing gross financing needs. This
scenario is based on a primary balance of 2 percent of
GDP, and a weakened business environment, leading to
lower investment, including foreign direct investment,
than in previous years. By the end of the decade, the
public debt ratio would remain high, at about
70 percent of GDP and foreign reserves would decline
to about 1.5 months of imports. While domestic
financing would remain broadly stable, the authorities’
fiscal path implies increased reliance on external
financing over the medium term. In particular, gross
financing needs would rise from 4 percent of GDP in
2013 to around 7½ percent by the end of this decade
(Table 6). Securing such financing will be a challenge. In
the context of the recent downgrade of Belize’s
sovereign debt by S&P, and the widening trading
discount on the super bond, this would be unrealistic
and hence the need for a higher primary balance.

The alternative fiscal adjustment scenario
contemplates strengthened policies. This scenario
envisages faster growth and lower external financing
needs. In 2013, growth would rise to 3 percent, and
then remain at 3½ percent for the remainder of the
decade. It is based on sustaining a primary surplus of
4 percent of GDP starting in 2013/14, an assumed
reallocation of spending toward capital and social
priorities, and increased private investment, including
foreign direct investment, that would result from
improved business environment. Under this scenario,
public debt would gradually decline to 45 percent of
GDP and foreign reserves would strengthen to
4 months of imports by the end of this decade. To this
end, staff recommended the following fiscal actions:


Expenditure: reversing the upward trend in
the wage bill relative to GDP; limiting growth in nonpriority spending areas; and making sustainable, the

contributions on the public officer’s pension scheme

Box 4. Belize—Exchange Rate Assessment and External Stability
The exchange rate is broadly in line with its equilibrium level, and deviations from equilibrium remain moderate
(under 10 percent) under alternative approaches.
After a temporary appreciation in real effective terms in
2009, Belize’s currency has retaken its depreciation trend.
Reflecting the low domestic inflation in Belize relative to its
trading partners, the real exchange rate depreciated some
12 percent from June 2010 to July 2011. It has now reached its
lowest level since 1980.
On balance, the exchange rate appears to be broadly in
line with its equilibrium level. Staff used the external
sustainability (ES) and macroeconomic balance (MB)
approaches to assess external stability in Belize. Both
approaches suggest that the Belize dollar is slightly above its
equilibrium value. The ES approach suggests that a modest
depreciation (½ percent) would stabilize the net foreign asset
position at a stable level, while the MB approach also points to
a similar depreciation (2 percent) to bring the projected
external current account deficit (6.3 percent of GDP) down to
its norm level (5½ percent of GDP) over the medium term.
Sensitivity analysis to the key parameters confirmed this
assessment, as the deviation from equilibrium will remain
moderate (under 10 percent) under the alternative scenarios.
The equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) approach, confirms
that the exchange rate is broadly in line with its fundamentals,
as it suggests the Belize dollar is moderately (8 ¾ percent)
below its equilibrium value at end-2010.
External debt sustainability assessments highlight
some vulnerability to Belize’s external position

account is consistent with a moderately declining external
debt ratio over the medium term (to some 60 percent of GDP
by 2016), the debt trajectory is vulnerable to shocks. In
particular, the external debt ratio is sensitive to depreciation
and current account shocks. In addition, annual external
financing needs will remain high, at 5–8 percent of GDP, which
represents an additional source of vulnerability. Beyond the
medium term, the widening of the current account represents
another source of risk, as it would drive the decline in reserve
coverage to under 2 months of imports by 2019 (Table 5).

APPENDIX I—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS (DSA)
The results of the DSA are broadly in line with those of the 2010 Article IV consultation. While this
assessment projects slightly lower public debt ratios over the medium term due to a somewhat
stronger fiscal performance and lower world interest rates, debt remains high and vulnerable to shocks

2.

Economic growth will remain subdued.

Feeble growth among Belize’s main trading partners
and a weak investment climate will constrain growth
rates at 2.5 percent over the medium-term.
3.

The main financing assumptions are as

follows: domestic debt is broadly constant;
multilateral and bilateral loans are borrowed at LIBOR
plus 100 bps; and that projected financing needs will
be covered primarily by external commercial creditors
at market interest rates. In particular, the spread over
the U.S. T-Bond is assumed at 400 bps over the
medium-term, and at 650 bps over the second half of
the decade. FDI inflows will remain below historical
levels.

broadly stable, but financing needs will further
increase to 7½ percent of GDP by 2019, due to the
start of the amortization payments on restructured
debt (Table 5).
5.

Bound tests highlight that the public debt

trajectory is vulnerable to standards shocks. Since
about 85 percent of total public debt was
denominated in foreign currency in 2010, the debt
ratio is particularly sensitive to the depreciation
shock—with a 30 percent depreciation, total debt
would climb to about 111 percent of GDP and then
follow a similar trajectory to that of the baseline. The
debt ratio is also highly sensitive to shocks in growth
and the primary balance. Further, a 17 percent of GDP
shock to contingent liabilities (Box 1) would cause a
proportional increase in debt levels, while financing
needs would expand by some 1.5 percentage point of
GDP over the medium-term.

1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - (1+g  - g + (1+r]/(1+g++g )) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate;  = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;  = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and  = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as (1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

ANNEX II. BELIZE: BANK—FUND COLLABORATION
UNDER THE JMAP AND RELATIONS WITH THE BANK
A. Bank-Fund Collaboration under the JMAP
1. The teams of the Fund and the World
Bank met on November 3, 2010 and
February 4, 2011 to coordinate the work
on Belize for the next 12 months. This
coordination meeting occurred in the
context of the 2011 Article IV consultation
and the preparation of a new four-year
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)
presented to the Board (World Bank) on
September 8, 2011.
2. The overall size of the envelope during
the new CPS period is likely to be
around US$20–28 million. The Interim
Strategy (March 2009–March 2011) reestablished the Bank as a development
partner in Belize through Analytical and
Advisory Activities (AAA) and modest
investment lending. Such lending includes
a US$15 million municipal development
loan, approved by the Board on September
16, 2010. The focus of the CPS is to
support the Government’s efforts to adopt
a sustainable natural resource based
economic model while enhancing the
country’s resilience to climate change and
natural hazards.
3. The teams agreed that Belize’s main
macroeconomic challenges are to
enhance the economy’s resilience to
shocks and strengthen growth and
social prospects. In particular, the teams
discussed the need to enhance banking
system stability and debt sustainability,
and to strengthen the policy framework,
while reinforcing the implementation
capacity of the Belizean authorities.

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

4. The work of the teams will be organized
along the following lines:


Banking system stability: The Fund is
providing TA (LEG and MCM) in the areas
of forensic auditing and bank resolution
framework.



Governance and budget framework: The
Bank is providing assistance on a project
aimed at developing and sustaining
institutional capacity in the areas of
external audit and public procurement,
with focus on the Audit Department and
the Contractor-General’s Office.



Social protection: The Bank will assist in
the design of a conditional cash transfer
program that would target urban and rural
vulnerable groups and give cash in return
for the beneficiaries engaging in activities
such as immunization, school attendance,
and health and family education.



Infrastructure. The Bank will, through the
Municipal Development Project, improve
access to basic municipal infrastructure
and enhance municipal management in
selected town and city councils of Belize.



National accounts. The Fund will continue
to provide TA on the launching of a
revised Consumer Price Index (CPI). While
the Statistical Institute of Belize has, in
collaboration with CARTAC, developed a
new basket of items, pending tasks relate
to the collection of price data and the
compilation of the CPI on a monthly basis.

B. Economic and Sector Work
1.
Projects approved and implemented
from 2007–10 were all consistent with CDB’s
strategy for Belize (2007–09). Total loan
approvals during the period 2007–10
amounted to one hundred and three point
five million United States dollars (US$103.5
million), while approvals of grants amounted
to US$3.5 million, including US$2.8 million
under the Basic Needs Trust Fund (BNTF) V
and VI Projects. Generally, CDB’s strategy was
successful with respect to the attainment of
the immediate objectives. As part of the
strategy, CDB supported Belize’s adjustment
efforts through a Policy Based Loan (PBL). The
loan of US$25 million was instrumental in the
success that Belize had with its adjustment
efforts. The first disbursement of the PBL was
made in 2007, while the second disbursement
was made during the first quarter of 2009.
Further, parallel to the PBL, Technical
assistance (TA) was extended to Belize under
three projects namely: the Modernisation of
Customs and Excise Department Project;
Institutional Framework for Conducting
Macroeconomic Management; and
Modernisation and Revision of Financial
Regulations. The latter two were small grants
while assistance under the first project (which
is still ongoing) was through a loan.
2.
To support the environment for
growth, in 2007 CDB approved a loan of
US$12.6 million to Belize for the upgrading of
the 33.4 kilometres Placencia Road, including
the reconstruction of some sections. The
Placencia Peninsula is an important and
growing area for tourism activity. The project
was successfully completed in 2010 under
budget. Further, in 2008, CDB approved a loan
of US$8.8 million to Belize for the
reconstruction of the Kendall (Sittee River)

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

and Mullins River bridges, which were
destroyed by floods generated from the
passage of tropical storm Arthur. The
reconstruction of these economically
important bridges started in 2010 and is
ongoing. In recognition of the importance of
infrastructure to the economic development
of Belize, a fourth road loan of US$24.7
million was approved in 2010 for a bypass
road through the reconstruction of Loma Luz
Boulevard and Joseph Andrews Drive, and for
connecting these two existing streets with a
new road and bridge crossing the Macal River.
The project is expected to contribute to
sustaining and increasing economic activity in
and through the area which is important for
tourism, the transportation of crude oil and
for trade with Guatemala.
3.
In 2010, CDB approved a loan of
US$1.6 million to conduct a feasibility study
for the expansion of water and sewerage
facilities on Ambergris Caye. Ambergris Caye
is an important area of concentrated tourism
activity for Belize. The improvement of the
water and sewerage system is thought to be
important to sustain and boost tourism
activity in the area. The objective of this
intervention was the production of a
feasibility study and phased capital works
investment programme for Ambergris Caye to
guide Belize Water Services Limited (BWSL).
4.
To support private sector
development, in 2009 CDB approved a line of
credit of US$10 million to the Government of
Belize (GOBZ), for the financing of projects in
the sectors of agriculture, industry, housing
and education. The funds are being managed
by Development Finance Corporation (DFC)
on an agency basis. CDB also provided a TA

BELIZE

Grant for institutional strengthening of DFC
and the institution has started implementing
recommendations from the Consultant’s
report.
5.
With respect to critical social sector
investments, approximately US$3.3 million
was approved by CDB in 2010, for GOBZ to
establish a potable water supply system in
Belize River Valley, to serve nine villages, by
installation of pipeline, storage tanks, pumps
and boreholes and connect the system to
BWSL mains. The project is expected to
contribute to a reduction of risks to food and
water-borne diseases and, in general, will
contribute to the reduction in poverty and an
improvement in the general quality of life of
residents.
6.
Additionally, through a US$15 million
loan, approved in 2010, CDB will make
resources available to the Belize Social
Investment Fund (BSIF) to fund small subprojects in poor under-served communities.
The sub-projects, to be selected on a
demand-driven basis, will be in the following
areas: water and sanitation; education; health;
economic infrastructure; social infrastructure;
and organization strengthening. The project is
expected to help improve living conditions
and enhance social capital in poor
communities in Belize. Interventions under
BSIF are an integral component of Belize’s
poverty reduction strategy and action plan.
CDB’s funds will also allow for the
development of a comprehensive resultsbased monitoring and evaluation system. This
is the second loan approved by CDB to fund
projects through BSIF, which was established
by legislation to appraise, finance and
supervise sub-projects in poor communities
throughout Belize. The first loan was

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

approved in 2003 and amounted to USD7.07
mn.
7.
With respect to human resource
development, CDB approved grant funding of
US$260,000 in 2010 for the payment of
consultancy services to assist GOBZ with the
formulation of a policy and strategic
framework for the education sector. This
involves the development of a comprehensive
education sector strategy, including a school
location plan. The assignment will also assist
GOBZ with the development of a proposal for
a comprehensive investment programme for
CDB's consideration.
8.
CDB has in place a new strategy for
the period 2011 to 2015. Given the need to
enhance growth as an anchor for poverty
reduction, it is proposed that the CDB assists
Belize to strengthen the environment and the
institutional framework for sustainable
growth. Hence, the proposed interventions
under the strategy are designed to contribute
to: the maintenance of a stable
macroeconomic environment; improving
public financial management; and enhancing
environment for output growth. Further,
recognizing that growth by itself may not be
sufficient to reduce poverty, it is proposed
that the CDB assists Belize to close the
growth-poverty gap by improving the
opportunities for persons to escape poverty,
increase inclusivity and reduce vulnerability.
Among the specific interventions, CDB
proposes: PBLs amounting to US$50 million
to encourage Belize to maintain a stable
macroeconomic environment and to support
policy developments in the areas of
improving public sector financial
management; managing for results and
critical human resource capacity building;
investments to improve road, water and

focus on the financial sector; investments to

education; and other social interventions
targeted at poor and vulnerable groups. The
overall proposed lending programme
amounts to a total value of US$172.8 million.

ANNEX V. STATISTICAL ISSUES
A. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data are broadly adequate for
surveillance. In general, the quality, coverage,
and timeliness of statistics permit an adequate
monitoring of economic developments.
However, the multi-sector statistics report of
July 2007 listed shortcomings in national
accounts, prices, external trade, government
finance, and labor statistics. Data concerning
the balance sheet of the DFC also requires
improving.
Real sector: Priorities for the period ahead
include establishing a user advisory
committee, updating the SNAPC-Belize
application to account for changes in the
structure of the economy, modifying the
concept of government industrial activity in
line with the 1993 SNA, rebasing the national
accounts to 2006, including electricity imports
in the merchandise trade statistics, conducting
a survey of activity in the commercial free
zone, disaggregating the imports of the export
processing zone, undertaking an inventory of
data sources, updating the register of
establishments, annotating all GDP tables to
distinguish the various revision stages, and
collecting data on informal activity. The
statistical office (SIB) is assessing the reliability
of the establishment survey conducted for
2006, given the low response rate--conducting
a new survey for reference years 2006–08 is an
alternative option, but would result in delays
on the current time frame; other options
include using general sales tax (GST) and
income taxpayers’ data to validate cost
coefficient assumptions.

Prices and labor statistics: The CPI is
calculated for February, May, August, and
November, and released to the public with a
lag of about three months. With the assistance
of the Fund, the basket of goods and services
has been updated. The SIB is compiling a
monthly CPI for food and fuels that will be
tentatively released in the fourth quarter 2011
with data from December 2010. Labor market
statistics are scarce and available at irregular
intervals.
Fiscal accounts: Priorities for the period ahead
include preparing a comprehensive list of
institutions that comprise the central
government, general government, and the
public sector; evaluating each statutory body
to determine its proper sectorization;
compiling GFS for the social security fund;
including the social security fund and the extra
budgetary units in the coverage of debt data;
treating all government transactions in line
with the guidelines of the GFSM 2001,
ensuring that annual financial statements for
budgetary central government are audited in a
timely manner; disseminating the statistics for
central government aggregates and debt in
accordance with the GDDS recommendations;
and disseminating the available monthly data
on budgetary central government revenue,
expenditure and financing.
Balance of payments: There is a need to
improve and expand the compilation and
dissemination of external sector statistics. The
authorities are refining the process for
collecting relevant data that is enabling regular
quarterly presentation. International

Priorities ahead include recording the financial
support provided by the government to DFC in
recent years; and renewing efforts to collect

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
October 31, 2011

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with Belize
On October 21, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Belize.1
Background
Belize has weathered the financial crisis relatively well when compared with Caribbean
Community peers. Output expanded by 2.7 percent in 2010 owing largely to activity in the
electricity and wholesale and retail trade. Twelve-month inflation was nil in 2010, reflecting
primarily continued weakness in domestic demand, and picked up slightly in the quarter ending
in May driven by higher food and fuel prices. The external position strengthened, as a narrowing
in the current account deficit (from 6.1 percent of GDP in 2009 to 3 percent in 2010)
underpinned an increase in foreign reserves to 3.25 months of imports at end-2010, equivalent
to 300 percent of 2011 external financing needs. Public debt rose to 83 percent of Gross
Domestic Product (GDP).
In Fiscal Year 2010/11, the overall fiscal deficit widened by 0.3 percentage point of GDP to
1.5 percent of GDP, reflecting an increase in expenditure and weak grant disbursements. This
outturn was, however, better than envisaged in the budget. Meanwhile, bank prudential
indicators have remained weak, with high nonperforming loans (NPLs) and low provisioning.
Bank liquidity remains ample. In July, the authorities participated in their first Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP). Despite a cut in reserve requirements, bank credit growth has
slowed as fewer investment opportunities and high NPLs continue to constrain new lending.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares
a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this
summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can
be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
Improvements in social indicators have been protracted, despite the allocation of significant
resources to social protection.
The macroeconomic outlook for 2011 remains moderately positive. Output growth is projected
at 2.5 percent, reflecting a strong performance in the first quarter—supported by an expansion
in manufacturing and electricity sectors, and a modest recovery in stayover tourist arrivals.
Higher food and fuel prices are expected to push inflation slightly upward. The external current
account deficit is projected to remain at about 3 percent of GDP in the context of some
improvement in the terms of trade. The reserve coverage would remain at around 3 months of
imports by year-end.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their macroeconomic management, which
enabled Belize to weather the financial crisis relatively well. While the near-term outlook is
positive, challenges arise from the uncertain global environment, vulnerabilities in the banking
system, rising gross financing needs of the public sector, and the weak investment climate. The
recent rise in poverty is also a cause for concern. Against this backdrop, Directors encouraged
the authorities to strengthen the policy framework and advance the reform agenda.
Directors emphasized the need to further tighten the fiscal stance and rebuild macroeconomic
buffers. A gradual increase in the primary surplus would keep financing needs manageable and
place the public debt on a downward path. Directors cautioned that growing contingent liabilities
could put an additional burden on public finances, requiring close monitoring over the medium
term. Welcoming the authorities’ intention to strengthen tax administration, Directors stressed
the importance of improving overall tax collections, including a reduction in tax concessions.
They also highlighted the need to contain the growth of the wage bill, and streamline capital
spending in line with implementation capacity and grant disbursements.
Directors endorsed the authorities’ emphasis on developing social programs aimed at reducing
poverty. They underscored that these programs should be cost effective and better monitored
and targeted.
Directors agreed that safeguarding financial sector stability should be a high priority. They
welcomed the authorities’ plans to use the findings of the recent FSAP to guide their reform
agenda and strengthen the financial sector. Noting the high level of non-performing loans,
Directors stressed the importance of issuing revised loan classification and provisioning
guidelines by year-end as planned, and of closely monitoring bank’s capital adequacy. They
encouraged the authorities to follow through on recommendations to enhance the bank’s
supervisory capacity and reinforce the bank resolution and consolidated supervision

3
frameworks. Directors also called for greater autonomy of the central bank. They welcomed the
ongoing efforts to revamp the monetary policy framework.
Directors noted that the fixed exchange rate has provided an important anchor for
macroeconomic policies. Given that rising gross external financing needs over the medium-term
would increase vulnerability, they recommended building a higher level of foreign reserves as a
buffer against shocks.
Directors emphasized the need to strengthen the macroeconomic framework and the business
climate to tackle Belize’s low productivity growth. They called for timely compensation to former
owners of the nationalized entities, once the courts have reached a final verdict. Improving the
long-term conditions for growth would also require the implementation of steady programs to
enhance physical and financial infrastructure, promoting the formation of skilled labor, and
reforming the tax system. Directors stressed the importance of close collaboration between the
Fund and development partners in these areas.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of
the IMF's views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the
country (or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article
IV consultations with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional
level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with
longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of
general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
