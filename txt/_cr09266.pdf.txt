INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
REPUBLIC OF POLAND
Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2009 Consultation with the
Republic of Poland
Approved by Marek Belka and Aasim Husain
July 17, 2009
Executive Summary
Poland is weathering the global crisis better than most of its peers. Having entered the
crisis without serious internal or external imbalances, the authorities were afforded some room
to undertake counter-cyclical measures. The approval of the FCL has also helped to calm
markets.
Monetary policy should continue to maintain a loosening bias as inflation is set to remain
within its tolerance range. Gradually cutting the policy rate remains appropriate. Should an
increase in the public sector’s borrowing requirements place pressure on domestic interest
rates, the authorities should stand ready to accommodate the increase. A measured easing
should not cause the zloty to depreciate given Poland’s strengthening cyclical position relative
to partners and the credibility in the NBP’s anti-inflation credentials.
The limited increase in the 2009 fiscal deficit should remain anchored in a credible
medium-term fiscal consolidation. Allowing for a higher fiscal deficit in 2009 to partly
accommodate lower revenue as the economy slows is appropriate. But the deficit is set to
remain well above the Maastricht limit even as the economy recovers, due to the recent
structural relaxation. Hence a sustained fiscal consolidation should start in 2010, unless there
are signs that the recovery will not materialize as expected. To help anchor confidence in the
authorities’ medium-term consolidation targets, the authorities should consider revamping the
fiscal framework by introducing rolling and binding multi-annual expenditure limits.
The banking sector is well buffered, but risks remain. Vigilance and pre-emptive actions by
the KNF have been welcome and should be continued, including by conducting bottom-up
comprehensive stress tests of banks in coordination with neighboring countries to better reflect
the regional dimension of the problem. In addition, credit unions (SKOKs) should be
supervised by the KNF, their deposits be insured by the bank guarantee fund, and have direct
access to lender-of-last resort facilities.

1.
Poland’s rapid growth had
begun to lose steam even before the
global crisis hit. Following a robust and
relatively well-balanced expansion, driven
by an EU accession-related investment
boom and rapid credit and wage growth,
economic activity began to slow in the
face of gradually emerging capacity
constraints. By mid-2008, inflationary
pressures peaked and the unemployment
rate was at record lows. Still, despite a
somewhat pro-cyclical fiscal policy,
external and internal imbalances were
relatively limited going into the crisis.

Source: Polish Statistical Office.

2.
A sharp deceleration in activity is underway, reflecting spillovers from the global
crisis through real and financial channels.
•

Real sector channel. With Poland’s key export markets in recession, exports
contracted by 30 percent (year-on-year) in the first quarter of 2009. While the share of
exports in GDP of about 40 percent is relatively low compared to regional peers—
reflecting the larger size of the Polish economy—the significant compression in
exports is having a considerable direct impact on domestic activity (Figure 1).

•

Financial sector channel. As in other countries in the region, local asset markets
succumbed to sharp price declines and capital outflows led to rapid zloty depreciation
in the wake of Lehman Brothers (Figure 2). In addition, the interbank market froze in
late October 2008, reflecting increased uncertainty, and a number of banks had
difficulty obtaining foreign exchange liquidity to fund their growing foreign-currencydenominated (largely Swiss franc) mortgage portfolio.

A mission comprising Messrs. Thomsen (head), Hoffmaister, and Epstein and Mses. Chivakul and Velculescu
(all EUR), and Ms. Goretti (SPR) visited Warsaw during June 15–23. Messrs. Allen and Sierhej, from the
Warsaw Regional Office, supported the work of the mission. Poland is an Article VIII country (Informational
Annex, Appendix I). Data provision is adequate for surveillance (Informational Annex, Appendix II).

As a result, output growth has decreased sharply, albeit less so than in regional
peers. While consumption held up relatively well through the first quarter of 2009, partly
supported by tax cuts that came into effect in 2008-09, investment declined significantly, and
domestic demand slowed sharply as uncertainty about the economy emerged. Still, while
other economies in the region contracted in the last two quarters, Poland managed to
maintain slight positive growth.

A recent IMF TA mission investigating statistical discrepancies in Poland’s 2007–08 BoP accounts concluded
that these appear to be primarily concentrated in selected financial accounts. The National Bank of Poland
(NBP) is following up on several areas identified by the mission and is working on adopting a new BoP
compilation system, targeted for early 2010, which may solve many of these discrepancies.

7
5.
Against this background, markets have welcomed Poland’s FCL. The zloty
reached a four-month high against the euro immediately following Poland’s FCL
announcement, but has subsequently lost some ground, in line with developments in the
region (Figure 3). CDS spreads narrowed by about 100 basis points over this period, although
this also reflected, in part, regional trends. Shortly after the FCL was approved, the
authorities tapped the euro bond market with a spread that was 20 basis points lower than in
January. In early July, the authorities issued a $2 billion ten-year bond, their largest ever
issuance on the U.S. market. Both papers were significantly over subscribed.
6.
A sharp slowdown in credit growth is underway. While foreign bank exposure to
the Polish banking sector has remained stable since the third quarter of 2008, surveys suggest
that banks have tightened credit criteria dramatically both for corporate and individual
borrowers since the fourth quarter of 2008. Such changes in lending policies have been
influenced by uncertainties related to the economic outlook, growing industry-specific risks
(real estate and export industries), and the expected deterioration in the capital position of the
banks. Loan demand has also weakened with declining investment activity. Reflecting
growing uncertainties and the continuing difficulties faced by global banking groups, Polish
banks—mostly foreign subsidiaries—have a strong liquidity preference and have not been
willing to lend to other banks in the interbank market beyond one-week maturities.
7.
The banking system, nonetheless, has weathered the crisis well so far. Poland’s
banking system entered the crisis from a relatively strong position. Although it has
experienced a rapid credit expansion as in other countries in the CEE region, Poland’s credit
boom started later and has been shorter (Figure 4). Still, credit risk has risen with the
slowdown of the economy. NPLs started to pick up in 2009, especially in the non-financial
corporate sector (Figure 5). Lower asset returns and higher funding costs have already begun
to squeeze profitability—banking sector profits have fallen by about 50 percent in the first
quarter of 2009 from a year earlier. But the banking system remains well capitalized with a
capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of 11.7 percent at the end-April 2009, a high ratio of tier 1
capital, and record profits in 2008.

II. POLICY RESPONSE TO THE CRISIS
8.
Monetary policy has been accommodative. Inflation rose through the third quarter
of 2008, overshooting the NBP’s tolerance range of 1½ to 3½ percent. Since then, the global
commodity price boom reversed course, slower output growth set in, and wage and price
pressures receded. In this regard, the size of the exchange rate pass-through to inflation has
diminished, which has alleviated inflationary pressures from building up during the recent
zloty depreciation episode (Annex 1). The decline in inflation, together with the room
provided by euro interest rate cuts, has prompted the NBP to embark on a loosening cycle:
since November, policy rates have been lowered by 250 basis points to 3.5 percent. Besides
renewed price pressures in commodities, recent policy rate cuts have been tempered by
concerns about zloty depreciation. The reserve requirement was recently lowered by 50 basis
points to 3.0 percent.
9.
Measures have also been taken to assist bank funding and safeguard financial
stability. Specifically, to address foreign-currency funding risks and broader liquidity
shortfalls, the authorities introduced dollar, Swiss franc, and euro swaps; widened the list of
collateral that can be used at its discount window; and extended the maturity of repo
transactions (Text Table). They have also proactively addressed a potential fall in capital
buffers by stepping up the frequency of top-down stress testing and on-site inspections and
have successfully convinced most banks to retain their profits from 2008. Finally, to ease the
credit crunch, the authorities have introduced a credit-guarantee program offered by the stateowned bank BGK, albeit, so far, no bank has applied for it likely because of potential adverse
signaling effects.
10.
A fiscal stimulus enacted before the crisis came into effect as the slowdown set
in. The 2008 general government deficit exceeded the budget target by 1½ percent of GDP,
reaching almost 4 percent of GDP and prompting the EC to invoke the Excessive Deficit
Procedure against Poland.3 Revenue shortfalls due to the economic slowdown in the second
half of 2008 contributed to this outcome. But the deterioration of the fiscal stance was also
the result of a significant discretionary relaxation enacted in 2007—comprising mainly cuts
in the tax wedge, but also one-off spending increases. This provided some stimulus as the
economy slowed, with the cyclically-adjusted balance deteriorating by about 2 percentage
points. Late in 2008, in response to the crisis, the authorities proposed limited employment
subsidies and mortgage support for the unemployed; given their small size—less than
0.1 percent of GDP—these were not expected to affect the 2009 deficit.

3

The EDP for Poland was formally approved by EU finance ministers on July 8, 2009, requiring Poland to
reduce its fiscal deficit to below 3 percent of GDP by 2012.

12
III. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
11.
The economy is set to contract in 2009 and recover slowly in 2010. The central
scenario envisages a small contraction of about ¾ percent this year, primarily reflecting a
deep recession in Poland’s main European trading partners and the likelihood of a credit
crunch. Domestic demand is poised to continue to decline, as business confidence remains
weak, unemployment rises, and credit and wage growth decline. Modest growth of about
1½ percent in 2010 is predicated on improving global conditions and moderate consumption
growth, consistent with a gradual strengthening of financial conditions and a slowly
improving labor market. Risks to the central scenario, stemming from a slower-than expected
global recovery and uncertainty regarding domestic demand, are on the downside.

pressures on the zloty. Despite gross external
financing requirements of around $100 billion (25 percent of GDP) in 2009–10, financing

13
gaps are not expected to emerge under the baseline scenario. Specifically, the public sector
has already secured a large part of its rollover needs for 2009; 4 the decline in private sector
rollover rates is expected to continue, being largely demand driven (trade credit accounts for
over 80 percent of non-bank short-term debt). Moreover, declining import volumes and
favorable terms of trade developments should more than offset a projected decline in exports
and gradually narrow the current account deficit to about 3¼ percent of GDP in 2009–10.
Given these considerations and staff’s assessment that the real exchange rate is broadly
aligned with fundamentals, pressures on the zloty are not expected to emerge (Box 1).
14.
In the case of unexpected external shocks, including an intensification of
regional spillovers, the FCL would provide a considerable cushion. A worsening of the
crisis in Western Europe with an attendant delay in economic recovery could further slow
export growth and result in additional retrenchment of foreign assets from Poland. Moreover,
the risk of contagion from adverse developments in the region, not least the Baltics, can not
be excluded. In turn, reduced rollover rates by parent banks and corporates could exacerbate
downward pressures on the zloty. In this scenario, a more severe contraction of the Polish
economy would emerge and result in mounting NPLs, heightening the pressure on privatesector balance sheets. Limited public sector access to capital markets would become a
binding fiscal constraint in the presence of significant revenue shortfalls and potential bank
recapitalization needs. However, the possibility to draw on the recently approved FCL would
provide a considerable cushion to limit the economic impact of such an extreme scenario.5
15.
While sharing concerns about the downside risks, the authorities were more
sanguine on growth prospects in 2009, but somewhat less optimistic about 2010. The
authorities foresee growth of about ½ percent in 2009, supported by resilient consumption.
For 2010, their forecasts range from about ½ percent to 1½ percent, reflecting differences in
the outlook for the external sector.

4

In addition to the Eurobond and dollar placements already completed, Poland has secured a $1.25 billion loan
from the World Bank in early July; a further 1 billion euro refinancing from EIB and a new eurodenominated bond issuance are expected before end-2009. As of July 15, about two-thirds of the government’s
2009 gross financing requirements were filled.

5

The FCL would fully cover financing needs if roll over rates fell to about 80 percent. Details of the scenarios
can be found in IMF Country Report No. 09/138.

14

Box 1. Poland: Real Exchange Rate Assessment
Staff estimates do not point to significant misalignment in the real exchange rate. CGER
assessments for the latest reference period suggest that the sizable depreciation of the zloty since
August 2008 has more than offset the real appreciation that had been registered in the first half of
2008 for an overall assessment of a 10 percent undervaluation. However, nominal exchange rate
appreciation since the reference period would bring the assessment closer to equilibrium.
Specifically,




The equilibrium real exchange rate
(ERER) methodology suggests a
moderate undervaluation of around 12 percent; this estimate reflects a
strengthened equilibrium level driven
by improvements in relative
productivity and a CPI-based real
exchange rate that is now in line with
its historical average.

As regards other indicators of price and cost competitiveness, increases in ULC-based measures of

dampen wage pressures.

15
IV. THE POLICY AGENDA
A. Setting the Stage for a Credible Medium-Term Fiscal Consolidation
16.
The revised 2009 budget entails a limited increase in the fiscal deficit. Given
staff’s macroeconomic scenario, the recent state budget amendment expected to be approved
by Parliament in mid-July implies that the general government deficit will rise to about
5½ percent of GDP compared to 2½ percent planned in 2009. Underlying this outcome is a
shortfall in tax revenues of about 2¼ percent of GDP and higher expenditures of more than
2 percent of GDP, partially compensated by higher expected dividend receipts from stateowned companies of about ½ percent of GDP and across-the-board expenditure cuts
estimated at close to 1 percent of GDP. Nevertheless, as a result of the 2008 personal income
tax cuts enacted in 2007 but becoming effective in 2009, the cyclically-adjusted fiscal
balance is expected to deteriorate by about 1 percentage point in 2009—following the
2 percentage points deterioration of 2008—providing a small stimulus during the downturn.
So far, markets have reacted positively to the revised budget, and government bond auctions
have seen high bid-to-cover ratios—averaging about 3 in recent months—and yields have
remained stable despite the increase in the public sector’s borrowing requirement.
17.
Staff supports the proposed increase in the deficit limit, but believes that it
should be accompanied by measures to strengthen confidence in medium-term
consolidation targets. Fiscal policy should balance short-term cyclical considerations and
medium-term consolidation efforts. On the one hand, taking stronger pro-cyclical measures to
curb the deficit now would exacerbate the economic slowdown. On the other hand, allowing
automatic stabilizers to fully operate through a higher short-run deficit would imply the need
for a deeper fiscal adjustment in the coming years. Thus, even with the 2009 measures, staff
expects the deficit to increase to 6 percent of GDP in 2010 and remain above the Maastricht
limit in the medium term, with debt hovering close to the 60 percent-of-GDP threshold.
Against this background, staff believes that the decision to increase the deficit limit should be
supported by measures to strengthen the medium-term framework. In this regard, a revamped
fiscal framework consistent with international best practice—including binding multi-year
expenditure limits—could bolster confidence and underpin a durable consolidation (Box 2).
This will help to anchor market expectations despite higher short-run financing needs and
reassure European partners that Poland is committed to achieving its medium-term targets.
18.
The 2010 budget should set the stage for a sustained medium-term consolidation.
On the assumption that the recovery will begin next year, permanent measures amounting to
about 1 percent of GDP starting in 2010 would be needed for a three-year period, in order to

16

meet the 1 percent of GDP medium-term deficit target agreed with EU partners, albeit with a
one-year delay. This adjustment will help stabilize debt comfortably below 60 percent of
GDP. However, to prevent a strongly pro-cyclical stance, the authorities should be prepared
to delay this adjustment if the economy does not begin to recover as projected.

19.
Spending reforms will be required to achieve a durable medium-term
adjustment. Owing to the early implementation of pension reforms in the 1990s, aging costs
do not pose a significant problem to the medium-term fiscal outlook. But statutory
expenditures constitute a large proportion of the budget. Hence, reforms are needed to reduce
the deficit in the medium run, including in the area of social spending, where recent increases
have led to additional fiscal costs. Possible options include better targeting child deductions
in the personal income tax, disability contributions, and pension indexation.
20.
The authorities agree with the need to embark on a fiscal consolidation, but do
not see the need for forward-looking binding expenditure rules. They are still working on
the details for the 2010 budget but remain committed to starting an expenditure-based fiscal
adjustment then. They are also open to introducing a performance-budgeting system to
improve the effectiveness of policies. However, they do not see a need for introducing
binding expenditure ceilings in their multi-year fiscal plan, noting that these would be
difficult to implement, given their dependence on uncertain projections, and could run the
risk of being interpreted as entitlements. They believe that strict yearly deficit limits and the
existing Public Finance Act—which triggers fiscal actions once the debt reaches certain
thresholds—are sufficient to ensure the credibility of fiscal policy.

17

Box 2. Poland’s Fiscal Framework: Proposed Changes and Options for
Strengthening
The authorities have recently proposed to update their budgetary framework, which focuses on
annual budgets, by introducing a multi-year financial plan for the state (MFPS). The plan would
include a rolling four-year horizon—current and three years ahead—detailing a nonbinding
direction for fiscal policy. The one-year ahead budget deficit would, nonetheless, be expected to be
adopted the following year baring exceptional circumstances. In addition, the new framework
would introduce medium-term plans at other levels of government and elements of performancebased budgeting, while maintaining Poland’s national debt ceilings.1
The proposal introduces elements of a medium-term fiscal framework but, by focusing on nominal
deficits, the pro-cyclical bias in fiscal policy remains. Moreover, the lack of binding commitments
beyond a year limits its role as an effective tool to prioritize and rationalize public expenditure and
articulate a high-quality medium-term consolidation.
While international best practice varies, establishing binding multi-year expenditure ceilings would
strengthen Poland’s fiscal framework and would be facilitated by:
•

•

•
•

Establishing rolling forward estimates derived from the path of fiscal deficits consistent
with the authorities’ medium-term targets and fiscal sustainability, coupled with revenue
projections in line with the economic outlook.
Developing of an effective top-down/bottom-up reconciliation process as part of the annual
budget preparation. This would compare the expenditure and revenue trends indicated by
the forward estimates with the government’s targets, in order to identify any necessary
changes to expenditure, revenue, or fiscal policy.
Enhancing the expenditure prioritization process, including systematic expenditure review.
Continuing to develop performance budgeting, which will support forward estimates and
the expenditure prioritization process.

Greater transparency and accountability can help to further safeguard fiscal discipline. In this
regard, strengthening of fiscal institutions could enhance the objective analysis of current fiscal
developments, long-term fiscal sustainability, and costing of budgetary initiatives. In addition to
safeguarding the independence of projections, this could also provide a broader context for
normative assessments of fiscal policy.

_________________
1

The constitution establishes a cap of 60 percent of GDP for public debt. Currently, the government must
take increasingly tough corrective actions if debt breaches triggers established at 50 percent of GDP and
55 percent of GDP.

18
B. Cautiously Easing Monetary Policy
21.
Further policy rates cuts are warranted. With inflation set to remain within the
tolerance range for the foreseeable future, staff considers that the loosening bias in monetary
policy should continue. Moreover, should increases in the government’s borrowing
requirements—associated with the operation of automatic stabilizers—exert pressure on
domestic interest rates, monetary policy should stand ready to accommodate fiscal policy.
22.
A measured relaxation was not expected to weaken the zloty. Staff noted that the
scope for interest rate cuts and their pace will be tempered by external financing constraints.
However, while still volatile, the zloty appears to have stabilized, and lower interest rates are
not expected to weaken it further. Pressures on the exchange rate are likely to continue to
moderate as Poland’s cyclical position and monetary policy stance relative to those of the
euro area and the US strengthen. Moreover, the weakening of the zloty that has already taken
place has served to align the real exchange rate with fundamentals, and the current account is
set to continue to improve. Still, monetary relaxation should proceed with caution.
23.
On balance, the authorities thought that a further small interest rate cut now
followed by a pause would be appropriate.6 While cautioning that world oil price increases
may result in rising inflation, they believe that continued weak demand will contain
inflationary pressures. The authorities considered that the interest rate cuts so far, together
with the reduction in reserve requirements, will support the economy’s return to potential
growth. While further interest rate cuts cannot be ruled out, these would depend on the
evolution of inflation and the economy, including financial markets and the zloty.
C. Safeguarding Financial Sector Health
24.
While the banking system is well buffered, risks remain. The authorities’ topdown stress tests suggest that the system is resilient to adverse scenarios, and only a
prolonged recession would lead to general recapitalization needs (Box 3). Moreover, post
Lehman Brothers, parent banks have maintained stable exposures to their Polish subsidiaries
and continued to provide them with funding and capital injections, when needed.
•

6

Credit quality represents the most immediate risk to the Polish banking system.
NPL ratios have increased from historic lows to reach 5.7 percent at end-April 2009
and are expected to rise further with slower economic activity and higher
unemployment. While the corporate sector is not highly leveraged, and strong profits
through the third quarter of 2008 (Figures 6 and 7) have kept it liquid, pressures are
rising as profits are falling and funding is becoming more expensive. Net corporate
profits over the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 were about half
the average quarterly profits in the first three quarters of 2008, partly due to financial
losses from zloty depreciation, with more vulnerable sectors such as manufacturing
The MPC cut interest rates by 25 basis points on June 24, immediately after the mission.

19

Box 3. Poland’s Financial Sector: Stress Tests
Staff’s credit risk stress tests suggest that Poland’s systemically important banks are
resilient to a sharp increase of non-performing loans. Specifically, only one of the eight
systematically important banks would see its capital adequacy ratio fall below the regulatory
minimum if the NPLs were to more than triple from their end-2008 level to 15 percent.
Assuming, however, that 2008 profits are retained, the CAR should remain above the
minimum threshold for all banks. These results are based on stress tests of eight systemically
important banks—accounting for 54 percent of total banking sector assets—using balance
sheets for which end-2008 data are available from Bankscope.
The NBP’s top-down stress tests show that the banking system is robust to adverse
scenarios. The most important risk identified by these tests are credit risks associated with a
slowing economy and rising unemployment. In an adverse scenario where GDP contracts in
two consecutive years, losses are expected to be about 3 percent of total assets, more than
twice the losses experienced during the 2001–03 slowdown. In this case, recapitalization
needs to keep the CAR at 8 percent would amount to 0.3 percent of GDP over 2009–10.

These tests are based on a consistent set of macro assumptions and panel estimation of
loan loss reserve. The NBP derives its macro scenarios from a medium scale structural
macroeconometric model. These scenarios are translated into aggregate loss provisioning by a
bank-level panel model. Interest rate levels follow a Taylor’s rule while movements in the
exchange rates are not captured in the main panel estimation model. The tests also assume
constant assets and exogenously imposed operating profits of the banks. The macro stress
tests are complemented by two simulations for households’ ability to service debt, employing
micro-level data from household budget surveys and credit registry. Due to limited data
availability, the NBP does not have a model specifically for corporate sector default.

20
exports and construction experiencing large earnings declines. The household sector
has been relatively healthy so far, and the portfolios of foreign-currency denominated
mortgages have continued to perform well, as lower foreign interest rates have been
compensating for the depreciating zloty. In addition, lending standards for foreigncurrency denominated loans have been tightened since 2006, as recommended by
supervisors. The main risk to the sector remains rising unemployment, should the
recession last longer than expected, and a reversal of monetary policy easing abroad.
•

Direct foreign exchange risks could emerge. Banks maintain their ability to hedge
against foreign exchange (FX) and interest rate risk through their parents in light of
illiquid financial markets. While direct FX risks are now under control, banks are
finding it more expensive to close their open positions. The NBP’s sensitivity analysis
shows that only in an extreme case in which banks are unable to rollover the entire
value of maturing hedging transactions, eight of them (representing 15 percent of
system assets) would not meet the regulatory capital requirement.

•

Risks related to exposures to structured credit products and derivatives appear
contained. Polish banks have negligible direct exposure to U.S. subprime mortgage
assets. But they have been affected by corporate losses on derivative contracts that
were made as the zloty was appreciating, and subsequently back-fired once the
currency trends reversed. These risks, however, are now diminishing. Exposures have
been declining to about 0.4 percent of GDP in April, compared to 1.2 percent of GDP
in January 2009, due to favorable exchange rate movements, but also to individual
negotiations and restructuring of claims with banks. Of the remaining exposure, about
80-85 percent is naturally hedged, as it was incurred by the tradable sector. Under
existing contracts, around 80 percent of options should be settled by end-2009.

•

Funding risks could arise in some banks, but measures taken by the NBP have
helped. The overall loan-to-deposit ratio stands at around 110 percent. At the
aggregate level, total exposure to foreign funding has remained stable since
September 2008. Funding risks, however, are not evenly distributed among banks and
are particularly acute for a number of small- and medium-sized banks, which had
relied on market funding. To close their funding gaps when interbank market access
remains restricted, these banks resort to parent banks’ assistance and aggressive offers
on the deposit market. The NBP measures have mitigated some pressures, but a
number of these banks had to stop expanding their balance sheets, especially in new
foreign currency mortgage lending. Costly new deposits and foreign funding—due to
higher risk premiums following rating agency’s downgrades of Polish and their parent
banks—will limit profitability and the banks’ capacity to internally accumulate
capital.

21
25.
The revival of credit activity to support growth in 2010, including through
restoring the normal functioning of the interbank market, is likely to depend mainly on
external factors. Underlying credit demand exists: mortgage loans stand at only 15 percent
of GDP, and half of firms do not rely on bank credit. But the supply of credit is likely to
remain constrained, given the above risks and the reliance of many banks on funding and
liquidity from international parent banks which are still in the process of deleveraging.
Measures to unfreeze the interbank market have not yet succeeded in restoring transactions at
longer maturities. To a large degree, the reluctance of foreign-owned subsidiaries to lend to
each other in the Polish interbank market mirrors the reluctance of their parents to do so. This
suggest that normalizing financial markets in Poland will, to a large degree, hinge on
normalizing such markets globally.
26.
Vigilance and pre-emptive measures by the authorities remain key in the current
situation. In this regard, encouraging banks to boost capital buffers, mainly by retaining the
record-high 2008 profits, was appropriate. Moreover, postponing the recommendation to
tighten lending standards for foreign-currency denominated loans has rightly avoided a procyclical action. In staff’s view, as a complement to the top-down stress test performed by the
NBP, a case can be made for the KNF’s conducting systematic, bottom-up, bank-by-bank
stress tests based on a consistent set of macroeconomic projections. This would help identify
emerging weaknesses and potential bank recapitalization needs, as well as alleviate
uncertainty in the financial system. A national effort in this regard would complement the
EU’s approach of stress-testing major banking groups, and such an exercise could be
coordinated with neighboring countries.
27.
Staff supports the KNF’s effort to strengthen supervision of credit unions
(SKOKs). While staff is not aware of problems in these institutions, it is a concern that they
have no direct access to a lender of last resort facility, are not supervised by the KNF, and are
not covered under the bank guarantee fund, but only by their internal insurance fund. While
SKOKs are small (as a share of total banking assets) and, on their own, are unlikely to pose a
systemic risk, any problems could spillover to the rest of the system.
28.
There has been progress in improving the framework for financial sector
surveillance and crisis management. The Financial Stability Committee was formalized by
law, and the Ministry of Finance introduced a law on state treasury assistance to financial
institutions and a law on recapitalization of distressed financial institutions. The former—
entered into force in March 2009—allows the State Treasury to assist financial institutions
with guarantees, loans, and sale of securities. The latter—still under discussion in
Parliament—allows the Minister of Finance to issue a guarantee to a financial institution to
increase regulatory capital or increase its capital by taking up shares, bonds or bank
securities. Moreover, the governing structure of the Bank Guarantee Fund (BGF) has been
modified to include the KNF—beside the NBP and the MOF—in its governing council. The
BGF is no longer partly funded by the NBP, although it retains the ability to borrow through

22
the NBP and the state budget. In addition, the time period for deposit insurance payments in
case of bank suspension—currently at around 3 months—is expected to be lowered to
comply with the new EU Directive by end-2010.
29.
With the prospect of reduced intermediation through banks, it should be a
matter of priority to foster the development of domestic capital markets. The equity
market has been growing in terms of market capitalization with an increasing number of
IPOs, aided by active measures such as the introduction of new corporate governance rules
and a new trading platform for start-ups and new companies. The privatization of the Warsaw
Stock Exchange—expected in 2009—will bring further international linkages to Polish
capital markets. The non-government bond market, however, remains small and illiquid.
Consistent with the 2006 FSAP Update recommendations, measures to facilitate corporate
debt issuance, such as enhancements in market infrastructure in the areas of custody and
depository services and streamlining issuance procedures, could support the development of
the market. Moreover, to diversify the funding of banks’ mortgage credit portfolio, universal
banks should be allowed to issue covered bonds to mobilize longer-term funds and reduce
maturity mismatch.
30.
The authorities agreed with the thrust of staff’s recommendations. They continue
to monitor the situation in individual banks closely and to analyze system-wide issues, such
as exposures to foreign-exchange options. While they are, in principle, open to undertaking a
bottom-up stress-testing exercise, they are inclined to resist doing so within broader regional
context unless carried out under the EU umbrella. In addition, the authorities welcomed the
prospect of an FSAP update in 2010.
D. Bolstering Growth and Adopting the Euro
31.
Removing labor-supply bottlenecks will be vital to boosting long-term growth.
Before the crisis hit, resource constraints were emerging particularly in the labor market,
reflecting Poland’s low labor participation rate, especially among those above 50 years old.
To address this bottleneck, the authorities reformed the early-retirement provisions by
substantially tightening the eligibility requirements slashing the number of eligible citizens
from over one million to about 250,000 in 2008. Staff strongly welcomed this and suggested
that future priorities should include gradually increasing the effective retirement age and
equalizing the statutory retirement age of men and women (Annex 2). Moreover, special
pension schemes should also be reformed and merged into the general pension scheme.
Besides helping to promote fiscal sustainability, labor-market reforms would complement
continued efforts to improve the regulatory interface with business and reinvigorate
privatization plans to enhance the economy’s flexibility and bolster its long-run potential.

A more flexible economy would allow Poland to adopt the euro successfully in
the medium term. On balance, staff felt that euro adoption remains beneficial for Poland.
But the increased uncertainty in global markets and the current cyclical conditions have tilted
the short-term balance in favor maintaining monetary policy independence and a flexible
exchange rate for now. Delaying euro adoption would also allow the economy to adjust to
possible changes in long-run financing prospects prompted by global deleveraging. Besides
allowing for addition time to achieve the needed fiscal consolidation, it would provide time
for exchange rate volatility to subside and for political support to be marshaled to ensure
smooth passage of the constitutional amendment needed for euro adoption.
33.
The authorities are determined to adopt the euro as soon as possible and
continue implementing structural reforms. They recognized, however, that adopting the
euro in 2012 may not be feasible and a short delay would be necessary. Still, the authorities
considered that an early adoption target would help galvanize support for fiscal consolidation
and structural reforms. In this connection, they will continue to give priority to reforms that
would alleviate supply constraints, particularly in the labor market. This would be in line
with the objectives established in their Solidarity 50+ and Poland 2030 plans.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
Poland is weathering the global crisis relatively well. The economy has continued
to expand even as all neighboring countries and most CEE peers have been mired in deep
recession. While the global financial crisis engulfed Poland’s financial markets last fall—
paralyzing the interbank market, causing a credit crunch, and weakening the zloty—a
significant measure of stability has returned since then. This has been helped, in part, by
Poland’s availing itself of the FCL on a precautionary basis. As a result, the zloty has
stabilized, CDS spread have declined, and the government—which throughout the crisis has
preserved access to international capital markets—has seen a notable decline in interest rates
on its zloty bonds.
35.
This strong performance owes much to relatively sound economic policies.
Entering the crisis without serious internal or external imbalances, policy makers were
afforded some room to undertake counter-cyclical measures. Their responses have generally
been timely, well-focused, and properly measured. Given the authorities’ continued
commitment to adjust policies appropriately as circumstances evolve, staff expects Poland to
experience only a mild recession before a recovery slowly gets underway.
36.
Monetary policy should continue to maintain a loosening bias. The lowering of
policy rates since last November has been appropriate, and staff believes that further
relaxation is justified by the outlook for inflation, not least by the notable easing of pressures
on wages. Should the increase in the government’s financing need result in an increase in
interest rates—which staff considers unlikely—then the MPC should stand ready to

27
accommodate. In recommending a continued loosening bias, staff is taking into account that
the MPC has built considerable confidence in its anti-inflation credentials over the past
decade.
37.
Staff does not expect a measured, further monetary easing to cause the zloty to
depreciate. Poland’s cyclical position and its monetary stance relative to the euro area and
the US appear to be strengthening, suggesting that the zloty could, if anything, be subject to
upward pressure. In any case, the weakening of the zloty since the onset of the crisis has
facilitated adjustment, and some further depreciation—in the event of unforeseen shocks—
should not pose a problem. While a flare-up in what is still an unsettled regional situation
could potentially cause negative spill-over to Poland, recent experience suggests that the
impact will be transitory. In this regard, the potential access to the FCL remains an important
safeguard.
38.
The challenges facing fiscal policy are more complex. On the one hand, the
significant structural relaxation that has taken place recently—in part reflecting important
reforms enacted before the onset of the crisis—means that the deficit is set to remain well
above the Maastricht target even as the economy recovers. On the other hand, taking drastic
corrective actions now would impart an unwelcome pro-cyclical impulse in the midst of the
global crisis, risking to turn a mild recession into a more serious one. In staff’s view, the
authorities’ recent decision to increase the deficit limit for 2009 to partly accommodate the
inevitable revenue shortfall as the economy slows is appropriate and should unsettle neither
Poland’s European partners nor markets, which indeed appear already to have discounted it.
A sustained fiscal consolidation should start in 2010, unless there are signs that the recovery
will not materialize as expected. To help anchor confidence in the authorities’ medium-term
consolidation targets, the authorities should consider revamping the fiscal framework by
introducing rolling and binding three-year expenditure limits.
39.
Aging costs do not pose a significant problem. Too often overlooked, Poland’s
early implementation of comprehensive pension reforms means that the issue of an aging
population weights much less on the medium-term fiscal outlook than in many other
countries. This is another example of how good economic policies in the past are now
affording policy makers room for maneuver.
40.
Even as the financial sector has been well buffered, continued vigilance is
warranted. Rising NPLs and funding cost are squeezing profits and capital adequacy ratios,
but staff takes note of top-down stress tests suggesting that only very severe shocks would
pose systemic risks. In this regard, vigilance and pre-emptive actions on part of the regulatory
authorities—such as the welcome decision to encourage banks to retain the record-high 2008
profits—have helped to ensure that the banking system is well-buffered.

28
41.
Staff feels that the KNF should go further, by conducting bottom-up,
comprehensive stress tests of banks. Such an exercise should be coordinated with
neighboring countries to take into account the regional dimension of the problem. This could
help alleviate uncertainty and thereby facilitate the unfreezing of the interbank market,
although staff acknowledges that the current reluctance to engage in interbank transactions
mainly reflects concerns about the financial health of foreign parents rather than of their
Polish subsidiaries. Nevertheless, credit supply is set to become increasingly constrained by
scarcity of capital, posing a risk to the recovery once confidence and the demand for credit
begin to return. A more comprehensive forward-looking analysis of capital adequacy would
help the KNF ensure that banks move pre-emptively to shore-up capital.
42.
Looking to the medium term, the key challenge facing policy makers is to boost
Poland’s exceptionally low labor participation rate. The evidence that growth had begun
to falter even before the onset of the global crisis because of emerging labor shortages should
serve as an important reminder of the urgency of this task. In this regard, last year’s radical
reforms of the system for early retirement are very encouraging. However, much more needs
to be done, including by increasing and equalizing retirement rates and merging special
pension schemes with the general scheme.
43.

It is recommended that the Article IV consultation remain on a 12-month cycle.

Text Table. Measures to Safeguard Financial Sector Stability

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
ε = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and α = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

Annex 1

Poland: Inflation and the Exchange Rate Pass-Through
The recent depreciation of the zloty has brought
to the fore concerns about its potential
inflationary effects. Prior to the intensification of
the adverse spillovers from the global crisis, the
argument had been made in reverse: inflation had
been contained through the moderating effect of the
convergence-driven nominal exchange rate
appreciation.
But since EU accession, the exchange rate has
appeared to play a diminishing role in influencing
headline inflation. Specifically, Poland’s nominal
effective exchange rate (NEER) had appreciated in the
period 2006–08 while headline inflation was steadily
rising—from about 1 percent in early-2006 to around
4.5 percent by mid-2008. Moreover, as the NEER had
depreciated in recent months, inflation fell.

Staff’s model also includes import and producer prices and assumes that commodity-price shocks,

Annex 2

Boosting Labor Market Participation While Promoting Fiscal Sustainability
Poland's labor market developments compare unfavorably to those in the region largely
reflecting adverse supply incentives. Privileged schemes have promoted early withdrawal from the
labor market. These problems are deeply rooted in the past, when early retirement and disability
pensions were used to disguise open unemployment. While reforms made in the mid-90s curtailed
regulations on disability, early exit from the labor force has remained an issue.

Recent reforms have helped rebalance work incentives. Specifically,
•

Tightening early retirement eligibility. Early retirement for certain sectors (e.g., teachers) was
abolished in late-2008, and job-specific early retirement rights were cut leaving 250,000
people covered compared to a million people before. Only those who worked in harmful
conditions before 1999 remain eligible. Age-specific privileges were also eliminated, with the
ending of women's rights to retire at 55 after 30 years of work (including education and
maternity). The reforms are crucial for longer-term fiscal sustainability, but do not yield
immediate budgetary gains.

•

Cutting the tax wedge. Social security contributions were cut by lowering the disability
contribution from 13 to 6 percent of gross wage.

But further reforms are needed and can support fiscal sustainability. Specifically, farmer’s
pensions and special retirement schemes should be merged and aligned with general pension system.
In addition, the retirement age for men (65 years of age) and women (60 years of age) should be
equalized at the higher level and the statutory retirement age gradually increased. In the medium term,
these reforms and those recently implemented will contribute to broaden the tax base and bolster tax
collections. In the short term, the fiscal costs of these reforms must be accommodated within the
budgetary envelope and the authorities’ medium-term fiscal objectives.

Projected Obligations to Fund: None
Exchange Rate Arrangement:

Poland accepted the obligation of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 on June 1, 1995. The
exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions.
Since April 12, 2000, the zloty has floated freely.
Prior to that, the zloty had been pegged to a currency composite made up of the U.S. dollar,
deutsche mark, pound sterling, French franc, and the Swiss franc. As of January 1, 1999, the
currency composite was changed to a basket comprised of 55 percent Euro and 45 percent
U.S. dollar. From January 1, 1995, the zloty was redenominated, with new Zl 1 equaling old
Zl 10,000. The central parity of the zloty was adjusted under a crawling peg policy at a preannounced monthly rate. On May 16, 1995, a band of ±7 percent was introduced around the
central rate. Following the implementation of the new system, the zloty initially appreciated
by about 5 percent above the central rate. In September 1995, the exchange rate was allowed
to appreciate a further 1 percent within the band. In December 1995, the central parity was
raised by 6 percent, and at the same time the authorities allowed the actual exchange rate to

3
appreciate by 22 percentage points. On January 8, 1996 the monthly rate of crawl was
reduced to one percent. On February 26, 1998, with the zloty pushing towards its upper limit,
the newly-formed Monetary Policy Council (RPP) widened the fluctuation band from
±7 percent to ±10 percent. At the same time, the rate of crawl was reduced from one percent
to 0.8 percent per month. On July 17, 1998, the crawling peg’s monthly rate of depreciation
was cut from 0.8 percent to 0.65 percent. On September 9, 1998, the monthly rate of
depreciation was reduced further to 0.50 percent. On October 29, 1998, the zlotys trading
band was widened to 12.5 percent. On March 25, 1999, the zloty’s trading band was widened
to ±15 percent, and the rate of crawl was lowered to 0.3 percent per month. On
December 31, 1999, the official rate was PLN 4.08 per US$1. On April 12, 2000, the
crawling band regime was abolished and the zloty has since floated freely.
Poland maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions, except for the exchange restrictions imposed
by Poland solely for the preservation of national or international security that have been
notified to the Fund pursuant to Executive Board Decision No. 144–(52/51). Those exchange
restrictions are contained in the following legal instruments:
•

Council Regulation (EC) No. 2488/2000 of November 14, 2000, as amended
(freezing of funds and economic resources of former Yugoslav President Slobodan

VIII.

Article IV Consultation

The last Article IV consultation was concluded on April 16, 2008. In concluding the
consultation, Directors noted Poland’s strong and well-balanced economic growth, but at the
same time noted that resource constraints were beginning to emerge, particularly in the labor
market. They welcomed the authorities’ intention to pursue reforms to enhance work
incentives. On fiscal policy, Directors noted the need for medium-term consolidation and
stressed importance of strengthening Poland’s medium-term budgetary framework. They
called on the authorities to ensure that there were no disruptions in the timeliness and
effectiveness of financial supervision. Directors found that the authorities’ commitment to
macroeconomic stability, reinvigoration of structural reforms, and the adoption of the euro
augured well for Poland’s prospects of taking full advantage of its EU membership.

Appendix II. POLAND: Statistical Issues
1.
Poland has a comprehensive macroeconomic database that has been improving in
recent years and is adequate for surveillance. The authorities publish a full range of economic
and financial statistics, and cooperate fully in providing data to the Fund. Data on the core
indicators are available on a timely basis (see the attached Table of Common Indicators
Required for Surveillance). Consistent with its commitment to provide a comprehensive set
of high quality data, in an open manner, the country subscribes to the IMF’s Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and its metadata are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination
Standards Bulletin Board.
Real sector statistics
2.
The Central Statistical Office (GUS) compiles a wide range of real sector statistics,
most of which are published promptly in the monthly Statistical Bulletin. The main problems
for users include (i) the short span of comparable data series, reflecting the upheavals
associated with transition to a market economy; (ii) inconsistencies between annual and
higher frequency data, reflecting differences in weights and in coverage; and (iii) lack of easy
electronic retrieval of these data.
3.
The national accounts follow the concepts and definitions of the European System of
Accounts 1995 (ESA 95), which is based on the System of National Accounts 1993 (SNA
1993). The GUS compiles annual and quarterly GDP estimates by the production and
expenditure approaches in current and constant prices, a full set of accounts by institutional
sectors, supply and use tables, input/output tables, annual financial accounts, and regional
accounts. The statistical techniques are basically sound. The constant price estimates are
compiled in average prices of the previous year, using deflation techniques that generally
follow international standards. However, national accounts data still have some problems—
the subannual data are collected on a cumulative rather than on a discrete basis, and plans to
introduce proper benchmarking have been delayed. In addition, seasonal adjustment on
relatively short period leads to frequent and large backward revisions.
4.
The concepts and definitions of the CPI follow the ESA 95 standards and Eurostat’s
requirements for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index. The CPI does not cover the imputed
rents of owner-occupied dwellings. The weights for the index are obtained from the average
annual expenditures primarily taken from the national Household Budget Survey (HBS) of
the previous calendar year, and are updated annually. From 1999 onwards, the national
classification is based on the Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose
(COICOP). The scope of the index covers all resident households, except those in some rural
areas. Historical series are constructed using a chain method. Time series data are available
for the index with reference periods of 1990 and 1998.
5.
The producer price index (PPI) is based on the 1993 SNA concepts and definitions for
recording and valuation of product prices and weights. Its scope includes mining and

8
quarrying, manufacturing and electricity, gas and water supply. Output price indices are also
calculated for agriculture, construction, and business services such as transport, storage, and
communication. Since 2000, the index is classified by the Polish Classification of Activities
based on the General Industrial Classification of Economic Activities within the European
Communities, first revision (NACE, Rev.1), the Classification of Products by Activity, and
the List of Products of the European Communities. The PPI does not include any estimation
for missing prices or quality and seasonal adjustments.
Government finance statistics
6.
The Ministry of Finance (MoF) provides detailed monthly state budget data on its
website, compiled on a cash basis. Fiscal data for other levels of government are published or
provided to IMF missions on a less frequent basis. Consolidated general government data are
published only on an annual basis, at the time of the budget, as an estimated outturn at the
time of the preparation of the next budget, and as the final outturn in late spring of the
following year. The limited breakdown of expenditure by category hinders fiscal analysis and
identification of priority areas for fiscal consolidation; consequently they play a very limited
role in the public policy debate, although non-state budget expenditure accounts for a large
share of general government expenditure.
7.
Data for inclusion in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook are reported to the
Fund on a regular basis and, since 2004, according to the framework of GFSM 2001. The
authorities have provided comparable data, compiled on an accrual basis, for 2001–03.
Monthly cash data on consolidated core operations of the central government are reported in
the GFSM 2001 cash flow statement for the IFS. The Central Statistical Office also produces
fiscal data according to the ESA95 methodology for submission to the EU and use in Poland’s
Stability Programs. However, GFS and ESA95 data, while providing a superior classification
of revenues and expenditure, traditionally became available with long lags and only on an
annual basis, diminishing their value for surveillance purposes.8
Monetary statistics
8.
The National Bank of Poland (NBP) regularly reports analytically useful data to the
Fund with minimal delay. High-frequency data (every ten days) on the central bank balance
sheet and the monetary survey are also available with minimal delay. As a member of the
European Union, the country has adopted the recommendations of the European Central
Bank (ECB) for the compilation of monetary and financial statistics; data compiled from
March 2002 onward are generally consistent with the ECB framework, and previously
released data have been revised back to December 1996.
9.
The mission that prepared the data module of the Report on the Observance of
Standards and Codes (ROSC) in January 2003 found that the concepts and definitions used
8

In 2007, STA and Eurostat finalized bridging the annual ESA and GFS data for all EU countries.

9
by the NBP to compile monetary statistics were in broad conformity with the guidelines
outlined in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). Nevertheless, the
following concepts and principles underlying valuation and classification of financial
instruments deviate from the MFSM: (i) financial derivatives are indistinguishably recorded
under other assets/other liabilities; (ii) accrued interest on loans and deposits are included as
part of other assets/other liabilities, but not with the respective underlying instruments;
(iii) similarly accrued interest on securities other than shares issued by the depository
corporations are included as part of other liabilities; (iv) loan-loss provisions are classified as
special reserves under capital accounts and reserves; and (v) valuation of shares and other
equity on the asset side of the balance sheets of the NBP and other depository corporations is
not at market prices. The first three practices differ from the MFSM guidelines, but are in
conformity with the ECB framework.
10.
Regarding financing data, the ROSC mission noted material differences between
government finance statistics and the corresponding monetary data. The data ROSC mission
recommended that the NBP, in cooperation with the MoF, reconcile monetary and
government finance statistics and carry out a reconciliation exercise on a regular basis.
11.
Compiled monetary data, based on the SRFs, have been published in the February
2008 issue of the IFS Supplement. The new data provide breakdowns of the claims on, and
liabilities to the central government and general government, which were previously not
available. However, breakdowns of the claims on, and liabilities to, other resident sectors are
not available.
External sector statistics
12.
While improvements have been made in the balance of payments data, some issues
need to be addressed. While there are valid differences in definitions between the customs
(GUS) and payment-based trade data compiled by the NBP, the two data sources need to be
further cross-checked for broad consistency. The NBP now reports net foreign assets rather
than the net international reserves previously shown in the monetary survey. Also, the
coverage and reporting of the stock of external debt, especially at maturities up to one year,
could be improved. The 2003 data ROSC mission recommended including interest on an
accrual basis, making explicit the legal requirement that the NBP disseminate balance of
payments statistics, separating insurance from transportation when making the c.i.f./f.o.b.
adjustment, publishing on a regular basis a reconciliation table between international
merchandise trade statistics and “goods” in the balance of payments, and undertaking
periodic revision studies.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with
the Republic of Poland

On July 31, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Poland.1
Background
Poland’s rapid growth had begun to lose steam even before the global crisis hit.
Following robust and relatively well-balanced expansion, driven by an EU accessionrelated investment boom and rapid credit and wage growth, economic activity began to
slow down in the face of capacity constraints. By mid-2008, inflationary pressures
peaked and the unemployment rate was at record lows.
As world commodity prices are expected to remain in check and wage developments
are likely to track slower economic activity, price pressures are projected to be subdued.
With output growth well below potential, headline inflation is forecasted to stay within the
tolerance range of 1½ to 3½ percent for the foreseeable future.
External imbalances have been relatively limited, and the equilibrium exchange rate has
been broadly aligned with fundamentals. The current account deficit widened to
5.5 percent of GDP in 2008, from 4.7 percent of GDP a year earlier. However, the
current account deficit is projected to narrow significantly this year, as domestic demand
has weakened and the fall in imports offset the contraction in exports.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

2
Macroeconomic policies have provided stimulus. The fiscal deficit was allowed to
increase as the slowdown set in, with the general government deficit reaching
3.9 percent of GDP at end-2008, compared with the budget target of 2.5 percent of
GDP. Meanwhile, the decline in inflation, together with the room provided by euro
interest rate cuts, prompted the central bank to embark on a loosening cycle since last
November. The policy rate was cut by cumulative 250 basis points to 3.5 percent.
Besides renewed price pressures in commodities, recent policy rate cuts have been
tempered by concerns about zloty depreciation.
The banking system has weathered the global crisis relatively well. Capital-adequacy
ratios (CAR) have declined, but the banking system remains well capitalized with a CAR
of 11.7 percent at the end of the first quarter of 2009, a high ratio of tier 1 capital, and
record profits in 2008. However, credit risk has risen with the slowdown of the economy,
while a sharp deceleration in credit growth is underway as new foreign funding dried up
and uncertainty about future economic developments have emerged. Reflecting these
uncertainties and the difficulties that banking groups are facing at the global level, the
interbank market has seen very little activity beyond one-week maturities. Still, the
authorities’ top-down stress tests suggest that the system is resilient to adverse
scenarios, and only a prolonged recession would lead to general recapitalization needs.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that the strength of Poland’s fundamentals, policies, and
institutions had enabled it to withstand the global crisis better than most of its peers, as
reflected in a limited buildup of external and internal imbalances. Financial markets have
broadly stabilized, and investor confidence has strengthened, attributable in part to
Poland’s Flexible Credit Line arrangement with the Fund.
Directors noted that a significant deceleration in economic activity is underway,
reflecting adverse spillovers through real and financial channels. They commended the
authorities for the timely, well-focused, and measured policy response. Sound policies in
the past are now affording policy-makers room for maneuver. The authorities’ continued
commitment to adjust policies as circumstances warrant would help Poland to endure a
mild recession this year.
Directors welcomed the accommodative stance of monetary policy. Given a benign
outlook for inflation and public confidence in the National Bank of Poland’s strong
antiinflation credentials, most Directors supported the authorities’ intention to maintain a
loosening bias, while remaining vigilant about price developments. Some Directors
considered that a pause in interest rate cuts appears warranted in light of uncertainties
surrounding external financing conditions. Directors noted that further measured
monetary easing is not likely to result in undue depreciation pressures on the zloty.
Directors recognized that the challenges facing fiscal policy are more complex, reflecting
the need to balance short-term cyclical priorities and longer-term objectives. They
broadly supported the authorities’ recent decision to raise the deficit limit for 2009 to

3
accommodate the revenue shortfall. Noting that the deficit is set to remain above the
Maastricht target through the medium term, Directors welcomed the authorities’
commitment to take corrective actions to preserve debt sustainability. They called for
fiscal consolidation to start in 2010 if the recovery materializes as expected, with a few
seeing limited scope for further delaying the consolidation process if the medium-term
deficit targets were to be achieved. Introducing rolling and binding multi-annual
expenditure limits, together with measures to enhance the expenditure prioritization
process, could help anchor confidence in the medium-term targets. These efforts should
be complemented by a further strengthening of fiscal institutions.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ pre-emptive actions to safeguard financial stability,
notably steps to encourage banks to retain the record-high 2008 profits, as well as
ongoing efforts to strengthen the supervisory framework. While the banking system
remains well-capitalized, continued vigilance is warranted, given banks’ rising nonperforming loans and funding costs. Directors welcomed the plan to conduct bank-bybank bottom-up stress tests to ensure that, if needed, banks move preemptively to
shore up capital. This exercise should help reduce uncertainty and facilitate the
unfreezing of the local interbank market.
Directors stressed that raising Poland’s labor participation rate is the key to boosting
long-term growth. In this regard, they welcomed last year’s reforms of the early
retirement system, and highlighted the need to continue reforming the pension system,
including by gradually increasing the retirement age and merging special pension
schemes with the general scheme. Reinvigorating structural reforms more broadly,
including the privatization plan, will help enhance the economy’s flexibility, bolster its
long-run potential, and facilitate successful euro adoption in the medium term.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Katarzyna Zajdel-Kurowska, Alternate Executive Director for the
Republic of Poland and Pawel Gasiorowski, Advisor to the Executive Director
July 31, 2009
We would like to thank staff for the report and the constructive consultations held in
Warsaw. Our authorities broadly agree with the staff’s assessment and policy
recommendations and look forward to the upcoming mid-review of the Flexible Credit Line
arrangement.
Macroeconomic outlook
So far, Poland has only been modestly affected by the world financial crisis. A strong reliance
on domestic demand (with consumption still growing) and strong fundamentals have
safeguarded the Polish economy against a severe external storm. Moreover, despite a sharperthan-expected deterioration in Poland’s main trading partners (mainly the euro area
countries), net export brought in an unexpectedly positive contribution to GDP growth in the
first quarter of 2009. Hence, economic growth still remains in the positive territory. In the
first quarter, GDP growth was up by 0.8 percent y/y and 0.4 percent q/q , following 2.9
percent y/y and 0 percent q/q growth in the last quarter of 2008. Preliminary data for the
second quarter also point to encouraging results. Against this background, the authorities also
remain moderately optimistic on the growth outlook, but uncertain external trends put risks to
the forecasts on the down side.
Fiscal policy
The economic slowdown combined with the negative short-term effects of the tax cuts
imposed at the beginning of the year has negatively affected the revenue side of the budget.
The revenue shortfall is estimated at PLN30 bn, which is 10 percent of the amount expected
earlier. By avoiding a sharp rise in the deficit, but protecting the economy against further
deceleration, the proposed supplementary budget with selective expenditure cuts was
accepted by the Parliament. As a result the central budget deficit has increased by only PLN9
bn, to PLN27 bn (2.1 percent of GDP), which is slightly above the 2008 outcome.
Borrowing needs of the government are fully covered. Since the beginning of the year, the
Ministry of Finance entered the foreign market several times, issuing EUR1.75 bn of
Eurobonds and USD3.5 bn of dollar bonds, which together with the financing from the World
Bank (Development Policy Loan) and the EIB exceeds the total government’s foreign
currency borrowing needs this year. Additionally, the government is planning to reinvigorate
the privatization process.
The authorities remain fully committed to the Maastricht criteria, as well as the budgetary
policy framework of the EU’s Stability and Growth Pact, and they continue to strengthen
medium-term fiscal planning to maintain a sustainable path for public debt (e.g, elements of a
system of performance based budgeting were implemented to improve effectiveness of public
spending).

2
Monetary policy
The authorities agree with the staff’s assessments of the future inflationary trends as well as
the recommendations towards monetary policy. Despite the sizable depreciation of the Polish
zloty in January-February, headline inflation has already returned to its tolerance range,
scaling down inflationary expectations. Monetary policy maintains an accommodative bias.
Apart from the main policy rate cuts this year, the Monetary Policy Council (MPC) reduced
the reserve requirement on deposits by 0.5 percentage points to 3.0 percent to improve the
liquidity of the banking sector.
Financial sector
Polish financial institutions entered the period of difficult economic conditions with a sound
financial position. This was due, among others, to very high profits generated by financial
institutions in 2008 and historically good asset quality in banks. The banking sector still plays
a leading role as it comprises over 80 percent of total assets of the financial sector. The banks
are in good shape, with an average capital adequacy ratio of 10.6 percent as of the first
quarter of 2009. In an environment of scarce capital from market sources, high earnings
became the first source of recapitalization. Taking into account increased uncertainty, the
Polish Financial Supervision Authority (KNF) has recommended the banks to retain 2008
profits. Following this recommendation, the majority of banks did not pay high dividends and
built an adequate capital buffer. In the coming quarters, the profitability of financial
institutions is expected to worsen. Macroeconomic top-down stress tests show, however, that
even if banks' revenues significantly decrease, the majority of the sector is able to absorb the
hypothetical cost of credit risk with the revenue it generates and the capital buffer it holds,
without threatening the required capital adequacy ratio of 8 percent.
Most of the banks operating in Poland follow a traditional funding model, based primarily on
customers' deposits. The financing of credit portfolio by assets backed securities does not
exist, hence the credit risk stays at the loan originator. Although the mortgage loans portfolio
was growing very fast, mortgages represent only 17 percent of GDP. Over half the mortgages
have been originated in foreign currency and are financed by credit lines from mother-banks.
So far an outflow of external financing has not been observed in the banking sector due to—
among other factors—a very low NPL ratio for mortgages. Therefore, the liquidity risk is
contained and temporary problems of limited access to the domestic interbank market did not
strongly affect the situation of banks. Temporary problems were solved by measures taken by
the National Bank of Poland.
In response to the worsening economic growth outlook, banks tightened lending policies,
both with regard to loans to corporates and loans to houseaholds. Nevertheless, credit growth
is still positive, although—in the corporate sector in particular—low. The impact of a
negative feedback between a procyclical contraction of the loan supply by banks and GDP
growth may be limited due to the still small scale of financing in the economy and the high
reliance of enterprises’ on their own funds and funds provided by foreign parents or related
parties.

3
The transmission of the global crisis to the Polish financial system has been limited so far.
First, the exposure of banks towards foreign financial institutions has been significantly
reduced since the third quarter of 2008, as a result of banks' preference to hold liquid assets in
zloty and the supervisory actions of the KNF. Second, a withdrawal of funding was observed
on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, but the banking system was not affected. Oppositely,
starting from September 2008, banks received significant liquidity support from foreign
financial institutions, mainly from their parents. Third, even as the liquidity in the markets
used by banks to hedge market risk decreased, banks can still hedge their positions through
operations with parents and instruments offered by the National Bank of Poland under the
"Confidence Pact".
The staff report properly describes the measures taken by our authorities with regard to the
financial system. It is worth noting that to date the National Bank of Poland did not need to
use the ECB repo line.
Stress tests of the financial sector
Our authorities have concluded preliminary top-down stress tests based on extreme
assumptions. Results were published and are clearly presented in the staff report. The
preparation of the bottom-up tests is underway.
Although our authorities appreciate the idea of a regional stress testing exercise, they
consider that results for banking systems may provide limited added value. The countries in
the region differ greatly in terms of their macroeconomic and institutional situation.
Therefore the aggregation of information from such a diverse group of countries is likely to
produce misleading results, leading to potentially flawed policy conclusions.
