Peru: Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Western Hemisphere Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Rodrigo Valdés and Dominique Desruelle

Crisis resilience followed by strong growth. Peru’s resilience to the global crisis owes to its
sound economic fundamentals and past prudent policies, which allowed building fiscal and
international reserve buffers and implementing a timely countercyclical policy response. Peru’s
growth is expected to rebound strongly, with upside risks from renewed capital inflows and
domestic demand dynamics. Downside tail risks could arise from a relapse in global growth and
return in global risk aversion.
Focus of the consultation. Discussions focused on: (i) how to graduate the withdrawal of the
accommodative policy stance in a timely manner to limit the risk of inflationary pressures later in
the year; (ii) policy challenges of large and sustained capital inflows; and (iii) reforms to sustain
high growth over the medium term and to solidify further Peru’s policy framework.
Key policy issues. Staff viewed the policy response to the global crisis as timely and effective
and supported the authorities’ policy plans amid a strong rebound in growth. With upside risks to
the outlook, the withdrawal of policy stimulus would need to be graduated early on, with the
consolidation of the fiscal stance preceding the tightening of the policy rate to limit incentives for
carry trade. To deal with a surge in capital inflows, the sequencing of the policy response should
be complemented by macro-prudential measures to prevent credit and asset booms and
exchange rate flexibility to avoid one-side bets. Peru’s bright prospects over the medium term
hinge importantly on the authorities’ ambitious reform agenda to boost competitiveness and
innovation, develop the domestic capital market, and further solidify the policy framework.
Exchange Rate Regime. The exchange regime is classified as floating (Informational Annex).
Peru has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 and maintains an exchange
system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions.
Mission. A staff team comprising M. Kaufman (head), M. Garcia-Escribano, L. Medina and
M. Vera Martin (all WHD), I. Rial (FAD), and P. Imam (MCM) conducted the discussions in Lima
during March 112. L. Breuer (Senior Resident Representative) assisted the mission and
O. Hendrick (OAD) participated in the meetings. R. Valdés (WHD) joined the concluding
meetings.

I. Background: Peru’s Resilience to the Crisis

1. Peru’s economic performance over the last decade has been outstanding by domestic
and international standards. Strong economic fundamentals, including a sound institutional
policy framework, and a solid track-record of prudent macroeconomic policies helped reduce
vulnerabilities, achieve record-high economic growth, and advance significantly with poverty
reduction. Economic activity experienced a 10-year expansion, the longest on record, with a
cumulative growth of about 50 percent.

medium-term prospects remain
unimpaired, linked to an ambitious
reform agenda and the expected preservation of macroeconomic stability. The economic
resilience during the recent global financial crisis has consolidated Peru’s standing among
emerging markets and is expected to become a major recipient of foreign investment.
2. As a result of the global crisis, activity in Peru decelerated sharply in 2009 but began
to rebound in the second half of the year. Following exceptionally high growth in 2008
(9.8 percent) and emerging signs of overheating, growth declined substantially in 2009, with a few
months in negative territory, but remained positive at about 1 percent for the whole year
(Appendix 1). The downturn was primarily linked to the collapse in global trade and uncertainty
about global growth, temporarily

consumption dragged down on growth—private investment (including inventories) fell by
30 percent in real terms but consumption proved more resilient thanks to sustained employment.
Inflation, which peaked at 6.7 percent in December 2008, fell to near zero in the second half of
2009, partly because of the decline in food and fuel prices. Core inflation declined more
sluggishly, to near 2 percent (the mid-point of the target range) by end–2009. Real activity gained
traction in the second half of 2009, supported by the acceleration in the execution of the fiscal
stimulus; the lagged impact of the monetary easing; the completion of the inventory destocking
cycle; and better terms of trade and global recovery prospects. In the last quarter of 2009, the
economy grew by over 15 percent (qoq, saar annualized).
3. Peru’s strong policy framework and proactive response were key to limit the impact of
the crisis and to the ensuing economic rebound. Thanks to the strong buffers built in recent
years, Peru was able to implement a significant monetary and fiscal policy response, which
helped avoid a credit crunch, support economic activity and sustain employment. As a result, the
economy endured limited slack in resource utilization.
x

The direct financial impact of the global crisis was contained. During the period of
heightened global risk aversion and deleveraging, the central bank injected substantial
liquidity in the system, both in Soles and U.S. dollars, to prevent a liquidity squeeze and
credit crunch. Credit growth decelerated significantly but remained positive in 2009. The
central bank also intervened significantly in the foreign exchange market to limit currency
volatility associated with the unwinding of carry trade operations and domestic portfolio reallocation, including some deposit re-dollarization (Appendix 2).

x

The policy interest rate was lowered significantly to support economic activity.
Once currency pressures abated, the central bank acted proactively to reduce the policy
rate by 525 bps since early 2009 to a historic-low of 1¼ percent. Lending rates to the
private sector also declined in line with the policy rate.

x

A substantial fiscal stimulus plan has been implemented. The fiscal stimulus, largely
financed with fiscal savings, aimed to sustain domestic demand and boost business
confidence. It entailed a positive fiscal impulse of about 2½ percent of GDP in 2009, with
an increase in real general government primary spending of 14 percent. The fiscal plan
also included contingency measures including guarantees to support corporates,
exporters and smaller financial institutions, which in the end were not needed.

4. Peru’s banking sector proved resilient to the global crisis, with solid financial
indicators. The banking system was well-positioned to weather the global financial crisis, with a
regulatory and supervisory framework that had been strengthened substantially in past years,
including through the introduction of dynamic provisioning in 2008 (Appendix 3). Short-term
foreign financing was limited, thanks in part to prudential reserve requirements. Banks remained
well-capitalized, liquid, and profitable during 2009. The impact of the economic slowdown on
portfolio quality was limited, as non-performing loans increased modestly to 2.8 percent in
January 2010 from 2.2 percent in 2008. Stress testing performed by the Superintendence of
Staff Report Article IV 2010 Consultation-Peru

4

Banks and Insurance (SBS) showed that banks remain well prepared to absorb future potential
losses.
5. Peru’s external financial account also proved resilient, with a recent resurgence of
capital inflows and some appreciation pressures. A quick recovery of net FDI flows (which
diminished slightly to a still-high 3 percent of GDP) and strong public sector flows compensated
for portfolio outflows, partly driven by domestic pension funds. The public sector took advantage
of improving global market conditions during 2009 and issued debt (US$2 billion) for pre-financing
operations and full repayment of Paris Club debt. The Sol recovered its pre-Lehman level against
the U.S. dollar by November 2009, and has appreciated by 5 percent in nominal and real
effective terms since then. Recent appreciation pressures have been associated with portfolio reallocation of domestic agents, including pension funds, and some foreign portfolio inflows. These
pressures have been intermittent since late last year, with temporary respites during episodes of
heightened global volatility linked to sovereign risk developments in other regions. As of
March 24, the central bank has bought US$2.3 billion so far this year to moderate volatility.

II. Outlook: Strong Growth with Upside Risks

6. The economy is expected to grow strongly this year, with limited slack in resource
utilization thanks to the successful policy response. With the recovery already taking place, a
sustained improvement in global conditions and the remaining policy stimulus, staff projects
growth at 6¼ percent this year and 6 percent in 2011. The stimulus plan has a residual impulse in
2010, with real government spending projected to grow at 7 percent, and monetary conditions
remaining accommodative. Peru’s recovery appears less dependent on policy support than in
other advanced and emerging market economies, as it did not open a significant output gap and
the balance sheets of the corporate, household, and financial sectors remain unimpaired. Inflation
is expected to converge to the middle of the target range in the second half of the year, with
upside risks from food and fuel price developments. Renewed appreciation pressures could
materialize, linked to the re-emergence of capital inflows.
7.

Overall, the balance of risks to growth in Peru appears tilted to the upside. Prospects of
renewed capital inflows to strong emerging markets and domestic demand dynamics, including
the cyclical rebuilding of inventories and an acceleration of private investment projects put on
hold last year, could intensify growth momentum this year and next. The combination of a relapse
in global growth and a return of global risk aversion is the principal tail risk that could encumber
the growth outlook. Moreover, a strong El Niño weather effect this year could generate negative
economic disruptions, while the upcoming electoral cycle—municipal and regional elections set
for October 2010 and presidential elections for April 2011—could potentially dampen private
investment temporarily.

Staff Report Article IV 2010 Consultation-Peru

8. The medium-term economic outlook is bright, with prospects for sizable capital
inflows. Peru’s potential growth is expected to remain elevated at about 5¾ percent over the
medium term, somewhat lower than the rate prevailing before the global crisis due in part to the
envisaged reduction in trend global growth.1 The current account deficit is projected to fluctuate
between 2 and 3 percent of GDP as global conditions normalize. Overall, the fiscal deficit is
expected to decline gradually to a balanced budget, while public debt ratios will continue to
decline to about 20 percent of GDP. Underpinned by continued prudent macroeconomic policies,
Peru’s strong economic outlook hinges on the authorities’ ambitious reform agenda. Peru’s solid
fundamentals and bright economic prospects could stimulate large and sustained capital inflows
that could test the absorption capacity of the economy and pose significant policy challenges.
Such scenario would likely result in stronger private investment and a widening of the current
account over the medium term.

III. Policy Discussions: Challenges From Upside Risk and to
Preserve Medium-Term Growth
9. Discussions centered on:

1

x

The appropriate policy response to the strong recovery. With increasing evidence of a
self-sustained rebound, policies need to be graduated early on toward a neutral stance as
Peru avoided opening a significant output gap.

x

Challenges associated with easy external financing conditions and renewed capital
inflows. Discussions focused on the sequencing of policy normalization and
complementary tools to prevent credit and asset booms.

x

Reforms to sustain high growth over the medium term. These include continuing with
Peru’s global integration; improving competitiveness and innovation; and developing
domestic capital markets. Attention would also be needed on education, labor markets,
economic/judicial institutions, and civil service reform.

x

Reforms to strengthen the institutional framework. These include reviewing the current
fiscal framework to reduce pro-cyclicality and further strengthening the prudential
framework, guided by the emerging lessons from the global financial crisis.

See the selected issues paper “Potential Growth and Output Gap in Peru” for a detailed analysis on this

topic.

Policy Challenges of Strong Growth and Easy External Financing Conditions
Graduating the macroeconomic policy stance
10. Evidence of a self-sustained private-led recovery will need to be assessed against the
potential buildup of domestic demand pressures. The normal lags in the transmission of fiscal
and monetary policies calls for careful monitoring of the pace of the recovery, given Peru’s
success in avoiding a significant slack in resource utilization. The authorities expected growth in
the first semester to be driven by the remaining fiscal stimulus, accommodative monetary
conditions and inventory restocking, with private sector-led growth taking over in the second
semester. They indicated that the global outlook remained subdued, with risks to the strength of
the recovery in Peru.
11. Graduating the withdrawal of policy stimulus in a timely manner would be crucial to
avoid the risk of a buildup in inflationary pressures later in the year. The authorities agreed
that a sustained recovery would reduce the need for policy support and entail the need to move
the policy stance toward a more neutral position. Sustaining the policy stimulus on top of a
private-sector led recovery would heighten the risk of inflationary pressures in the second part of
the year. The authorities expressed that they were aware of the challenges and ready to take
action as needed.
12. With global financial conditions conducive to renewed capital inflows, the sequencing
of policy withdrawal would need to be complemented by a combination of prudential tools.
The authorities noted that, to limit incentives for carry trade inflows, it will be beneficial to start
consolidating the fiscal stance in advance of increasing policy interest rates. Moreover, they
noted that, in such circumstances, normalizing accommodative monetary conditions may rely on
a combination of quantitative measures, including reserve requirements, and the policy interest
rate, which will help re-build liquidity buffers in the financial sector. The authorities noted that
reserve requirements proved an effective tool in Peru’s dollarized economy during the period of
abundant global liquidity and capital inflows to build prudential buffers in the financial system, and
during the global financial crisis to inject liquidity and avoid a credit squeeze. The authorities
agreed that the sequencing of the fiscal and monetary policy withdrawal may need to be
accompanied by the implementation of macro prudential measures to prevent credit and asset
booms. Staff noted that it would be important to exercise heightened vigilance for potential oneside bets, for which greater exchange rate flexibility could reduce incentives.
13. Peru has room to provide additional policy stimulus to limit the fallout of a relapse in
global growth. The authorities noted that the infrastructure and maintenance projects
implemented in 2009 proved effective to help sustain economic activity and employment. They
noted that the current low policy interest rate would require to recourse to non-traditional or
quantitative measures, including acting along the sovereign yield curve. If global risk aversion
returns and financial conditions worsen, the central bank would have room to inject liquidity in
soles and U.S. dollars into the system.

Staff Report Article IV 2010 Consultation-Peru

14. The authorities agreed that the real effective exchange rate was broadly in line with
fundamentals. The authorities noted that the overarching objective of the intervention policy has
been to mitigate the volatility of the exchange rate and its potential balance-sheet effects in the
context of a still highly dollarized economy, with no pre-determined target on the level of the
currency. The latest CGER estimates suggested that the Sol is within the range of its equilibrium
value, with some indicators suggesting a slight overvaluation and others a slight undervaluation,
all within a   t range (Appendix 4). The authorities concurred with this assessment.
Staff agreed that a precise assessment was difficult to undertake at this juncture given, inter alia,
the uncertainties about the impact on global trend growth and commodity prices, and the
resolution of global imbalances and potential exchange rate adjustments of advance and major
emerging economies.
15. Bringing the fiscal stance to a neutral position would help regain fiscal cushions and
manage prospective large and sustained capital inflows to Peru. The authorities agreed that
fiscal spending would need to be managed carefully to gradually lower the fiscal deficit, and
return in 2011 to the 1 percent of GDP deficit limit established by the Fiscal Responsibility and
Transparency Law. This will also help preserve fiscal cushions which proved very important to be
able to respond to the global crisis, and prepare for the risk of a relapse in global growth. They
also concurred that the mounting liabilities of the Oil Price Stabilization Fund (FEPC) would need
to be addressed in the short run to avoid the buildup of large debt obligations. The authorities’
projection of an overall deficit of 1.6 and 1.0 percent of GDP for 2010 and 2011 would help
reduce the structural deficit that resulted from the fiscal stimulus plan, with additional efforts
needed in later years. Staff noted
that, as the urgency to undertake

Financial Sector Resilience with Further Strengthening of the Prudential Framework
The global financial crisis highlighted the strength of the prudential framework, and the
authorities remain strongly committed to enhancing it further, by applying the lessons
from the global crisis. Regulatory norms on capital, liquidity and dynamic provisioning are
ahead international standards. Nevertheless, the authorities indicated that they are proactively
taking steps to incorporate the lessons from the global financial crisis, including broadening
further the regulatory perimeter to bring cooperative banks and Banco de la Nacion (publicly
owned bank) fully under the umbrella of the SBS. They have also established additional capital
requirements linked to the assessment (stress testing) and risk of borrowers’ FX credit risk, which
Staff Report Article IV 2010 Consultation-Peru

8

will become effective in July 2010, to further promote that banks internalize such risk. The
authorities are also analyzing ways to increase cross-border collaboration with other supervisors,
including improved information sharing. They noted that important steps have been taken to
improve macro-prudential supervision, with meetings at the highest level being regularly
conducted. The authorities are considering various initiatives being discussed at the international
level, including capital requirements for systemic risk; strengthening the crisis resolution
framework; and improving liquidity provisioning under systemic stress.2
16. Further de-dollarization will allow higher exchange rate flexibility. The authorities
indicated that, over the coming years, Peru’s improved fundamentals will continue fostering dedollarization and allow further exchange rate flexibility. They noted that, with a substantial
reduction in financial dollarization over the last decade, the Sol has shown greater currency
volatility in recent years. Staff concurred that this de-dollarization trend has been the result of
macroeconomic stability, a solid prudential framework, and a developing capital market in Soles.3
Peru’s successful management of the worst global financial crisis since the great depression has
boosted confidence in the local currency and lending in Soles. The authorities noted that their
reform agenda to develop mortgages in local currency and other necessary financial instruments
should further contribute to de-dollarization. Staff indicated that a gradual increase in currency
volatility will also foster the development of FX hedging instruments and markets to manage
currency risk in the corporate and financial sectors, and further support the de-dollarization
process. In this context, the exchange rate would be able to play a larger role as a shock
absorber.

Reforms to Maintain High Growth and Enhance the Policy Framework
Medium-term Policies to Sustain High Growth
17. Peru’s bright economic prospects would benefit from the implementation of the
authorities’ ambitious reform agenda to preserve high growth over the medium term. Staff
concurs that growth will need to be increasingly driven by higher productivity growth over the
medium term, with the current drivers of growth centered on capital accumulation and
employment of under-utilized resources (labor, land and natural resources). Key pillars of the
authorities’ strategy include: (i) global integration through free trade agreements with the United
States, Europe and Asia (where substantial progress has been made); (ii) enhancing
competitiveness by improving the business environment (lowering, inter alia, the cost of setting
up and conducting business and fostering innovation); and (iii) developing domestic capital

markets (Appendix 5). Staff welcomed the authorities’ efforts to lay out plans in key reform areas
over the next years. Areas that would require early attention include: education, labor markets,
economic/judicial institutions, and civil service reform.
18. The authorities have an ambitious agenda to develop the domestic capital markets. A
deeper capital market would be important to effectively channel resources in the economy. The
actual and potential demand for domestic assets has increased substantially in recent years, but
the supply of assets has been limited. While structural factors—economic size and selective
nature of issuers—are part of the challenges to overcome over the medium term, regulations and
taxation issues could be reviewed to ensure that they remain conducive to fostering the
expansion of assets available. The authorities noted that steps are being taken to develop the
mortgage market in Soles through the creation of a covered bond instrument, and to foster the
development of key financial instruments such as the repo and interest rate swap markets that
would facilitate lending in Soles. Moreover, the authorities intend to strengthen the function of the
Security and Exchange Commission (CONASEV) which would help ease access to the domestic
capital markets. In this context, the authorities noted that an agreement to integrate the Chilean,
Colombian and Peruvian stock markets by 2011 could be expected to increase investible assets
for AFPs of all countries and increase market liquidity.
19. Peru’s progress in poverty reduction has been preserved during the global financial
crisis, and there is a strong commitment to continue implementing the poverty alleviation
strategy. Poverty declined significantly from 44½ percent in 2006 to 36 percent in 2008, thanks
to strong economic growth and efforts to prioritize social spending. Despite the sharp deceleration
in growth in 2009, the gains in poverty alleviation were preserved as the fiscal stimulus plan
helped sustain employment and protected social spending. The authorities’ efforts to improve the
quality of social spending have included the strengthening of the Inter-ministerial Committee for
Social Assistance (CIAS); the consolidation and focusing of social programs; increased coverage
and resources for some social programs (in particular for the conditional cash-transfer program,
Juntos); and improvements in the provision of public health and education. Staff welcomed the
authorities’ strong commitment to continue fighting poverty. The authorities stressed that they will
continue implementing their poverty alleviation strategy Crecer, focusing on further addressing
targeting challenges, including through the creation of a single registry of beneficiaries, and
improving the quality of social programs through performance indicators.
Solidifying the Policy Framework
20. While the Fiscal Responsibility and Transparency Law (FRTL) has been instrumental
for fiscal consolidation, the authorities showed interest in exploring ways to reduce
cyclicality. Staff underscored that the current FRTL framework has been essential to Peru’s
successful fiscal consolidation. However, controlling spending has been challenging and caps
frequently proved to be difficult to enforce, particularly at the sub-national level. The use of
structural balance indicators could facilitate and focus budget discussions on sustainable
medium-term expenditure plans, anchor prudent fiscal policies over a longer horizon, and reduce
the potential pro-cyclicality of other fiscal targets. The authorities concurred that a structural
Staff Report Article IV 2010 Consultation-Peru

10

balance approach can be demanding in terms of the economic and institutional prerequisites and
require lengthy preparatory steps. The design of the FRTL (with deficit and expenditure growth
limits) has an embedded flexibility to adapt to evolving objectives. Staff suggested that adjusting
the current parameters—mainly through changes in expenditure caps—could shift the focus of
fiscal policy closer to a structural balance approach, reducing its potential pro-cyclical bias and
retaining debt limit objectives, which still remain important to the authorities.4
21. Strengthening the Oil Price Stabilization Fund (FEPC) can improve its effectiveness
and reduce fiscal risks. At current prices, the potential liability of the FEPC would amount to
½ percent of GDP in 2010.5 The authorities are considering moving to a rule-based adjustment of
the price bands to ensure that the FEPC is self-financed, and to an automatic settlement of
liabilities. A gradual but frequent adjustment of the reference price can help minimize disruptive
effects on other prices and avoid the buildup of large price differentials and debt obligations. This
could be facilitated by placing the oversight of the FEPC under a technical regulatory agency.
Staff suggested that the changes in the FEPC framework could be accompanied by a mechanism
to minimize the effects on the more vulnerable segments of the population.
22. Several initiatives on the fiscal front would improve the quality and efficiency of public
spending. Staff commended the authorities’ strong resolve to improve the quality and efficiency
of public spending, including introducing performance indicators for some budgetary items and
fostering capacity building at the sub-national level. Staff also welcomed the authorities’ efforts to
assess the potential medium–term implications of contingent fiscal liabilities, including those
derived from the public-private partnerships (PPP) and remaining public sector pension schemes.
The authorities indicated that they are well aware of the importance of maintaining appropriate
risk sharing between the public and private sector in PPP initiatives. Staff supported the
authorities’ continued efforts to strengthen the financial management information system (SIAF),
as well as the efforts to broaden the tax base and protect the integrity of tax administration.
23. Peru is likely to experience a persistent shift in investor preference, with large and
sustained capital inflows beyond the current juncture of easy external financial conditions.
Inflows, especially FDI, would support the authorities’ strategy to upgrade economic productivity
and boost potential growth. However, large capital inflows can pose significant macroeconomic

The mechanism involves a price band for the wholesale domestic price and an international reference

price. When the international price is above the band, the FEPC compensates wholesale distributors that
keep prices within the band. Similarly, distributors must compensate the FEPC when the reference price
drops below the lower band limit. For more details on the determination of the price band, please see IMF
Country Report No. 09/40 (2009).

and policy challenges. Staff emphasized the challenges associated with the composition of
inflows, the widening of the current account and appreciation of the currency, potential credit
booms and asset bubbles, and the risk of reversal and economic volatility. The authorities
concurred that it is important to prepare in advance for those challenges. The lessons of the
international experience point to some key elements, including a fiscal policy that creates space
for private investment, the role of exchange rate flexibility, and macro-prudential instruments to
avoid credit and assets price booms.6

IV. Staff Appraisal

Macroeconomic Policy
24. Given Peru’s upside risks to growth and limited output gap, a key policy challenge will
be to graduate the withdrawal of policy stimulus early on to mitigate the risks of a buildup
in inflationary pressures later in the year. The normal lags in the transmission of fiscal and
monetary policies call for careful monitoring of the pace of the recovery. Evidence of a selfsustained private-led recovery will need to be assessed against the potential buildup of domestic
demand pressures, given Peru’s success in avoiding a significant slack in resource utilization.
Graduating the withdrawal of policy support in a timely manner would be crucial to avoid building
inflationary pressures later this year.
25. Global financial conditions conducive to a renewed surge in capital inflows would call
for sequencing the withdrawal of policy stimulus and using a combination of tools. Staff
supports the authorities’ view that, to limit incentives for carry trade inflows, it will be beneficial to
start consolidating the fiscal stance in advance of increasing policy interest rates. Moreover, staff
concurs that, in such circumstances, normalizing accommodative monetary conditions may rely
first on reserve requirements before increasing the policy interest rate. The sequencing of the
fiscal and monetary policy response may need to be implemented in coordination with macro
prudential measures to prevent credit and asset booms, which Peru appears well prepared for,
and by heightened vigilance for potential one-side bets, for which greater exchange rate flexibility
could reduce incentives.
26. Should a relapse of global conditions materialize, Peru has space to provide additional
policy stimulus to limit the fallout. As with the fiscal stimulus implemented in 2009,
infrastructure and maintenance projects can prove effective to help sustain domestic demand and

lessons with episodes of large capital inflows in emerging markets.

employment. However, the limited scope for reducing further the policy interest rate would call for
other monetary measures. The central bank would also have room to inject liquidity in the system
if global risk aversion returns and financial conditions worsen.
27. Over the coming years, Peru’s improved fundamentals will foster further dedollarization and allow the exchange rate to play a larger role as shock absorber. Peru has
shown greater currency volatility in recent years, which coincides with a substantial reduction in
financial dollarization over the last decade. Moreover, the successful management of the worst
global financial crisis since the great depression has boosted confidence in the local currency and
lending in Soles. The authorities’ reform agenda to develop mortgages in local currency and other
necessary financial instruments should further contribute to de-dollarization. A gradual increase in
currency volatility will foster the development of FX hedging instruments and markets to manage
currency risk in the corporate and financial sectors, and further support the de-dollarization
process. In this context, the exchange rate would be able to play a larger role as a shock
absorber, including to large and persistent capital inflows.
28. Gradually returning to a neutral fiscal stance would help regain fiscal cushions and
manage prospective large and sustained capital inflows to Peru. Fiscal spending plans
should be administrated carefully to achieve a declining path for the fiscal deficit and return in
2011 to the limit of 1 percent of GDP established by the Fiscal Responsibility and Transparency
Law. In addition, the mounting liabilities of the FEPC should be addressed in the short run to
avoid the buildup of large debt obligations. A timely consolidation of the fiscal stance would allow
regaining fiscal space in case of a relapse in global conditions. Peru’s success in reducing public
debt and building financial cushions was essential to have the fiscal space and credibility to
launch a substantial stimulus plan, with no offsetting effect on interest rates. In addition, fiscal
consolidation, by creating space for the private sector, can be a valuable tool to address the
macroeconomic challenges of large and sustained capital inflows, a likely scenario for Peru.
These inflows, particularly FDI, would support the authorities’ reform agenda to sustain high
growth over the medium term, but may also promote excessive domestic demand growth and risk
taking.

Medium–Term and Structural Issues
29. Peru’s bright economic prospects would benefit from the implementation of the
authorities’ ambitious reform agenda to preserve high growth over the medium term.
Underpinned by continued prudence in macroeconomic policies, staff concurs that growth will
need to be increasingly driven by higher productivity growth over the medium term, for which the
authorities’ reform strategy is critical. Moreover, the authorities’ efforts to lay out plans in key
structural reform areas are essential to facilitate the reform process over the next years. Areas
that would require early attention include: education, labor markets, economic/judicial institutions,
and civil service reform.
30. The development of Peru’s capital market is a key area to effectively channel domestic
and external resources to sustain capital formation. Staff supports the authorities’ initiatives

Staff Report Article IV 2010 Consultation-Peru

to develop the mortgage market in Soles and to foster the development of key financial
instruments that would facilitate long-term lending. Moreover, the authorities’ intention to
strengthen the function of the Security and Exchange Commission (CONASEV) could help ease
access to the domestic capital markets. Limited market size and regulatory incentives of pension
funds may contribute to market volatility and inefficient price discovery.
31. The authorities’ commitment to further solidifying Peru’s strong prudential framework,
incorporating the lessons from the global financial crisis, is essential to address an
evolving international financial architecture environment. Peru’s regulatory and supervisory
framework includes features that have been ahead of the international practice. The challenge
going forward would be to reassess the prudential framework against a moving international
standard and how to incorporate those aspects most relevant for Peru. In particular, the
strengthening of agency coordination for macro-prudential supervision is an important step, and
formalizing the institutional mechanism could further enhance its effectiveness. Other areas to
consider include assessing the scope for incorporating systemic risk into the prudential
framework, reviewing the crisis resolution framework, and fully extending the prudential perimeter
to cooperatives and public financial institutions.
32. Building on the success of Peru’s Fiscal Responsibility and Transparency Law (FRTL)
in reducing public debt, the focus of the current framework could shift toward mitigating
potential pro-cyclical effects. Adjusting the current parameters of the FRTL could shift the
focus of fiscal policy closer to a structural balance approach, reducing its potential pro-cyclical
bias and retaining debt limit objectives. Staff supports the authorities’ intentions to report as part
of the fiscal balance and debt measures the government certificates of future payments issued as
part of the partial completion of PPP investment projects (CRPAOs). Staff also welcomes the
authorities’ initiatives to improve capacity building at the sub-national level as a way to enhance
the effectiveness and quality of public spending.
33. Strengthening the FEPC can improve its effectiveness and reduce significant fiscal
risks. Staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to move to a rule-based adjustment of the price
bands to ensure that the FEPC is self-financed. In addition, gradual but frequent adjustments of
the reference price can help minimize disruptive effects on other prices and avoid the buildup of
large price differentials and debt obligations. This could be facilitated by placing the oversight of
the FEPC under a technical regulatory agency. The changes in the FEPC framework could also
be accompanied by a mechanism to minimize the effects on the more vulnerable segments of the
population.
34. It is expected that the next Article IV Consultation will take place on the standard 12-month
cycle.

During the first months following Lehmann’s collapse,
the monetary response consisted primarily of
unconventional measures such as: reduction of reserve
requirements, currency swaps, repo operations,
announcing the possibility of intervening along the
sovereign yield curve, as well as the repurchase of central
bank’s certificates of deposits. Moreover, the central bank

As conditions stabilized, the central bank began to reverse some of the
unconventional measures. Since the second quarter of 2009, the central bank has reduced
the stock of FX-swaps, repo operations and FX-indexed CDs. In January 2010, a reserve
requirement of 35 percent on short-term (less than 2 years) foreign credit lines was
reinstalled.

Appendix 3: Dynamic Provisioning in Peru

Peru was among the first emerging market economies to introduce dynamic provisioning
(DP) at end-2008. The introduction was a reaction to several years of double-digit credit growth
and a desire to dampen lending pro-cyclicality

Generic Provision

Cyclical Provision

"Voluntary" Provisions

Peru’s provisioning requirements are composed of a fixed component (“generic rate”),
and a variable dynamic element, which reflects the state of the business cycle (“cyclical
rate”). ‘Generic’ provisioning is defined according to eight separate loan categories that represent
different credit risks. ‘Cyclical’ provisioning is activated and deactivated only according to certain
pre-determined growth-thresholds (see graphs below). These cyclical provisions, which became
effective in December 2008, were calibrated on data from the crisis of the late 1990s, and are
higher for consumption credit.

Peru’s DP has two unique features compared with Spain, Colombia and Uruguay
(Table A3.1). First, it is a GDP-based rule, as opposed to being a credit-based rule. The reason
for using GDP as a trigger was in part to avoid interfering with the desirable trend of financial
deepening in Peru. Second, it applies equally across banks, independently of individual bank’s
behavior. The impact could be asymmetric across banks, with a potential higher burden on more
prudent banks. While tailoring the rule to individual institutions could be better from an efficiency
perspective, the current rule has the advantage of simplicity.

Appendix 4: Exchange Rate Developments and Assessment

Amid the global financial crisis, the Nuevo Sol has appreciated by about 5 percent in the last
2 years, thanks to stronger fundamentals and a weaker U.S. dollar. The appreciation has been
very gradual, as the Sol has been the most stable currency among major countries in the region.
Exchange rate volatility in Peru compares positively in light of other dollarized economies.
Different exchange rate assessments suggest that the exchange rate is in line with fundamentals,
with estimates ranging from an undervaluation of 7 percent to an overvaluation of 6 percent.
In real effective terms, the Nuevo Sol has recovered from its low level in recent years
(Chart 1). In November, the real effective exchange rate (REER) was at around its 19912008
average. In contrast with the

Peru’s Sol has been the most stable currency among major countries in the region. 3month rolling volatility for the nominal exchange rate (vis-à-vis the US$) has been below
2 percent during 200809, well below other large economies in the region which have a freely
floating exchange rate regime. Further, volatility has been declining since June 2009 and remains
somehow subdued (below 1 percent). However, Peru compares well with respect to other
dollarized economies in the region. The exchange rate volatility in Peru is historically about
middle ground between those of Uruguay and Costa Rica.

CGER-type calculations suggest that the exchange rate is broadly in line with
fundamentals.
x

The macroeconomic balance approach compares the difference between the underlying
current account balance projected over the medium term at the current exchange rate, and
an estimated equilibrium current account or “CA norm”. The change in the real effective
exchange rate needed to close the gap between the two measures is the degree of
misalignment. The CA norm is estimated as a function of the economy’s medium-term
fundamentals on the basis of a cross-country panel regression. This approach shows an
overvaluation of 6 percent in the real effective exchange rate.

The external stability approach calculates the difference between the actual current
account balance and the balance that would stabilize the net foreign asset position of the
country at a benchmark level. The real exchange rate adjustment needed to bring the current
account balance in line with the NFA-stabilizing level over the medium term is the degree of
misalignment. This approach suggests an overvaluation of 5 percent.

The equilibrium real exchange rate approach estimates the long-run relationship between
the real effective exchange rate and fundamentals based on a cross country panel
regression. The exchange rate adjustment needed to restore equilibrium over the medium
term is calculated as the difference between the estimated equilibrium real exchange rate
and its current value. This approach suggests an undervaluation of the Nuevo Sol of
7 percent as of October 2009.

Calculations based on an alternative methodology for countries with large stocks of nonrenewable resources confirm the CGER results. Under the stock approach (Thomas, Kim, and
Aslam (2008)) the level of the non-copper current account consistent with optimal consumption
smoothing is estimated. The degree of misalignment is the real exchange rate adjustment needed
to bring the current account balance in line with the estimated equilibrium non-copper current

account (a deficit of 2.1 percent of GDP). An analysis for Peru based on copper suggests an
undervaluation of 2 percent. Uncertainties in this approach include the estimate of the stock of
copper reserves, assumptions on the return on investment and the discount rate, and the
exclusion of other non-renewable resources in the country.
Under the 2007 Surveillance Decision, the underlying current account balance is defined
as the medium-term level of the current account stripped of temporary factors influencing
the trade and income balances. The projected current account (at -1.3 percent of GDP for
2010) may differ from the underlying current account for several reasons, including:
x

Domestic output gap. Peru’s output is estimated to be below potential in 2010. If output
were brought up to its potential, imports would increase, widening the current account deficit.

x

Output gap in trading partners. Foreign demand in Peru’s key trading partner is estimated
to be below potential. If this gap were to close, Peru’s exports would benefit, leading to an
improvement in the trade and current account balances.

x

Commodity prices. 2010 prices are estimated above their long-term level (average of
201415). If prices were to be adjusted to their long-term level the trade and current account
balances would deteriorate. In parallel, profit remittances for foreign companies would decline
in line with reduced commodity prices.

x

Hydrocarbon prices. As a net importer of hydrocarbon products, Peru’s trade balance has
deteriorated due to the recent price increase. If these were reversed and prices were to fall to
a smoothed average. The current account would improve.

The adjustments to the projected current account balance imply an estimated underlying
current account deficit of 1.1 percent of GDP compared to a projection of a deficit of
0.7 percent of GDP in 2010. With mining products accounting for nearly two thirds of Peru’s
goods exports, lower longer-term commodity prices have the strongest effect on Peru’s current
account through reduced exports—equivalent to 1¼ percent of GDP (see table). This is only
partially offset by lower profit remittances, and the effects of Peru’s and trading partner’s negative
output gap. These temporary factors are expected to dissipate over the medium term as output
gaps are closed and commodity and mineral prices approach their long-term levels. The level of
the underlying current account is consistent with external sustainability.
Finally, the exchange rate assessments are subject to considerable uncertainties stemming
from the model assumptions, as well the rapid changes taking place against the background of
the global financial and economic turmoil. Further disruptions in currency markets, declines in
commodity prices, and changes in relative inflation and output gaps can also complicate the
analysis at this juncture.

Appendix 5: Capital Markets in Peru

Peru’s financial market has grown rapidly in recent years, and demand for Peruvian assets
is expected to continue growing strongly. A decade of macroeconomic stability and economic
growth has put Peru on the emerging markets map. Peru’s stock market has been among the
best performers in recent years, driven by the rebound in mineral prices and obtaining
investment–grade status from all three major rating agencies. Rising domestic savings—in the
form of increasingly capitalized pension and mutual funds as well as sound public finances—and
increasing demand for Peruvian assets by foreign investors, insurance companies and other
financial intermediaries, have led to increased demand for domestic equity, bonds and other
financial assets, which is expected to be sustained in coming years.
Peru’s supply of financial assets is limited by regional standards (Table A5.1). High equity
returns, a stable macroeconomic environment and rising assets under management of AFPs
have not led to the take off of the primary market. Equity issuances/Initial Public Offerings (IPO)
are still rare, with many companies raising capital overseas instead. The stock market has had
few new listings and remains dominated by commodity–producing companies (two-thirds). By
regional comparison, the domestic fixed income market is also underdeveloped and dominated
by public debt. Most fixed-income products remain illiquid, as they are bought and held by AFPs.

(2) Includes gross external debt (registered and nonregistered public and private).

The constraint to expanding the supply of domestic assets is partly structural, related to
market size. In comparison to key emerging markets in the region, Peru has the smallest market
size in dollar amounts, as well as the fewest issuances of equity, loans and bonds between 2005
and 2009 (Figure A5.1). This reflects in part the size of the economy, which limits the scope for
deep domestic capital markets. Moreover, the dominance of buy and hold investors in Peru leads
to a lack of liquidity, which raises the entry and exit hurdle into the stock market. The selective
nature of issuers—mainly companies in the mining sector—restricts the benefit of diversification
for investors. Corporate culture also plays a part in explaining why entities and controlling
shareholders are reluctant to relinquish control over firms. Finally, for medium-sized corporations
in Peru, banks provide capital in a more cost-efficient way than capital markets, given the
minimum amount needed for the issuance to be cost-effective.

Appendix 6: Fiscal and External Debt Sustainability
Analysis
Peru’s public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to decline under the baseline debt scenario to
below 20 percent of GDP. Economic growth will recover after the dip in 2009, and will reach
potential this year. Growth will average 6 percent a year in 2010–15 underpinned by domestic
demand dynamics and the global recovery. The public sector revenue-to-GDP ratio is expected to
increase by a cumulative 0.9 percentage points, reflecting the recovery in growth and mining
revenues. Under these assumptions, Peru’s public sector debt stock (including CRPAOs) would
decline from 27.4 percent of GDP at end-2009, to 19.7 percent of GDP by 2015.
External debt is projected to remain below 30 percent of GDP. The decline in external public
sector debt over the medium term (of about 5 percentage points of GDP) would be compensated
by a marginal increase in private sector external debt as financing conditions improve globally.
Given the recent declines in public external debt, total external debt is projected to diminish from
32 percent of GDP at end-2007 to 26 percent by 2015 (public external debt would decline from
18 percent to 11 percent over the same period).
Peru’s external and public sector debt ratios are robust to alternative assumptions about
underlying macroeconomic variables. Sensitivity tests based on 10-year historical standard
deviations for GDP growth and interest rates show that Peru’s debt dynamics are only moderately
vulnerable to such changes.
Despite the increasing share of public sector debt in domestic currency, external and
public debt ratios remain sensitive to large and permanent exchange rate shocks. Under a
one-off 30 percent real depreciation of the exchange rate, the external and public debt ratios
would increase by about 10 percentage points above the baseline projections over the medium
term. This test assumes that the exchange rate would remain at a depreciated level permanently,
which would occur if the current level of the exchange rate was significantly overvalued. CGER
estimates, however, indicate that the Sol is broadly in line with fundamentals. Noninterest current
account shocks (such as in the terms of trade) would have a moderate adverse impact on
external indebtedness.
A contingent liabilities shock to the public sector of 10 percent of GDP would increase
public debt by a similar amount over the medium term. The public debt ratio would rise
sharply in the short run and decline over the medium term. By 2015 the debt ratio would remain
9.6 percentage points above the baseline scenario.
The authorities are strongly committed to continue improving the debt profile through the
implementation of a proactive debt management strategy. Currency risks have declined
significantly in recent years, with the foreign currency share in total public debt declining from
94 percent in 2000 to less than 60 percent in 2009. In 2010, the authorities are targeting a decline
in the share of debt at fixed interest rate to 7080 percent, as well as extending the average
maturity of debt to 1112 years.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with Peru
On April, 14, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Peru.7
Background
Peru’s economic performance over the last decade has been impressive by domestic and
international standards. Strong economic fundamentals, a sound institutional policy framework,
and a solid track-record of prudent macroeconomic policies helped reduce vulnerabilities,
achieve record-high economic growth, and advance significantly with poverty reduction.
Reflecting on these achievements, Peru was granted investment grade by Fitch and Standard
& Poor’s in 2008 and by Moody’s at end-2009, consolidating its standing among major
emerging market economies. Peru’s medium-term prospects remain bright, linked to sustained
efforts in the implementation of an ambitious structural reform agenda.
Peru’s economic resilience during the global financial crisis was the result of the proactive
policy response and sound fundamentals. Growth in Peru decelerated sharply in 2009, due to
the global financial crisis, but remained positive at about 1 percent for the year, despite a few

7

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the

Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

months in negative territory. Thanks to the strong buffers built in recent years, Peru was able
to implement a significant monetary and fiscal policy response, which helped to avoid a credit
crunch, support domestic demand and sustain employment. The central bank injected
substantial liquidity in the financial system and lowered the policy rate to an historic low of
1.25 percent. A significant fiscal stimulus plan was introduced, which entailed a positive fiscal
impulse of about 2.5 percent of GDP in 2009. Peru’s financial sector proved resilient to the
global financial crisis thanks to the sound prudential framework put in place in past years and
its strong initial standing, and it has remained well-capitalized, liquid and profitable. Peru’s
external financial account showed also resilience to the global financial crisis, with a
resurgence of capital inflows and appreciation pressures in recent months. To moderate
currency volatility, the central bank has intervened in the foreign exchange market, purchasing
US$2.5 billion so far this year.
Economic activity is expected to grow strongly in 2010, with limited slack in resource utilization
thanks to the successful policy response. With the economy already gaining momentum, a
sustained improvement in global conditions and the remaining stimulus, staff projects growth
at 6.25 percent this year and 6 percent in 2011. Peru’s recovery appears less dependent on
policy support than in other advanced and emerging market economies, as it did not open a
significant output gap and the balance sheets of the corporate, household, and financial
sectors remain unimpaired. Moreover, the balance of risks to growth in Peru appears tilted to
the upside, linked to prospects of renewed capital inflows to strong emerging markets and
domestic demand dynamics, including the cyclical rebuilding of inventories and acceleration of
private investment projects put on hold last year. A relapse in global growth and a return of
global risk aversion are the principal tail risk that could encumber the growth outlook for Peru.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Peruvian authorities for their impressive track-record of
prudent macroeconomic policies which helped limit the impact of the global crisis and jump
start a vigorous economic rebound. Given its strong fundamentals, the economy is expected to
return to rapid growth. Peru’s medium–term outlook remains bright, supported by the
authorities’ ambitious reform agenda.
Directors noted that the balance of risks to Peru’s growth is tilted to the upside because of
domestic demand dynamics and renewed capital inflows. They agreed that, with limited slack
in resource utilization, these risks call for early withdrawal of policy stimulus to avoid a buildup
in inflationary pressures. Directors also noted that a renewed surge in capital inflows would
require close monitoring and would benefit from a strategy that focuses on fiscal consolidation
and greater exchange rate flexibility. Directors observed that normalizing monetary conditions
may rely on a combination of measures, including reserve requirements, along with macro–
prudential measures to prevent credit and asset booms.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to manage spending plans carefully to achieve in
2011 the fiscal deficit limit established by the Fiscal Responsibility and Transparency Law.
They supported the plans to strengthen the Oil Price Stabilization Fund (FEPC) for addressing
Staff Report Article IV 2010 Consultation-Peru

the rising liabilities and reducing fiscal risks. Directors also welcomed the authorities’ interest in
exploring ways to reduce pro-cyclicality of the fiscal framework.
Directors noted the progress made with de-dollarization over the last decade and agreed that
improved fundamentals would continue to advance this process and allow the exchange rate
to play a larger role as shock absorber. A gradual increase in currency flexibility could foster
the development of foreign exchange hedging instruments and reduce dollarization.
Directors commended the authorities’ resolve to further solidify Peru’s strong prudential
framework, with some regulatory norms ahead of international standards. The challenge would
be to reassess the framework in light of the moving international standards, and incorporate in
it the elements relevant for Peru. Directors noted that it would be important to continue
strengthening macro–prudential supervision. Consideration could be given to assessing the
scope for incorporating systemic risk into the regulatory framework, reviewing the crisis
resolution framework, and extending the prudential perimeter to cooperatives and public
financial institutions.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ ambitious reform agenda to preserve high growth over the
medium term, underpinned by continued prudent macroeconomic policies. The authorities’
plans to further develop Peru’s capital market would be key to effectively channel resources to
sustained capital formation over the long term. Directors encouraged the authorities to
continue with their poverty reduction efforts.

An off-site safeguards assessment of the central bank has been finalized and has found that
safeguards at the Banco Central de Reserva del Perú (BCRP) meet the requirements of the
safeguards policy.
VIII. Exchange Arrangements
Peru maintains a unified, floating exchange rate. The monetary authorities have in place an
inflation targeting framework. The Central Bank has established an inflation target of 2.0 percent,
with a tolerance margin of ±1 percent. On March 11, 2010, the average of interbank buying and
selling rates was 2.84 Nuevos Soles per U.S. dollar. The exchange system is free of restrictions,
except for those maintained solely for the preservation of national or international security, and
which have been notified to the Fund pursuant to Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51).
Those restrictions are maintain pursuant to UN Security Council Resolutions 1267 (October 15,
1999) and 1373 (September 28, 2001). The central government maintains small external
payment arrears to unguaranteed suppliers (US$11.7 million of principal and accrued interests as
of December 31, 2009). Peru has maintained a clearing arrangement with Malaysia since 1991.

FSAP, ROSCs, and AML/CFT

Several joint Fund-Bank missions visited Lima in the period September 2000–January 2001 to
conduct an FSAP for Peru. The corresponding FSSA report (SM/01/75 dated February 28, 2001)
was discussed by the Executive Board on March 12, 2001. A follow-up FSAP mission was
concluded in February 2005. In October 2002, an FAD mission conducted a Fiscal ROSC for
Peru, while an STA mission conducted a Data ROSC for Peru in February 2003.
The Fund is actively engaged with Peru in delivering technical assistance to the Superintendency
of Banks, Insurance and Pension Fund Companies (SBS) in the following areas: (i) developing
and/or strengthening of existing AML/CFT supervisory policies, practices, systems and tools
needed to identify, measure, monitor, and control ML/FT risks with the financial institutions under
the responsibility of the SBS; (ii) providing advice and assistance to SBS officials in addressing
organizational and operational issues of the newly created AML/CFT Unit, including the
identification of resources, both human and technological to facilitate the implementation of the
risk-based approach to AML/CFT supervision; and most recently (iii) initiating the process for
conducting a national risk assessment of ML/FT risks impacting Peru. So far, Peru has received
three TA missions and the TA program is expected to continue for the next 18 months.

Annex II. Peru: World Bank Relations
Bank Group Strategy
The World Bank Group support to Peru is defined in the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)
approved by the Board on December 19, 2006. The strategy supports the government’s
developmental goals with emphasis on inclusive growth and poverty reduction. The agenda
includes programs addressing fiscal, national competitiveness, infrastructure and social-sector
needs. The country strategy underscores partnerships, flexibility and results orientation in public
expenditure. The CPS projects financial assistance of up to US$3.5 billion between July 2007 and
June 2011 and envisages a flexible lending program. The strategy includes development policy
lending operations in the fiscal, social, and environmental sectors.
The CPS Progress Report discussed by the Board on February 17, 2009 showed progress in the
areas of fiscal management, sustained economic growth, and poverty reduction. New
government priorities have been included in the Bank’s program in response to changing
circumstances. The Bank responded rapidly to the Government’s request of contingent credit
lines to mitigate potential effects of the developing global crisis, with US$1.36 billion in DPLDDOs during FY 09. In addition, two investment lending operations in transport infrastructure and
water and sanitation sector, and a CAT DDO were included in the program during the preparation
of the CPS Progress Report. While the Program adjusted accordingly to the Government’s
financial needs, the overall medium term vision of the CPS continues to be relevant for Peru.
Peru’s current lending portfolio includes 19 active projects with a commitment of US$1.9 billion
and an undisbursed balance of US$1.5 billion. The portfolio includes fourteen investment loans,
three DPL/DDOs and two GEF grants. The areas covered by the existing portfolio are economic
policy, environment, social protection, transport infrastructure, water resources, among others.
The Board has approved four new operations during FY 10, including two programmatic DPLs in
the fiscal and environmental sectors for US$200 million and two investment operations in water
resources management and transport infrastructure for US$160 million. In the remaining of the
FY 2010, three investment operations in the areas of nutrition, justice services improvement, and
agriculture irrigation are expected to be submitted to the Board for approval.
FY 2011 pipeline comprises eleven operations for a total of US$685 million. It includes three
DPLs in the fiscal, environmental, and social sectors for US$275 million, one CAT DDO for
US$75 million, and seven investment lending operations in the areas of agriculture, education,
water and sanitation, and rural electrification for US$335 million.
In addition, the Bank has an extensive program of analytical and advisory activities for FY 1011,
including both economic and sector work and non-lending technical assistance. The economic
and sector work covers areas such as public expenditure, infrastructure, gas development
strategy, decentralization, labor markets, social sectors, climate change, and housing and
municipal financing. Several multi-year non-lending technical assistance are currently in progress,
Informational Annex - Staff Report Article IV 2010 Consultation-Peru

covering areas such as governance and governability enhancement, poverty monitoring, and
performance informed budgeting. In addition, non-lending technical assistance in education,
nutrition, governance, disasters risk management, and natural resources management are
planned for delivery in FY 10FY 11.

Bank-Fund Collaboration in Specific Areas
Tax Reform and Fiscal Decentralization. Fund staff has taken the lead in assisting in the
design of tax reform. Jointly with the World Bank and IDB, staff has worked on drafting laws and
regulations for fiscal decentralization. The World Bank has also focused on the design and
implementation of decentralization of the social sectors and pro-poor spending policies.
Financial Sector. A joint FSAP was completed in May 2001. Follow up technical assistance to
implement FSAP recommendations has been given by both institutions. A joint FSAP update was
completed in June 2005.
Public Sector Management. Bank-Fund collaboration has focused in the area of results based
budgeting, the implementation of a Treasury Single Account and modernization of budget
processes, institutions and information systems.
Customs Administration Modernization: A needs assessment mission was undertaken
together with the IMF to develop an action plan for modernizing customs administration. The joint
team presented a technical report to SUNAT.
Reform of the National Public Investment System (SNIP). The Bank has been working in
close collaboration with the authorities in reducing the institutional bottlenecks of the public
investment system. A joint WB-IADB mission took place in March 2007 to revise current
government procurement regulations. The Bank is also providing technical assistance in the
design of the framework law for Public-Private Partnerships as well as in the implementation of
FONIPREL.

Annex III. Peru: Relations with the Inter-American Development Bank
Country Strategy
The Country Strategy for 20072011 continues the thrust of Bank assistance in areas relating to
competitiveness, social development, and modernization of the State, and reflects wide-ranging
discussions of policies with the Government and with Peruvian society to identify the constraints
the country faces in achieving its development objectives.
The IDB supports Peru’s development agenda by deepening the country’s sustainable economic
growth and generating greater opportunities for the majority of Peruvians, through efforts grouped
into the following three strategic pillars: (i) strengthening Peru’s participation in the global
economy and enhancing competitiveness; (ii) promoting social development and economic
inclusion; and (iii) deepening the reform of the State and improving public sector management.
More recently, government demands for IDB interventions have been linked to environmental
sustainability. These operations have been grouped in what may be called the “green cluster”,
including interventions in water and sanitation, solid waste, energy, climate change, natural
disasters and agriculture.

Lending
As of January 31, 2010, the Bank’s portfolio of active, public sector operations consisted of
25 loans for a total amount of US$793 million, of which US$255 million (32.1 percent) had been
disbursed. The public sector lending program for 2010 comprises seven policy-based loans for
US$252 million and six investment loans for US$133 million, all of them pending approval.
Regarding private sector operations, the Structured Corporate Finance Department’s portfolio in
execution consists of four A-loans and two B-loans amounting to US$470 million and
US$415 million, respectively. There are also five credit guarantee operations for US$165 million
(includes the Trade Finance Facilitation Program). These operations are focused primarily in the
financial, natural gas and renewable energy sectors. By the end of January, about 65 percent of
this portfolio had been disbursed. At the moment, private sector lending for 2010 includes two
projects.
To assist Government efforts to de-dollarize public sector debt, the Bank successfully converted
US$131 million of previously disbursed loans into local currency in 2008. The Government also
requested to modify 23 loan contracts, converting their interest rates from variable LIBOR-based
to fixed rates in 2009. This modification represented an opportunity to reduce volatility and debt
service payments.

Annex IV. Peru: Statistical Issues
Macroeconomic statistics are broadly adequate for policy formulation and surveillance. Peru
subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). A data ROSC was prepared and
published in 2003.
Despite progress in recent years, there is scope for improvement in the following areas:
(i) coordination among the agencies that compile official statistics to avoid duplication of efforts
and confusion among users; (ii) implementing a new benchmark and base year for GDP;
(iii) expanding the coverage of the wholesale price index to include mining, oil and gas extraction,
electricity and water, public transportation, and communication; (iv) finalizing the migration to the
standardized report forms for monetary data, with the introduction of report forms for the central
bank, other depository corporations, and other financial corporations; and (v) expanding the
scope of data sources for compiling financial flows of individual residents.

I.

Real Sector and Prices

The authorities published a revised GDP series in 2000. The series used the 1994 benchmark
estimates as the base year, and included input-output tables. However, due to limited availability
of periodic source data, estimates after 1994 are largely based on extrapolation techniques. The
lack of current detailed tables for supply and use hampers the reconciliation of discrepancies. As
a result, changes in inventories are mainly determined as a residual. Although the quarterly
accounts have benefited from some improvements in the timeliness of monthly production
indices, coverage is still very limited. The National Statistics Office (INEI) is working on a new
national account series implementing the 1993 SNA and using 2007 as the base year. Three
national accounts statistics missions visited the country in November 2008, May 2009, and
September 2009. The missions are assisting the authorities in compiling the complete set of
national accounts by institutional sectors, and in developing the sequence of accounts of
nonfinancial corporations. More technical assistance will be needed in the coming years.
Expenditure weights of the CPI (2009=100) for the Metropolitan area of Lima were derived from
the 20082009 household budget survey. Source data are timely and consistent with the
technical requirements for producing the index. The coverage of owner-occupied housing,
however, was eliminated from the Metropolitan Lima index through the exclusion of imputed rent,
a deviation from international practices. As concerns the WPI, statistical techniques used to
compile the index generally follow international standards. The weights for the WPI are outdated,
and were derived from the 1994 input-output table and other reports and publications of relevant
ministries.
The authorities monitor labor market developments using four indicators: open unemployment,
underemployment, employment, and remunerations. The quality of the indicators has improved
over recent years. Monthly wage data for the Metropolitan area of Lima is timely, but for other
areas come with a relatively long delay; the nationwide unemployment and underemployment

Informational Annex - Staff Report Article IV 2010 Consultation-Peru

10

situation is surveyed quarterly; and monthly employment indices for the private sector and the
government are available and are relatively timely.

II. Fiscal Sector
Institutional coverage and classification of the government finance statistics (GFS) still follow the
GFS Manual 1986. For the consolidated central government, revenues are compiled on a cash
basis, while expenditures are compiled on an accrual basis. The authorities have sent to the Fund
information on the components of consolidated central government expenditures by function. The
coverage of published national budget data is narrower than the fiscal statistics prepared for the
combined public sector. The authorities have prepared a plan to migrate to the GFS Manual
2001, preparing a new budgetary classification and chart of accounts aligned to the GFSM 2001
methodology. The new budget aligned to GFSM 2001 was used for the 2009 budget processing.
However, there are still problems of coordination of GFS compiling units in the Ministry of Finance
and in the central bank. Although the authorities report data for publication in the Government
Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) using the GFSM 2001, they do not report high frequency
data for publication in International Financial Statistics (IFS) using this methodology.

III. Monetary Sector
The central bank (BCRP) compiles and publishes the analytical accounts of the central bank,
depository corporations, and financial corporations broadly in line with the methodology
recommended by the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. The main discrepancies are the
exclusion of the deposits of other financial corporations, state and local governments, and public
nonfinancial corporations from the definition of broad money; and valuation of some financial
instruments at cost rather than at market prices. At the request of the authorities, a mission
visited the country in January 2007 to assist with the migration to the new standardized report
forms (SRFs) for reporting monetary data to the IMF. The mission finalized the SRF for the
central bank, recommending improvements in the classification and sectorization of some
accounts. A follow-up mission took place in September 2008. The mission completed the work on
the SRF for the central bank and developed a bridge table linking the source data reported by
banks to the BCRP to the report form 2SR (other depository corporations). The mission identified
shortcomings in the management of the database that generate the accounts of the other
depository corporations sector at the BCRP. Although the two technical assistant missions
finalized the groundwork for the migration to the SRFs, the BCRP is in the process of revising
historical data for form 2SR, and will report to the Fund using the SRFs when the revision is
completed.

IV. External Sector
The BCRP prepares quarterly data on the balance of payments and international investment
position largely in line with the recommendations of the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments
Manual (BPM5). Data are reported to the Fund for publication in the IFS and the Balance of
Payments Statistics Yearbook. Departures from BPM5 include the lack of coverage of assets held
Informational Annex - Staff Report Article IV 2010 Consultation-Peru

11

abroad and land acquisition abroad by residents; and not recording on an accrual basis some
external debt transactions.
The BCRP has been reporting since August 2001 weekly data on international reserves in
accordance with the Operational Guidelines for Data Template on International Reserves and
Foreign Currency Liquidity. Since August 2006, the BCRP is including the full amount of the
liquidity requirements in the reserve template both under official reserve assets and as a
contingent net drain (as specified in Section III of the Data Template). Peru disseminates
quarterly data on external debt with an eight week lag on the National Summary Data Page with a
hyperlink to the Fund’s website.

Peru: Table of Common Indicators Required for Surveillance

Statement by Pablo Pereira, Executive Director for Peru and Oscar Hendrick, Advisor
to the Executive Director
April 14, 2010
Key Points
•
The resilience of the Peruvian economy has been successfully tested once again
by the worst financial crisis in recent history. At end-2009, Peru was granted investment
grade by Moody’s, joining Fitch and Standard & Poor’s, consolidating its standing among
major emerging market economies.
•
Overall, macro-economic indicators are very good. Growth was positive in
2009, inflation expectations are well anchored within the inflation target of 2 percent, the
external position is very strong, with NIR in excess of four times the total short-term
external debt on a residual maturity basis, and the financial system remains very liquid,
profitable, and well regulated. The public debt is one of the lowest among emerging
markets, and is set to decline below 20 percent by 2015.
•
This favorable outcome reflects the strong economic fundamentals after two
decades of continuity in the implementation of sound economic policies; key structural
reforms, and a very proactive policy response by the Peruvian authorities to deal with the
recent financial crisis.
•
The economic outlook remains very favorable. The Peruvian economy is set for
a strong rebound in 2010 and robust economic growth thereafter. The possibility of a
higher and sustained level of capital inflows, and domestic demand pressures derived from
higher-than-expected growth could pose certain challenges to fiscal and monetary policy.
The authorities are taking preventive actions and they are confident in their ability to
manage the challenges of their economic success.
•
Nevertheless, many challenges and risks remain. Poverty is still relatively high,
despite substantial progress achieved in recent years, and risks to g lobal recovery remain a
factor that could undermine external demand and induce higher volatility in commodity
prices.

INTRODUCTION
1. Our Peruvian authorities would like to express their gratitude to Management and
the staff for the open and constructive policy dialogue, and for their excellent
work. The report provides a fair and well-balanced description and analysis of recent
economic developments and policy discussions. Our authorities are in broad
agreement with the staff’s assessment and policy recommendations. We are grateful
for the comprehensive set of selected issues papers, which provide interesting insights
into relevant economic topics. We appreciate the focus on the consultation on the exit

2
strategy from policy stimulus and the challenges to handle economic success,
including possible large and sustained capital inflows. The authorities consent to the
publication of the staff report.
2. Peru is looking for new and proactive ways to engage the Fund as a partner and as
a client of the Fund’s accumulated cross-country experience. As a partner, Peru has
volunteered to be part of pilot on innovating Article IV consultations to help improve
the consultation process, including a timely Board discussion of the mission findings
and timely disclosure to the markets. Peru is a very active participant in the Fund’s
lending activities through the Financial Transaction Plan, and it has renewed its
commitment to poorer countries by contributing to the Poverty Reduction and Growth
Trust Fund. As a client, Peru is currently receiving technical assistance to strengthen
the existing AML/CFT, and has requested a new FSAP update, scheduled for the
fourth quarter of 2010 (Peru was one of the first countries to volunteer in the original
FSAP pilot program back in 2000, and an FSAP update was undertaken in February
2005).
RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
3. The Peruvian economy continued to perform well in 2009, despite the lingering
effects of the worst financial crisis in recent history. Although growth was in the
negative territory during the first half of the year, the successful implementation of
contracyclical monetary and fiscal policies led to a fast recovery in the second half of
the year ending in real GDP growth close to 1.0 percent. In the fourth quarter of 2009,
the economy grew over 15 percent (seasonally adjusted and annualized). This was
one of the shortest economic cycles in the last 30 years in Peru, both in entering into
the crisis and exiting from it (a total of four quarters). Net international reserves grew
to US$ 33 billion, equivalent to some 13 months of imports of goods and services, 80
percent of broad money, and 412 percent of short-term external debt on a maturity
basis. In addition, despite the deterioration in the terms of trade, the external current
account had a small surplus. FDI flows remained strong, more than compensating for
portfolio and short-term outflows. In 2009, due to favorable market conditions, Peru
issued a US$ 2 billion debt for pre-financing operations and repayment of Paris Club
debt.
4. The authorities’ decisive and proactive fiscal response to the crisis was possible
thanks to the strong buffers built in recent years during the economic boom. A
substantial fiscal stimulus—equivalent to around 2½ percent of GDP—was largely
financed with fiscal savings. Government expenditure was focused on infrastructure
and poverty alleviation to boost growth potential, while preserving the gains attained
in poverty reduction and employment creation. The authorities were successful in
increasing public investment to close to 6 percent of GDP—up from an annual
average of 3 percent in the last decade, with the additional impulse from the fiscal
stimulus plan. Public investment is expected to remain at this level in the medium
term, contributing to a higher potential output. The public debt is expected to
continue its declining trend and reach a level below 20 percent by 2015, one of the
lowest in the region and among emerging markets.

3
5. The Central Bank’s swift policy response was instrumental to limit spillovers from
the global financial crisis. The central bank provided ample liquidity in soles and
dollars, helping to maintain orderly financial conditions during the peak of the crisis,
preventing a liquidity squeeze. It has also reduced its policy rate by 525 bps since
early 2009 to a historic low level of 1¼ percent. Lending rates to the private sector
also declined to historical low levels, in line with the policy rate. Inflation fell to near
zero by end-2009, but core inflation declined to near 2 percent, the mid-point of the
target range. As conditions have stabilized, the central bank has started to reverse
some of the measures to inject liquidity.
6. The Free Trade Agreement with China went into effect on March 1, 2010 and
similar arrangements with Korea, Japan, and other countries are underway. The
agreement with the European Union is almost complete and final legal details are
being revised. These new agreements, together with the FTA signed with the United
States last year, are expected to continue to encourage investment, higher export
growth and diversification.
7. The 2010 outlook is promising. Early economic indicators, such as electricity
consumption and construction activity, point to a strong economic rebound in 2010.
The latest WEO projection has real GDP growing at 6¼ percent in 2010 but the
authorities have a somewhat more conservative forecast of 5½ percent, which is more
in line with market expectations. The consolidation of the investment grade by the
three major rating agencies is expected to further reduce the financing cost for the
public and the private sector. Inflation expectations remain well anchored, and all
market surveys point to an easy compliance with the central bank target of 2 percent
in 2010 and beyond. The authorities concur with the staff that the balance of risks to
growth is tilted to the upside, and that a new wave of capital inflows may take place.
Nonetheless, they are confident that they have the toolkit to deal with it.
THE EXIT STRATEGY AND THE MEDIUM-TERM CHALLENGES
8. The Peruvian authorities agree with the staff on the timing and sequencing of the
withdrawal of policy stimulus. In particular, they are already taking the first steps
towards the consolidation of the fiscal stance, prior to the tightening of the monetary
policy. However, they will carefully monitor the dynamics of the private sector
activity to avoid undermining economic recovery. Under the baseline scenario, the
authorities intent to gradually reduce the fiscal deficit, and return to the 1.0 percent of
GDP deficit limit established by the Fiscal Responsibility and Transparency Law in
2011. They agree with the importance of safeguarding the quality of public
investment projects, and the need to preserve the fiscal cushions. As the staff
indicates, Peru has room for additional fiscal stimulus in case of the risk of a relapse
in global growth.
9. On monetary and exchange rate policy, the central bank stands ready to adjust the
current policy stance and use its toolkit in tandem with the speed of economic
recovery. The credibility of the central bank has contributed significantly to the
resilience and stability of the Peruvian economy. Among the option at its disposal, the

4
reserve requirements have proved to be an effective tool in Peru’s dollarized economy
during the period of abundant global liquidity and capital inflows. These measures
were reversed during the global financial crisis (Appendix 2 of the staff report), and
could again increase in tandem with expected higher economic activity. Although, the
central bank has kept its policy rate at 1¼ percent in its recent March 2010 review, it
will closely monitor developments for any signs of inflationary pressures, and will
take action as needed. On the exchange rate, our authorities agree with the staff’s
assessment that the real effective exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals.
They underscored that the central bank is committed to a floating exchange rate and,
as in the past, they noted that intervention policy has been focused on smoothing out
volatility of the exchange rate, and the potential negative balance sheet effects in the
context of a still highly dollarized economy.
10. The framework for crisis management and resolution has been strengthened, but
the authorities are proactively taking steps to incorporate the lessons from the
global financial crisis. Peru’s regulatory and supervisory framework includes
features such as dynamic provisioning and risk management practices that are ahead
of international standards. They have established additional capital requirements like
the assessment (stress testing) and risk of borrowers’ foreign exchange credit risk,
which will become effective in July 2010. Steps to improve macro-prudential
supervision have been taken and the outcome is constantly being monitored by the
Coordination Committee, comprising of senior officials from the Ministry of Finance,
the central bank, and the Superintendency of Banks, Insurance and Pensions. The
central bank is currently organizing a conference with local and international
participants on Macro Prudential regulations scheduled to take place in July.
11. The authorities regard the development of domestic capital markets as a high
priority. A liquid and well-developed domestic capital market will enhance the
effectiveness in channeling resources in the economy. In particular, the development
of instruments in domestic currency would be instrumental in reducing further
financial dollarization, and creating room for greater exchange rate flexibility in the
future. Our authorities are grateful for the Fund’s assistance in developing the
mortgage market in local currency through the creation of a covered bond instrument,
and repo and interest swap markets to further facilitate lending in domestic currency.
The authorities are also revamping the functions of the Security and Exchange
Commission to promote access to the domestic capital market.
12. Poverty reduction is still a challenge, despite the substantial progress attained so
far, and the successful efforts to protect this gain in 2009 despite the marked
decline in the rate of economic growth. The fiscal stimulus plan helped sustain
employment and protected social spending. The authorities will continue with their
social programs for poverty alleviation, but they are convinced that the best answer is
to maintain the momentum of economic growth, persevere with sound economic
policies, and continue working on their structural reform agenda.
