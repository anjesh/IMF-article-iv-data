STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
November 1, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Background. Mexico’s growth has remained resilient, supported by both external and
domestic demand, nearly closing the output gap opened during the global crisis.
Mexico’s strong economic performance, despite the sluggish U.S. recovery and
persistent global uncertainty associated with Europe, attests to its strong fundamentals
and sound policy management. Economic activity is expected to moderate towards
potential growth. Inflationary pressures have been contained and inflation expectations
remain anchored, despite the recent uptick in headline inflation due to higher food
prices. The exchange rate has fluctuated significantly, related to bouts of global risk
aversion, but with no major balance sheet or pass-through effects. The authorities’
policies have aimed to balance supporting the recovery and gradually rebuilding policy
space, given heightened global risks.
Risks. Short-term risks are mainly associated with unsettled external conditions, with
longer-term risks linked principally to domestic structural challenges. A significant U.S.
slowdown or renewed global financial turmoil from Europe would affect Mexico, given
its close integration with the U.S. economy and international capital markets. Longerterm issues include the need to advance reforms to boost growth and to address fiscal
challenges associated with diminishing oil revenues and spending pressures from health
and pensions.
Policy Challenges. With Mexico operating close to potential but external risks looming
large, discussions focused on the importance of: (i) maintaining an appropriate policy
stance (from a cyclical perspective) and policy mix (to continue rebuilding fiscal policy
buffers); and (ii) weighing contingent policy responses to global downside risks. The
ongoing fiscal consolidation is welcome, but stepping up consolidation efforts would be
important to restore Mexico’s fiscal buffers to pre-crisis levels. The end of oil windfalls
would pose challenges for fiscal policy, making this more difficult. The monetary
authorities’ vigilance over recent supply shocks and cyclical conditions is warranted at
the current juncture.

MEXICO

Overall, current and incoming authorities emphasized policy continuity, stressing that it
is underpinned by the strong consensus in Mexico about macroeconomic stability.
Were downside risks to materialize, exchange rate flexibility should continue to play a
key buffering role. The policy room to contain the fallout would greatly depend on the
extent to which global financial stresses spill over to Mexico. In the event of a significant
U.S. slowdown, monetary policy and automatic stabilizers could be used to cushion the
impact of the real spillover. In the event of a surge in global risk aversion and
consequent general pullback from emerging markets, the policy space to contain the
fallout would be more constrained. However, Mexico has significant foreign exchange
buffers to deploy if necessary to limit overshooting and dysfunctional market conditions.
Addressing Mexico’s longer-term challenges would require decisive action on structural
reforms. Tax and subsidy reforms, including revenue mobilization efforts, would be
essential to address future pressures from declining oil revenues and population aging.
Structural reforms to unleash Mexico’s growth potential would benefit from a broad
approach, whereby energy reform is accompanied by, inter alia, competition, labor and
education reforms to ensure that productivity gains accrue to all sectors.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Mexico’s strong economic performance, despite the sluggish recovery in U.S. GDP and
persistent uncertainty from Europe, attests to its strong fundamentals and sound policy
management. The strength and resilience of the recovery after the global crisis have been
underpinned by Mexico’s sound balance sheets, strong policy frameworks, and skillful
macroeconomic management. Mexico’s recognition as a predictable and prudently managed
economy, as well as its open capital and current accounts, market-friendly and transparent
regulations for foreign investment, and deep and liquid financial markets, have bolstered large
foreign investment in recent years. Amid persistent global financial uncertainty, the successive
Flexible Credit Line (FCL) arrangements have supported Mexico’s economic policies by providing a
significant buffer against tail risks. The Executive Board commended Mexico’s very strong policy
track record and frameworks in the 2011 Article IV consultation and the last review of the FCL
arrangement.
2.
Mexico’s growth has been resilient, supported by both external and domestic demand,
helping to close the output gap. Growth in 2011 and 2012 has remained above potential and is
expected to help close the output gap that opened during the global crisis (Figure 1). Since the
crisis, Mexico has benefited from the relatively good performance of the U.S. manufacturing sector
(which has grown faster than U.S. GDP) and achieved a strong recovery of its market share in that
market, particularly vis-à-vis China (see Chapter 2 of the Selected Issues paper). The gain in market
share in the U.S. has come in part from improved relative unit labor costs (ULCs) and a continued
flow of foreign direct investment into manufacturing, especially in the automotive sector.1 In turn,
domestic demand has been supported by sustained growth in employment and credit, underpinned
by investors’ and consumers’ recognition of Mexico’s resilience.
3.
Inflationary pressures have remained contained thus far, despite the recent uptick in
headline inflation associated with higher food prices. The increase in agricultural prices has
driven headline inflation above the 4 percent ceiling of the inflation targeting range (Figure 2). While
core inflation has also risen slightly, it remains within the target range, particularly in services,
suggesting limited demand pressures so far.2 Amid relatively slack labor market conditions until
now, wage pressures have remained subdued.3 Headline inflation developments are broadly viewed
as temporary and supply-driven, with medium-term inflation expectations remaining firmly
anchored, albeit slightly above the mid-level of the target range.
1

ULC in Mexico measured in pesos have shown a declining trend since early 2009. This is related to the containment
of wage increases due to lower migration to the U.S. since the mid-2000s and a strong increase in manufacturing
sector productivity. Other factors explaining the recouping of U.S. market share include the reemergence of a
location advantage due to higher oil prices and transport costs, and a reassessment of additional benefits from
relocating to Mexico (including the protection of proprietary technologies).

2
The spike in non-core inflation has been driven by both external factors (international corn prices) as well as
domestic factors (eggs and poultry prices linked to a bird flu outbreak, and vegetable prices linked to a drought).

3

Following the global crisis, employment has experienced a significant and sustained recovery, but with the increase
in labor participation from lower migration to the U.S., the urban unemployment rate (at about 5¾ percent) has
remained somewhat above its pre-crisis level (4½ percent at end-2007). See Chapter 5 of the Selected Issues paper.

The exchange rate has fluctuated substantially, linked to the recurrent bouts of global
risk aversion, but without major balance sheet or pass-through effects. Exchange rate flexibility
has been a key shock absorber, while sovereign and financial markets have remained stable,
including the banking sector and domestic subsidiaries of Spanish banks. Capital inflows have
continued, from an increasingly diversified investor base, particularly into local-currency sovereign
paper and across the whole yield curve.4 During the periods of high global uncertainty in 2011 and
2012, foreign investors responded mainly by covering currency exposures rather than divesting from
government paper (Figure 3). These shifts to cover currency positions induced significant exchange
rate volatility, but interest rates on government bonds remained stable through this period. To try to
4

In 2012, foreign investment into short-term government paper (CETES) has increased by US$13 billion and into
longer-duration government bonds by US$18 billion. In all, foreign investors currently hold about one third of the
outstanding stock of local-currency government bonds.

reduce excessive daily currency volatility, the authorities introduced a new FX rule last November,
selling U.S. dollars when the peso depreciates more than 2 percent in any given day; this is
considered to have had an important signaling effect but has been used only sporadically.5
5.
Mexico’s external position has remained sound. The Fund’s current account models and a
range of exchange rate metrics suggest that the external position and real exchange rate are
consistent with underlying fundamentals and desirable policy settings (see Annex 1). The balanced
recovery in activity has meant that the current account deficit has remained moderate at about
1 percent of GDP (Figure 4). Given Mexico’s rule-based reserve accumulation policy, the central bank
bought US$16 billion in the first three quarters of 2012, with the bulk coming from Pemex’s net FX
balance; international reserves now amount to US$166 billion. At the same time, capital inflows have
increased the stock of foreign portfolio liabilities by US$48 billion in the first half of 2012, to
US$355 billion (30 percent of GDP).
6.
Credit conditions have remained supportive of domestic demand. The banking system,
including the domestic subsidiaries of Spanish banks, has been shielded so far from unsettled
external conditions. Underpinned by strong capital and liquidity ratios, bank credit has continued to
expand at a healthy pace (about 10 percent in real terms), sustaining the recovery that started in
2010, particularly through consumer and corporate lending.6 Market access conditions for
corporates have remained favorable, with spreads near historic lows. Despite some concerns from
the large presence of Spanish banks in Mexico, lending by these institutions has continued
unabated; any potential future divestment by these banks is expected to have limited effects in
Mexico, as other financial institutions are anticipated to fill the space left.7

5

The new rule stipulates that the Central Bank stands ready to sell up to US$400 million on any day that the peso
depreciates more than 2 percent from the previous closing. At the same time, the authorities stopped their monthly
auctioning of options to buy foreign exchange (for an equivalent to US$600 million per month), which had been
established in February 2010.
6

Bank NPLs have remained broadly stable at about 2 percent of assets for the system as a whole.

7

Santander, the fourth largest bank in Mexico, recently conducted a successful IPO equivalent to 25 percent of the
capital of its local subsidiary (about US$4 billion) and BBVA, the second largest bank, has announced plans to sell its
stake in the pension administration business.

The policy stance has judiciously balanced the need to support the recovery while
gradually rebuilding policy buffers in the context of heightened global risks. Mexico has
continued to implement sound economic policies. Together with the flexible exchange rate regime,
the policy mix—combining a gradual fiscal consolidation with stimulative monetary policy—has
helped Mexico cope with capital inflows:


Monetary policy. The policy rate has been maintained at 4½ percent since 2009, equivalent to
an (ex-ante) real interest rate of about ½ percent, with medium-term inflation expectations
remaining firmly anchored (Figure 2).



Fiscal policy. Continuing the fiscal consolidation that began after the fiscal stimulus during the
crisis, the structural primary deficit is expected to fall by about 1 percent in 2012—and thus
return to balance. The consolidation efforts have helped stabilize public debt at around
43 percent of GDP (Figure 5).



Exchange rate. Mexico’s exchange rate flexibility has continued to play a key buffering role
during the repeated bouts of global risk aversion. The central bank’s rule-based intervention
policy has sought to limit excess currency volatility. The peso has depreciated nearly 10 percent
with respect to the U.S. dollar over the last year.

8.
A new administration will take office in December. Mr. Enrique Peña Nieto (PRI) was
elected president last July with nearly 40 percent of the vote and will take office on December 1.
Since no party has a majority in congress, the new administration will need to marshal support to
pursue its reform agenda. Among his closing acts in office, President Calderon (PAN) introduced two
reform projects to congress in September—a labor reform to flexibilize labor markets and a public
transparency initiative to improve information and monitoring of subnational governments—that
were approved with PRI support (see Box 2). Mr. Peña Nieto’s reform priorities, expressed during the
campaign, also include: (i) opening up the energy sector to private investment; (ii) a tax reform to
increase public revenues; and (iii) reforms to foster competition.

Box 1. Mexico: Corporate Sector Financial Position
Mexico’s corporate sector appears resilient to potential adverse shocks, including a sudden
depreciation of the exchange rate or a spike in interest rates.1 Median leverage ratios, while
increasing slightly from their pre-crisis levels, are contained at 49 percent, below those of comparator
countries. Short-term maturity exposures have continued to decline and are below the levels observed
before the Lehman crisis. On-balance sheet currency mismatches, as measured by the difference
between foreign currency debt and natural hedges (export revenues) as a percent of total liabilities,
have fallen steadily and by the first quarter of 2012 reached the lowest point in the last 20 years (see
Figure). Average interest coverage ratios, defined as operating profits to gross interest expenses, have
also improved and remain at comfortable levels.2
There is no evidence of a build-up of systemic risk from foreign exchange derivative positions in
the corporate sector, based on first quarter information reported by the firms. Following the large
losses at the end of 2008 by a number of large corporations from speculative derivative positions,
supervisory agencies introduced stricter reporting and disclosure requirements on financial derivative
instruments and their associated exposures. All publicly listed firms and those issuing bonds are now
required to provide in their quarterly financial statements detailed information about financial
derivative operations and potential losses under adverse scenarios. Authorities are closely monitoring
compliance with disclosure requirements by market participants.3 At present, there are 60 firms
reporting derivative positions, including several that suffered losses in the past. Since 2008, firms have
become more conservative in their use of derivatives and there appears to be no concentration of risk
exposures associated with derivative instruments. Nevertheless, vigilance is important, particularly in a
low-volatility and high global liquidity environment where are increased incentives for search for yield
and risk taking.

Box 2. Mexico: Recent Reforms of Labor Market Regulations and Reporting of
Subnational Government Finances
In the final days of his administration, President Calderon (PAN) introduced two reform initiatives: a labor reform
to flexibilize labor markets (which is in the final stage of approval by Congress) and the modification of the
General law of Government Accounting that improves reporting of data at the subnational level.
The labor reform bill would overhaul labor laws dating back to 1970. The new legislation introduces flexible
modalities for hiring and dismissal, streamlines dispute resolution, promotes incentives for productivity, regulates
outsourcing practices and improves labor conditions. Specifically, the law introduces:



New types of temporary employment contracts, which can be defined per project, for a specific period of
time, per season, on a trial basis and/or for training purposes. All these categories will accrue wages, social
security and other benefits;



Hourly pay contracts, provided that the pay is not below the equivalent of the minimum wage;



Provisions to streamline the settlement of labor lawsuits and to limit compensation for unjustified
dismissals to one year of salary. These provisions would simplify the current lengthy dispute resolution
process (which can hold up severance pay for several years) and provide more legal certainty;



More flexible seniority rules, including productivity and labor skills as criteria for promotion. The law
recognizes training as the most important factor for increasing productivity and establishes a National
Committee for Productivity;



New social protection guarantees that formally ban child labor under 14 years of age and promote gender
equality at work. The reform also improves labor conditions for mining, rural, and domestic workers, and
provides for five days of paid paternity leave;



A new regulatory framework for outsourcing, banning the transfer of the majority of workers in a firm to
an outsourcing company in order to reduce labor benefits.

The Law on Government Accounting harmonizes the reporting, and enhances the transparency, of
subnational finances. The transparency law introduces a common template for reporting financial and budgetary
information at the state and municipal levels, which will have to be published on a quarterly basis. The main
provisions of the law include:



Subnational governments will be required to publish all financial information (revenues, expenditures,
debt and financing sources) in a detailed and homogenous format. Budget expenditures, in particular,
should include expenditure priorities and a detailed breakdown of current and investment outlays (including
wages and pensions). The reporting of public debt should contain all obligations, including short-term
supplier credit. Local governments will also need to make public the norms that govern the process of
preparing and approving the revenue and expenditure laws.



Financial information is to be published quarterly and posted on the internet for at least six years.



Local governments will also need to enhance the accountability of their public programs. They are
required to provide specific information on beneficiaries of public programs, and the indicators used to
evaluate their performance. Beneficiary payments will need to be done electronically through bank accounts.



Stiffer penalties for government officials. Public servants who fail to fulfill the law will incur severe
penalties, including prison.

MEXICO

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
9.
Growth is expected to moderate towards Mexico’s potential rate next year. Growth in
2013 is envisaged to converge to 3½ percent, close to Mexico’s long-term potential growth rate.
Despite a subdued U.S. recovery, external demand is still expected to contribute moderately next
year, while domestic demand is envisaged to maintain its momentum underpinned by sustained
business and consumer confidence. High capacity utilization rates suggest that the recovery in fixed
investment will continue, while favorable credit conditions and sustained employment growth
should help underpin consumption. As food price shocks dissipate, headline inflation is expected to
revert towards the middle of the inflation target range.
10.
Short-term risks are associated mainly with unsettled external conditions, while
longer-term risks are linked to Mexico’s structural challenges. The short-term balance of risks is
tilted to the downside, linked to the global environment:


Slowdown in the U.S. Despite Mexico’s strong economic performance since the global crisis, a
significant U.S. slowdown would be a major drag on growth due to its close integration with the
U.S. economy, particularly the manufacturing sector.



Heightened global risk aversion. Given high integration with international capital markets, a
surge in global risk aversion from an intensification of the crisis in Europe could affect even
strong sovereigns like Mexico. A generalized pullback from the emerging market asset class
would be a material risk, due to the substantial equity and debt portfolio holdings of foreign
investors (30 percent of GDP), including short-term government paper. The large presence of
Spanish banks in Mexico also represents a risk. However, the subsidiary model (with high levels
of required capital, exposure limits, and reliance on a broad and stable domestic deposit base in
local currency) as well as effective supervisory oversight (as noted in the December 2011 FSAP
Update) would help contain spillovers from potential shocks to the parent banks. Moreover, any
deleveraging or divestment is considered likely to be offset in part by other financial institutions
taking the opportunity to expand in the profitable Mexican market.



Structural reforms. Longer-term challenges for Mexico arise from the need of reforms to
address pressures from a decline in oil revenues and increasing health and pension spending. In
turn, a decisive implementation of productivity-enhancing structural reforms could provide
considerable upside to Mexico’s growth outlook.

KEY POLICY ISSUES
11.
With Mexico operating close to potential but external risks looming large, policy
discussions focused on: (i) the appropriate policy stance (from a cyclical perspective) and
policy mix (to restore Mexico’s fiscal buffers); and (ii) contingent policy responses if global
downside risks materialize. The policy stance and mix have been broadly appropriate and,
combined with the flexible exchange rate, have helped cope with capital inflows amid lax monetary
conditions in advanced economies. Discussions on policies going forward centered on:


Under the baseline scenario: the need to continue with consolidation efforts to restore
Mexico’s fiscal buffers to pre-crisis levels (given that the potential for global shocks remains
high); the challenges for monetary policy to assess and steer the right policy course, taking into
account domestic conditions and headwinds from the global environment.



If downside risks materialize: the policy response and room to contain the fallout, including
the key role of exchange rate flexibility. In particular, discussions focused on the response to a
significant U.S. slowdown and to a potential intensification of the global financial crisis.

A. Near-Term Macroeconomic Policies
12.
Overall, the authorities stressed that policy continuity is underpinned by a strong
consensus in Mexico about macroeconomic stability. Mexico has continued to implement sound
policies supported by its strong policy frameworks, and the incoming administration (through the
representative of President-elect Peña Nieto) stressed that it remains strongly committed to
maintaining prudent policies within the current frameworks. Monetary policy will continue to be
guided by the inflation targeting framework, in the context of the floating exchange regime, while
fiscal policy will be anchored by the balanced budget rule.8

Fiscal policy
13.
Under the baseline scenario, further fiscal consolidation efforts next year would help
continue rebuilding policy buffers. As discussed with the authorities, continued fiscal
consolidation in 2013 would help turn the primary balance into a slight surplus and return to a
balanced budget under the fiscal rule.9 This consolidation, underpinned by sustained oil revenues
and containment of investment expenditure, would help to stabilize public debt at about 43 percent
of GDP (Table 2). Staff supports the continuing efforts, while emphasizing that stepping up fiscal
consolidation to return to the primary surplus prevailing before the global crisis would help put the
debt ratio on a more sustained downward path towards pre-crisis levels, which is particularly
important in the present juncture where the potential for external shocks remains high. In this
8

Mexico’s Fiscal Responsibility Law establishes that the overall position of the public sector, excluding PEMEX’s
investment, should be balanced.
9

Given the presidential transition, the 2013 budget will be discussed and approved during December 2012.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MEXICO

context, staff noted that it would be useful for revenue-enhancing reforms to include some
frontloaded elements—like the re-establishment of a positive excise tax on gasoline prices—to help
avoid over-reliance on restraining public investment to achieve fiscal consolidation. The authorities
concurred with the need to mobilize non-oil revenues, and took note of staff’s proposals to reestablish a positive excise tax on gasoline prices as in the past, to broaden the tax base for the VAT,
and to reform the income tax, including the elimination of loopholes and special regimes.
14.
The authorities concurred that the fiscal policy environment will probably be more
challenging from now on, given the likely end of large oil windfalls.10 The significant increase in
oil prices during past years—which increased the budget price, albeit less than market prices—
together with limitations in the design of the stabilization funds that effectively capped the saving of
oil windfalls, allowed primary spending to rise by 3 percent of GDP in the last four years.11 Going
forward, the likely convergence of the budget and actual oil prices makes windfalls less likely,
meaning that expenditures will need to be more strictly prioritized in the budget process. It will
probably also make Mexico’s oil price hedge significantly more costly.
15.
The recent modification of the General Law of Government Accounting will enhance
the reporting and monitoring of subnational government finances (see Box 2). On average,
over 90 percent of states’ revenues come from central government transfers with limited restrictions
on spending, thereby reducing incentives for prudent fiscal management at the subnational level.
Subnational governments’ (SNG) debt has doubled since 2008, while SNG also face future pension
liabilities. However, SNG debt remains moderate at about 3 percent of GDP, posing little risk to
macroeconomic stability. The authorities recognize that SNGs are vulnerable to shocks (notably a
reduction in oil prices), particularly in light of limitations in their capacity for fiscal management and
lack of own-revenues. They are also concerned with the rapid build-up of subnational debt and
noted that addressing the issue will require tackling entrenched incentive problems among SNGs
and lenders. They see the new reporting requirements for SNGs as a vital prerequisite and an
important advancement toward strengthening subnational finances. The staff concurred that the
debt build-up and pension commitments warrant close monitoring and supported the authorities’
resolve to improve fiscal discipline at the subnational level.

Monetary and financial policies
16.
The Central Bank remains vigilant to risks from the possible persistence of recent
supply shocks, as well as to cyclical conditions. Banxico has judiciously maintained a stimulative
monetary policy, with the policy rate at 4½ percent since 2009, supporting the recovery in the
context of continued fiscal consolidation. The authorities noted that the breach of the inflation
target range has primarily been due to temporary supply shocks and that medium-term inflation
10

Oil windfalls refer to revenues from oil prices above the budget price (see Figure 5).

11

Since 2008, the increase in the budget price of oil reached 70 percent, with actual market prices above the budget
price by about 30 percent on average each year (see Figure 5). The rules for transfers to stabilization funds allow
offsets when revenues are below budget; moreover, funds are subject to accumulation ceilings.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

MEXICO

expectations remain firmly anchored. Nonetheless, they are committed to closely monitor the
determinants of inflation (including cyclical conditions, the persistence of supply shocks and global
headwinds) in order to adjust monetary policy as necessary to keep inflation in line with the target.
Staff concurred that vigilance is warranted (taking also into account fiscal consolidation plans which
can provide further margin to take stock of evolving conditions), and that an important challenge
ahead will be to communicate effectively the stance of monetary policy vis-à-vis temporary supply
shocks, emphasizing that its primary role lies with preventing second-round effects and maintaining
inflation expectations well-anchored.
17.
The floating exchange rate has continued to play a key role amid persistent global
uncertainty. The authorities noted that currency volatility has been associated with the recurrent
bouts of global risk aversion and the hedging of local currency positions by portfolio investors.
Exchange rate flexibility has continued to play a central part in the policy response to external
shocks due to the absence of significant balance-sheet or pass-through effects. The authorities
underscored that the exchange rate will continue to play a key buffering role against potential
shocks, with rules-based FX intervention limited to smoothing disorderly market conditions. In this
context, the authorities, including the incoming administration, concurred that Mexico’s level of
international reserves appears adequate for normal times (based on staff assessment of reserve
adequacy against a broad range of metrics; see Annex 1) but that, amid heightened external
uncertainty and Mexico’s high integration with international capital markets, the FCL remains a key
insurance complement against global tail risks.12 The build-up of reserves will continue primarily
through the acquisition of PEMEX’s net FX balance. In the staff’s baseline scenario, the projected rule
based accumulation of international reserves would be consistent with the increase in foreign
portfolio liabilities and monetary aggregates. This would allow the authorities to broadly maintain
current reserve coverage ratios, which continue to appear relatively low in terms of balance sheet
exposures that are particularly relevant for global tail risks.
18.
The financial sector has proved resilient to the recurrent bouts of global risk aversion,
but further efforts are needed to enhance the regulatory and supervisory framework. The
banking system remains sound, with good levels of liquidity, capital and profitability.13 The recent
FSAP Update highlighted several issues that require attention, stemming mainly from limitations to
the consolidated supervision of financial conglomerates and from portfolio concentration. The
concentration of the system in a few large conglomerates creates also potential conflicts of interest
and may hinder competition. The authorities are closely monitoring external risks and the operations
of local subsidiaries of foreign banks to ensure compliance with regulatory norms, which have been
tightened recently in the area of asset sales from parents to subsidiaries. Moreover, while the fast
12

Mexico’s FCL has played an important role by supporting the authorities’ macroeconomic strategy and bolstering
market confidence on the country’s ability to withstand external tail shocks. Recent studies on the effectiveness of
the FCL (IMF, 2011) support this view, showing a significant reduction in Mexico’s EMBI spreads around the time of
the FCL announcement.

13

Mexico’s high capitalization levels will allow for an early adoption of most elements of the Basel III capital
requirements.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MEXICO

growth in lending to subnational governments and in consumer credit (particularly payroll lending)
is not a systemic threat, the authorities’ initiatives to monitor this closely and devise measures to
contain risks are well warranted.14 These could be enhanced by adopting FSAP recommendations to
tighten concentration limits and implement Pillar 2 of Basel II.15 Although implementation of FSAP
recommendations has been limited so far, given that most require legal changes, progress is being
made particularly on the groundwork for the legal reforms, promoting contestability and access, and
refining pension fund investment guidelines to ensure a greater focus on long term returns (Box 3).
The FSAP noted that enhancing supervisory independence remains a priority, including to ensure
budgetary autonomy. Moreover, the authorities agreed that CNBV’s powers to mitigate
concentration and conglomeration risks should be strengthened.
19.
The authorities reiterated that the international financial regulatory reforms could
have unintended consequences for Mexico’s banking system. The authorities expressed
concerns that new capital surcharges for systemic and trading risks could negatively impact Mexican
financial markets, as could the introduction of the Volcker rule which would prohibit banks with
presence in the U.S. to engage in proprietary trading. These concerns arise from the effects that
these regulations may have on the cost of capital and liquidity of domestic sovereign debt markets,
in which domestic affiliates of global banks are active participants, as it is difficult to distinguish
between market making and proprietary trading. The authorities have asked the FSB to study the
unintended consequences of the agreed regulatory reforms on emerging and developing
economies. They have also sent formal comments on the Volcker rule to U.S. agencies, requesting
an exemption for Mexican government securities (similar to that granted to U.S. government
securities).

14

Banks total exposures to subnational borrowers are less than 10 percent of total loans and related NPLs (plus
write-offs) are less than 1 percent of exposure. The Financial System Stability Council has been monitoring these
risks, as highlighted in its recent financial stability report, and the Bank and Securities Commission (CNBV) tightened
provisioning requirements in 2011.
15

Currently, lending to sub nationals that is guaranteed by federal transfers are not subject to limits or capital
requirements.

Box 3. Status of Key FSAP Update Recommendations
Mexico undertook an FSAP Update last year, which was discussed by the Board in December 2011. Overall the assessment found
that Mexico’s banking system was profitable, liquid and well capitalized, and able to withstand severe shocks. The FSAP advised
Mexico to continue monitoring emerging risks and address developmental challenges, with the main recommendations focused
on:



Increasing the budget autonomy, independence and accountability of financial sector supervision to consolidate
recent gains. Financial sector supervisory agencies (CNBV and CNSF) should have the authority to amend their
organizational structures, make key staffing decisions, or modify their budgets (as the regulatory perimeter for CNBV is
expanding and below-market salaries have led to high staff turnover). In addition, the FSAP recommended increased
independence (in particular, a fixed-term appointment for the President of the Banking and Securities Commission, defined
appointment periods for—and clear grounds for dismissal of—senior officers, and adequate legal protection for staff) and
accountability. Over the medium term, it proposed reviewing Mexico’s supervisory architecture to reduce overlap of
responsibilities for the effective supervision of a more integrated financial sector.



Mitigating the risks and potential conflict of interest from the high level of portfolio concentration and
conglomeration in Mexico’s financial system. To provide additional supervisory tools, the FSAP Update recommended
implementing Pillar 2 of Basel II (including introducing a capital charge for concentration risk and requiring buffers above
regulatory minima), as well as tightening concentration limits. To strengthen consolidated supervision, and to mitigate risks
and conflicts of interest from financial conglomeration, it would be important to amend the law to transfer group regulatory
powers from the SHCP to CNBV and extend prudential requirements and governance and risk management standards to the
holding company level.



Improving some areas of the financial sector safety net. Key FSAP recommendations were to strengthen the deposit
guarantee fund by a gradual transfer of IPAB’s legacy debt to the government, and set up an emergency contingency
funding mechanism with a government guarantee, as well as to establish a program to address weak and not yet regulated
cooperatives. The FSAP also recommended disclosing the broad features of emergency liquidity assistance, consulting the
Financial Stability Committee on the systemic importance of institutions requesting ELA access, adding liquidity triggers in
the prompt corrective action regime, shortening delays in revoking a bank license and channeling bank liquidation through
an administrative process. Furthermore, increased market discipline-supporting measures for deposit insurance, such as a
reduction in coverage and the charging of risk-based premiums, would also be useful.



Enhancing competition in financial services and the development of capital markets. Key recommended measures were
to review the structure of retail banking fees to ensure that they promote contestability and access, strengthen consumer
financial protection, encourage pension funds to focus more on long-term returns, increase pension replacement rates,
improve the legal framework for derivatives, strengthen competition in the mutual fund sector, and promote integration with
the larger capital markets in the region.

The authorities have made important progress on some of the main recommendations or aspects that do not require
legal reforms. CONSAR, the pension regulator, has revised guidelines and is proposing further changes to increase pension
funds’ focus on asset allocation and long-term strategies, and cut down on excessive switching of contributors across funds. The
CNBV has established working groups to assess the changes needed to fully implement Pillar 2 and a pilot program using pillar
2-type requirements to address concentration risks at some banks. It has also proposed concentration limits on bank loans to
subnational governments that are guaranteed by federal transfers, while Banxico tightened the rule on relevant related-party
transactions. Furthermore, the authorities continue to monitor closely risks associated with consumer lending and corporates’
use of derivatives, as well as effective home-host cooperation through supervisory colleges.
However, most of the recommendations require legal reforms. The authorities are working on a number of legal reforms
needed to address FSAP Update recommendations, which would help the incoming administration to advance the reform
agenda and legislative process.

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MEXICO

B. Global Spillovers
20.
The authorities concurred that Mexico’s policy response to the materialization of global risks
would depend on the nature of the external shock. (See Chapter 1 of the Selected Issues paper).


A slowdown in the U.S. would be a material drag on growth in Mexico. The flexible exchange
rate would be expected to continue playing a key role, while there remains room to reduce the
policy rate (currently at 4½ percent) to help contain the fallout provided that global financial
conditions remain benign. In that case, on the fiscal side, automatic stabilizers could be allowed
to operate. However, the authorities and the staff concurred that the room for effective
discretionary fiscal stimulus would be limited, given that Mexico is still rebuilding its policy
buffers.16



A surge in global risk aversion from unsettled conditions in Europe and a generalized pullback
from the emerging market asset class could have a significant impact on Mexico, given the large
stock of foreign portfolio investment. Exchange rate flexibility would be expected to remain the
first line of defense, but tight financing conditions and acute currency pressures would constrain
the room for monetary and fiscal policy to limit the fallout. However, Mexico has significant
foreign exchange buffers to deploy if necessary to limit overshooting and dysfunctional market
conditions, including the FCL in case tail risks materialize.

16

If the shock in the U.S. also affects global risk aversion and financial conditions, the policy room will be more
limited.

C. Longer-Term Challenges
21.
Unleashing Mexico’s growth potential remains a key challenge. Global conditions are
not likely to be supportive in the near future, given the prospects for subdued growth in advanced
economies and protracted global financial uncertainty. Mexico, however, should benefit from a
broadening recognition of its sound fundamentals, the high integration within NAFTA and
commitment to free trade, favorable demographics, and the recent improvement in relative labor
costs compared to key competitors. Nevertheless, boosting potential growth will require a
comprehensive approach to structural reforms to ensure that productivity gains accrue to all sectors
and thus entrench the recent remarkable gains of Mexico’s manufacturing sector. A comprehensive
approach would involve:


22

Energy reform. Overall, reforms should address impediments to private investment and to
efficiency in the public sector (including cost over-runs, subsidies, the deficit in refining
operations, and pension liabilities). The new administration is considering opening the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MEXICO

hydrocarbon sector to private investment, by providing the legal basis for private sector
participation in these sectors.


Boosting competition. Recent anti-trust reforms have strengthened the powers of regulatory
bodies to curb anti-competitive practices, including in consumer markets, but concentration
remains high in key sectors (e.g., telecommunications, transportation, energy).17 The incoming
administration has indicated that boosting competition will be crucial to bolster Mexico’s
growth. Recent initiatives to reduce the lengthy resolution of disputes of the rulings by the
Federal Competition Commission and to improve consumer protection and price setting are
welcome.



Broadening access to credit, especially for SMEs. While Mexico’s financial sector is sophisticated,
bank intermediation remains relatively low compared with other emerging economies, with
limited access to credit for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) (see Chapter 4 of the Selected
Issues paper). Improving information about borrowers and strengthening the legal framework
for the use of collateral would support the expansion of bank credit to SMEs, thereby supporting
their growth, increasing productivity and bolstering employment creation.



Improving education. The quality of education in Mexico remains below that of peers according
to standardized assessments.18 Enhancing the quality would reduce the skills gap and help
integrate more of the labor force into the formal sector.



Reinforcing domestic security. Ongoing efforts to fight organized crime, including through
strengthening the AML framework, are important to foster investment and growth.

Mexico will face fiscal challenges over the longer term from diminishing oil revenues
and increasing age-related spending:


Oil revenues. While risks to the level of oil production seem to have declined, reliance on oil
revenues will represent a drag on public finances over the longer term. Oil revenues currently
account for a third of government revenues, and, in the absence of a significant increase in
production volume, are projected to fall by 2–3 percent of GDP through 2030.



Population aging and the transition costs associated with the reform of the old pension system
are projected to put pressure on health and pension spending, which is expected to increase by
about 2 percent of GDP through 2030.

17

The competition law was amended in 2011 giving greater powers to the Federal Competition Commission
(Cofeco) to investigate and impose sanctions for monopolistic practices. Proposals to further strengthen Cofeco and
the Federal Communications Commission (Cofetel), including granting autonomy, show the resolve to improve
competition.

The OECD’s Program for International Student Assessment ranked Mexico 47th out of 65 countries assessed, and
the lowest among OECD countries. The gap compared to the highest-ranked OECD country was estimated to be
equivalent to more than two years of schooling.

The authorities agreed that coping with these pressures will require a combination of
non-oil revenue mobilization, including at the subnational level, and expenditure
rationalization. On the revenue side, staff argued that mobilization efforts should focus on reestablishing a positive excise tax on gasoline prices, broadening the base of the VAT, overhauling
the property tax, and eliminating preferential treatments in the income tax, such as the special
regime for maquiladoras (see Chapter 3 of the Selected Issues paper). On the expenditure side, staff
suggested that significant savings could be achieved by consolidating pension eligibility
requirements, revisiting the retirement age in the unreformed system, and reforming special
regimes. In addition, a rationalization of fuel and electricity subsidies would provide significant fiscal
savings.
24.
Over the medium term, Mexico would benefit from enhancing its fiscal framework to
reduce procyclicality. The strong fiscal framework has been instrumental in ensuring public debt
sustainability, but spending has been procyclical, particularly over the prolonged period of high oil
prices. This underscores the need to revisit the design of the stabilization funds, given their limited
effectiveness in saving oil windfalls and, more generally, to reduce procyclicality.

STAFF APPRAISAL
25.
Mexico’s resilient economic performance attests to its strong fundamentals and sound
policy management. The strength of the recovery after the global crisis has been underpinned by
Mexico’s sound balance sheets, strong policy frameworks, and skillful macroeconomic management.
The recognition of Mexico as a predictable and prudently managed economy, as well as its open
capital account, market-friendly and transparent regulations for foreign investment, and deep and
liquid financial markets, have bolstered large foreign investment in recent years. Amid persistent
global financial uncertainty, the successive FCL arrangements have supported Mexico’s economic
policies by providing a significant buffer against tail risks.
26.
The strong consensus in Mexico about macroeconomic stability remains a key pillar of
policy continuity. The crises of past decades have deeply ingrained in Mexico the value of
preserving macroeconomic stability to avoid large output losses and their burden on vulnerable
segments of the population. The authorities’ continued implementation of sound policies and the
incoming administration’s firmly-expressed commitment to maintaining Mexico’s strong policy
frameworks (monetary policy under the inflation-targeting framework, a floating exchange regime,
and fiscal policy anchored by the balanced budget rule) are commendable and attest to the
importance assigned to stable macroeconomic conditions as a prerequisite for sustained growth.
27.
With the economy close to potential but external risks looming large, the policy
challenges ahead involve maintaining an appropriate policy stance and mix, and weighing
contingent policy responses to global downside scenarios. The policy stance and mix have been
broadly appropriate and, combined with the flexible exchange rate, have enabled Mexico to cope
with capital inflows amid lax monetary conditions in advanced economies. Going forward:

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MEXICO



The heightened potential for global shocks suggests that stepping up fiscal consolidation efforts
would be important to restore pre-crisis fiscal buffers. These efforts would support monetary
policy by providing further margin to take stock of evolving conditions.



If downside risks materialize, the policy response and room to contain the fallout will greatly
depend on the extent to which global financial stress and risk aversion spillover to Mexico. In
any event, exchange rate flexibility will continue to play a vital buffering role, inter alia to
increase the cost of capital outflows.



Addressing Mexico’s longer-term challenges will require decisive action on structural reforms.
Revenue mobilization and subsidy rationalization (specifically fuels and electricity) will be
essential to compensate for future pressures from population aging and declining oil revenues,
while structural reforms to unleash Mexico’s growth potential would benefit from a broad
approach, including energy, competition, and education reforms to ensure that productivity
gains accrue to all sectors.

28.
The ongoing fiscal consolidation remains judicious, and stepping up these efforts
would help restore Mexico’s fiscal buffers. Under the baseline scenario, returning in 2013 to the
balanced budget rule—which has proven critical to stabilize public debt—would provide a strong
signal of commitment to the fiscal framework and to maintaining prudent macroeconomic policies.
Moreover, in the face of persistent heightened global risks, stepping up fiscal consolidation efforts
further would help put the debt ratio on a more sustained downward path towards pre-crisis levels
and restore the policy buffers that Mexico had before the global crisis. In this context, revenueenhancing reforms to address longer-term fiscal challenges could usefully include some frontloaded
elements to make fiscal consolidation feasible without excessive compression of public investment.
29.
The end of the oil windfalls that Mexico enjoyed in recent years would pose new
challenges for fiscal policy, underscoring the need for further enhancing the fiscal framework.
The persistent rise in oil prices of recent years allowed the expenditure envelope to expand
significantly, given the shortcomings in the design of stabilization funds (which meant that
effectively little of the oil windfalls were saved). The convergence of the budgeted and actual oil
prices will make windfalls less likely going forward (requiring greater prioritization of expenditures in
the budget process); increase the cost of the oil price hedge (constraining Mexico’s ability to insure
against lower oil prices); and reduce the scope for spending growth.
30.
Enhancing the reporting and monitoring of subnational government finances is a
priority. Although subnational government debt remains moderate, its steep increase in recent
years justifies close monitoring. The recent modification of the General Law of Government
Accounting should help improve the reporting and coverage of subnational government accounts,
which will be a key prerequisite for assessing their fiscal position and reinforcing fiscal discipline.
31.
The monetary authorities remain appropriately vigilant, with the task ahead being to
assess the right policy course taking into account domestic conditions and global headwinds.
Banxico’s strong policy track record gives it credibility and margin of action to assess conditions in

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

the current uncertain juncture. Going forward, while underlying inflationary pressures have been
contained so far, recent supply shocks and cyclical conditions warrant Banxico’s heightened
vigilance. The challenge ahead will be to communicate effectively the appropriate stance of
monetary policy vis-à-vis temporary supply shocks, emphasizing the role of preventing secondround effects and maintaining inflation expectations well anchored.
32.
Mexico’s floating exchange rate should continue to play a key role in buffering
external shocks. The flexibility of the exchange rate has been particularly beneficial in light of the
persistent global financial uncertainty. The absence of significant balance-sheet and pass-through
effects implies that the exchange rate can continue to be a key pillar of the policy response to
external shocks. The real exchange rate is consistent with underlying fundamentals and desirable
policy settings. The level of reserves appears adequate for normal times but, in the context of
heightened global uncertainty and Mexico’s high integration into international capital markets, the
FCL remains a key insurance complement against potential global tail risks.
33.
The financial sector remains sound, showing resilience to the recurrent bouts of global
risk aversion, but further efforts are needed to enhance the regulatory and supervisory
framework. The recent FSAP Update highlighted the need to enhance supervisory independence,
including to ensure budgetary autonomy of the CNBV. It also noted potential issues stemming
mainly from limitations to the consolidated supervision of financial conglomerates and from
portfolio concentration. The concentration of the system in a few large financial conglomerates also
creates potential conflicts of interest and may hinder competition. Implementation of FSAP
recommendations has been limited so far, as many of them require legislative changes, but progress
is being made on the groundwork for the legal reforms, which should be taken up by the incoming
administration. The authorities’ close monitoring of the operations of local subsidiaries of foreign
banks, lending to subnational governments, and consumer credit (particularly payroll loans), is
welcomed.
34.
Potential global spillovers warrant close monitoring. The authorities’ careful assessment
of external conditions and potential implications for Mexico, including in the Financial System
Stability Council report and Central Bank publications, is to be commended. The policy response to
the materialization of global risks would depend on the nature of the external shock, but the flexible
exchange rate would be expected to continue playing a key role in all circumstances. Although
Mexico cannot be expected to decouple from a significant U.S. slowdown, monetary policy and
automatic stabilizers could help contain the impact, provided that global financial conditions remain
benign, but the room for discretionary fiscal stimulus would remain limited given that Mexico is still
rebuilding its policy buffers. A surge in global risk aversion and a generalized pullback from
emerging markets remains a material risk for Mexico given the large stock of foreign portfolio
investment. In this case, tight financing conditions and acute currency pressures would tend to
constrain the policy room to contain the fallout. However, Mexico has significant foreign exchange
buffers to deploy if necessary to limit overshooting and dysfunctional market conditions, including
access to the FCL in case tail risks materialize.

35.
A broad structural reform agenda is needed to unleash Mexico’s growth potential. The
agenda would involve inter alia reforming the energy sector; enhancing competition; improving the
quality of education; facilitating access to credit for SMEs; and strengthening the rule of law.
Structural reforms would benefit from a broad-spectrum approach to ensure that productivity gains
accrue to all sectors.
36.
Mexico’s longer-term fiscal challenges from population aging and declining oil
revenues will require additional revenue mobilization and expenditure rationalization. On the
revenue side, mobilization efforts should focus on re-establishing a positive excise tax on gasoline,
broadening the base of the VAT, eliminating preferential treatments in the income tax, and
increasing subnational property taxes. On the expenditure side, savings could be achieved by
consolidating pension eligibility requirements, revisiting the retirement age in the unreformed
system, and reforming special regimes (notably PEMEX’s). Moreover, over the medium term,
Mexico’s fiscal framework could be enhanced by adding mechanisms to help save oil windfalls and
reduce fiscal procyclicality, while maintaining its key role of ensuring debt sustainability.
37.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Mexico take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

ANNEX I. MEXICO: EXTERNAL SECTOR ASSESSMENT
Mexico’s current account deficit and exchange rate level appear broadly in line with fundamentals and
desirable policy settings. The country’s floating exchange rate has been a key shock absorber in the
context of a volatile external environment, with large and symmetric fluctuations since the global
crisis. Rule-based intervention in the foreign exchange market, which has been minimal, has sought to
limit excess volatility and disorderly market conditions. Foreign investment in peso-denominated
government debt has increased significantly since 2010 amidst broadening recognition of Mexico’s
strong fundamentals and lax global monetary conditions. Reserve accumulation (mainly from PEMEX’s
foreign exchange balance) has allowed Mexico to maintain adequate reserve buffers for normal times,
given the substantial increase in portfolio inflows. However, the large stock of foreign portfolio
investment, including in government paper, can pose risk in an unsettled external environment. In this
context, Mexico’s FCL arrangement is an important complement to reserve buffers against global tail
risks.
Current Account
1.
Mexico’s current account deficit has remained relatively stable at about 1 percent of
GDP over the past few years. This has reflected balanced and resilient growth (supported by both
domestic and external demand), as well as a market-determined exchange rate in line with
fundamentals. The v-shaped recovery in exports after the global crisis (particularly in manufacturing,
which constitutes about 80 percent of

total exports) was accompanied by a

strong recovery of imports, linked to

inputs. The robust performance of

supported by continued strong demand

increase in market share. The latter was

due to significant FDI inflows in the past
(particularly into the automobile industry) and improved relative ULCs (from increased productivity,
contained wage growth from lower migration and increased labor market participation, and the
depreciation of the exchange rate). The recovery of Mexico’s terms of trade to pre-crisis levels also
helped underpin export values. The large and steady flow of remittances, particularly from the U.S.,
was partly offset by the net factor income balance (driven primarily by interest payments to foreign
holders of Mexican debt) and the non-factor services balance (closely linked to trade-related freight
and insurance services).

2.
Over the medium term, the current account deficit is expected to remain stable at
about 1 percent of GDP (at constant real exchange rate and given current medium-term
assumptions in the World Economic Outlook). The projected deterioration in the oil trade balance
(in line with the constant volume of production and projected decline in oil prices) is envisaged to
be offset by an improvement in the non-oil trade balance (led by continued strong growth in
manufactured exports). Mexico is expected to continue to attract FDI into the manufacturing sector.
Macro policy continuity and growth-promoting structural reforms introduce upside potential for
exports, both in manufacturing and energy.19

Mexico’s flexible exchange rate has served as an important buffer against heightened
external risks and uncertainties. The nominal exchange rate has shown significant volatility during
the recurrent periods of global risk aversion, but without posing major difficulties for the balance

15
the exchange rate during periods of

14
to the fact that the peso market is

and therefore used by market
12

participants across the globe to take
11
65
positions in reaction to external
20
10
developments. As such, part of
55
Mexico’s currency volatility in recent
45
9
years has reflected global sentiments
rather than country-specific factors.21
This has been shown by the contrasting behavior of the exchange rate and sovereign interest rates,
whereby upsurges in global risk aversion have not led to foreign divestment from government debt
with interest rates remaining remarkably stable.

19

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, Mexico has the fourth largest reserves of shale gas in the
world.
20

According to a 2010 BIS survey, the Mexican peso is the third most traded emerging market currency, next to
South Korea’s won and the Singapore dollar. The bulk of currency trading is conducted outside Mexico by foreign
market participants.
21

The real effective exchange rate depreciated by about 25 percent from peak to trough during the 2008–09 global
crisis. Since the crisis, the real effective exchange rate has strengthened and weakened, including in the second half
of 2011, mainly reflecting nominal exchange rate movements driven by the recurrent bouts of global risk aversion.
The nominal exchange rate depreciated by about 50 percent against the U.S. dollar during the 2008–09 crisis in a
period of seven months.

4.
A range of metrics and methodologies indicate that Mexico’s external position is
broadly in line with fundamentals. The analyses in the 2012 Pilot External Sector Report and the
recently-released External Balances Assessment (EBA) indicate that Mexico’s cyclically-adjusted
current account and real effective exchange rate are broadly consistent with fundamentals and
desirable policies. The overall assessment of the most recent CGER results also indicates that
Mexico’s real effective exchange rate is in line with fundamentals.
Capital account, international reserves and international investment position
5.
Mexico has experienced large capital inflows during the last years, which have been
driven by both external and domestic factors. The former have been associated with lax global
monetary conditions and, as a recurring offset, with the repeated bouts of global risk aversion.
Domestic factors have been related to Mexico’s strong macroeconomic fundamentals, which led to
its inclusion in the World Global Bond Index (WGBI) in 2010 and the opening of Mexico’s assets to a
new class of institutional investors. Although the bulk of foreign investors are from the U.S., the
investor base has increasingly diversified across a broader range of countries, including from the
Asia-Pacific region seeking exposures in emerging markets.

80 percent during the last three years, from about US$200 billion at end-2009 to US$355 billion in
mid 2012. Capital inflows have been particularly large, channeled to domestic sovereign debt
markets where the stock of foreign portfolio holdings increased from about US$30 billion in 2009 to
US$100 billion in mid-2012. A significant part of portfolio inflows has been from institutional
investors into the long-end of the yield curve, driven largely by Mexico's strong fundamentals and
its inclusion in the WGBI. More recently, flows to short-term government paper (CETES) have
increased considerably, driven in part by carry trade operations. Given the impact that a surge in
global risk aversion could have on emerging markets as an asset class, including sound countries
like Mexico, the large portfolio exposure of foreign market participants represents significant risks.
7.
While reserve coverage has increased moderately since the global crisis, it remains low
in terms of balance sheet exposures against comparator emerging markets. The increased
investor appetite for Mexican assets has meant that despite efforts to rebuild reserve buffers, the
coverage ratio vis-à-vis foreign portfolio liabilities has increased only modestly and still appears low
(48 percent) compared with the median for a group of emerging markets (147 percent). The
coverage of monetary aggregates shows a similar picture, with the increase in coverage from
16 percent to 21 percent of broad money still low compared to the median for emerging markets of
33 percent.22 Other metrics show that Mexico is below the median for emerging markets in the case
of reserves to GDP, and above the median for the coverage of short-term debt at residual maturity
plus the current account deficit. The ARA metric and reserves as months of imports show that
Mexico is in line with the median for emerging markets. However, Mexico has low short-term debt
and current account deficits, and high correlation between exports and imports, which suggests that
less weight can be given to these metrics as indicators of potential external drains.
8.
Mexico’s net foreign asset position
remains moderate, narrowing slightly below
pre-crisis levels. As of the end of the second
quarter of 2012, Mexico’s net foreign assets
position stood at about negative 31 percent of
GDP (from negative 36 percent at the end of 2007).
Over the medium term, the NFA is expected to
remain broadly stable as the current account is
projected to be in line with the NFA-stabilizing
level of 1.1 percent.23

FISCAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Mexico’s public debt is moderate and is projected to remain stable over the medium term
under the baseline scenario, at around 43 percent of GDP. Standard DSA bound tests suggest
that public debt would remain at moderate levels under standard shocks. Moreover, Mexico’s
balanced-budget framework is a strong fiscal anchor against the materialization of such scenarios.

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Mexico’s external-debt-to GDP ratio continues to be low and sustainable, and is expected to
remain stable over the medium-term. In the most extreme shock—a 30 percent real exchange
rate depreciation—the debt-to-GDP ratio would increase to 37 percent, which is still a moderate
level. Mitigating factors include the fact that a larger share of Mexico’s (public) debt is now
denominated in pesos, and Mexico has taken advantage of low interest rates and the recognition of
its strong macroeconomic fundamentals to lengthen the maturity structure of its external debt.
Other shocks, including to interest rates, current account and growth have only a marginal impact
on Mexico’s debt-to-GDP ratio.

ANNEX 2. RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK AND
BANK-FUND COLLABORATION UNDER THE JMAP
A. Relations with the World Bank
Mexico has had a longstanding partnership with the World Bank Group encompassing the delivery
of the full menu of financial, knowledge, and coordination and convening services. The flexibility of
the FY08–13 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) was instrumental in helping Mexico adjusting to the
large adverse shocks experienced during 2008–2009. The global economic downturn and tightening
in financial conditions combined with the outbreak of the A (H1N1) influenza in April 2009 led much
of the World Bank’s assistance to Mexico to focus on financial services while continue working on a
broad knowledge agenda.
Since then, Mexico's growth has held up reasonably well despite turbulence in Europe, in part as a
result of the slow but steady recovery in the United States. As expected, Mexico has lowered IBRD
lending to protect exposure from US$6.4 billion in FY10 to US$1.46 billion in FY12, The WBG
engagement with Mexico is structured around an innovative and thematic approach with an
engagement model that fully provides customized development solutions utilizing packages of
financial, knowledge and convening services. A new CPS will be prepared during the second half of
FY13 to be implemented during the next six-year period.
As of September 30, 2012, Mexico had 17 projects under supervision for a total net commitment
amount of US$7,153 million, placing Mexico in the fourth position amongst the top 5 countries with
the largest portfolio under supervision in the World Bank. In terms of Borrower’s obligation, Mexico
has the largest debt outstanding at US$13,801 million.

B. Bank-Fund Collaboration under the JMAP
The Bank and Fund teams have discussed the following priorities:


The need for non-oil revenue mobilization. These efforts would be important to address Mexico
longer-term fiscal challenges from gradually diminishing oil revenues and increasing age-related
spending.



Structural reforms. Boosting potential growth will require a comprehensive approach to
structural reforms to ensure that productivity gains accrue to all sectors and thus entrench the
recent remarkable gains of Mexico’s manufacturing sector.



Addressing climate change. Support the authorities’ efforts to reduce Mexico’s carbon footprint,
including increasing sources of renewable energy, and improving efficiency of lighting and
appliances.



Financial sector surveillance. The Fund will continue with the surveillance of the financial sector.
The FSAP update took place in the second half of 2011, a joint Bank-Fund effort.

ANNEX 3. STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision is adequate for surveillance. Mexico observes the Special Data Dissemination
Standards (SDDS) and its metadata are posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
(DSBB). In a number of cases, the periodicity and timeliness of disseminated data exceed SDDS
requirements. A data ROSC update was completed on October 8, 2010 and was published as IMF
Country Report No. 10/330. There are various areas where improvements could be made. The
authorities are aware of this situation and are continuing work in this regard.
Although some items of the balance of payments statistics conform to the Fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual, a full transition has not yet been completed.1 Several measures to
improve external debt statistics have been carried out, including the compilation of data on external
liabilities of the private sector and publicly traded companies registered with the Mexican stock
exchange (external debt outstanding, annual amortization schedule for the next four years broken
down by maturity, and type of instrument).
The national accounts statistics generally follow the recommendations of the System of National
Accounts, 1993 (1993 SNA). Source data and statistical techniques are sound and most statistical
outputs sufficiently portray reality. A broad range of source data are available, with economic
censuses every five years and a vast program of monthly and annual surveys. For most surveys,
scientific sampling techniques are used. Nonetheless, most samples exclude a random sample of
small enterprises. Changes in inventories are obtained as residuals, so there is no independent
verification between the production and expenditure measures of GDP. Some statistical techniques
need enhancement. For example taxes and subsidies on products at constant prices are estimated
by applying the GDP growth rate; a deviation from best practice.
The concepts and definitions for both the CPI and PPI meet international standards. The PPI is only
compiled by product and not by economic activity. A ROSC mission on prices will be conducted in
November 2012.
The authorities compile fiscal statistics following national concepts, definitions, and classifications
that make international comparison difficult. The statistics are comprehensive and timely, except for
states and municipalities. The new government accounting law mandates accounting standards that
follow international standards for all levels of government, and that take into account the
information needs of international organizations and national accounts.
The authorities are committed to reporting government financial statistics in GFSM 2001 format, as
well as data for the GFS Yearbook.

1

Since the release of the balance of payments figures for the second quarter of 2010 (August, 25th,
2010), Banco de Mexico has been publishing a new format that follows the guidelines of the Fifth
edition of the Balance of Payments Manual.

The methodological foundations of monetary statistics are generally sound. However, the recording
of financial derivative and, to a lesser extent, repurchase agreements transactions are overstating the
aggregated other depository corporations (ODC) balance sheet and survey. Availability of data on
other financial intermediaries such as insurance companies and pension funds allow for the
construction of a financial corporations survey with full coverage of the Mexican financial system,
which is published on a monthly basis in International Financial Statistics.
Mexico is reporting Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs) for Deposit Takers on a monthly basis.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
November 28, 2012

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with Mexico
On November 19, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Mexico.1
Background
Mexico’s growth has remained resilient, supported by both external and domestic demand.
Since the crisis, Mexico has benefited from the relatively good performance of the U.S.
manufacturing sector and achieved a strong recovery of its market share in that market. The
gain in market share in the U.S. has come in part from improved relative unit labor costs (ULCs)
and a continued flow of foreign direct investment into manufacturing, especially in the
automotive sector. In turn, domestic demand has been supported by sustained growth in
employment and credit. Inflationary pressures have remained contained thus far, despite the
recent uptick in headline inflation associated with food prices. Amid persistent global financial
uncertainty, the successive FCL arrangements have supported Mexico’s economic policies by
providing a significant buffer against tail risks.
Growth in 2013 is envisaged to converge to 3½ percent, close to Mexico’s long-term potential
growth rate. Despite a subdued U.S. recovery, domestic demand is envisaged to maintain its
momentum, underpinned by sustained business and consumer confidence. High capacity
utilization rates suggest that the recovery in fixed investment will continue, while favorable credit

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
conditions and sustained employment growth should help underpin consumption. As food price
shocks dissipate, headline inflation is expected to revert towards the inflation target.
Exchange rate flexibility has played a key shock-absorbing role, amid recurrent bouts of global
risk aversion, but without major balance sheet or pass-through effects. In turn, sovereign and
financial markets have remained stable, with interest rates near historical lows. Mexico’s
recognition as a predictable and prudently managed economy, as well as its open capital and
current accounts, market-friendly and transparent regulations for foreign investment, and deep
and liquid financial markets, have bolstered large foreign investment in recent years.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities’ sound rules based policy framework and skillful
macroeconomic management, which have underpinned the strong recovery after the global
crisis, improved the economy’s competitiveness and resilience to shocks, and bolstered foreign
investment and growth. At the same time, Directors noted that downside risks prevail in the
current uncertain external environment. They therefore welcomed the incoming administration’s
commitment to maintaining prudent macroeconomic policies within the existing policy
framework.
Directors supported the ongoing fiscal consolidation. They encouraged the return to a balanced
budget under Mexico’s fiscal rule in 2013, which will help put the debt ratio on a downward path
and restore fiscal buffers. To this end, revenue mobilization efforts are needed to raise the
revenue to GDP ratio from its relatively low level, reduce the dependence on oil revenue, and
avoid excessive compression of public investment. Fiscal reforms will also be needed to
address pressures on the budget from population aging and declining oil revenues as a percent
of GDP. Directors welcomed recent legislation to improve the reporting of sub national
government accounts, which will be key to reinforcing fiscal discipline.
Directors agreed that the current accommodative stance of monetary policy has helped sustain
the ongoing recovery in the face of fiscal consolidation. The task ahead is to determine the right
monetary policy course given cyclical conditions and global headwinds. Recent supply shocks,
which caused inflation to rise above the target range, further warrant central bank vigilance.
Directors stressed that communicating the appropriate stance of monetary policy in the
presence of such shocks is essential to maintain central bank credibility and keep inflation
expectations anchored.
Directors agreed that the flexible exchange rate will continue to play a key role in buffering
external shocks. They supported limited foreign exchange market intervention through a
transparent and rules based mechanism. They took note of staff’s conclusion that the real
effective exchange rate is consistent with fundamentals and desirable policies. Directors also

3
welcomed the authorities’ monitoring of potential cross border spillovers, noting that a surge in
global risk aversion could affect Mexico. They agreed that the Flexible Credit Line arrangement
with the Fund has provided significant insurance against global downside risks.
Directors noted that Mexico’s financial sector remains sound and resilient. Nevertheless, they
encouraged further effort to strengthen the regulatory and supervisory framework and reduce
concentration in banks’ loan portfolios. They also urged stepped up efforts to implement the
recommendations under the Financial Sector Assessment Program, and welcomed the close
monitoring of lending to sub national governments.
Directors emphasized that boosting Mexico’s growth potential will require structural reforms to
increase productivity and investment. They welcomed the recently approved labor reform, and
underscored the importance of reforms to improve the quality of education, enhance
competition, facilitate access to credit by small and medium sized enterprises, and strengthen
domestic security.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
