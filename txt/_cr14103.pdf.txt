STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
February 6, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Context. Despite recent strong non-oil growth, poverty and income inequality remain
high and social and governance indicators are below averages for sub-Saharan Africa.
Structural reforms under the Transformation Agenda are ongoing, but significant
infrastructure gaps and weak institutional capacity still retard growth prospects. At the
same time, vulnerabilities are rising in the buildup to general elections in 2015 and fiscal
buffers have been reduced. Meanwhile, GDP is being rebased and structural shifts may
suggest a refocus in some policy areas.
Outlook and Risks. Growth is expected to remain strong, driven by agriculture, trade,
and services. Inflation should continue to decline, in line with a tight monetary policy,
and a lowering trend in food prices from higher rice and wheat production. Key
downside risks are (i) persistently lower oil revenue from changing global dynamics and
lower domestic production; (ii) less prudent fiscal policy through the ongoing political
cycle; (iii) ongoing security problems in the North; (iv) uncertainty about the pace of
global recovery; and (v) capital flow reversals from the expected unwinding of
unconventional monetary policy (UMP) in the advanced economies or increased
domestic political risk.
Addressing oil theft/production losses. Transparency and governance in the oil sector
should be enhanced, including by strengthening the regulatory framework through the
passage of a sound Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) featuring stringent enforcement clauses.
A multicountry partner strategy could also improve oil sector oversight.
Rebuilding fiscal buffers by insulating macrofinancial stability from the political
cycle. The fiscal framework should continue to be improved, with an appropriately
conservative 2014 budget. Monetary policy should remain supportively tight, given the
potential for capital flow reversals and fiscal slippages. In the event of persistent
pressures, the naira should be allowed to adjust and reserve adequacy maintained.
Improving competitiveness and productivity to generate inclusive growth will
require wide-ranging structural reforms. Three key areas could help promote inclusive
growth—increasing the delivery of power, broadening the agricultural production base,
and increasing access to finance for SMEs. Support for sectoral growth should be
underpinned by improvements in competitiveness rather than by protectionist measures.

CONTEXT
Despite strong growth in recent years, key social indicators remain below averages
1.
for sub-Saharan Africa (Table 1). Long-standing structural challenges—a large informal sector,
income inequality, high unemployment, and growth disparities among regions—together with
significant infrastructure gaps and weak institutional capacity have constrained progress toward
meeting the national goal of top-20 nation status by 2020. The Transformation Agenda is
advancing, but the political environment has become more difficult, with increasing attention on
the 2015 elections and concerns about ongoing security problems in the North. Consequently, it
could be difficult to build consensus among the various tiers of government on the urgency of
continuing structural reform.
The authorities have advanced their structural reform agenda, drawing on past staff
2.
advice (Box 1). Notable progress has been achieved in the fiscal sector—improved administration
of the fuel subsidy, increased coverage of the Treasury Single Account, and developing information
management modules to better formulate the budget. In the financial sector, progress was made in
enhancing consolidated and cross-border bank supervision, building capacity for effective
implementation of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and adopting a
macroprudential framework. The privatization of power generation and distribution was completed,
and a seed and fertilizer program has significantly increased rice production. However, access to
finance for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) has lagged and legislation to strengthen
the petroleum sector has been delayed.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
A. Recent Economic and Policy Developments
Macroeconomic performance has been broadly positive, but signs of weakness are
3.
emerging.


Real GDP grew by 6.8 percent in Q3 2013 (y-o-y), mainly owing to a continuing strong
performance (7.9 percent (y-o-y) growth) in the non-oil sector (primarily agriculture,
services, and trade—Table 2), in which Nigeria over performs its peers (Figure 1). Oil
production improved slightly in Q3, but remains below capacity owing to continued oil
theft/production losses. Staff projects the economy to grow 6.4 percent in 2013.



Inflation continued to decline, ending December at 7.9 percent, in part owing to lower
food and utility prices (which comprise 68.5 percent of the consumption basket), and
supported by fiscal consolidation and a tight monetary policy stance by the Central Bank
of Nigeria (CBN). Core inflation has been rising however since May, reflecting higher prices
of imports.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGERIA



The current account surplus is expected to decline to 3.1 percent of GDP (Table 3) from
7.8 percent at end-2012. The fall in oil exports is a consequence of production losses
associated with oil theft and is projected at 4 percent annually. At the same time, imports
have continued to rise at a rapid pace as demand remained strong through the year
(Figure 2).



The non-oil primary deficit (NOPD) of the consolidated government is projected to narrow
to 23½ percent of non-oil GDP from 27 percent at end-2012, driven by expenditure
restraint, including lower-than-budgeted capital expenditure because of low execution
capacity (Tables 2 and 4a). Meanwhile, fiscal buffers have been depleted—the balance in
the Excess Crude Account (ECA) and Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) declined from
US$11 billion at end-2012 to US$3 billion at end-2013—because oil revenue has been
below budget, largely on account of oil theft and production losses.



Credit to the private sector remains sluggish (Table 5b), with banks showing more appetite
for low-risk government securities. Prudential indicators (Table 6) suggest a
well-capitalized banking system with a low level of nonperforming loans (NPLs), though
most deposits have a short-term maturity, and lending by banks is still not sufficiently
diversified.

4.
Capital inflows have become more volatile as concerns have increased about the
possible unwinding of the U.S. unconventional monetary policy (UMP). In the last three years,
Nigeria has received a significant amount of foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows (largely into the
oil and gas, banking, manufacturing, and telecommunications subsectors1) as well as portfolio
investment (equity and debt securities), contributing to a slight exchange rate appreciation, a
strong increase in the All Share Index, and accumulation of gross international reserves (text figure).
Foreign direct investment (FDI) and portfolio inflows increased to 7.9 percent of GDP in 2012
compared to 3.4 percent in 2010. However, softened investor sentiment toward
emerging/developing markets, after Chairman Bernanke’s May 22 statement on the possible
unwinding of UMP, led to some outflows (projected at 5.5 percent of GDP in 2013) and pressures
on the naira, which weakened against the U.S. dollar. The CBN intervened to help stabilize the
exchange rate, with gross international reserves falling to US$43.6 billion at end-2013 from
US$49 billion in mid-March. As a result of changing market sentiment, there was also an increase in
government bond yields (text figure). The pressure on the naira was, however, contained and capital
inflows have stabilized.

importation respectively.

B. Medium-Term Outlook and Risks
5.
The short- and medium-term outlooks are strong. Growth is expected to increase from
6.4 percent in 2013 to 7.3 percent in 2014, driven partly by a rebound in oil production and
supported by positive effects of reforms in power and higher agriculture production. Inflation
should continue to decline, in line with a tight monetary policy and helped by expected policies
preserving fiscal consolidation through the ongoing political cycle. The authorities’ 2014–16
Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) proposal is consistent with a declining NOPD in 2014
compared with end-2013. However, the early start to the 2015 general elections and fiscal
performance in previous election cycles suggest uncertainty about the continued implementation
of the MTEF and structural reform agenda. Over the medium term, continued progress on fiscal
consolidation and the implementation of key structural reforms should lead to a gradual increase in

6

NIGERIA

the growth rate and a generally more resilient economy, characterized by a low risk of debt
distress.2
6.
Risks to the outlook are significant (Risk Assessment Matrix, RAM—Table 7). To
illustrate these risks, staff analyzed the direct impact of domestic and external shocks on key
macroeconomic variables. The first scenario (Figure 6) replicates a persistently lower oil price. The
drop in oil prices puts substantial pressure on the fiscal and external accounts, resulting in severely
depleted buffers. The second scenario (Figure 7) looks at the implication of less prudent fiscal
policy, with increased spending that does not target human capital and infrastructure development.
In this scenario, depleted buffers show that policies assumed in the baseline cannot be sustained.
The third scenario (Figure 8) examines the impact of high levels of production losses related to oil
theft, compounded by less favorable oil market dynamics from the shale oil/gas revolution
(Appendix 1) and a possible emerging market slowdown. In this scenario oil revenue reduces
significantly, leaving little space for boosting growth-enhancing spending.
7.
In addition to these scenarios, security problems in the North could also affect economic
activity through agriculture and trade, as occurred in 2012. Also, a reversal of investor sentiment or
less confidence in the policy stance could put pressure on the exchange rate and adversely affect
macroeconomic and financial stability. This could occur from the prospective exit from UMP.

C. Inward and Outward Spillovers
8.
Inward spillovers from the U.S. shale energy boom are sizeable. The rise in
unconventional sources of energy such as shale gas and oil has led to a rapid increase in U.S.
domestic energy production in recent years. Assuming the increase in unconventional energy

percent). At the same time,
various studies point to important informal trade links, in particular in petroleum products and food
cereals: Nigeria meets 70 percent of the cereal needs of Niger and Chad; its highly subsidized
gasoline accounts for more than 80 percent of gasoline consumed in Benin.
10.
The planned implementation of a Common External Tariff (CET) for the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is expected to facilitate trade integration.
Under the new trade regime, starting on January 1, 2015, 5 percent duty is applicable for 2,146 tariff
lines under the basic raw materials and capital goods category; 10 percent for the 1,373 tariff lines
that qualify as intermediate products category; and 20 percent duty is reserved for the 2,165 tariff
lines that fall into the category of final consumer products. The CET will improve the transparency
and coherence of the tariff structure of Nigeria, increase formal trade ties with the other ECOWAS
countries, and reduce incentives for informal trade in the region.
11.
Cross-border activity of Nigerian-based banks with sub-Saharan countries is
expanding. Since 2004, the number of subsidiaries of resident banks licensed in foreign
jurisdictions increased from 3 in 2002 to 44 (operating in 21 sub-Saharan African countries outside
Nigeria) at end-2010, to 67 at end-October 2013. After establishing a strong foothold in West
Africa, Nigerian banks now appear to be looking to expand in the East. Guaranty Trust Bank Plc
(GTBank), a leading Nigerian financial institution, acquired a 70 percent stake in Kenya’s Fina Bank
Limited in 2013. This acquisition expanded the bank’s operations to three East African countries.
Among Nigerian banks, United Bank of Africa has the widest footprint, with 21 subsidiaries as of
end-October, 2013. However, its subsidiaries play only a small role in the host countries’ banking

8

systems. In at least 15 of the host countries, there is at least one Nigerian subsidiary that accounts
for more than 10 percent of system-wide deposits or credit. (IMF AFR REO N

12.
Contagion through cross-border banking activity has been limited. The 2009–10
Nigerian banking crisis did not lead to systemic contagion across the region. This is partly because
the banks with the largest cross-border operations, accounting for more than half the foreign
subsidiaries, were not among the troubled banks. Another factor that minimized systemic
contagion was that the banking systems of the host countries are mainly funded by local deposits
and therefore do not significantly depend on Nigerian funding.
13.
Systematic linkages between fluctuations in growth rates in Nigeria and neighboring
countries are difficult to identify. Correlations between Nigerian GDP and that of neighboring
countries are still generally weak: for example, IMF AFR REO October 2012 shows that after
controlling for common global factors, shocks to Nigerian GDP have a negligible impact on GDP in
neighboring countries.
14.
Authorities’ views. The authorities had a broadly similar view on the outlook and risks.
There was agreement on the need to rebuild fiscal buffers to mitigate possible oil revenue shocks;
but they acknowledged that achieving consensus with state and local governments (SLGs) on an
appropriate level of buffers would be difficult, because the political environment seems less
favorable ahead of elections. The authorities reiterated their commitment to stay the course on
fiscal consolidation, as expressed in the 2014–2016 MTEF. Noting the changing dynamics in
international oil markets, they pointed to the need to accelerate ongoing reforms in the oil and gas
industry. On outward spillovers, the authorities see an urgent need to review the tariff structure,
given the agreed implementation of the common external tariff in early January 2015.
15.
A GDP rebasing exercise is underway that could significantly increase the level of GDP
(Appendix 2). The base year for the national accounts is being updated from 1990 to 2010, a period
during which the structure of the economy has changed significantly—for example, the share of
agriculture in employment has fallen from 70 percent to about 30 percent. A material change in
GDP would alter key performance indicators in the macroeconomic framework, including tax,
investment spending, and debt ratios. For example, the tax revenue to GDP ratio of 20 percent puts
Nigeria in the middle range of low-income countries, but a significant increase in GDP could push
Nigeria in the low range of low-income countries. The authorities stressed the importance of
credibility for the rebasing of the GDP; consequently the release of the revised GDP data has been
delayed until after technical assistance missions from the Fund, World Bank, and African
Development Bank, which started in mid-December. The authorities noted, however, that the
expected higher nominal GDP would have little impact on their borrowing strategy, which is based
on the ratio of debt service to revenue.

ADDRESSING OIL THEFT/PRODUCTION LOSSES
16.
Nigeria’s oil production declined sharply in early 2013, from increased oil theft that
was amplified by pipeline closures after the sabotage. With the oil sector accounting for
75 percent of government revenue and 95 percent of exports, the reduction in oil exports adversely
affected the fiscal and external positions in 2013. The impact on revenues was particularly strong:
for example, between January 2012 and June 2013, revenues collected from Nigerian National
Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) fell by 47 percent and transfers to the ECA were reduced by
73 percent. Historically, oil theft has varied (text figure).

A number of key measures have been taken to address oil theft/production losses,
but more can be done. Mitigating measures have included special naval exercises, collaboration
with local leaders in oil-producing communities, and international initiatives to discourage the
purchase of illegal oil by foreign refineries. While these measures, along with the reopening of
some major pipelines, helped improve production in the second half of 2013, staff noted that more
can be done to tackle the governance issues in the oil sector and to address the international
dimension (Appendix 3). Staff highlighted the need to further strengthen the regulatory framework
of the prospective PIB with enhanced oversight and transparency provisions and stringent
enforcement clauses. While efforts are underway to improve the reconciliation of oil revenue

NIGERIA

collections—Nigeria is Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) compliant3—processes
from pre-Federal Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) to postmortem FAAC are being
strengthened, and collaboration among agencies has improved (Box 2). Staff urged the authorities
to regularly audit and monitor exports and collection processes for oil revenues, and to apply the
Anti-Money-Laundering (AML)/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) framework to help
combat oil-theft-related money laundering.
18.
Authorities’ views.4 The authorities agreed on the need to strengthen governance and
oversight in the oil sector. They also concurred on capacity enhancements to address critical
infrastructure constraints, ensure open access rules, and mandate strong integrated regulatory
bodies aligned with international best practices. They indicated that the decision to privatize the
four main state refineries, along with a sector project to build a US$9 billion refinery, would make
an important contribution to modernizing the petroleum industry and could help accelerate
ongoing efforts to enhance transparency in fuel subsidy management processes and further
streamline the fuel subsidy regime. The authorities pointed also to the need to strengthen
provisions in the PIB to ensure more transparency and accountability in the oil industry.
19.
Addressing oil theft has strong AML/CFT implications. The Nigerian AML/CFT framework
contains important building blocks that can support a national strategy to combat oil theft and
related money laundering. The Presidential Committee on Financial Action Task Force (FATF) could
lead in the national coordination of AML measures to combat oil theft and related money
laundering. The ongoing National Money Laundering/Terrorism Financing Risk Assessment (NRA)
also provides a well-timed opportunity to include oil theft and related money-laundering risk as
part of its mandate. The IMF’s technical assistance (TA) has also helped enhance capacity to
conduct strategic analysis and typologies that could be applied to the study of oil theft and money
laundering, and staff recommended that such an exercise be conducted and its results
disseminated to all AML/CFT stakeholders. Financial and non-financial sector supervisors also have
the capacity to require and enforce explicit oil theft money-laundering controls using their
risk-based approach to supervision, including reporting of suspicious activities to the relevant
authorities.
20.
Authorities’ views. The authorities concur that oil theft is a profit-motivated crime with
money-laundering elements and that the existing AML/CFT framework could be mobilized to
support broader national efforts to mitigate oil theft and associated production and revenue losses.
There was broad agreement that the main AML/CFT stakeholders (i.e., the Presidential Committee

EITI compliance means the EITI Board considers that all of the EITI requirements have been met, but does not imply
full transparency in the oil sector (http://eiti.org/faqs#EITICompliant). The EITI audit reports have helped improve the
awareness of the governance issues in the extractive industries in general, but these reconciliations are retrospective
and need to be strengthened with reconciliations on an on-going basis.

Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, and the AML/CFT supervisors) could play a critical
supporting role in this endeavor, including by harnessing the role and cooperation of financial and
non-financial entities subject to Nigeria’s AML/CFT regime. The authorities expressed interest in TA
on strategic analysis and typologies exercises.

STRONG ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT,
NOTWITHSTANDING THE POLITICAL CYCLE
A. Preserving Fiscal Consolidation Through the Political Cycle
21.
Fiscal consolidation is progressing well, but fiscal buffers have been drawn down
sharply. General government expenditure declined by about 1 percentage point of GDP in
2012-2013, largely from policies to control personnel expenses in the federal government, including
by limiting compensation increases, consolidating pay bonuses, and enhancing payroll
administration processes. Actual capital expenditure has been below budget—but relatively stable
share in GDP—largely reflecting capacity constraints. Non-oil revenue as a share of GDP has
increased slightly, reflecting the rapid growth in non-oil GDP. In addition, SLGs have contained the
growth of expenditure, reflecting a relatively tight shared revenue envelope and their limited ability
to borrow. This has narrowed the NOPD from about 27 percent to 23½ percent of non-oil GDP over
the past year. However, ECA withdrawals were needed to offset lower oil revenue to all levels of
government, reducing the ECA buffer to about US$3 billion by end-2013 (equivalent to about one
month of federally collected revenue).
22.
Improvements have been made to the fiscal framework, but more needs to be done to
enhance fiscal control.5 The introduction of the Nigeria SWF in mid-July 2012 represented an
important strengthening in the management of oil revenues. The Nigeria SWF made its first
investment in September 2013, providing more than US$200 million to international banks to
manage a fixed-income portfolio. However, additional measures are needed to enable the
framework to serve as an effective fiscal anchor, ensure adequate fiscal buffers, and avoid
procyclical spending. For example: (i) the budget oil price is not formally instituted; (ii) the full
transition from the ECA to the Nigeria SWF has not occurred—excess crude revenues are still being
deposited in the ECA, which is managed by political agreement among federal, state, and local
governments and is subject to discretionary withdrawals; and (iii) the Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL)
does not cover the SLGs, which receive more than half of total oil revenue as prescribed in the
constitution. These factors imply that the federal government has only limited control over
macrofiscal management (Box 3).
5

The authorities’ fiscal framework is based on a budget oil reference price (set below the oil market price) and a
production volume that determines the expenditure envelope for all levels of government as well as the scope for
accumulating fiscal buffers. The framework is bounded by a 3 percent of GDP limit on the federal government deficit
provided by the 2007 Fiscal Responsibility Act and accompanied by limits for borrowing from the state and local
governments. For details on the fiscal framework see IMF Country Report No. 13/116, p. 8.

23.
The upcoming elections could test the resilience of the fiscal framework and the
consolidation plan. In the past, expenditure has been sensitive to elections, with the share of
primary balance in non-oil GDP increasing one year before and during the election year (text
figure). For example, a general raise for public sector wages was granted in 2010, less than a year
before the general election of 2011.

The 2014 budget is consistent with the medium-term consolidation plan, but its
implementation is subject to risks heightened in the context of the 2015 election. The 2014
budget has been crafted using a US$77.5 barrel reference price (below the reference price of US$79
used in 2013) and oil production of 2.388 million barrels per day (bpd) (about 5 percent lower than
in the 2013 budget).6 The budget assumes a continued fiscal effort in 2014, including a reduction of

buffers will be gradually rebuilt with the ECA increasing from US$3 billion to US$15 billion in the
next three years. Key risks to its implementation include the following:


The assumed oil production is 3¾ percent above its 2013 level, implying that the problem
of oil theft/production losses will be at least partially contained. Therefore, given the low
level of fiscal buffers, potential disruptions in oil production are likely to require additional
debt issuance to finance the projected expenditure levels.



The assumed savings in payroll expenditure will require determined implementation. Initial
efforts to clean up payrolls through the implementation of the Integrated Personnel and

The government originally proposed a budget oil price of US$74 a barrel for 2014. However, the National Assembly
agreed on a price of US$77.5 a barrel for the price of oil; the detailed budget is still under discussion. Staff
expenditure projections are based on a slightly higher oil price of US$79 a barrel.

Payroll Information System (IPPIS) have been very successful—about 20 percent of the
federal workforce (about 200,000 civil servants) had been targeted and more than 45,000
erroneous payroll records have been corrected. However, expanding the IPPIS to the rest of
the federal workforce, including the armed and security forces, health care professionals,
and educators may be difficult. In addition, with relatively rapid growth in the non-oil
sector, it could be challenging to keep public sector wages frozen without affecting service
delivery.


The medium-term consolidation plan implies a stable federal government capital budget of
about 2 percent of GDP a year. However, in the past there has been an uptick in the use of
the capital budget in election years—for example, in 2011 capital releases were about
71 percent of the budget levels compared to an average of 52 percent in 2010, 2012, and
2013—suggestive of potential pressures to increase this expenditure during the political
cycle. Moreover, consolidation efforts should aim to create space for, and enhance the
quality of public investment, with positive benefits for key sectors including agriculture.



The projected long-term decline in oil revenue will necessitate additional fiscal effort,
particularly for SLGs whose revenues are projected to decline by nearly ½ a percentage
point of GDP over 2016-2018. Given their limited ability to borrow, the key will be to raise
revenues independently or reduce expenditure but without affecting service provision,
particularly in key areas such as health care and education.

25.
The consolidation momentum needs to be preserved through the 2015 election cycle
and beyond. Rebuilding the ECA fiscal buffer to an adequate level to offset oil-revenue shocks
(potentially of about US$15 billion to US$20 billion) and supporting macroeconomic stability
requires a resolute implementation of the MTEF and a strong fiscal framework. This should be
based on four pillars: (i) strengthening oil-revenue management; (ii) containing expenditure and
increasing the quality of spending, ensuring service delivery in key areas such as education and
health care;8 (iii) boosting non-oil revenue through ongoing initiatives to enhance tax
administration, curtail exemptions, and reduce evasion. Non-oil revenue mobilization could be
further underpinned by broadening the value-added tax (VAT) base, continuing extension of
automated tax collections, simplifying tax laws, and reducing transfer-pricing risks; and
(iv) establishing FRLs for states, to further enhance the MTEF guidance of the fiscal policy of the
general government. This could include states adopting a balanced-budget rule that could help
limit the potential state and local budget slippages and reduce the incentives for ad hoc ECA
withdrawals.
8

Early successes in the Subsidy Reinvestment and Empowerment Program (SURE-P) could be leveraged to build
broader support for the eventual full deregulation of fuel prices to strengthen the safety net, including the
Conditional Grant Scheme (CGS) (addressing weaknesses in education, health care, water, and sanitation) and the
Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) (which has reached more than 60,000 households in extreme poverty). Further
expansion of these programs should be underpinned by a strong framework for monitoring and evaluation to
improve service delivery in an affordable way.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGERIA

26.
Authorities’ views. The authorities agreed on the need to further strengthen the fiscal
framework and reiterated that the government would keep its fiscal consolidation on track. Oil
revenue management initiatives are also underway. Expenditure restraint is central to the
authorities’ 2014 budget. The authorities pointed to their ability to contain salaries and clean up
payroll in the past two years as evidence of their commitment to control the wage bill. The
expansion of the IPPIS started in December 2013, by including the police force (about
200,000 individuals) and should be expanded to most of the remaining federal government workers
by end-2014. On capital spending, the authorities argued that the 2014 budgeted level reflects the
current capacity and prioritizes the completion of existing capital projects. They also see potential
quick gains from improved non-oil revenue administration, which could deliver up to
US$500 million (a 6 percent increase in non-oil revenue) in 2014. The authorities agreed with the
need to strengthen the safety net, but noted the low political appetite for further subsidy removal.
The authorities acknowledged that the states have limited capacity to borrow—any debt issuance
request is carefully evaluated by the Debt Management Office (DMO) taking into account the state
revenue capacity—and indicated that FRLs have already been approved by 12 states.
27.
Nigeria’s public financial management (PFM) capacity is improving, but needs to be
strengthened. Thus far, the Government Integrated Financial Management Information System
(GIFMIS) has continued to support the rollout of the Treasury Single Account (TSA), which has been
implemented in 217 entities (about 60 percent of the ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs)
of the federal government). In addition, the GIFMIS has deployed several other functionalities
including the budget preparation component (which has helped the 2014 budget process). Looking
forward, the resolute implementation of PFM reforms is crucial to the ongoing consolidation efforts.
This should include the expansion of the TSA to the remaining entities of the federal government,
ideally prioritized by size to include first large entities such as the armed and security forces. In
addition, it would be important to establish protocols for public entities outside the federal
government—which are responsible for a substantial portion of public expenditure—to be
gradually added to the TSA, including SLGs.

28.
Authorities’ views. The authorities are committed to continue the rollout of the TSA in
2014 to the remaining MDAs. However, they indicated potential challenges to expand the system to
MDAs outside of Abuja. In addition, their current focus is initially limited to the federal government,
given issues of fiscal federalism that limit the ability of the central government to control the cash
management practices of the SLGs.

B. Monetary, Financial, and Exchange Rate Policies
29.
The monetary policy stance is appropriate to safeguard macro-financial stability. The
monetary policy committee (MPC) has set the inflation target for 2014 at 6-9 percent, above the
5-percent target of the Convergence Council of the ECOWAS (Figure 1). During 2013, the CBN has
maintained its policy interest rate corridor (12 percent +/- 200 basis points), but in July raised the
banks’ cash reserve requirement (CRR) on public deposits from 12 percent to 50 percent. At the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

NIGERIA

same time, the CBN has been sterilizing capital inflows by increasing issuance of CBN bills,
smoothing temporary fluctuations in the exchange rate to limit exchange rate pass-through on
inflation. Moreover, given the risk of fiscal slippage and potential capital outflows associated with
changing investor sentiment, maintaining high interest rates with a stable exchange rate would
reduce the risk of highly destabilizing capital outflows, and consequent pressure on the exchange
rate.
30.
Managing liquidity remains challenging. Staff acknowledged Nigeria-specific
circumstances that motivated an increase in the CRR on public sector deposits; in particular, the still
limited coverage of the TSA with about a half of public sector deposits held in commercial banks.
Staff however noted that the increase in the CRR poses costs on banks, and recommended more
reliance, going forward, on open market operations to guide short-term interest rates to conduct
monetary policy. Staff also noted that the current policy stance poses a concern about longer-term
inclusive growth: while inflation has come down from 12½ percent at the beginning for 2012 to
8 percent at end-2013, lending rates remained unchanged reflecting no changes in the monetary
policy rate established by the CBN, so that the maximum real cost of borrowing has increased from
10 percent to 17 percent, amplifying barriers to the growth of SMEs that have no access to the
equity market.
31.
Authorities’ views. The authorities were in broad agreement with staff’s assessment on the
appropriateness of the tight monetary policy stance. They also agreed on the blunt nature of the
CRR, but argued that because financial markets do not always work in a rational manner, sending a
strong signal of CBN’s commitment to keep inflation low was critical to the monetary policy stance
because of the risks for capital flow reversals and fiscal slippages. In particular, they stressed that
CRR effectiveness should be assessed based on its broader economic impact, in particular its
benefit to managing liquidity in the banking system and its capacity to contribute to broadening
the coverage of the TSA.

32.

The stable naira policy has provided confidence to markets. Pursuing exchange rate
stability has worked well so far, contributing to bringing inflation down to single digits, providing a
conducive environment for investing in domestic government securities and the equity market, and
accumulating international reserves. Reserve buffers are deemed adequate—the current level of
reserves (5.7 months of prospective imports) is close to the optimal level implied by standard
metrics—(Appendix 5), but staff pointed out risks from medium-term oil price developments,
potential capital outflows associated with expected UMP tapering, political uncertainty through the
election cycle, and low fiscal buffers. The external sector assessment finds a moderate overvaluation
of the naira in 2013, though caution is warranted given the quality of balance of payments data, in
particular the size of errors and omissions (outflow of 3 percent of GDP in 2012). If the underlying
supply-demand imbalance continues and persistent pressures emerge, staff underscored that the
exchange rate should be allowed to adjust. At the same time, staff also encouraged a continuation
of improvements in productivity-enhancing measures to improve non-price competitiveness to
bolster non-oil exports, while enforcing security to curtail oil theft/production losses to strengthen
external positions. Increased demand for dollars, coupled with administrative limits in the last

quarter of 2013 on sales to the Bureau de Change (BDC) segment (about 16 percent of the market
as of September 2013), resulted in a widening of the spread in the official-BDC rate, from an
average of 1.5 percent in the first half of 2013 to 9 percent at end-December.9 The CBN has since
lifted these limits, authorized dealers are now free to sell to BDCs subject to compliance with
AML/FT laws and other foreign exchange regulations, and the spread in the official-BDC rate has
narrowed.

33.
Authorities’ views. The authorities were in broad agreement with a number of factors that
could potentially put the naira under pressure over the medium term. They pointed to the
asymmetric adjustment of fiscal policy: when oil revenues decline, the ECA is drawn down and
borrowing and debt service increase because the size of the wage bill limits the government’s
ability to reduce spending. In particular, they pointed out that the weakening of the fiscal position,
affecting the exchange rate, mainly owed to oil theft, which is a criminal issue, and has to be
addressed through security measures and introducing stringent rules to track oil revenue.
34.
The banking sector is well capitalized and with low NPLs, but implementation of the
key recommendations in the 2012 FSAP Update would further enhance financial stability
(Table 6). While financial soundness indicators generally point to strong commercial bank
performance, staff noted that net foreign liabilities had increased in the past 2 to 3 years—from
26.2 percent of core capital (share capital and reserve fund) at end 2011 (at the time of the FSAP
Update) to 69.5 percent at end-December 2013. While part of these open positions may be hedged,
staff recommends that the CBN closely monitor foreign exchange exposures and the adequacy of
bank equity. Given the volume of interbank transactions, including with discount houses, and of

System (RDAS), tightened reporting requirements, and imposed weekly limits on the sale of foreign exchange to the

foreign currency operations, the CBN should more closely monitor the level and nature of such
transactions and the open foreign exchange positions of banks. Staff welcomes the authorities’
reactions to FSAP recommendations (Box 4). In particular, staff welcomes the authorities’ directive
for the Asset Management Company of Nigeria (AMCON) to redeem by end-2013 all its debt held
by deposit money banks (DMBs)10 and not to purchase additional assets from banks which could
encourage moral hazard and imprudent risk taking in the sector. Staff commends the CBN’s
collaboration on the use of cross-border supervisory arrangements, notably memoranda of
understanding (MOUs) and participation in a regional College of Supervisors. Further, the mission
encourages enhanced participation in on-site inspections of all Nigerian banks operating abroad,
particularly in countries where the supervisory framework is not as developed as in Nigeria.
35.
Authorities’ views. The authorities noted that the AMCON is closing for all practical
purposes: it is no longer purchasing NPLs, and it has a financing plan for ten years. They expressed
a preference, however, for a longer period for winding down AMCON than the proposed sunset of
end-2017 as recommended in the FSAP, and maintaining an inactive ―shell.‖ In principle, this would
allow them to reduce future ―cost‖ in the event of need for a similar institution. The authorities
agreed with the need to continue to strengthen the prudential framework and expressed interest in
additional TA on Financial Soundness Indicators.

C. Improving Competitiveness and Productivity
36.
To achieve the goals of the 2020 vision and the Transformation Agenda, planned
structural reforms to boost productivity and competitiveness must be implemented. Growth
has been mainly driven by subsistence-based and informal agriculture, trade, and services. Wage
jobs have also not recovered from a significant decline following the privatization of various
parastatals in the mid-2000s, the impact of the recent global financial crisis, and increased
competition from Indian and Chinese companies in textiles. In this context, to improve
competitiveness the authorities have been implementing the Transformation Agenda aimed at
promoting an inclusive growth policy based on economic diversification, by improving power
supply and enhancing the value chain of agriculture-manufacturing. In particular, they have been
reviewing the tariff and non-tariff structure, and increasing import protection on a number of
agricultural products, notably by raising duties levied on rice to 100 percent.

10

All AMCON bonds held by DMBs are to be redeemed by October 2014. All AMCON bonds held by the CBN will
then be bought back by AMCON using the Sinking Fund: to which DMBs contribute 0.5 percent of their assets in the
next ten years.

(telecommunications). In this round of consultations, staff focused on reforms aimed at increasing
the delivery of power, broadening the agricultural base, and increasing access to finance for SMEs.
38.
Reforms in the power sector are advancing. The objective of the power reform is to
reduce the cost of doing business in Nigeria and encourage investment in the sector by creating a
private sector–led electricity market. The physical handover to private tenders of 10 distribution
companies (DisCos) and 4 legacy generation companies (GenCos) to new owners on November 1,
2013, was a significant milestone. In addition, the recently launched Access Power initiative of the
federal government and the signature of MOUs are expected to enhance power infrastructure and
access to electricity. Staff stressed the need to ensure timely and adequate public investments to
increase and improve transmission capacity (which is not being privatized). Therefore, staff
welcomes the authorities’ decision to allocate half of the Nigeria Independent Power Producers’
privatization proceeds (US$1.3 billion) to fund critical transmission projects, while stressing the need
to strengthen the provision of lifeline tariffs for low-income households.
11

Lending to SMEs is a mere 5 percent of the total lending of commercial banks, and banks finance only 3 percent
of SME working capital and 2 percent of their fixed assets (2011 survey for SME Finance Study (World Bank).

12

Care should be exercised when interpreting these indicators given subjective interpretation, limited coverage of
business constraints, and a small number of respondents, which tend to overstate the indicators' coverage and
explanatory power (www.worldbank.org/ieg/doingbusiness).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

39.
Reforms to unlock Nigeria’s agriculture potential are on track, but caution should be
observed in designing supporting measures. The broad objective of reform is to transform the
agriculture sector into a modern and market-oriented sector, reduce poverty, enhance employment,
and diversify the economy. Accordingly, staff supports the Growth Enhancement Support (GES)
scheme that helps to foster private sector–led marketing of seeds and fertilizers, and accelerates
private-sector investment in domestic fertilizer manufacturing. Also the establishment of free zones
is helping to accelerate reforms. These reforms appear to have unleashed rice production potential.
However, staff noted that although time-bound support measures can be useful in encouraging
private investment at its nascent stage, fiscal costs should be contained and the focus should
continue to be on improving the business climate by addressing structural bottlenecks, reducing
the costs of doing business, and improving overall governance. High tariffs recently introduced on
selected agricultural products (for example, rice, wheat) should be temporary with a clear exit
strategy (Appendix 7).
40.
Improving access to financial services for SMEs. SMEs have suffered from limited access
to credit or other financial services. Although staff welcomes government measures to ease access
to credit, regular performance reviews of credit and guarantee schemes should be undertaken to
detect problems early and improve effectiveness. In addition, these schemes should be funded from
fiscal sources. Staff also noted that financial education should be expanded and reforms accelerated
to improve credit reporting systems (to minimise adverse selection by banks) and ensure
enforcement of lenders’ rights over collateral.
41.
Authorities’ views. The authorities are committed to continuing the achievements so far to
reform the power and agriculture sectors and improve SMEs’ access to financial services. In the
power sector, they broadly agreed with staff on the need to scale up investments in the
transmission infrastructure, while protecting lifeline tariffs for low-income households. They
indicated that the federal government has developed a broad social safety program and a lifeline
tariff for those households consuming below 50 Kwh/month, with each DisCo’s lifeline tariffs
reflecting specific costs, location, and consumer profile. In agriculture, the authorities argued that
the changed tariff structure was mainly aimed at protecting the value chain of rice and wheat
production, where Nigeria spends most of its hard currencies, and that the overall policy objective
is to reduce poverty and create jobs. They agree however on the principle that those measures
should be time bound, but they did not however foresee any sunset clause. They stressed that
financial schemes to ease access by SMEs to financial services mainly reflect high lending rates, and
are aimed to ameliorate the high cost of borrowing.

STAFF APPRAISAL
42.
Macroeconomic performance has been broadly positive, but indicators of inclusive
growth remain low. The non-oil sector continues to record solid growth, while inflation has
declined and a comfortable reserve position has been maintained despite uncertainties created by
the timing of the tapering of UMP. A shortfall in oil revenues resulted in a drawdown of the ECA, a
key fiscal buffer. Continued weaknesses in labor markets, access to electricity, cost of doing
business, and SMEs’ access to finance have prevented a transition to a more robust and more
inclusive growth path.
43.
Economic growth is expected to improve in 2014, but risks are elevated and will need
to be managed. Key risks are (i) uncertainty about the pace of global recovery; (ii) unwinding of
UMP; (iii) persistently lower oil prices; (iv) persistent oil production losses; (v) continuation of
insurgency in the North; and (vi) low political consensus for key reforms. To manage those risks,
policies should focus on boosting external and rebuilding fiscal buffers, avoiding spending
pressures from the political cycle, improving oil-revenue management, undertaking structural
reforms to boost growth and job creation, and strengthening governance frameworks.
44.
The 2014 budget is consistent with the authorities’ medium-term fiscal consolidation
objectives that remain appropriate. The adoption of a conservative oil benchmark price and oil
production level, freezing allocations for salaries, and focusing on completing existing capital
projects in the 2014 budget should facilitate the achievement of these objectives. Ongoing public
financial management reforms—notably the extension of the TSA and information systems in key
federal institutions—should enable expenditure efficiencies and strengthen service delivery.
Improved oil revenue management—migrating from the ECA to the SWF, incorporating a
rule-based budget oil price, and supporting greater transparency in the management of the fuel
subsidy—together with steps to enhance non-oil revenue mobilization, will also help achieve the
authorities’ consolidation targets. Programs to fight poverty and alleviate inequalities are welcome,
and implementation of strong monitoring and evaluation frameworks should help improve service
delivery at low cost.
45.
Strengthening the transparency and governance of the oil sector is crucial for
rebuilding external and fiscal buffers. Recent measures have helped contain oil theft, but
additional steps—such as passing a sound PIB with enhanced provisions and stringent enforcement
clauses and implementing regular auditing and monitoring of oil revenue management processes—
are needed. AML/CFT measures and a multicountry partner strategy could also contribute.
46.
Maintaining a tight monetary policy stance is appropriate, given that growth remains
strong and there is risk of fiscal slippage and potential for capital outflows. Recent
adjustments of reserve requirements to manage liquidity create costs to financial-sector
development, and staff encouraged greater reliance on open market operations to guide
short-term interest rates. The stability of the naira has supported confidence in the economy and

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

helped bring down inflation. In the event of persistent pressures, greater flexibility in the exchange
rate may be needed to respond to shocks.
47.
The financial system has been resilient to recent shocks, and further actions to
implement the key recommendations of the 2012 FSAP Update could further strengthen
financial stability. Available financial soundness indicators point to adequate levels of capital and
low levels of NPLs. Reflecting the evolution of the financial system, closer monitoring of the nature
and level of interbank transactions, including with discount houses, and the foreign currency
positions of banks will be desirable. The recent directive for AMCON to phase out its activities is a
welcome step to exiting the legacy of the 2009 banking crisis. Staff commended the CBN’s
collaboration on cross-border supervisory arrangements and encouraged enhanced onsite
inspections of Nigerian banks operating abroad, particularly in countries where the supervisory
framework is less developed than in Nigeria.
48.
Implementing wide-ranging structural reforms should improve competitiveness and
productivity. Consistent with the Transformation Agenda, key priority areas are to increase the
delivery of power, broaden the agricultural base, and increase access to finance for SMEs. Timely
and adequate public investment is needed to increase and improve transmission capacity and
support power generation. Recently introduced high tariffs on selected agricultural products create
distortions and should be temporary, with sectoral growth underpinned by improvements in
competitiveness rather than by protectionist measures. Specialized credit and guarantee schemes
can encourage financial access but regular reviews should be undertaken to detect problems early
and improve effectiveness.
49.
Nigeria’s macroeconomic statistics are broadly adequate for surveillance. The
authorities’ focus on ensuring the accuracy and credibility of the rebasing of GDP is appropriate and
the release of the new national accounts, expected in early 2014, as well as planned census of
business, increased use of biometrics, and a household living conditions survey will strengthen the
basis for informed policy making and private-sector investment decisions. However, continued
improvements to data collection and dissemination in the balance of payments and state and local
fiscal accounts remain a high priority.
50.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

Table 7. Nigeria: Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM)1

Source of
Threat
Oil price shock

Likelihood

Impact

MEDIUM
• Protracted period of slower
growth in advanced and
emerging economies could
lead to a fall in oil prices.

MEDIUM
• Given Nigeria’s heavy reliance on
oil exports and revenue, oil price
volatility directly affects the whole
economy: drawdown on the
Excess Crude Account (ECA)
would in particular be severe
(Figure 6).

LOW to MEDIUM
• Prolonged oil theft and
production losses will
translate into a weakening
of the economy.

MEDIUM
• Scenario analysis (Figure 8)
shows that if the level of oil
production losses were to
continue, the current account
balance and gross international
reserves will deteriorate rapidly.

Recommended Policy Response

• Rebuild the ECA balance by
implementing regular effective
reconciliation processes, while
containing recurrent expenditure
and prioritizing spending in favor
of high-return infrastructure
projects.
• Boost non-oil revenues.

Continued Oil
theft and
production
losses

• Improve oil sector oversight by
strengthening the regulatory
framework (e.g., passing a sound
Petroleum Industry Bill) and
security arrangements and
engaging in a multicountry partner
strategy.
• Boost non-oil exports by
diversifying the economy and
improving competitiveness and
productivity.

Weaker fiscal
policy stance

Substantial
deterioration
of security in
the North of
Nigeria

MEDIUM
MEDIUM
• Fiscal stance has weakened • A looser fiscal policy, with little
ahead of previous elections. increase in pro-growth spending
and delays in much needed
structural reforms would adversely
affect growth.

LOW
• The campaign of violence
being waged by Boko
Haram has adversely
affected agriculture and
commerce in the North.

• Continue enhancing fiscal
control (e.g., formula-based
budget oil price; full transition to
Sovereign Wealth Fund; Fiscal
Responsibility Laws for state
governments).

• It can also lead to inflation and
crowding out of the private sector. • Better manage the banking sector
liquidity as well as public finance
management by expanding the
coverage of Treasury Single
Account (TSA).
MEDIUM
• If the conflict intensifies, the

• Strengthen social safety net by

Empowerment Program (SURE-P).
• Continue with reforms in the
agriculture sector.

Protracted
economic and
financial
volatility

HIGH
• Prospective exit from UMP
continues to result in
economic and financial
volatility.

1

MEDIUM
• Given the relatively open capital
account of Nigeria, this could
adversely affect macroeconomic
and financial stability.

• Enhance prudential supervision.
• If persistent pressures emerge in
the foreign exchange market, the
exchange rate should be allowed to
adjust.

The RAM shows events that could materially alter the baseline path and reflects staff views on the source of risks and
overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non mutually exclusive risks may interact
and materialize jointly.

Box 1. Nigeria: Authorities’ Response to Past IMF Policy Recommendations
The authorities have been pursuing policies consistent with staff recommendations. Notable progress has
been achieved in fiscal consolidation and public financial management (PFM); financial sector supervision
and regulation; and the privatization of power generation and distribution and agriculture reform.
Fiscal policy—strong progress observed, but more is needed.

The authorities are staying the course in fiscal consolidation and expect to rebuild fiscal buffers and to
promote fiscal stability in the medium term. Improved administration of the petroleum subsidy has
been a key contributor to the strengthening of the fiscal position. Subsidy administration has also
become more transparent, making it easier for oil marketers to follow the subsidy payment process.
The SURE Program has helped to scale up investment in priority sectors. However, further improved
project management and evaluation, and availability of information to the public would help obtain
needed consensus on the reform subsidy agenda. .
IMF-World Bank-supported reforms in PFM are advancing. The number of public sector entities
covered by the Treasury Single Account (TSA) has doubled from [95] in 2012. Modules developed in the
context of the Government Integrated Financial Management Information System GIFMIS have
contributed to improving the formulation of the 2014 budget. At the same time, initiatives to mobilize
non-oil tax revenues (e.g., use of outside consultants) and improve tax administration will contribute to
reducing fiscal risks.
Monetary and financial policy— supervision and regulation have improved.
Following the 2009 financial crisis, the authorities and staff have broadly agreed on the appropriate
monetary policy stance. Monetary policy has been kept tight given the risks of potential reversal of
capital inflows and possible fiscal slippage. This contributed to bringing and maintaining inflation to
single digit levels for the last 11 months. Progress is being made in all key areas of the Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP) recommendations, in particular in enhancing consolidated and crossborder bank supervision, building capacity for effective implementation of the International Financial
Reporting Standard (IFRS), and adopting a macroprudential framework. To minimize potential fiscal and
moral hazard risks, the 2012 FSAP also recommended setting a formal sunset provision on AMCON
operations by 2017. This recommendation has not been adopted, but efforts have been made to phase
out AMCON’s activities.
With respect to the anti-money-laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT)
framework, both the action plan agreed with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the removal of
Nigeria from the FATF’s International Cooperation Review Group (ICRG) list on October 18, 2013, are
positive developments.
Structural reform— reforms in the power and the agriculture sectors are advancing.
The transfer of Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) assets in November to distribution and
generation companies (DisCos and GenCos) was a significant milestone in the privatization of the
power sector. To reap the full benefit of expanded generation capacity, however, it is important to
ensure adequate and timely investment in the transmission subsector [as well as produce and transmit
electricity at relatively low cost]. Agriculture production has increased significantly. Reforms are helping
to enhance the system for distribution of seeds and fertilizers, effecting a biometric system of
registration for farmers, and promoting export and attracting investment. But more needs to be done,
including addressing the low access to credit and other financial services by small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) and passing a sound anti-money-laundering and combating the financing of
terrorism (PIB).

Box 2. Nigeria: Strengthening the Monitoring and Reconciliation of Oil Revenue
Flows
The recent decline in oil revenue underscores the need to strengthen the oversight of oil revenue
flows. The evolution of oil prices and volume does not fully explain the drop in oil revenue. In 2013 oil
prices were 12 percent higher and production 10 percent higher than in 2008, yet oil revenue was
20 percent lower. The oil revenue yield—the ratio of revenue received by the Federation Account to the

Recent efforts to strengthen oil revenue monitoring are promising, but more needs to be done.
The Federation Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC) conducts monthly meetings to ensure the
prompt and accurate distribution of the Federation Account resources to different levels of government.2
Oil revenue monitoring largely is done through pre-FAAC and post-mortem FAAC exercises, under which
the different agencies that manage oil revenue (including OAGF, NNPC, FIRS, DPR, and the CBN) submit
data, reconcile data, and examine revenue performance relative to the budget. However, the different
agencies do not use an integrated system of accounting, making it a challenge to settle claims across
agencies—the FAAC subcommittees rely on the information provided by the different entities.3
Furthermore, the 2012 NEITI review and reconciliation exercise highlighted the lack of

For example, OAGF and NNPC have not settled debts to each other related to domestic oil revenue

clarity on the remittance of dividends from Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG), third-party
arrangements that could mask contingent liabilities, implications for fuel subsidies from use of domestic
crude allocation, and several accounting discrepancies, including realized oil revenue payments that did
not match CBN statements.
Further measures to enhance the oversight of oil revenue flows could focus on a few critical areas:
“Domestic” oil. The domestic sales of refined products and subsidy payments do not appear to have a
clean accounting framework, which often generates disputes between NNPC, OAGF, and PPPRA.
Cash calls and alternative funding arrangements. Traditional Joint Venture (JV) arrangements require
cash calls for funding projects. However, NEITI noted that this budget money for the purpose seems to
be used to finance non-cash call items. The process of alternative funding could also be improved.
Capital and operational expenditure. Capacity should be developed to improve procedures for
budgeting, justifying, and auditing these costs.
Interagency liabilities. NEITI estimated a “debt” from NNPC to the Federation Account of about
US$8.5 billion (including cost of crude-subsidy deductions and transfers for cash calls) at end-2011.
Most recently, disputes have continued on the size of the outstanding liabilities related to oil subsidies
between the Federation Account and NNPC.
Accounting systems. The accounting system should be able to register crude oil sales and collections in
real time to ensure speedy sweep of funds. In addition, it is crucial to integrate procurement, accounting,
and inventory systems (including product receipt, discharge, and physical balance) across all agencies.
Further, the recording of transactions should facilitate easy reconciliation and analysis, increasing
transparency, accountability, and decision making.
The recent experience in Angola offers a template for a streamlined monitoring and reconciliation
process. In Angola, a presidential decree4 established a system of accountability and statistical
information of the oil business, for better planning and implementation of economic and financial policy.
The decree established a working group comprising the main agencies dealing with oil revenue flows
(including the ministries of Finance, Petroleum, and Planning, the central bank, the national oil company,
and private oil companies) to verify, reconcile, and evaluate oil revenue flows. Specifically, these agencies
are required to provide information on production volume, average price of exports, committed gross oil
revenue to cover liabilities, gross oil revenue used to finance infrastructure, and quasi-fiscal operations,
with strict deadlines (typically 21 days after the end of the reporting month). The working group reports
monthly to the president, including on gaps between sales and declared revenue, as well as the
distribution of revenue to mandated accounts.

Box 3. The Challenge of Fiscal Federalism in Nigeria
Nigeria has a federal system of government with substantial revenue sharing between layers of
government. The administrative structure comprises 36 states, a federal capital territory, and 774 local
authorities. The constitution allocates responsibilities for the delivery of public services across the
different levels of government, supported by revenue-sharing agreements1 75 percent of total
consolidated government revenue is

Assembly and can be updated every five
years by the National Assembly, based on recommendations from the Revenue Mobilization Allocation
and Fiscal Commission. Current formulas assign about 38 percent of distributable revenue to the FG,
56 percent to SLG, and 6 percent to EBFs.2 For oil revenue, the formulas put an important weight to the
principle of derivation—the constitution mandates that no less than 13 percent of the oil revenue to be
allocated to the states endowed with natural resources.3 In addition, to determine the distribution
across states, the formulas consider horizontal principles (40 percent of the revenue state allocation is
distributed equally across states) and equity considerations (60 percent of allocation is distributed
depending on population, land mass, internal revenue generation, school enrollment, hospital beds,
and rainfall).

__________________
1

The constitution sets an exclusive list for the federal government (including national interest, defense, international affairs,
elections, roads and railways), a joint list for the federal government and the states (including electricity, industry,
commerce and agriculture, research, statistics, higher education, health, and social welfare), a joint list for the state and
local governments (including primary, adult, and vocational education; health care; agricultural; and non-mineral natural
resources), and an exclusive list for local governments (streets, public facilities, sewage).

2

The revenue sharing formula for revenues accruing to the Federation Account is as follows: Federal Government (48.5
percent), State Governments (26.72 percent), Local Governments (20.6 percent), and Special funds (4.18 percent). The
formula for revenues in the VAT pool account is as follows: Federal Government (14 percent), Federal Capital Territory (1
percent), State Governments (50 percent), and Local Governments (35 percent).

3

This has been a contentious issue over the years. Initially the law was interpreted as including both onshore and offshore
revenue as the base for derivation. However, in 2002 the Supreme Court determined that offshore revenue was not to be
included in the derivation revenues. This was reversed by the National Assembly in 2004 that passed an act deeming the
offshore areas as part of the states “for purposes of accruing to the federation account” (http://bit.ly/1bRwa6o).

Box 3. The Challenge of Fiscal Federalism in Nigeria (concluded)
A political agreement underpins the current framework to manage oil revenue volatility in
this complex federal fiscal system. Only 7 percent of SLG revenue is derived from independent
sources—63 percent depends on shared oil revenue and 30 percent on shared non-oil revenue—
raising important questions on the macrostability of the revenue sharing arrangements. To limit
the exposure of SLG budgets to oil revenue volatility, a political agreement was reached in 2004
to limit distributable oil revenue by a budget oil price and volume of production. Under this
agreement, realized oil revenue above the budget amount is transferred to the ECA (about
17 percent of total consolidated revenue has been transferred over the past three years). The
ownership shares in the ECA are the same as the revenue-sharing formulas for distributable
revenue.
The current federal fiscal arrangements pose several challenges for macrofiscal management.

The fiscal federalism framework does not seem robust enough to ensure fiscal discipline of
SLG, commensurate with the large transfer of resources. The ECA framework depends on a
political agreement, which is not rooted in legislation. This results in recurrent disputes
surrounding ad hoc withdrawals from the ECA, which help to augment the spending
envelope of the SLG as well as reduce incentives to control expenditure or raise independent
revenue. In addition, although there are limitations on the issuance of debt by SLGs,
borrowing from banks and nonbank sources is possible.
Blurry federalism lines are partly responsible for the reluctance of many states to support
further transition to the SWF. Several states have challenged the legality of the SWF
framework, on grounds that states and local governments should decide on whether to
invest or spend their share of oil revenue autonomously. These questions have stalled
funding of the SWF beyond the initial US$1 billion seed funding.
Guaranteed transfers to SLG highlight the need to ensure the quality of expenditure and
governance. Revenue sharing formulas do not take into account expenditure capacity
considerations. For example, an increase in VAT rates would result in higher revenue for all of
the states, potentially leading to inefficient expenditure, particularly in the absence of strong
governance structures.
Fiscal shocks can be augmented by poor policy coordination. For example, a large shock to
oil revenue would result in lower distributable revenue, which would eventually lead to
adjustments across the different tiers of government. Without effective coordinating
mechanisms, these adjustments might lead to duplication or lack of provision of certain
services or types of expenditure (capital investment) with adverse macro impacts.
Disparities across regions can be difficult to address by current federal fiscal arrangements.
The revenue sharing formulas are not based on a definition of a minimum set of public
services per capita, regardless of state of residence. This limits the ability to address the large
disparities across states (for example, most of the North Eastern states have substantially
higher than average absolute poverty rates).
Data weaknesses prevent a reliable assessment of the fiscal positions of SLGs, posing
challenges for macro-policy formulation. The CBN conducts fiscal surveys, but further efforts
are needed to ensure consistency of the data to allow for consolidation across the different
levels of governments.

Box 4. Follow-up on the 2012 FSAP Recommendations
The 2012 FSAP Update made recommendations in four key areas: (i) establish a more
coherent framework for supervision with a strong resolution mechanism while strengthening
capacity of supervisors and regulators; (ii) institute compulsory insurance requirements for the
insurance sector with improved disclosure standards and resolution mechanisms and
expeditiously nominate members of the Board of the Securities and Exchange Commission
SEC); (iii) with the financial crisis ended, start unwinding crisis measures and continue to
strengthen the crisis prevention and resolution framework; and (iv) improve access by small
and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to the formal financial sector to meet their financing
needs.
Significant progress has been made on strengthening the bank supervision and
resolution framework. A roadmap for improving supervisory capacity has been developed
and in April 2013 a Framework for Consolidated Supervision of Financial Institutions in Nigeria
was established by the Financial Services Regulation Coordinating Committee (FSRCC). The
authorities are strengthening macroprudential oversight and crisis preparedness with better
functioning of the FSRCC. A diagnostic study of the entire financial system is underway, with
support of outside consultants. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has also increased the use of
cross-border supervisory collaboration arrangements, including the conduct of cross-border
onsite inspections of Nigerian banks operating abroad jointly with host supervisors or on its
own. In 2012, the CBN entered into four more memoranda of understanding (MOUs) (out of
15 MOUs executed in total) and initiated arrangements for five more in 2013. It is also in the
process of establishing a College of Supervisors for one of its main banks, which should be
completed soon. The Board for the SEC was announced on December 22, 2012.
In terms of the crisis resolution and prevention framework, a sunset provision for
AMCON has not been formally established, but AMCON is being gradually phased out.
AMCON has been directed not to engage in further acquisitions of nonperforming loans
(NPLs) and strengthened its balance sheet by repaying at end-2013 maturing bonds held by
banks. Further, the bonds held by the CBN that mature during 2014 will be refinanced for 10
additional years, while a bond repayment sinking fund will be established with annual
contributions by banks and the CBN.
Other FSAP recommendations—such as in the nonbank financial sector—have longer
implementation timelines and will be covered in future Article IV consultations.

Appendix I. Changing Trends in Oil Markets?
1.
The United States is poised to be the world’s largest oil producer. Since 2010, worldwide
oil supply has grown at an unprecedented rate, outpacing consumption—the world total oil
supply is projected to reach about 106 mbd by 2018, while demand would rise to 96 mbd. This
shift in production is mainly supported by Iraq, the United States, Canada, and Brazil, with the
United States the surprising factor in this changing picture (text figure). Sustained high oil prices

grow by 3.9 mbd,
accounting for about half
of the increase in world oil output by 2018. Thus, oil production in the United States is set to
overtake that in Saudi Arabia and Russia by the second half of this decade.
2.
The shale/tight oil and gas boom is transforming the oil product market. In particular, it
has caused an unexpected and unseen quality shift in the global crude mix toward more light
and sweet crude, including large volumes of field condensate. Consequently, other sectors of the
oil industry—mainly refining and trading—that had been predicated mostly on heavier and
sourer grades have started to adjust to the new crude mix. This new mix is also affecting product
markets: increased domestic consumption of U.S. oil production, in part owing to current U.S. law
restricting most crude exports, has significantly reduced U.S. imports. At the same time, the surge
in U.S. shale gas production and subsequent lower gas prices have encouraged increased gas
consumption.
3.
Lower U.S. import volumes, however, have mainly affected African countries. The
staggering growth of the oil/gas output and the continued increase in energy efficiency helped
to sharply reduce U.S. oil imports, which fell to 8.5 mbd in 2012, the lowest level since 1997.
Lower U.S. imports, however, have mainly affected African oil-producing countries supplying

oil). Since July 2010, U.S. imports
from Nigeria have decreased by
about half (according to data from
the U.S. Energy Information
Administration), while Angolan
imports are down by the same
magnitude (to less than 200 kbd,
compared with an average of 513
kbd in 2008). However, the United
States still relies on heavy and sour
oil crude producers—imports from
Saudi Arabia, Canada, Iraq, Mexico,
and Venezuela rose to 72 percent
of U.S. net crude imports, the
highest in 15 years (text figure).

Oil futures prices suggest that

are expected to remain volatile in 2013–

factors. Abstracting from these

Rising oil output presents opportunities, but also poses challenges. Incremental North
American supply clearly played a critical role in offsetting record supply disruptions in 2012.
Going forward, the increased supply would help offset declining oil reserve growth in other parts
of the world. However, significant challenges exist to increasing shale/tight output. These revolve
around: (i) the massive infrastructure and logistical needs required by the development of these
oil fields; (ii) the uncertainties concerning the U.S. legislative framework, in particular the
restrictions of crude exports to other parts of the world; (iii) the prospective environmental
challenges to unconventional technologies; and (iv) the geopolitical factors, in particular
decisions of OPEC countries that could affect the shale oil revolution process.

Appendix II. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Rebasing and
Implications
1.
The National Bureau of Statistics, in collaboration with the International Monetary Fund,
World Bank, and African Development Bank, is working on the rebasing of the national accounts
estimates. Rebasing Nigeria GDP involves (i) replacing the existing price and quantity structure
used to measure GDP with a more recent price structure; (ii) updating weights used in
aggregating individual quantities; and (iii) incorporating methodological and conceptual
improvements.
2.
The improvements and changes being carried out in the rebasing exercise can be
summarized as follows: (i) base year changed from 1990 to 2010; (ii) use of the 2008 Systems of
National Accounts (2008 SNA) compilation methodology instead of the 1993 SNA, and an
updated International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC, Rev.4) to
meet compilation requirements of a Supply and Use Table framework;, and (iii) revisions of data
sources.
3.
The above measures could lead to changes in the size of the GDP, growth rates, sectoral
contributions, and related indicators that use the GDP. Since 1990, the economy has evolved:
new sectors have emerged and telecommunications and other services have increased
significantly their contribution to economic growth. Therefore, the current GDP series may have
become biased in the interpretation of economic change and attendant ratios. At the same time,
with increased available services (telecommunications, mobile phones, internet usage),
consumption and production would have changed, affecting price structure.
4.
The GDP rebasing project is important. Although the rebasing is expected to result in a
higher nominal GDP, the authorities note, for instance, that their borrowing strategy is not likely
to be affected, because it is based on the ratio of debt service to revenue, not the level of
nominal GDP. They acknowledge, however, that the rebasing could confirm structural shifts
among sectors (for example, the share of agriculture in the labor force could fall from 70 percent
to 30 percent), as well as alter key policy ratios (for example tax effort and reserve cover), leading
to a change in policy focus in those areas. At the same time, as a larger GDP would imply an
upward revision of per-capita income, Nigeria could lose benefits afforded to low-income
countries.

Appendix III. Oil Theft in Nigeria and Proposed
Countermeasures
Oil Theft
1.

Nigeria scores low in the 2013 Resource Governance Index. A 2010 report by Revenue

Watch Institute and Transparency International rated the Nigeria state-run oil company the
least transparent of 44 national and international energy companies surveyed. As a result of
poor governance, the tracking of sales, associated revenue, and physical flows are a challenge
in Nigeria. Organized criminals exploit disorder and social unrest to steal oil. Also, liberalization
in the international markets, where parcels of oil change hands many times, could create
conditions for larger oil theft.
2.

Oil theft/production loss volume is difficult to estimate. Estimates range from

100-500 thousand barrels a day in the first quarter of 2013. This figure assumes the integrity of
industry
numbers and
may not
account for
what could
happen at
export
terminals. The loss in oil production of 200 thousand barrels a day, close to 10 percent of
Nigeria’s oil production and about 0.3 percent of world oil production, is equivalent (at 100
U.S. dollars a barrel) to a loss of above 7 billion U.S. dollars a year. In absolute terms, oil theft
affects mostly the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria; in relative terms,
Nigerian Agip is the hardest hit. Oil theft is significant in five other countries, with Russia at a
similar scale to Nigeria.
3.

Oil theft occurs mainly through three methods: (i) small-scale and illegal refining;

(ii) large-scale illegal bunkering in the field (stealing directly from the wellhead); and (iii) filling
tankers at export terminals. At the small-scale, local groups puncture or install illegal taps on
pipelines on onshore oil infrastructure such as wellheads and manifolds. Most of this oil is sold
illegally to local refineries. The large-scale illegal bunkering uses almost the same methods, but
involves sophisticated networks, and the oil is transferred and sold mostly in international

52

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGERIA

4.

markets. Theft at export terminals is considered ―white collar‖ theft and involves

pumping illegally obtained oil onto tankers already loading at export terminals.
5.

The cost of oil theft/production loss is significant. The Nigerian government bears

significant revenue losses—the government charges royalties on oil that reaches an export
terminal, thus excluding crude illegally bunkered from pipelines, flows stations, or wellheads. In
addition, international oil companies (IOCs) shut down production when pipeline infrastructure
is sabotaged, resulting in significant deferred production and forgone revenue. At the same
time, continued oil theft poses a downside risk to investment and growth as international oil
companies recalibrate their long-term investment or shift focus to deepwater fields with more
lucrative production-sharing terms.
6.

Amounts of stolen oil vary with global oil prices and security concerns. The current

price level of light sweet crude, above US$100/bbl, provides an incentive for oil theft. Oil theft
has been a feature of the industry in Nigeria for many years, but the sharp increase since the
early 2000s coincides not only with the restoration of civilian rule, but perhaps more
significantly with a huge increase in oil prices. Available data show that stealing of oil onshore
dipped when oil prices fell sharply in mid-2008, and increased in the face of security problems
(Figure in staff report text).
7.

While there are many factors contributing to oil theft (for example, poverty,

unemployment, and lack of social services), most of the stolen oil is believed to be exported (a
lower proportion is used to refine fuel for domestic consumption), involving well-funded and
organized Nigerian and international criminal groups. Their activities are motivated by profit
and, based on estimates of volume of crude oil stolen and oil price, the proceeds from these
activities are considerable and are laundered in domestic and international markets. Against
this background, national efforts to reduce crude oil production and revenue losses associated
with oil theft could be supported by a comprehensive and sustainable national strategy
focused on two broad fronts that can include, among other things (i) measures to combat the
crime of oil theft in the Niger Delta through intelligence, law enforcement, social/employment
initiatives; and (ii) measures to combat money laundering associated with oil theft.

Applying the Anti-Money-Laundering (AML) Framework to Combat Oil Theft Money
Laundering (ML)
8.

Nigeria has a relatively well-developed AML framework that can help deprive oil theft

criminals and their facilitators from the proceeds of their crime. The main components of this
framework and their potential contributions to this effort are described below.
Presidential Committee on Financial Action Task Force
9.

The federal government established a Presidential Committee on Financial Action Task

Force (FATF), which reports directly to the president, to coordinate efforts to remove Nigeria
from the FATF list of countries that have significant weaknesses in their AML/CFT regime.
Those efforts succeeded in the delisting of Nigeria in October 2013.1
10.

Discussions during this mission with the financial and non-financial sector supervisors

(Central Bank of Nigeria, Securities and Exchange Commission, National Insurance
Commission, Special Control Unit Against Money Laundering) indicated that this committee
will continue to frame and guide the national AML/CFT agenda and could play a lead and high
level coordinating role in the formulation of a national AML strategy to combat oil
theft-related ML. The Chairman of this committee is a director of the CBN and as noted above,
reports directly to the president, fostering political support for AML/CFT efforts. The
committee is composed of key AML/CFT stakeholders including representatives from each of
the financial supervisory agencies, the NFIU, and the Economic and Financial Crimes
Commission (EFCC). All of the agencies concur that this committee would be a logical forum to
formulate and coordinate the implementation of a national AML strategy to combat ML
associated with oil theft.
National Risk Assessment (NRA)
11.

In preparation for its next mutual evaluation for compliance with the new FATF

international AML/CFT standard, Nigeria has started to organize the conduct of a national
money laundering and terrorism financing (TF) risk assessment. The Presidential Committee is
1

Immediately following the removal of Nigeria from the FATF’s list of countries with significant weaknesses in
its AML/CFT systems, the Chairman of the Committee publicly stated, ―In the recent past, Nigeria has received
technical assistance from the IMF to develop a risk-based approach to AML/CFT supervision. This has resulted
in the development of similar procedures across all regulatory authorities as well as the financial intelligence
unit, namely the Central Bank of Nigeria, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the National Insurance
Commission, and the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit.‖

leading the organization and coordination of the NRA with assistance being provided by the
World Bank. The aim of the NRA is to identify the principal threats and risks of ML and TF and
would serve as a blueprint for establishing a national AML/CFT strategy, establishing priorities,
and deploying resources efficiently. According to the authorities, the NRA process is at the
scoping stage and they are not aware that the World Bank or the local participants have
included oil theft as a significant source of proceeds of crime and ML. They concur, however,
that inclusion of oil theft and related ML in the NRA is timely and critical in light of the present
production and revenue losses being faced by the country, and the risks to the country posed
by organized criminal organizations involved in these activities.
Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit and other AML/CFT Stakeholders
12.

The financial and non-financial sector supervisors agree that they and all of the sectors

subject to their supervision can benefit from specific guidance, training, and typologies on oil
theft and related ML. They support the idea of conducting a Strategic Analysis on oil theft and
ML. This initiative would be spearheaded by the NFIU in collaboration with other stakeholders,
including law enforcement. The result would be a Strategic Analysis report on oil theft and
related ML, with recommendations on measures to combat these crimes. It is expected that a
byproduct of the Strategic Analysis would be a typology report on methods and techniques
used to launder illicit proceeds from oil theft. The typology report would be disseminated to all
stakeholders and would be particularly useful for financial and non-financial entities subject to
the AML/CFT regime, and their supervisors, in calibrating compliance with due diligence,
monitoring, and reporting of suspicious activity. It would also serve as input for specialized
training to these sectors and their supervisors on the subject.
Supervisors (CBN, SEC, NAICOM, SCUML)
13.

The supervisory agencies indicated their willingness to participate in the formulation

and implementation of a national strategy to combat oil theft-related ML, and to recalibrate
their supervisory activities to take this risk into account in their risk-based approach and
processes to AML/CFT supervision. Financial institutions and entities under their supervision
can be required to pay special attention to this risk in their customer due diligence and risk
management systems. Typologies developed by the NFIU in the context of their strategic
analysis will support this effort. In addition, the CBN and SEC will spearhead discussions on this
issue in their regular supervisory coordination forum meetings to ensure harmonization in
practices.

Appendix IV. Estimates of the Sustainable Non-Oil
Primary Deficit
1.
The Permanent Income Hypothesis (PIH) is used to benchmark the sustainable path for
the non-oil primary deficit (NOPD). Under the PIH, the smoothed value of government
consumption is that which equates the present discounted value of future oil and gas revenue
to the present discounted value of the government consumption.
2.

The following assumptions are used to compute the sustainable NOPD:



Reserves. For end-2012, proven reserves are set at 37.2 billion barrels for oil and 33.2 billion
barrels of oil-equivalent for gas (BP Statistical Review of World Energy, 2013, available at:
http://bit.ly/1bvFY3o).



Production path. The path of production is estimated from a logistic equation, using a
Hubbert model. It is assumed that oil production will peak in 2022 at about 1,000 million
barrels and gas will peak in 2040 at about 800 million barrels of oil-equivalent, consistent
with staff projections for 2013–2020.



Oil and gas prices. Prices follow the IMF’s World Economic Outlook (WEO) projections for
2013–2018 and are assumed to remain constant in real terms thereafter (US$86.6 a barrel
in 2018 for oil and US$10.98 per million BTU in 2018 for gas: http://bit.ly/17hhGhK). An
alternative scenario uses the baseline price from the U.S. Energy Information
Administration’s Annual Energy Outlook 2013 (AEO), which shows oil prices increasing by
70 percent in real terms in 2011–2040 and gas prices increasing by 97 percent in real terms
in the same period (http://1.usa.gov/10dU1dk).



Government revenue yield. Government oil revenue is set at 60 percent of the total value of
production and 7 percent for gas (corresponding to the average for the past 5 years,
excluding 2009).



Discount rate. The real discount rate is assumed to be 5 percent a year. An alternative
scenario with a 3 percent discount rate is also provided to compare the results with
previous Article IV calculations of the NOPD.



Time horizon. Resources are assumed to be exhausted by 2080. Two scenarios are provided
for the smoothing of oil and gas wealth—one over an infinite horizon and another for
2013–2080.

3.
The sustainable NOPD estimated under the WEO assumptions is about 21.5 percent of
non-oil GDP in 2013, below the 23 percent of 2013 non-oil GDP estimated in the 2013 Article
IV. The sustainable NOPD declines over time—oil and gas wealth is smoothed in real terms
while non-oil GDP is assumed to grow in real terms—to 16–17 percent of non-oil GDP by 2016

56

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGERIA

and 13–14 percent of non-oil
GDP by 2018 (text figure). The
planned fiscal consolidation
will help bring the NOPD
closer to the estimated
sustainable levels—in the staff
baseline, the NOPD is
projected to fall from 23.5
percent of non-oil GDP in
2013 to 15.4 percent of nonoil GDP in 2018.

5.
Sustainability benchmarks should take into account the specific circumstances of the
country. For example, the design of such a benchmark should capture preferred social welfare
criteria. The PIH is based implicitly on a constant distribution criterion, under which the social
objective is to maintain the purchasing power of the oil wealth distributed every year, with the
government spending a constant amount in real terms. This implies a declining annuity, with
the share of non-oil GDP falling as non-oil GDP grows. Second, the analysis treats all the
government spending as consumption. This implies that the benchmark could be conservative,
as it excludes the potentially higher non-oil GDP growth that could arise from spending oil
wealth on infrastructure and human capital (and hence a higher sustainable non-oil primary
deficit). Finally, there is substantial uncertainty over the oil and gas wealth estimates—owing to
unknown factors such as innovations in technology, future oil and gas prices, extent of

overvalued (text figure). The exchange rate regime is a managed float, with the CBN

the quality of balance of
payments data, notably the size of errors and omissions, these findings warrant caution.


The equilibrium real exchange rate approach finds an overvaluation of 7.7 percent. In
calculating the equilibrium real effective exchange rate (REER), the latest projections
for 2013 were used for the key determinants (commodity terms of trade, government
consumption to GDP, net foreign assets to GDP, relative productivity differentials),
while projections for 2013 under the September WEO were used for global variables
and trading partners. As for the REER in 2013, the average REER during the first eight
months of 2013 was used as a proxy.



The macroeconomic balance approach results in an overvaluation of 8.3 percent. In
calculating determinants (fiscal balance, oil balance, relative income, lagged current
account, relative growth, dependency ratio, population growth) of the current account
norm, latest projections for 2018 were used for Nigeria, while projections for 2018
under the September WEO were used for trading partners.

1

The methodology used for the exchange rate assessments of oil-exporting countries is described in the
working paper (WP/09/281). The current assessment is based on information available as of December 2013.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

59

NIGERIA



The current account norm for Nigeria is estimated at 3.4 percent of GDP, compared
with a projected current account balance of 1.4 percent of GDP in 2018. 2 Given the
estimated elasticity of the current account balance in Nigeria, the exchange rate is
estimated to be overvalued by 8.3 percent.



The external sustainability approach indicates an overvaluation of 4.6 percent. Based
on the medium-term projections for real growth and inflation, an external current
account surplus of 2.5 percent of GDP would stabilize net foreign assets at their current
level. This is higher than staff’s projected medium-term current account surplus of 1.4
percent of GDP, which suggests that the currency is overvalued by 4.6 percent.

2.
These results should be viewed with some caution. There are a number of reasons to
be cautious when reading these results. One reason is that determining the appropriate target
level for net foreign assets in Nigeria is not straightforward. As an oil producer seeking to
preserve oil wealth for future generation, Nigeria should be seeking to accumulate financial
assets via a higher current account surplus. On the other hand, as a low-income country with
substantial investment needs, there is also a case for using its oil savings for infrastructure
investments. Data gaps, which are reflected in relatively large errors and omissions in the
balance of payments, could also distort the estimates. Further, the assessment/extent of
overvaluation is subject to changes/projections in the factors determining the current account
norm, as well as known estimation challenges and variance of the elasticities. As such, an
understanding of the projected current account path is important, as the correction of an
estimated misalignment can be done through different policies, including correcting the
factors driving the movement in the current account.

Differently from the 2012 Article IV, staff used the overall fiscal balance (3.3 percent deficit in 2018) instead of
non-oil fiscal balance (15.7 percent deficit in 2018) in calculating the current account norm. The reason for this
approach is that stripping out the oil sector for Nigeria has the benefit of removing cyclical components of the
fiscal balance, but also offers an inadequate characterization of the Nigerian economy given the large share of
the oil sector. Under this assumption, the current account norm is lower than that of last year because the
economy is weaker both on the growth and on the fiscal fronts.

60

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

reflects high export receipts as well as capital flows.

4.
The current level of international reserves is estimated to be close to the optimal level.
This assessment is conditional on the authorities implementing the projected fiscal
consolidation and structural reforms, and the projected economic outlook being realized.
Proxies for adverse scenarios, (shocks to the terms of trade, external demand, FDI to GDP ratio)
were set at the bottom 10 percentile of Nigeria-specific distribution in the past ten years
(2003–2012). Given Nigeria’s low reliance on foreign aid, staff assumed no shocks to foreign
aid to GDP ratio.
5.
Under the baseline scenario, fundamentals were set as follows: Country Policy and
Institutional Assessment (CPIA) was set at its 2012 level (latest available data of the economic
management cluster); fiscal balance was set at the average level during 2008–12; the exchange
rate policy regime was classified as ―not flexible‖ given that it is heavily managed. The values
used for this baseline analysis are summarized in the table below.

6.
Under these baseline assumptions, the optimal level of reserves varies from 3.9 months
to 8.9 months of next year’s imports of goods and services, depending on the unit cost of
holding reserves (Table below). Staff also analyzed the optimal level of reserves under a wider
fiscal deficit relative to the baseline scenario (5 percent of GDP). This scenario requires a higher
optimal level of reserves compared to the baseline. Nigeria has large infrastructure investment
needs, which suggest the opportunity cost of holding reserves could be relatively high, say
4 percent to 5 percent. In light of this, the projected levels of reserves in the Staff Report for
2013 (5.7 months of prospective imports) would be appropriate for Nigeria, provided the fiscal
consolidation takes place as planned.

Some caution is warranted. First, the current policy and economic environment is
uncertain, notably as changing global dynamics may intensify capital flows and commodity
price volatility. Second, the size of the errors and omissions in the balance of payments

Appendix VI. Tracking Job Creation
1.
In the last decade, the Nigerian economy has been growing strongly. However,
unemployment has doubled from 12.3 percent in 2006 to an all-time high of 24 percent in
2011. The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) estimated that 56 percent of youth are
unemployed, mostly because of lack of adequate skills, despite high education levels.
Therefore, since 2006, Nigeria has experienced social unrest, largely led by youth between the
ages of 16 and 24. This appendix presents the ongoing reforms to better track created jobs,
and improve the quality of spending, using SURE-P.
2.
The federal government has implemented a quarterly survey to track job creation. With
growth concentrated in the non-oil sector, the disappointing outcomes in unemployment and
poverty reduction are still somewhat puzzling. To better understand and monitor the evolving
trend, the federal government1 designed the Quarterly Job Creation survey, covering
12 sectors2 of the economy and all 36 states of the federation, including the Federal Capital
Territory (FCT). The surveys, which sample 5,000 establishments, also cover public institutions
(ministries, departments, agencies—MDAs). Privately created jobs are divided into formal
(establishments with more than 10 persons) and informal (those generated by individuals or
businesses employing less than 10 persons, generally in agriculture, wholesale, and retail
trade).
3.
The data show that fewer jobs are created in sectors with high growth than in sectors
with low growth. Of the total number of jobs created in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first
quarter of 2013, the sectors (agriculture, wholesale and trade, services) experiencing the
highest growth rates generated the least jobs, while low-growth sectors (education) created
more than 50 percent of new jobs. Sixty-four percent of the jobs created in the fourth quarter
of 2012 and 31 percent in the first quarter of 2013 were occupied by the youth (15–35 years).
The highest number of jobs for youth was in education, followed by social work, and financial
intermediation. More generally, in the fourth quarter of 2012, subsistence crop farmers
recorded the highest number of new employees followed by nursing; mobile plant operators
recorded the least number of new employees. The surveys show also that skill mismatches,
measured by unoccupied positions, continue to be an issue, with 49,968 unoccupied job
positions at end 2013.

1

The stakeholders are the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), National Planning Commission (NPC), Office of
the Chief Economic Adviser to the President, Federal Ministry of Labor and Productivity (FMLP), National
Directorate of Employment (NDE), Central Bank of Nigeria, and Office of the Special Assistant on Job Creation.
2

Twelve sectors covered are agriculture; mining, and quarrying; manufacturing; construction; wholesale and
retail trade; hotels and restaurants; transport, storage, and communication; financial intermediation; real
estate, renting, and business activities; health and social work; other community, social, and personal activities;
and education.

The informal sector continues to be the main job provider. In both reporting quarters
the informal sector accounted for more than 50 percent of the jobs generated in the Nigerian
economy. In the 4th quarter of 2012, 208,920 jobs were generated, while in the first quarter of
2013 the informal sector accounted for 232,327 of the total jobs generated.

Appendix VII. Trade Policy and Competitiveness:
Agriculture in Nigeria
1.
Key message: Policies aiming at improving competitiveness should focus on domestic
measures rather than actions related to border transactions, on reducing market failures rather than
on sectors, and base criteria for success/failure on productivity and international benchmarking.
High tariffs recently introduced on selected agricultural products should be temporary.

Trade policy and competitiveness
2.
Export diversification is an important development goal. Diversification of the economy is
associated with economic growth. Diversification has at least two meanings: (i) product
diversification; and (ii) process diversification (i.e., moving up the value chain). Both aspects of
diversification matter.
3.
Oil-rich economies face obstacles to diversification and generally require economic policy to
promote the development of non-oil sectors. The resource curse and other market failures limit
product and process diversification. Economic policy can promote diversification by complementing
market forces.
4.
Trade and trade-related policy can be an instrument for diversification if they aim at
promoting competitiveness, not protectionism. Economic policy should not aim at self-sufficiency
and/or ―relocating‖ the entire value chain of specific products. Rather, the objective should be to
foster investment and growth by facilitating the development of the sectors and activities where the
economy has potential comparative advantage.

Trade policy risks and checks and balances
5.

Trade policy may incur three types of risks:



Uninformed policy. For the government, identifying ―successful‖ products may be difficult.



Poorly designed policy. General equilibrium effects may not be appropriately accounted for. For
example, high tariffs on rice may have a negative impact on overall exports, because producers
of other agricultural products that do not receive protection compete for the same scarce
resources (namely, land) and face higher input costs.



Self-perpetuating policy. When a rent is created, there is a natural tendency to maintain the
policy independently of results.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

6.

A (non-exhaustive) list of design principles for trade policy should include:



Target market failures more than sectors. Peru developed its highly successful asparagus export
by promoting the adoption of more stringent standards, not through direct incentives to the
producers of asparagus.



Second-best measures (such as tariffs) should be temporary and used as part of a broader
program. Temporary protection can increase growth only in conjunction with targeted
competitiveness measures, such as policies that promote the adoption of new technology.



Clear criteria for success and failure. Measures of success need to be based on productivity
and/or international benchmarking, not on employment and output, as the latter will fall when
the policy is removed, unless productivity has increased.



Automatic rules to discontinue unsuccessful programs. Absent specific rules, rent-seeking
behavior will make the policy self-perpetuating.

Agricultural exports experienced strong growth in recent years. Agricultural exports are
dominated by cocoa beans, but other products are taking up an increasingly important share of
exports (text figure). In addition to traditional trading partners in Europe, emerging economies are
becoming important export destinations for Nigeria’s agricultural products (text figure).

Agricultural trade policy in Nigeria
9.
Nigerian agricultural exports and imports face substantial trade barriers. IMF staff
calculations based on UN Comtrade data show that (i) non-tariff measures (NTMs), such as
prohibitions and standards, are a much higher barrier than tariffs for both Nigeria’s imports and
exports of agricultural commodities; (ii) import barriers in agriculture are substantially higher for
Nigeria than for other developing economies (such as sub-Saharan countries) or large agricultural
exporters (such as Brazil); and (iii) food products face the highest import restrictions.
10.
In the last year, protectionist measures on selected agricultural products have largely
increased. As part of an effort to boost production of rice, Nigeria has imposed a 100 percent tariff
on brown, semimilled, and wholly milled rice in February 2013.
11.
Authorities should use domestic tools that boost agricultural productivity rather than
protectionist measures. This is the strategy adopted by successful agricultural exporters such
as Brazil. Brazil mostly supports the agricultural sector through domestic measures that
directly address market distortions, in particular preferential credit lines and price support
mechanisms that aim at reducing uncertainty in agricultural production. The logic of these
policies is similar to Nigeria’s Incentive-Based Risk-Sharing System for Agricultural Lending
(NIRSAL).

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

Approved By
Ranil Salgado and David
Robinson (IMF) and
Jeffrey D. Lewis and
Marcelo Giugale (IDA)

Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and the International Development Association (IDA)

Although Nigeria’s debt has increased relative to the last DSA (May 2013), Nigeria remains at a
low risk of debt distress under current macroeconomic assumptions. For both the baseline
scenario and the standardized stress tests, Nigeria’s debt outlook remains robust. For the
customized stress test, which simulates a persistent oil price shock, all indicators deteriorate
when compared to the baseline results, but remain within all of the country-specific thresholds
relevant for Nigeria. Taken together, the stress scenarios indicate that, without significant or
timely compensating policy measures, a prolonged negative oil price shock or a fiscal revenue
shortfall could undermine the recent progress in achieving macroeconomic and debt
sustainability. The findings are highly sensitive to the actual implementation of the fiscal
consolidation assumed in the analysis. Also, data deficiencies suggest caution: (i) errors and
omissions in the balance of payments are large (possibly reflecting an underestimation of
current account debit transactions)1 and lead to large observed residuals in the DSA
presentation; (ii) the methodology for estimating imports was changed in 2010, resulting in a
break in the balance of payments series between 2009 and 2010; and (iii) the DSA does not
incorporate debt of the state and local governments and of public enterprises.2

2

For instance, in 2012 errors and omissions were 10 percent of total imports.

The authorities recently made information available on domestic debt of state and local governments (estimated at
about 1.7 percent of GDP in 2011 in commercial bank loans and State bonds and 1.5 percent of GDP in arrears and
other liabilities see http://bit.ly/1fjOmpD). Sub-national borrowing is currently limited and tightly regulated. However,
the exposure of the multiplicity of off-budget funds is unknown.

MACROECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS
2.

The assumptions used in the baseline scenario for 2013–33 are:



Average GDP growth of 6.8 percent in 2013–33 (slightly below the average of 7 percent for
2012–2032).



Consistent with the WEO projections of an anticipated decline in oil prices over the medium
term, the analysis assumes a Nigerian oil price of US$104.5 a barrel in 2013, moderating to
US$86.7 a barrel by 2018, and then remaining constant in real terms thereafter.4



Non-oil primary deficit (NOPD) would decline from 27.4 percent of non-oil GDP in 2012 to
about 15.7 percent of non-oil GDP in 2018. This takes into account the consolidation plans
embedded in the 2014–2016 Medium Term Expenditure Framework, including policies to control

3

External debt data provided by the authorities do not include publically-guaranteed debt.

The DSA is based on the WEO’s latest projections for Brent crude prices. Nigerian oil price is projected by using the
relation for the previous period between the Nigerian oil prices and Brent oil prices.

personnel expenses and contain the growth of capital expenditure. In addition, it is assumed
that the oil-price-based fiscal rule continues to be applied, with a budget oil price assumed to
be on average about 20 percent below the projected oil price. On that basis, the Excess Crude
Account accumulates over time, reaching about 6 percent of GDP by 2018 (more details in the
accompanying Staff Report for the 2013 Article IV Consultation). After 2018, it is assumed that
the government budget remains balanced, i.e., well within the deficit limit enshrined in the Fiscal
Responsibility Law (FRL). This implies the primary deficit of 3.3 percent of GDP in 2018 will have
to turn to a surplus of 0.3 percent of GDP in 2033.


Following the strong total export growth in 2010–11, exports are projected to stagnate 2012–19
and recover thereafter. Imports are also expected to increase strongly in 2013–18, reflecting
strong economic growth. Consequently, the current account surplus declines to about 1.4
percent of GDP by 2018, followed by a small deficit after 2019. Growth in non-oil exports is
expected to partially offset the declining oil exports in the medium term.



To finance much needed infrastructure investment, new borrowing of US$1.5 billion is
contracted during the medium term and $500 million thereafter. The grant element of these
loans is assumed at 1.7 percent.



N1 trillion of contingent liabilities (bonds) from the Asset Management Company of Nigeria
(AMCON) materialize as ultimate fiscal cost for the federal government in 2023 (equivalent to
0.7 percent of GDP).5

EXTERNAL SUSTAINABILITY6
Baseline
3.
In the baseline scenario (Table 1 and Figure 1), the nominal gross external debt burden is
projected to moderately increase in the next three years but decline gradually after.7 The external
debt-to-GDP ratio would rise from 2.5 percent in 2012 to 2.8 in 2013 and then return to 2.0 in 2018.
5

The Sinking Fund is estimated to be worth N6.4 trillion at the end of 2023: the annual contributions of 0.5 percent
of total assets by Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) (about N23 trillion at end-2013) are assumed to grow at 20 percent)
and the 50 billion by CBN every year are assumed to accrue 10 percent return. The fund will be used to fill the gap in
the AMCON’s balance sheet of about N3.4 trillion (assets and bond liabilities are about N2.3 trillion and N5.7 trillion
respectively as of September 2013). It will also pay for net interest expenses on its bonds, which over 10 years is
estimated to be about N4.0 trillion. All assets are assumed to be sold at face value or higher to cover other operating
costs.
6

The LIC debt sustainability framework (DSF) provides a methodology for assessing external debt sustainability that
is guided by indicative, country-specific, debt-burden thresholds based on the relative strength of a country’s policies
and institutions. Given Nigeria’s rating of 3.5 (medium performer), which is the three year average of the World
Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), the relevant country-specific thresholds are a PV of
external debt-to-GDP ratio of 40 percent, a PV of external debt-to-exports ratio of 150 percent, and an external debt
service-to-exports ratio of 20 percent.
7

The historical average of the noninterest current account surplus is much higher at 9.6 percent than the average of
about 3 percent for 2013-18, and treating the difference as “residual borrowing” becomes explosive over time.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

3

NIGERIA

The initial increase reflects the external borrowing to finance scaled-up public investment during the
next years. The external debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to decline gradually to 0.3 percent by 2033.
The debt service-to-exports and the debt service-to-revenue ratios also decline gradually
throughout the projection period. All debt and debt service indicators remain well below their
respective threshold levels throughout the projection period.

Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests
4.
Standardized stress tests were carried out (Table 2 and Figure 1). Under all scenarios, (i) the
PV of debt is not likely to exceed 10 percent of GDP throughout the projection period; and (ii) the
PV of debt-to-exports ratio is far below its indicative debt burden threshold of 150 percent.8
5.
A country-specific alternative scenario was conducted to illustrate the impact on the external
accounts and the debt dynamics of a prolonged oil price shock (in light of Nigeria’s high
dependency on oil, as well as the high level of oil prices projected in the medium term). The oil price
shock is calibrated at 20 percent lower than the baseline during 2014–18. All indicators worsen from
the baseline under this country-specific scenario, but remain within the country-specific thresholds
relevant for Nigeria. If the oil price were to go below 30 percent of WEO projections (about 1
standard deviation), however, all indicators worsen considerably and especially the PV of the debtto-exports ratio can exceed the threshold for several years.

FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY
Baseline
6.
The amount of federal government gross debt outstanding is estimated at 18.4 percent of
GDP at end-2012, and is projected to decline to about 3.4 percent of GDP by 2033 (Table 3). The
current maturity structure of domestic debt is favorable, with short-term debt only accounting for a
quarter of total debt. Under the baseline scenario (Table 3 and Figure 2), the consolidated
government debt-to-GDP ratio would decline slightly to about 18.2 percent in 2018, reflecting the
ongoing consolidation efforts envisaged in the authorities’ Medium Term Expenditure Framework.
This implies continued expenditure restraint, including policies to control personnel expenses and
contain the growth of capital expenditure. After 2018, the public debt-to-GDP ratio would gradually
decline to single digits by 2031. This is largely because of the assumption that the authorities would
reduce expenditure or raise non-oil revenue in the medium term, to offset the projected decline in
oil revenue (as a share of GDP) implied by WEO projections for oil prices. Thus, these findings are
highly sensitive to the resolute implementation of the fiscal consolidation and recovery in oil
revenue assumed in the analysis.

8

Note that the projection does not fully capture a possible volatility in real GDP growth. For instance, if one were to
replicate the same level of volatility in real GDP growth in the next five years (2014–18) as was observed in the 2004–
2008 period, the PV of debt-to-export ratio would breach the indicative policy threshold at least once (in 2018).

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGERIA

Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests
7.
The standardized stress tests underscore the need for fiscal policy to adjust to the economic
environment. In particular, debt in 2033 may increase from 4 percent in the baseline to 32 percent if
the primary balance is unchanged from its 2013 level. With oil prices stabilizing over the medium
term, public debt dynamics would become more susceptible to adverse economic growth shocks.
This is shown under the “permanently lower GDP growth” scenario, under which gross public
debt-to-GDP ratio in 2033 would increase from 4 percent in the baseline to 15 percent. In addition, a
persistent revenue shock would also result in debt reaching about 14 percent of GDP by 2033. In
such adverse scenarios, fiscal policy would need to adjust accordingly (Table 4 and Figure 2). To the
extent that the staff’s fiscal policy assumptions under the baseline scenario (including gradual
improvements in the primary deficit over the medium term) do not materialize, the debt outlook will
be negatively affected. In this case, risks to debt sustainability may appear.

AUTHORITIES’ VIEWS
8.
The authorities concurred that the external debt risk was low. They agreed, however, that
timely policy responses would be necessary in the event of a prolonged adverse oil price or
economic growth shock. In their view, the sinking fund will be sufficient to cover the negative net
worth by the end of 2023.

Includes both public and private sector external debt.
Derived as [r - g - (1+g)]/(1+g+ +g ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and
= growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Export values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assum
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

1/ The public sector refers to federal, state, and local governments. Debt refers to gross debt and public sector assets such as the excess crude account (ECA) are not netted out.
2/ Gross financing need is defined as the primary deficit plus debt service plus the stock of short-term debt at the end of the last period.
3/ Revenues excluding grants.
4/ Debt service is defined as the sum of interest and amortization of medium- and long-term debt.
5/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.

Exchange Rate Arrangement
The de jure exchange rate arrangement is other managed arrangement. The CBN explicitly aims to
maintain an exchange rate fundamentally driven by market forces, but intervenes to reduce volatility
and to counteract speculative attacks on the national currency. In recent years it has maintained an
exchange rate band vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar and has recently allowed adjustment of the band’s
midpoint in response to market forces. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is also other
managed arrangement. In spite of some stability of the Naira-U.S. dollar exchange rate, the nominal
effective exchange rate has fluctuated considerably in recent years. The CBN publishes information
on its interventions through auctions on its website; however, data on interventions in the interbank
market are not disseminated. Nigeria is a signatory to the W-ERM II of the WAMZ, which requires
that the spot exchange rate between the naira and the U.S. dollar be maintained within ±15%
around the central rate. The CBN has not implemented this regime. Multiple currency prices are a
technical characteristic of the CBN’s Dutch auction system and give rise to a multiple currency
practice under Article VIII of the Articles of Agreement.
Safeguards Assessment
Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) was subject to a
full safeguards assessment with respect to the Stand-By Arrangement that expired on
October 31, 2001. The assessment, which included an on-site visit, was completed on
November 28, 2001. The assessment concluded that vulnerabilities existed in the areas of financial
reporting and legal structure of the Central Bank.
Article IV Consultation
Nigeria is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle. The previous Article IV
consultation was concluded on February 6, 2013.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of December 31, 2013)

I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Macroeconomic data are broadly adequate for surveillance; however serious data
deficiencies—in particular, inadequate information on subnational public finances and large errors and
omissions in the balance of payments—continue to hamper policy design and monitoring.
The Statistics Act of 2007, which established the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) as the main
coordinating agency for data management, has led to a number of improvements, including better
information sharing between data producing and collecting agencies. Nevertheless, a number of
problems continue to prevent the compilation of timely and internally consistent data, in particular,
lack of good source data and insufficient computerization.

National accounts: Basic statistics are extensively available for the compilation of national accounts,
but their quality is not always satisfactory owing to high non-response rates, inaccuracy of reported
data, and methodology used. The reliance on the consumer price index to construct the constant price
GDP series leads to weaknesses. The supply and use table (SUT) and introduction of additional indices,
such as a producer price index, would facilitate more accurate estimation of the constant price
measure. The authorities are receiving Technical Assistance (TA) from the Fund, World Bank, and
African Development Bank in completing a GDP rebasing exercise. The rebased GDP (base year =2010)
and supply and use table are expected to reflect the significant change that has taken place in the
structure of the economy since the previous rebasing in 1990. In addition, the conduct of a census of
businesses, a census of agriculture, and a household living conditions survey in 2014 will contribute to
further improvements in the measurement of GDP.

Prices statistics: The official monthly consumer price index (CPI), a composite of urban and rural price
data, is available on a timely basis. The index has been re-referenced to November 2009=100, using
the 2003/04 National Consumer Expenditure Survey to update the 1996/97 survey-based expenditure
weights. Work is also underway to assess the concepts and methods used to compile the consumer

price index (CPI).
Government finance statistics: Fiscal data are incomplete and complicated not only by the federal
structure but also by a multiplicity of off-budget funds. The most pressing shortcomings are related
to inadequate data coverage, particularly of the subnational governments, which comprise almost
one-half of total government expenditure. The federal government has limited information on the
subnational fiscal accounts, making it difficult to target a consolidated fiscal balance; efforts to address
this issue have been stymied by constitutional restrictions. Although a recent STA TA Evaluation
mission found that the CBN has gathered a substantial amount of data on state and local
governments, these data are yet to be processed and are subject to further review. To facilitate the
timely preparation of a consolidated set of fiscal accounts, governments at all levels need to use
budget classification, chart of accounts, and accounting systems that will allow consistent
classifications of the data. There is also a need to formalize the publication of government accounts on
a monthly or quarterly basis and to increase coverage to report on the operations of parastatals.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGERIA

Monetary and financial statistics: There have been significant improvements in the compilation
of monetary statistics. Earlier problems with the CBN accounting framework and IT issues, which had
contributed to significant distortions in reported monetary data, have now been resolved. There is
need for a clearer measure of commercial banks’ foreign assets and liabilities that captures both their
on- and off-balance sheet exposures. The definition of the other depository corporations (ODCs)
sector should also be extended beyond commercial banks to include all deposit-taking financial
institutions, such as microfinance banks and primary mortgage institutions.
Financial soundness indicators: A broad range of information on the financial sector, including both
core and a number of non-core financial soundness indicators, is compiled by the CBN. The CBN is
currently working to improve the methodology used to compile FSIs and enhance disclosure practices.

Balance of payments: There have been significant efforts to improve the compilation of Nigeria’s
balance of payments data in recent years. Supported by IMF technical assistance, the authorities have
expanded the range and improved the quality of data sources, aimed at strengthening the balance of
payments and producing an international investment position.
There are however still large errors and omissions in the balance of payments, which complicate the
assessment of external sustainability. There is a need for improved validation of transactions reported
by banks, measurement of transactions outside the banking system, appropriate treatment of
transactions of enterprises in free trade zone (using a residency criterion) and improved coverage of
estimates of the external assets and liabilities of the banking sector. The DFID/GDDS Phase III Module,
launched in 2010 and covering a five-year period, will help improve source data by recording more
accurately cross-border private capital flows and stocks.
The authorities have not yet initiated compilation of international reserves data in line with the Data
Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity.
External debt: Public external debt data are of good quality and available on a timely basis. The Debt
Management Office (DMO) is collaborating closely with the CBN to extend the coverage of their
database to include private sector liabilities and foreign investment in domestically-issued debt
securities.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Nigeria

On February 21, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Nigeria.
Real GDP is projected to grow at 6.4 percent in 2013 owing to continued strong performance in
the non-oil sector. Inflation declined to 7.9 percent at year end, supported by lower food price,
fiscal consolidation, and a tight monetary policy stance. The external current account surplus fell
to 3.1 percent of GDP from 7.8 percent at end-2012, but reserves remained at a comfortable
5.6 months of next year’s imports, despite uncertainties about the timing of the tapering of
unconventional monetary policies. The non-oil primary deficit of the consolidated government is
projected to narrow from expenditure restraint, but a shortfall in oil revenues resulted in a
drawdown of the Excess Crude Account (ECA), a key fiscal buffer. Despite significant job
creation, unemployment and poverty are high and social indicators lag those of peers. Continued
weaknesses in labor markets, access to electricity, cost of doing business, and small and medium
enterprises’ access to finance have prevented a transition to a more robust and inclusive growth
path.
Economic growth is expected to improve further in 2014, driven by agriculture, trade, and
services. Inflation should continue to decline, with lower food prices from higher rice and wheat
production and supported by a tight monetary policy and a budget execution that maintains
medium-term consolidation objectives. The current account is also expected to improve. Key
risks to be managed include: (i) uncertainty about the pace of global recovery; (ii) unwinding of
UMP; (iii) persistently lower oil prices; (iv) persistent oil production losses; (v) continuation of
insurgency in the North; and (vi) slow implementation of reforms.
Sound and balanced economic policies over the medium term are critical. Policies should focus
on rebuilding external and fiscal buffers, avoiding spending pressures from the political cycle,

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

strengthening the transparency and governance of the oil sector, and enhancing financial
stability, while promoting the availability of and access to finance. Over the medium term, it will
be vital to ensure the steady implementation of the wide-range of structural reforms necessary to
improve competitiveness and productivity, boost growth and job creation, strengthen
governance, and build social cohesion.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed Nigeria’s continued strong macroeconomic performance,
underpinned particularly by sustained high growth in the non oil sector. Inflation has continued
to decline and the reserves position is adequate. While the economic outlook remains favorable,
key risks include continued lower oil revenues from oil production losses and lower oil prices,
the impact from the unwinding of unconventional monetary policy in advanced economies, and
domestic political and security uncertainties. Directors underscored that steadfast implementation
of prudent macroeconomic policies and reforms will be essential to address the risks and
vulnerabilities, generate more inclusive and balanced growth, and reduce unemployment.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ continued commitment to fiscal consolidation and noted the
improvements made to the fiscal framework. However, to ensure macroeconomic stability, they
emphasized the need to rebuild fiscal buffers and to strengthen the framework further. Efforts
should be geared towards boosting non oil revenue by broadening the tax base, improving tax
administration and curtailing exemptions, and further reducing oil subsidies. Directors
underscored that adopting a rule based reference oil price in fiscal projections and further
strengthening public financial management should help the authorities achieve their
consolidation objectives. They also highlighted the need for improving oil revenue management,
including by completing the transition from the Excess Crude Account to the Sovereign Wealth
Fund. These measures should be supported by full implementation of the Treasury Single
Account and the integrated information management systems. Maintaining fiscal discipline in the
run up to the elections is also important.
Directors called for strong action to address oil theft and production losses. They advised the
authorities to strengthen the regulatory framework by passing a sound Petroleum Industry Bill
with enhanced oversight and transparency provisions. The framework for anti money laundering
and combating the financing of terrorism could support these efforts.
Directors commended the authorities for lowering inflation and considered the current tight
monetary policy stance to be appropriate, given the risks associated with potential capital flow

Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

reversals. To better manage liquidity, they generally encouraged more reliance on open market
operations to guide short term interest rates. With regard to exchange rate policy, Directors noted
that greater exchange rate flexibility could serve as an important buffer against external shocks.
Directors noted that the financial system is well capitalized with low nonperforming loans. They
recommended continued improvements in the supervisory framework, especially with regard to
increased exposure from cross border financial activities. Directors encouraged the authorities to
build on the progress made in strengthening prudential policies, including by further enhancing
the framework for anti money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism, and
implementing the remaining Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) recommendations.
They welcomed the plan to wind down the operations of the Asset Management Corporation of
Nigeria.
Directors emphasized that structural reforms remain critical to improve competitiveness and
productivity, and reduce poverty and inequality. They encouraged the authorities to persevere
with their Transformation Agenda with continued focus on education and health reforms, the
improvement of power supply, and broadening agricultural production. Reform efforts should
also aim at enhancing the business environment, improving productivity, boosting financial
access to small and medium sized enterprises, and strengthening governance and institutional
capacity. The upcoming release of re based GDP data and further improvements in statistical
data collection should strengthen the basis for policy and private sector decision making in
Nigeria.

Statement by Mr. Nnanna, Alternate Executive Director for Nigeria
February 21, 2014
We welcome staff’s comprehensive assessment of Nigeria’s macroeconomic and policy
environment in 2013 and the outlook. My Nigerian authorities are grateful to the Fund
Management for its candid advice and also appreciative of the mission’s constructive
engagement. Overall, the report represents a fair and balanced assessment of the government’s
policies under the Transformation Agenda. Nevertheless, we have additional information we
would like to share with Directors aimed at updating the report, enhancing its clarity and
completeness.
Generally, my authorities regret that the report appears overly qualified and skeptical especially
when discussing recent achievements and progress made by government. Nigeria maintained a
very strong record of economic growth in the past decade. Real GDP has averaged about 7
percent per annum and according to staff projections, the trend is likely to continue in the near
term. Growth has been driven by a combination of domestic demand and exports – especially
crude oil. Inflation has been subdued, aided by abundant supply of domestically produced food
crops. The external sector has been robust and the current account balance has been persistently
in surplus in the past decade. The authorities have pursued sound fiscal and monetary policies
which have ensured robust fiscal and foreign exchange buffers. Nigeria’s public debt to GDP is
less than 20 percent while the gross external reserve is approximately US 41.54 billion as at
February 17, 2014 – equivalent to about 5.7 months of imports.
My authorities are of the view that:
The various concerns raised particularly the high income inequality and poverty, as well as
poor social and governance indicators are well known, and are the main reasons for the
implementation of the Transformation Agenda. It may take a while for the trend to be effectively
reversed given the large number of new entrants into the labor force each year, and the preexisting stock of people already looking for job. However, in 2013alone about 1.6 million jobs
were created, through government’s job creation programs.

ng formula is presented in a somewhat confusing way. The simpler and more
accurate revenue sharing formula is as follows: (i) Revenues accruing to the Federation Account:
Federal Government (48.5%), State Governments (26.72%), Local Governments (20.6%), and
Special funds (4.18%). (ii) Revenues in the VAT pool account: Federal Government (14%), Federal
Capital Territory (1%), State Governments (50%), and Local Governments (35%).
In view of the above, we will only dwell on the policies and initiatives being pursued by the
Nigerian authorities to address the various concerns in the near to medium term.
Macroeconomic Policies Going Forward:
The authorities’ focus is on continuation with macroeconomic and structural reforms, supported
by growth – enhancing policies.
Fiscal Policy:
The objective of the 2014 budget is to achieve and sustain inclusive growth. A mix of innovative
revenue mobilization and public expenditure rationalization is expected to help rebuild the
depleted fiscal buffers, and keep fiscal deficits within targeted 3 per cent of GDP as prescribed by
law. Steps have been initiated to increase revenues by blocking leakages from various sources
and enhancing the transparency of revenue remittance to the treasury by revenue generating
agencies. To this end, tax administration has been strengthened. Central to this, is the
transparent management of oil revenue flows to the government. In this regard, the swift
passage of the petroleum industry bill which is now before the parliament has become a priority.
On the expenditure side, the focus is on freeing resources from recurrent expenditure toward
capital spending, and channeling same towards critical infrastructure that would aid the
development of the private sector, reduce the cost of doing business in the country and
ultimately, reduce unemployment and poverty. This is to be achieved through reduction in the
cost of governance, better management of the subsidy scheme, and improvement in public
financial management. Already there are plans to extend the various public expenditure
management systems such as the Treasury Single Account, the Government Integrated Financial
Management Information System, and the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System
to all ministries, departments and agencies that are not yet the platforms in the cause of the year.
The new policy on oversee travels and training is expected to further reduce the cost of
governance.
The government acknowledges that it faces a challenge in rebuilding its fiscal buffer –particularly,
the Excess Crude Account (ECA). This account was created through a political arrangement
whose legality is being challenged by sub-national government in a competent court of law. In
spite of this, the Federal Government is committed to rebuild the excess crude account by
looking closely at the operation of the oil accounts including forensic audit of the national oil
companies and other major operators. However, with the recent addition of$550 million to the

3
Sovereign Wealth Fund, the total balance in the account now stands at$1.55 billion while the
total amount of buffer the economy currently have ( including the Excess Crude Account) is $3.6
billion
Monetary Policy:
Throughout 2013, the monetary authorities maintained tight monetary policy stance in response
to heightened inflationary pressures using appropriate mix of policy instruments. They also
strived to ensure exchange rate stability with necessary adjustments to align it to economic
fundamentals. The immediate impact of these measures is the achievement of single digit
inflation which the authorities intend to keep within the 6 – 9 percent band in2014. The monetary
policy stance and the exchange rate policies are expected to continue, as the recent decision of
the Monetary Policy Committee indicates. This is occasioned by the current liquidity challenges,
which may increase in accordance with the anticipated increase in spending in the run-up to the
general elections in 2015. The concern by staff over the use of cash reserve requirement instead
of reliance on open market operation is well noted. The authorities stand ready to deploy
appropriate instruments as situation warrants.
Financial Stability and Inclusion:
With the successful stabilization of the financial system after the domestic banking crisis, the
focus of the authorities has turned to strengthening the financial system and repositioning I t to
play a greater role in the Transformation Agenda. This was evidenced in the sector’s active
involvement in the privatization of the power companies in 2013. More of this role is expected in
2014 and beyond. It is in this sense that the authorities strive to strengthen the risk-based and
cross border supervision frameworks, and ensure transparency in the operation of the financial
system. This is attested to by the numerous memorandum of understanding signed between
Nigeria and countries hosting subsidiaries of Nigerian banks on cross-border supervision, and
Nigeria’s participation in the regional College of Supervisors.
The authorities are also strengthening the legal and institutional frameworks for financial sector
regulation and crisis resolution. Already, a diagnostic study of the entire financial system is
underway. Additionally, the special purpose vehicle for bank crisis resolution – the Asset
Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) – has been directed to desist from further
purchase of additional assets from banks to avoid moral hazard and ensure prudent risk
management. The company is also expected to redeem all its debt held by deposit money banks
by October 2014. The authorities are working on the appropriate exit date for AMCON. It should
be noted that a Sinking Fund was established by AMCON and Deposit Money banks (DMBs)
intended for the liquidation of potential loss to be incurred by AMCON. It is expected that this
buffer will significantly minimize the contingent liability of the government arising from the
operations of AMCON.
Nigeria is no longer in the FATF’s list of countries with significant weaknesses in AML/CFT
standards as a relatively well developed AML framework is in place. However, preparations for
the next mutual evaluation of compliance with the new FATF international AML/CFT standards
have begun. It is equally important to note that efforts are on to increase financial inclusion. The

4
initiatives under the National Financial Inclusion Strategy include extension of coverage of
Mobile Payment System and other Cash-less Policies to all parts of the country, and
implementation of Credit Enhancement Schemes/Programs to empower micro, small, and
medium enterprises such as the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Fund, The
Nigerian Incentive-Based Risk Sharing System for Agricultural Lending, Entrepreneurship
Development Centers, Restructuring and Refinancing Facilities for SMEs, and SME Credit
Guarantee Scheme.
Improving Competitiveness and Productivity:
The authorities view structural reforms as the surest way to diversify the economy and improve
competitiveness and productivity. The multi-faceted approach adopted in the Transformation
Agenda include developing a viable value chain within the agricultural sector, entertainment
industry, non-oil minerals, and real estate as well as improvement in power, road and port
infrastructure, education, and health. Equally important is enhancement of credit access for
agriculture and small and medium scale enterprises. Significant progress has been recorded in all
these areas. We shall only focus on few of them.
Agriculture
In agriculture, the focus is on achieving the twin goals of job creation and inclusive growth
through critical sectoral initiatives, particularly for the major crops with significant export
potentials such as rice, cassava, sorghum, oil palm, cocoa, and cotton. The key initiative is the
Government’s Growth Enhancement Scheme through which an estimated 4.2 million farmers
received subsidized inputs in 2013. There is also collaboration with the private sector to improve
financing for the sector through funds such as the $100 million Fund for Agricultural Finance in
Nigeria which would serve as agriculture focused private equity fund. New agro-industrial
clusters are also being established across the country. The ultimate goal is to achieve self
sufficiency in the production of basic staple food. In terms of employment creation, the target is
to attract over 750,000 young Nigerians into agribusiness through the Youth Employment in
Agriculture initiative. Meanwhile, in 2013, over 250,000farmers producing 1.1 million metric tons
of dry season rice were engaged. The authorities intend to continue with fiscal incentives to the
sector.
Power and other infrastructure
Epileptic power supply has been a binding constraint to industrialization in Nigeria. However, this
challenge is now being addressed decisively. Significant milestone was achieved in 2013 with the
privatization of 4 power generation companies and 10 power distribution companies. The
successful bidders for the remaining one generation company and two distribution companies
were announced, and the initial bid amount (25 percent of the bid price) has been paid by the
bidders. Within the year $1.5 billion in financing was mobilized from multilateral sources to invest
in the transmission network. The power market intermediaries such as the Nigerian Bulk
Electricity Trading Plc were strengthened with over120 billion naira in financing. This is in
addition to the commencement of construction of a new 700MW Hydro-Power project. In 2014,
the focus is on completing the privatization of the National Integrated Power projects, expedited

5
work on gas pipeline infrastructure for the power projects, further investment in hydro-electric
power, and efficient transmission of power. The government also plans to accelerate work on
ongoing road and rail projects across the country, speed up upgrading of communication
technology, and aviation infrastructures especially the construction of five new airport terminals
and 13 perishable air cargo terminals.
Small, Medium, and Large Enterprises
The authorities are also focusing on small, medium and large enterprises for employment
creation and industrialization. Recently, the Nigerian Industrial Revolution Plan (NIRP) and the
Nigeria Enterprise Development Program (NEDP) were launched by the President. The aim of
NEDP is to help small and medium enterprises with business development support, access to
finance and training needs. The NIRP is expected to accelerate growth in those industries where
Nigeria has comparative and competitive advantages such as the processing of food and
agricultural products, metals and solid minerals processing, oil and gas related industries,
construction, light manufacturing and services. The target is to increase the contribution of the
manufacturing sector to GDP from the present 4 percent, to more than 10percent over a fiveyear period.
To further support the industrialization process, a new wholesale development finance institution
will be established by end-2014 to provide medium-to long-term financing for Nigerian
businesses. The authorities are currently working with the World Bank, the Africa Development
Bank, the BNDES Bank in Brazil, and other development partners to realize this project. This is in
addition to restructuring of the Bank of Agriculture and Bank of Industry as specialized
institutions to retail financing from this new wholesale development bank. Furthermore, the new
Common External Tariff (CET) policy will provide additional support to emerging industries.
Social Safety Nets
In order to address the increasing inequality and vulnerability, my authorities have piloted a
number of social safety net programs such as (i) the maternal and child health programs under
the Saving One Million Lives program, (ii) routine immunization programs, and (iii)the conditional
cash transfer and various community-driven development programs. The authorities intend to
work with the World Bank to design a comprehensive social protection scheme.
Security
While security of lives and property of all Nigerians remains a priority of the Federal Government,
special attention is given to the North East where security forces intensifying efforts to contain
the Boko-Haram insurgents. To mitigate the impact on the citizens, the Federal government, in
collaboration with development partners, is introducing a5 billion naira intervention program the Federal Initiative for the North East (FINE) – for the region. This will facilitate rehabilitation of
local schools and health clinics as well as provide additional assistance to farmers.

6
Conclusion
Over the last three years, my Nigerian authorities have made progress in laying the right
foundation for enduring inclusive growth. This is evident in the strong growth performance even
though it will take a while for it to translate into significant reduction in unemployment,
inequality and poverty. The strong performance has also increased the confidence of the
international community in the economy as demonstrated recently in the one billion-dollar
Eurobond issue which was four times oversubscribed and the reaffirmation of the economy’s BBsovereign credit rating by rating agencies. Nigeria has become a prime destination of foreign
direct investment in Africa. Given it market size, which would be significantly enhanced with the
completion of the GDP rebasing exercise – done in collaboration with the IMF, the World Bank,
and the African Development Bank – a lot of opportunities abound. Given the authorities’
unswerving commitment to the implementation of structural reforms, it will not be long before
these opportunities are translated into reality. Meanwhile, my authorities remain grateful to the
Fund for the encouragement received through numerous technical assistance and policy advice
over the years.
