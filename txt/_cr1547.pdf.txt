STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context: Despite the abundance of natural resources and one of the highest levels of income
per capita in sub-Saharan Africa for several decades, poverty remains widespread and
unemployment is high. Weak institutions and governance, a shallow financial sector, and a poor
business environment have been obstacles to transforming the oil wealth into better living
conditions for the population. In 2010, after a long period of lackluster growth, the authorities
launched an ambitious strategic vision—Plan Stratégique Gabon Emergent (PSGE)—to
transform Gabon into a diversified emerging market economy by 2025. The resulting scaling up
in public investment significantly accelerated economic growth, but also substantially
weakened the fiscal stance. As a key member of the CEMAC currency and economic union,
Gabon’s economic policies have significant regional implications and spillovers.
Risks: In the context of the recent sharp decline in oil prices, the foremost downside risk to the
economic outlook in the short to medium term is an inadequate fiscal adjustment, leading to
further depletion of fiscal buffers, rapid debt accumulation, and insufficient fiscal space to
address binding constraints to growth.
Key policy recommendations
The oil price shock underscores the need for faster fiscal adjustment and acceleration of
structural reforms:
• Fiscal Policy. The fiscal stance should aim at adjusting to low oil prices to avoid a rapid
escalation of public debt levels and accumulation of arrears. On the revenue side, there is need
to compensate for declining oil revenues by widening the tax base, notably by reducing tax
exemptions and improving tax administration. The main focus should be on the expenditure
side by controlling the rapidly increasing wage bill and phasing out costly oil subsidies. The
emphasis should be on improving the quality of investment, rather than increasing its level.
• Structural Policies. Promote inclusive growth, structural transformation and economic
diversification by focusing on “horizontal” binding constraints to growth such as infrastructure
bottlenecks especially in transportation and electricity, as well as enhancing the business
environment, improving the quality of education and vocational training to reduce the skills
mismatch on the labor market, and reforming the legal and regulatory framework to support
employment creation in the private sector.
• Financial Sector. Promote financial deepening and access by improving the institutional
environment for credit, especially for SMEs, and enhancing access to microfinance and other
financial services for households. Implement plans to restructure the three public banks in
financial difficulty. Policies should be consistent with CEMAC regional financial sector
development and stability objectives.

BACKGROUND: STRATEGY TO REVERSE ECONOMIC AND
SOCIAL DECLINE
1.
Despite oil wealth, economic growth for most of the past 15 years has been lackluster
and has not been inclusive. Real GDP growth averaged less than 1 percent in the decade through
2009 (Figure 1). As a result, despite relatively high per capita GDP (US$11,100 in 2013), one third of the
population remains below the poverty line and (formal) unemployment is at 20 percent. While the
political environment has remained stable, weak institutions and governance, a shallow financial sector,
and a poor business environment have been obstacles to transforming the oil wealth into better living
conditions for the population. Against this backdrop, President Ali Bongo Ondimba launched in 2010
an ambitious plan to transform Gabon into an emerging and diversified economy by 2025,
underpinned by a large US$12 billion public investment program.

2.
The Plan Stratégique Gabon Emergent (PSGE) is the cornerstone of the authorities’
economic policies. The plan’s objectives are to: (i) significantly accelerate economic growth and
diversify its sources away from oil; (ii) improve social indicators by having more inclusive and job-rich
growth; and (iii) ensure sustainable management of natural resources for future generations. The two
main pillars of the strategy are to improve the level and quality of infrastructure, and to raise the
quality of human capital.
3.
Despite its upper middle-income country status, Gabon fares poorly in areas that are
critical to the success of the PSGE. Figure 2 and Text Table 1 compare Gabon to other emerging
economies on several indicators, including the business environment and financial market

development.1 As seen in Figure 2, Gabon ranks considerably lower than its comparators in most
determinants of competitiveness, and does poorly in basic aspects such as infrastructure, health, and
education. Comparisons of financial indicators show that emerging countries have considerably more
financial depth and market access than Gabon (Text Table 1).

Gabon is the second largest economy in the CEMAC monetary and economic
union, and its policies have significant spillover effects to the union. This is notably
the case regarding the accumulation of external reserves, since Gabon’s large oil wealth is
a major source of foreign exchange to the union. Representing over one fifth of CEMAC’s
nominal GDP, the evolution of the Gabonese economy is bound to have significant effects
over the rest of the region. Furthermore, a successful, fiscally sustainable implementation
of Gabon’s diversification plan would not only be a valuable model for other countries in
the region that are aiming to foster non-oil growth, but the resulting improvement in
Gabon’s roads and telecommunications infrastructure could foster the region’s integration

GROWTH HAS IMPROVED, BUT NEAR TERM RISKS HAVE
INCREASED
5.
Gabon’s growth performance has recently been strong, but fiscal pressures increased
significantly. Real GDP growth has averaged about 6 percent in the last four years on the back of
substantial scaling-up of public investment (Figure 3). Higher oil and manganese export prices have
improved the external current account balance since 2010. However, the fiscal position has increasingly
come under pressure due to a very rapid increase in spending, especially on investment,
notwithstanding historically high oil prices. By 2013 the overall budget surplus (commitment basis) had

virtually disappeared from a high of about 6 percent of GDP in 2009. Due to base effects in 2013,
average inflation has increased in 2014 to a projected 4½ percent.
6.
The growth outlook for 2015 has weakened due to the oil price shock, but should
improve afterwards. Thus, while 2015 growth is projected to slowdown to 4½ percent, it should
average about 5.7 percent in the following five years, driven by public investment, non-oil natural
resources, and services. The gradual decline in oil output—which is driven by maturing wells—will
likely continue in the coming years3, but may potentially be somewhat mitigated by the introduction of
new extraction technologies and new small-scale discoveries. A number of projects underway at
Special Economic Zones (SEZs) in agro-industry, mining, and wood processing, should help sustain the
projected non-oil growth.
7.
The foremost downside risk to the economic outlook in the short to medium term is an
insufficient adjustment to fiscal policy in the face of extremely weak oil prices, and weak
investment execution capacity. This could lead to further depletion of fiscal buffers and insufficient
fiscal space to address binding constraints to growth (see Risk Assessment Matrix), which could
depress both aggregate demand and supply. In the longer run, there is upside potential to raise
growth if the PSGE rapidly succeeds in its objectives of reducing “horizontal” binding constraints, such
as infrastructure bottlenecks, lack of qualified labor, and a weak business environment. In fact, the
diversification strategy is starting to bear fruit in attracting new FDI in mining, wood processing, and
agro-industry. The baseline assumes a somewhat higher growth rate toward the end of the projection
period, in part driven by increased FDI. The baseline projections also assume implementation of
additional fiscal adjustment beyond what the authorities currently envisage. If fiscal adjustment is
insufficient or delayed, the lack of sufficient fiscal space could derail the diversification strategy toward
a more private sector-led growth (see Figure 4). With the projected trend decline in oil exports, the
external current account surplus is expected to turn negative over the medium term.

The significant decline in 2015 is in part driven by large-scale rehabilitation of some wells.

With respect to the baseline scenario, the “No Fiscal Adjustment Scenario” assumes: (i) a lower increase in nonoil revenues because tax exemptions are not significantly eliminated; (ii) the fuel subsidy scheme is not reformed;
(iii) other current spending items are not controlled and therefore grow in tandem with non-oil GDP throughout
the projection period; and (iv) public investment also grows at the same rate as non-oil GDP from 2015.

Gabon’s track record in implementing the recommendations of the last Article IV
consultation has been relatively weak, with some progress made only recently (see Text Table
2). Gabon has not adopted an oil price-smoothing rule and fiscal buffers have not been rebuilt mainly
due to continued high spending levels, especially on the wage bill and energy subsidies. However,
during 2014 the authorities eliminated industrial diesel subsidies for most sectors and reduced the very
high capital spending. They also reduced the number of days needed to open a business in SEZs, and
have initiated the assessment of the financial situation of weak public banks.

ADJUSTING FISCAL POLICY TO ENSURE SUSTAINABLE
FINANCING OF AUTHORITIES’ GROWTH AND
DIVERSIFICATION STRATEGY
9.
Given the economic challenges facing Gabon, the Article IV consultation was centered on
how to make the PSGE a reality while ensuring fiscal sustainability in the face of a major terms of
trade shock. Specifically, the discussions focused on the following issues: (i) creating the fiscal space
necessary to finance the PSGE on a fiscally sustainable basis, notably by keeping rapid public debt
accumulation in check despite the collapse in oil prices; (ii) policies to strengthen competitiveness and
promote economic diversification; and (iii) deepening the financial sector and enhancing financial
stability.

A. Financing the PSGE on a Fiscally Sustainable Basis
Fiscal framework and policies
10.
Despite historically high oil prices, in recent years the fiscal stance has substantially
deteriorated as a result of a massive scaling up of public investment. The accelerated
10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GABON

implementation of the PSGE led to a large increase in government expenditures from 38 percent of
non-oil GDP in 2009 to 46.5 percent in 2013 (see Figure 5).4 The non-oil primary deficit consequently
increased from 11.7 to 19.6 percent of non-oil GDP between 2009 and 2013. The massive boost in
public spending, in the context of gradually declining oil revenues, has been partly financed by a large
increase in public debt from 16.5 percent of GDP in 2011 to 27.6 percent in 2013, statutory advances at
the maximum permissible level and a rapid draw-down of deposits at the central bank in 2014, a
significant accumulation of domestic payments and VAT arrears, and even some accumulation of
external arrears.5
11.
The authorities recognized the tight fiscal situation, appropriately rectified their 2014
budget in order to scale down their investment program, and are finalizing a conservative 2015
budget assuming much lower oil revenues. The revised budget approved by parliament in July 2014
sharply cut down capital spending with respect to the initial budget by an amount equivalent to
12 percent of 2014 non-oil GDP. Preliminary estimates indicate that the adjustment in 2014 resulted in
an overall surplus of 4½ percent of non-oil GDP on a commitment basis that allowed the government
to pay about CFAF 435 billion in arrears.6 The authorities also recently implemented measures to speed
up the reimbursement of the VAT. The most recent version of the 2015 budget to be sent to parliament
conservatively assumes the price of Brent oil at US$45 per barrel, cuts down spending on goods and
services with respect to 2014, substantially reduces oil subsidies, reschedules repayment of domestic
arrears7, and freezes the level of public investment. To protect capital spending, the government
intends to issue a eurobond in 2015.8 The staff report baseline scenario (see Tables 1-5 and Figure 7)
incorporates the expenditures proposed in the latest 2015 budget, reduces by half the size of the
eurobond issuance, and projects oil revenues based on a price of US$51 per barrel as per January 20,
2015 WEO assumptions. For 2016 onwards, the projections are based on staff’s understanding of the
authorities’ planned medium-term policies, and present an adjustment scenario aimed at controlling
public debt levels and ensuring repayment of arrears, mainly by containing the wage bill growth and
considerably reducing oil subsidies.

4

In assessing the quality of the scaling up of public investment it is worth noting that a considerable part of it was extrabudgetary and another significant amount was allocated to developing the infrastructure needed to host the African Cup
of Nations in 2012.
5

Non-accumulation of government arrears (domestic or external) is a CEMAC convergence criterion.

6

Oil revenue performance was better than originally projected in part due to settlement of arrears and fines of over
CFAF 190 billion.
7

The authorities are negotiating the repayment of arrears over the next three years. They are committed to remain
current on VAT reimbursements.

8

The initial 2015 budget planned the issuance of a US$1 billion eurobond, but the authorities may revise down this
amount in view of the tightening financing terms in international markets for Gabon (see Figure 3) and other oil
producers.

12.
The substantial and continued decline in oil revenues will complicate the sustainable
implementation of the PSGE, absent additional fiscal consolidation. With oil prices forecast at half
of their 2014 level and with Gabonese production continuing its declining trend, considerable fiscal
adjustment is required. As seen in Figure 4, without adjustment the fiscal position would deteriorate
sharply and debt levels would considerably surpass the government’s own ceiling of 35 percent of GDP.

in global interest rates could be further complicated by negative prospects in the oil sector and the
perception of a weakening fiscal situation. In fact, the spread of Gabon’s 2013 eurobond has climbed
about 200 basis points between end-November 2014 and mid-January 2015 (see Figure 6), and the
regional bond market may also tighten as many oil exporters in the region are also seeking additional
financing. The implementation of the PSGE itself could be endangered without the fiscal resources
needed for many of its public and public-private investments. At the same time, even if projects under
12

the PSGE reach production stage in the medium run, generous tax concessions will significantly limit
their potential contribution of net fiscal revenues anytime soon.9

In this context, ensuring the fiscal sustainability of the PSGE requires revenue and
spending measures upfront. The non-oil revenue tax base should be expanded, notably by reducing
overly generous tax exemptions. On the spending side, the government should strictly contain growth
in current expenditures, especially of the wage bill, and seize the opportunity provided by low oil prices
to phase out the substantial and poorly targeted fuel subsidies (Appendix III), while protecting welltargeted spending on key social areas. The government should avoid any increase in spending beyond
its current projections in the run-up to the 2016 elections. Staff’s macroeconomic framework assumes
the full implementation of these measures, and shows how capital spending can be gradually increased
to finance the PSGE while accumulating currently low government deposits to protect the economy
against exogenous shocks and without permanently violating the government’s debt ceiling.10,11 The
government should further strengthen the legal environment to promote PPPs in order to help finance
much-needed infrastructure, making sure the necessary safeguards are in place so as to avoid putting
excessive risk on the government. Finally, staff recommends anchoring medium-term fiscal policy based

Even if new oil explorations bear fruit, they will not reach production stage until the next decade.

10

The proposed framework actually assumes that, given tighter financing conditions for oil exporters in the oil market,
the authorities issue a US$500 million eurobond in 2015, not the previously planned US$1 billion. For 2016, the
assumption is that Gabon will issue a US$250 million eurobond.

11

Throughout the projection period, Gabon would be in compliance of CEMAC’s convergence criteria, including the nonaccumulation of government arrears criterion, which was violated in recent years.

on a nonoil primary deficit of less than 10 percent of GDP and an overall surplus of at least 2 percent of
GDP, which would allow the authorities to progressively rebuild fiscal buffers.
14.
Under the proposed staff scenario, public debt approaches the government’s ceiling only
temporarily and gradually declines afterwards, but shocks could considerably worsen the debt
situation (see Debt Sustainability Analysis). Debt is expected to continue its rapid upward trend in
2015 and 2016 slightly exceeding the 35 percent of GDP ceiling in 2016, and gradually decline
afterwards as the government further controls spending. External debt is also projected to increase up
to 2016 and gradually decline afterwards. Lack of fiscal adjustment, GDP growth below projections,
and/or shocks to government revenues would significantly accelerate public debt accumulation to bring
it considerably above the government’s ceiling. External debt could substantially rise if the non-interest
rate current account deteriorates and the real exchange rate depreciates.12 The destabilizing impact of
the shock scenarios highlights the urgent need to accumulate fiscal buffers.
Authorities’ views
15.
Given the tight fiscal situation and the collapse of oil prices, the authorities recognized
the need for further adjustment. In their view, the oil price shock has underscored the need to
accelerate structural reforms to boost non-oil growth. While emphasizing the need to keep public debt
below its conservative ceiling by limiting growth in current spending, they stressed the need to
adequately finance their diversification strategy. In order to do so, the authorities agreed on the need to
eliminate discretionary tax exemptions and progressively phase out fuel subsidies, while more forcefully
controlling current expenditures after 2016. At the same time, they underscored the need to protect
capital spending by shifting away resources from current spending, notably on goods and services. The
authorities emphasized that they are also strengthening the PPP regulatory framework, as well as
redoubling its tax collection effort. Revenue measures also include greater emphasis on risk-based
audits and enhanced customs controls including the use of scanners, which will be facilitated by the
survey of tax expenditure already undertaken by the authorities. To improve the credibility of the tax
system, the authorities are committed to ensuring that they are current on VAT refunds.
Public finance management issues
16.
Ensuring the fiscal sustainability of PSGE requires continued efforts to improve the effectiveness
and efficiency of government spending. A recent Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA)
assessment on Gabon found many deficiencies in its PFM system including: (i) low credibility of the
budget due to frequent upward revisions and inadequate monitoring of arrears; (ii) weak accounting
and financial reporting; (iii) insufficient monitoring and external audit, and lack of parliamentary review;
(iv) weak internal controls; and (v) low transparency of budgetary transactions and of transfers to local
authorities. On the positive side, the PEFA praised the fact that the annual budget is prepared in a
participatory process and within a medium-term framework.

12

The shock scenarios considered in the DSA could result from, for example, a decline in oil prices below WEO
projections or a limited growth pay-off of the PSGE.

Overall, the PEFA concluded that the PFM system remains outdated and relatively
ineffective. There are gaps between budget transactions and accounting, delays in the expenditure
chain, inadequate financial information systems, a chasm between payroll and personnel files, and weak
ex-post internal controls. There is need to improve the quality of spending, especially for investment
(“investing in investment”) by enhancing the selection, execution and monitoring (Figure 8), as well as
to curtail high extra-budgetary spending, which potentially leads to the accumulation of arrears, and to
strengthen anti-corruption safeguards. These improvements should be facilitated by more manageable
levels of investment.

An action plan should be developed to tackle weaknesses identified in the PEFA. The
authorities should aim to: (i) improve the completeness of the transactions recorded in the state budget
by fully integrating revenue and expenditure operations currently performed in cash on the accounts of
the treasury; (ii) enhance financial supervision of public institutions; (iii) modernize the accounting
functions to produce more reliable accounts within a reasonable time; and (iv) strengthen collaboration
between revenue collection units (at the Ministry of the Economy) and spending units (at the Ministry of
the Budget).
Authorities’ views
19.
The authorities expressed their determination to strengthen the PFM system and
welcomed IMF assistance in this area. They also highlighted recent PFM reforms, such as the recent
establishment of a single treasury account, the unification of customs and tax statements, and the

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GABON

ongoing process to introduce a "budgeting by program objective" (BOP, according to its initials in
French), which should result in a budget implementation in program mode as of January 2015.13 The
law governing the budget in BOP mode should be adopted by end-2014. The authorities underscored
their determination to increase transparency of natural resource revenues. To this end, they have
adopted an action plan to become EITI-compliant during 2015. Regarding investment quality, the
authorities highlighted their adoption of a public procurement code, a requirement to finalize technical
studies underpinning specific investment projects before monetary outlays are made, and a
requirement to effect payments only after proof of performance. They also note that Bechtel
Corporation, a large construction and engineering multinational company, contributes to the design
and monitoring of the implementation of PSGE infrastructure projects.

B. Improving Competitiveness for Economic Diversification and Structural
Transformation
20.
The PSGE aims to achieve greater economic diversification while moving up on the
exports value-added chain. With oil-related GDP accounting for about 35 percent of GDP and oil
exports accounting for about 80 percent of goods exports in 2014, and against the background of
falling oil prices and aging oil wells14, the authorities recognize the need to develop non-oil sectors
(mainly agro-industry, wood processing, industrial fishing, and service exports). Overall, the PSGE has an
ambitious target of creating 325,000 new jobs by 2025. According to value chain analyses conducted by
the World Bank for agriculture, forestry, and tourism, key hurdles to the expansion of the non-oil
economy include high transportation and labor costs, low labor productivity, and lack of craftsmanship
and technical know-how.15
21.
To meet the PSGE’s objectives, the government has taken several actions. In 2010, the
government banned the export of raw logs. A special economic zone (SEZ) has been established at
Nkok (near Libreville) and a free-trade zone is being established in Port-Gentil. Both offer very generous
incentives to firms exporting more than 75 percent of their production, including a 10-year corporate
income tax holiday, total tariff exemption on imported capital equipment and parts, total exemption
from the value-added tax (VAT) for the first 25 years, unlimited and tax-free profit repatriation, and
flexible labor laws for seven years for the employment of foreign workers. 16 Steps have also been taken
to facilitate business, such as cutting in half to two weeks the average time needed to start a business in
the SEZ of Nkok, and the granting of construction permits has been reduced from more than six
months to ten days.

13

Staff emphasized that considerable risks to its effective implementation remain, especially insufficient staff training and
inadequate testing of new software, and recommended back-up options.

14

Even if ongoing exploration in deep offshore bears fruit, production stage would be reached in the next decade and
therefore oil production is expected to fall by 10 percent between 2013 and 2020.

22.
To support the economic takeoff, the PSGE seeks to improve public infrastructure,
enhance the business climate, and strengthen human capital. Objectives for the modernization of
public infrastructure include developing a nationwide fiber optic infrastructure, doubling the country’s
energy capacity to 1,000 MW, and establishing a national network of 3,600 kilometers of paved roads17
and 3,000 kilometers of waterways by 2025. The target for business climate reforms is to make Gabon
one of the top 10 performers in Africa in the ranking of the World Bank’s of Doing Business indicators
by 2020 (Figure 9). Regarding human capital formation, the objective is to refocus the educational
system toward technical training in the sectors targeted by the PSGE.
23.
Despite considerable progress in attracting investment and improving infrastructure
(Appendix I), the government needs to focus on “horizontal” policies to ensure a positive impact
of the PSGE on the Gabonese population. Key achievements under the PSGE include improvements
in transport and energy infrastructure, and joint-ventures with foreign companies in strategic sectors,
but much remains to be done. Indeed, foreign investors typically cite insufficient and unreliable
electricity supply, limited supply of qualified labor, and security of contracts as key deterrents to
investing in Gabon. Given high labor costs, the authorities have aimed to compensate for them by
granting foreign investors tax exemptions and subsidized electricity. This may have the perverse effect
of attracting industries that are capital-intensive, thereby leading to a limited increase in employment
and government revenue. Staff underscored that cross-country evidence shows that to attract laborintensive industries that do not require direct government assistance, priority should be given to
“horizontal” reforms.18 These include notably reforms to improve the business climate, physical
infrastructure, and the quality of technical education. Clear targets for social indicators should be
defined and surveys should be conducted regularly to monitor progress. This is particularly important
given that Gabon has fallen short of meeting most Millennium Development Goals (Table 7).
24.
The real effective exchange rate is overvalued by 9 to 15 percent (Appendix II), following
the large decline in oil prices. The recent collapse in oil prices significantly weakened the current
account currently forecasted to fall from a surplus of 11 percent of GDP in 2014 to a deficit of about
4 percent in 2015. In the medium term, the current account deficit is projected to moderate somewhat
on the back of higher processed wood and manganese exports. The deficit is expected to be financed
with FDI inflows into strategic sectors19 and with external borrowing by the government, consistently
with debt sustainability. To reinforce external stability, structural policies should be implemented to
curtail factor costs considered high by regional standards. Key priorities are: (1) adopting a more
prudent medium-term fiscal stance to sustain the implementation of programs and projects under the
PSGE; and (2) accelerating the pace of structural reforms to boost human capital development and
improve the business climate.

Authorities’ views
25.
The authorities concurred on the need to improve infrastructure, boost human capital
development, and accelerate business climate reforms to diversify the Gabonese economy. They
further agreed that business climate reforms would be essential to the realization of public-private
partnerships needed to support the PSGE, and noted the recent creation of a special agency to improve
the business climate (Agence Nationale de la Promotion des Investissements) and efforts to improve
technical education under the PSGE. They also noted ongoing discussions with local businesses to
enhance their role in on-the-job training, and their intention to establish a specialized court for
mediating industrial disputes in 2015. However, they argued that given high labor costs, the small size
of the economy, and international competition, they had no choice but to offer incentives and
affordable electricity for SEZs—which was possible in part due to newer lower-cost plants. Finally, the
authorities deemed staff’s growth projections to be rather conservative.

C. Enhancing Financial Access and Financial Stability
26.
The financial sector in Gabon comprises mainly banks, and is highly concentrated. Three
banks account for nearly 75 percent of total assets, and their activity is concentrated on large
companies financing large-scale projects. Financial intermediation remains limited (lending to the
private sector is 15 percent of GDP), and well below the average for its emerging-market peers. The
nascent regional bond market, which has limited depth and short maturity profiles, can only meet a
limited amount of domestic financing needs. There are nine microfinance institutions (MFIs) and eight
insurance companies that operate in Gabon that have been increasingly instrumental in providing
financial access to households and small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs). Banking supervision is
carried out by the regional authority COBAC. While recent progress has been made in reforming the
regulatory framework, particularly in bank resolution, and licensing, the COBAC has also been facing
serious capacity constraints, which hinder its efficiency. Additional efforts will be required to develop
the regional bond market even to a level similar to that observed in the WAEMU.
27.
Financial access in Gabon is low due to several factors. While the share of population with
bank accounts has increased, it is still below the sub-Saharan Africa and emerging market averages.
Total credit provided to households constituted 3 percent of GDP in 2013. Given low financial
deepening, SMEs face even lower access to finance than in Gabon’s peer groups. Banks cite the absence
of credit bureaux and lack of company information and guarantees as underlying reasons for low credit
supply and high lending rates (Figure 10). Low financial deepening and access as well as high banking
sector liquidity also reduce the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission. Nonetheless, the
exchange rate peg has adequately anchored inflation expectations and inflation is quite low.

28.
Although the overall banking sector in Gabon remains liquid, profitable, and generally
well-capitalized, public banks are under financial stress.20 Overall financial soundness indicators
show that the banks were sufficiently capitalized with slightly higher return on assets and equity in
2013 compared to 2012. The liquidity ratio has come down as a result of increasing credit to the
economy, but remains high. The regulatory capital has been decreasing, but is above the legal
requirement of 8 percent, while non-performing loans are low at 3.5 percent of total assets.
Similarly, the ratio of provisions to non-performing loans decreased in 2013, although it is still at a
comfortable level. Although banks are not very exposed to the government directly, the weakening
government balance sheet will undoubtedly have a negative impact on the banking system through
increasing NPLs. Apart from the weaker growth outlook, the main transmission channel is likely to
be through the weakening financial situation of firms that rely on government contracts.
29.
Timely action is needed to address the weak financial situation of three distressed
public banks. These banks’ total assets amount to 9 percent of the banking system’s total and
3 percent of GDP. The banks are facing structural problems leading to significant
undercapitalization, and one of them has had serious governance issues. Faced with high overhead
costs relative to their peers, these banks are unable to generate sufficient revenues from lending
activities. Thus, they continue registering losses, but they have limited interbank relations with other
banks. Staff commends the authorities’ on their acknowledgement of the severity of the situation
and for initiating the process of assessing the financial needs to define an action plan. Staff
recommends developing resolution options in consultation with the regional bank supervisor,
COBAC, and subsequently taking timely action—which will likely have fiscal costs—to safeguard
financial stability.
Authorities’ views
30.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment of the financial sector, and
concurred with the need to improve financial access in the economy. They indicated that they
intend to continue their efforts in setting-up a credit registry, which is expected to decrease barriers
to finance. Regarding the three problem banks, the authorities informed staff that they have hired
international advisors to assess the banks, and to define an action plan and a financing package. As
for the MFIs, the authorities remain cautious of any macroprudential risks that may be induced by
these institutions.

More detailed assessment will be available after the completion of the ongoing regional FSAP exercise.

IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF DATA FOR DECISIONMAKING AND MONITORING PROGRESS UNDER PSGE,
AND FUND JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES
31.
The monitoring of the Gabonese economy and of the PSGE requires substantial
improvements in the quality, timeliness, and transparency of statistics. Comprehensive, readily
available, and high quality data are fundamental to the proper design and monitoring of a
development strategy. Reliable statistics are particularly important if the country wants to attain
market access levels similar to those that characterize emerging countries.
32.
Unfortunately, data comprehensiveness, availability and quality in Gabon have serious
shortcomings. In this regard, Gabon not only lags with respect to emerging economies, but even
with respect to SSA countries of much lower income per capita. Balance of payments statistics are
particularly weak, showing significant inconsistencies between oil exports and production data and
not elaborating International Investment Position data, for example. Financial soundness indicators
are very weak, and are produced with long lags.
33.
Since the 2012 Article IV mission the provision of public financial statements to staff
has been only sporadic. The authorities have provided fiscal statements in an untimely manner. In
addition, the quality of these statements is quite weak, considering that they have not reflected the
rapid accumulation of arrears in recent years, in part due to high extra-budgetary spending
undertaken by various public agencies. The authorities urgently need to improve the quality and
frequency of their fiscal statements to better monitor the fiscal sustainability of the PSGE.
34.
The authorities need to substantially strengthen the measurement of basic social
indicators. Household surveys are carried out with very low frequency. The latest survey of social
indicators in Gabon took place in 2012 and focused only on demographics and health. Gabon’s
latest unemployment figures date back to 2010.
35.
Fund jurisdictional issues. As has been noted in previous Article IV staff reports, Gabon
maintains a 1.5% tax on wire transfers abroad that is not consistent with Gabon’s obligations under
Article VIII, Section 2(a) of the Articles of Agreement. The proceeds of this tax are used to fund
Gabon’s health insurance scheme. The authorities note that they have exempted a number of
transactions from this tax (notably, all interbank transfers), but do not propose eliminating the tax.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
The Gabonese economy is at a crossroads, and the recent sharp decline in commodity
prices will make additional fiscal adjustment inevitable. While progress has been made to meet
some of the objectives of the PSGE, there is still a long way to go. A recent acceleration of public
investment has improved some infrastructure and put in place a nascent structural transformation.
However, the country is now facing a major negative terms of trade shock and has limited fiscal
buffers. The challenge ahead is to ensure that the recent growth pick-up is not derailed. In
particular, there is need to implement additional fiscal adjustment beyond what the authorities
currently envisage to secure the needed fiscal space and keep debt dynamics favorable. High
growth, especially outside of the enclave sectors, is necessary to reduce high unemployment,
especially among the youth. Given its prominent role in the CEMAC, Gabon should play a key role as
a champion for reform.
37.
Faced with the challenge of meeting infrastructure needs against the backdrop of
weak oil revenues, the government rightly decided to implement fiscal adjustment in 2014.
The very high level of investment spending undertaken from 2010 to 2013 was clearly unsustainable,
as it led to substantial accumulation of arrears. The fiscal measures implemented in 2014 and the
revised 2015 budget to be sent to parliament, which both better balance the need to address
infrastructure bottlenecks while maintaining medium-term debt sustainability are steps in the right
direction, but clearly more adjustment is needed in the medium run.
38.
Despite a much lower level of oil revenues, the government needs to repay arrears and
control the debt dynamics, while significantly improving the quality of investment. On the
revenue side, there is need to compensate for declining oil revenues by widening the tax base,
notably by reducing tax exemptions and improving tax administration. At the same time, improving
the management of oil revenues over the medium term will be crucial. That said, the main focus
should be on the expenditure side, containing the growth in current spending, especially in the
wage bill and seizing the opportunity of low oil prices to phase out costly, inefficient, and
inequitable fuel subsidies. After the recent reduction in investment the emphasis should therefore
be on improving the quality of investment (“investing in investment”) by addressing weaknesses in
investment prioritization—focusing on those with highest returns, project preparation, execution
and monitoring.
39.
Staff supports efforts under way to improve the management and transparency of
public finances. The planned implementation of program budgeting from 2015 is a step in the right
direction. To ensure full success, there is need to enhance training in the use of new monitoring and
accounting tools. There is also need for better coordination between the Ministries of the Economy
and the Budget, especially in treasury management, to eliminate the frequent accumulation of
payment arrears. More details on public finances should be provided to the general public, including
on budget execution. Staff welcomes the authorities’ renewed efforts to become fully compliant
with EITI standards by end-2015 to ensure transparency and accountability in the management of
natural resource wealth.

40.
The government has appropriately aimed at diversifying the economy away from oil,
and the oil price shock has underscored the need to foster diversification. Its strategy hinges on
addressing a number of binding constraints to growth, especially weak infrastructure in electricity
production and transportation, but the government also provides overly generous tax exemptions to
many projects that substantially limit their potential contribution to public revenues. Without strong
fiscal adjustment to the very weak commodity price outlook, there is considerable risk that lack of
sufficient fiscal space could impede on the government’s ability to implement a well-focused
diversification strategy. Thus, there is need to focus more on “horizontal” policies aimed at
improving the business climate and the educational system to provide better trained labor. These
policies would help lower factor costs, thereby boosting Gabon’s competitiveness and helping
establish external stability.
41.
There is need to improve financial depth and inclusion, and forcefully address financial
weaknesses of three public banks. Staff recommends improving the operations of land and
commercial registries, streamlining procedures for recording and enforcing guarantees, and
strengthening creditor rights enforcement by enhancing governance of the relevant courts. Staff
commends the authorities for initiating due diligence to assess the financial situation of the weak
banks in order to define an action plan. Staff recommends developing resolution options and
subsequently taking timely action in collaboration with the regional supervisor.
42.
While the data provided to the Fund are broadly adequate for surveillance, there has
been a notable deterioration in the timeliness of provision. Balance of payments and financial
stability statistics are particularly weak, and fiscal statistics have not been provided on regular and
timely basis. Current efforts to strengthen official statistics services need to be redoubled and, in
particular, data on the International Investment Position needs to be produced and published.
43.
Gabon maintains a tax on wire transfers, which is inconsistent with its obligations
under Article VIII. Staff does not recommend approval of this restriction.
44.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation will be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

Annex 1. Gabon: Risk Assessment Matrix

121

Likelihood of Realization in the
Next Three Years

Expected Impact on Economy
if Risk is Realized

Staff assessment: High
A surge in financial volatility: as
investors reassess underlying risk and
move to safe-haven assets given slow and
uneven growth as well as asymmetric
monetary exit.

Staff Assessment: High
Gabon would find it difficult to
issue new sovereign bonds at
competitive interest rates.

Source of Risk



Side-effects from global financial conditions

Staff assessment: Medium


Global Risks

Persistent dollar strength: improving
U.S. economic prospects versus the rest of
the world leads to a further dollar surge,
boosting non-U.S. trade but creating
balance sheet strains for dollar debtors

Protracted period of slower growth in advanced and
emerging economies.

Staff Assessment: High
Advanced economies: Lower-thananticipated potential growth and
persistently low inflation due to a failure
to fully address legacies of the financial
crisis, leading to secular stagnation.



Staff Assessment: High
Dollar strength would help
mitigate the revenue impact of oil
price falls in local currency, but FX
debt service would also increase.
However, the former impact would
dominate.



Staff Assessment: High
Lower oil exports will sharply
reduce government revenue and
lead to increased public debt levels.
Financing for infrastructure would
be curtailed.









Emerging markets: Maturing of the
cycle, misallocation of investment, and
incomplete structural reforms leading to
prolonged slower growth.

Demand for non-oil exports
would be reduced, and would
negatively impact efforts of
diversification.



Staff Assessment: Medium to High
Capital spending has historically
been volatile and pro-cyclical, in the
context of weak administrative and
absorptive capacity.



Domestic Risks

Loosening of fiscal policy and weak investment execution
capacity.

Failure of full materialization of the diversification strategy
due to insufficient fiscal space and weak implementation
of structural reforms (e.g., PFM, business climate
initiatives).
Widening inequalities in income and job opportunities.

CEMAC institutional reform stalled.



Since 2009, the government has
failed to increase fiscal buffers despite
high hydrocarbon revenues.

Staff Assessment: Medium
Investment and growth would
remain hampered by a poor business
environment and over-reliance on a
public sector-led growth model.
 Non-hydrocarbon sectors would
remain rudimentary and offer few job
opportunities.
 Regional integration and
cooperation would remain limited.



FDI in non-oil sectors would
likely be lower, with a negative
impact on potential non-oil growth.
Staff Assessment: Medium to High
 A loose and inefficient fiscal
policy would raise inflation and
undermine competitiveness, thereby
inhibiting non-oil growth and
negatively impacting the poor.



Further scaling-up of capital
spending could strain the
absorptive and implementation
capacity, with impact on project
selection and scope for corruption,
and resulting in additional waste of
resources.
Staff Assessment: High
 Economic diversification and
job creation would be much lower
than hoped for, making the
objective of emerging market status
very difficult to reach.
 Continued social inequalities
could fuel social tensions. There is
an urgent need to improve human
development outcomes and
enhance job opportunities.
 Duplication of development
projects across the sub-region
would waste resources and new
growth opportunities would be lost.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF
staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a
probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff
views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and
materialize jointly.

Appendix I. PSGE Track Record
Industrial and Agricultural Development
1.
Several projects have been realized to enhance industrial and agricultural
development, mainly as joint-ventures with international investors. Key achievements include
the establishment of a 1,126 hectare SEZ specialized in wood processing in Nkok (near Libreville),
the development of two palm oil plantations with over 100,000 hectares in total, and the
development of a rubber plantation with over 28,000 hectares, all as joint ventures with the
Singapore-based multinational corporation OLAM. Project costs are estimated at about
US$400 million for the SEZ of Nkok, most of which has been spent by OLAM, and US$1 billion for
the palm oil and rubber plantations. Production in the Nkok SEZ started in 2012 and over 70 foreign
investors have signed up. In the palm oil and rubber plantations, production is expected to start in
2015 and 2019, respectively. So far, about 3,800 people have been employed by the plantations. In
addition, OLAM is involved in a US$2 billion joint venture project with the government for the
development of a fertilizer plant in the free trade zone of Port-Gentil.
Adding Value-Added to Manganese and Iron Exports
2.
Manganese and iron processing plants are being constructed to increase value-added.
In addition to the manganese processing plant under construction in the manganese deposit of
Ndjolé (expected production amounts to 700,000 tons of manganese per year), a metallurgical
complex is being built in the Moanda-Franceville mining area. This complex is expected to process
20,000 metric tons of manganese and 40,000 metric tons of silico-manganese on average per year.
Another industrial complex estimated to cost US$4 billion will be built in Belinga to produce about
44 million tons of iron ore and 18 million tons of transformed iron on average per year.
Ongoing Infrastructure Projects
3.
Infrastructure has been boosted to catalyze economic growth. About 435 km of new
paved roads have been constructed and work is ongoing to pave 980 km more. An agreement was
signed with Singapore Port Authority to modernize and extend the ports of Owendo and PortGentil. Five docks in river tributaries have been built throughout the country and two river ports
were built in the cities of Lambaréné and Port-Gentil. Other projects pertaining to energy
infrastructure development include ongoing construction of the 160 MW capacity-Grand Poubara
and the 84 MW-capacity Empresse Eugenie hydroelectric dams, and the upgrading project for the
Alenakiri gas-fired power plant (in Libreville) which is expected to double capacity from 35MW to
70 MW.
Human Capital Development and Business Climate Reforms
4.
The government seeks to enhance human capital development through technical
education and training. A Mines and Metallurgy school is expected to open in the metallurgical
complex of Moanda in September 2015. Measures implemented to improve the business climate
include the adoption of a special agency to promote investments (Agence Nationale de la Promotion
des Investissements), the computerization of procedures required to open a business, a reduction in

construction permits processing delays which fell from over 6 months to 10 days, and the adoption
of a one-stop shop for large companies at the national company for water and electricity (SEEG) to
reduce connection delays.

Appendix II. External Sector Assessment
Falling all prices and oil production have contributed to deteriorating the external sector. Results from
the methodology of Araujo et al. (2013) suggest that the effective real exchange rate is overvalued by
about 10 percent. The Bems and Carvalho methodology, which abstracts from returns on investment,
points to some overvaluation between 9 and 15 percent. While the current account balance is expected
to continue falling in the medium term, sustained capital inflows from FDI and external borrowing by
the government would help maintain a sound level of international reserves.
1.
Gabon’s current account is projected to fall from a surplus of 11 percent of GDP in
2014 to a deficit of 4 percent in 2015 and 3 percent in 2020. The deterioration of the current
account is caused by falling oil exports reflecting the joint impact of the oil price collapse and
maturing oil wells. Oil prices are forecasted to drop from US$96 per barrel in 2014 to US$51 per
barrel in 2015 and US$69 per barrel in 2020. In spite of potential new oil discoveries from ongoing
exploration projects, production is expected to fall by 9 percent between 2014 and 2020, owing to
aging wells. The share of non-oil exports to total exports would increase in the medium term from
about 23 percent in 2014 to 40 percent in 2020 as manganese and processed wood exports pick up
in the context of the PSGE while oil exports continue falling.
2.
Thanks to increased FDI, international reserves will gradually increase from 5 to
6 months of imports in 2014–20. Projected falls in the current account would be largely
compensated by growing foreign direct investment and government’s eurobond issuances. Future
government’s bond issuance would help finance public investment projects supporting the PSGE.
Expected FDI would mainly target deep offshore oil exploration projects, wood processing, rubber,
palm oil production, and manganese and iron ore production.

Exchange Rate Assessment
3.
The real effective exchange rate appears overvalued by 9 to 15 percent. Given an
estimate of the trade balance elasticity with respect to the real effective exchange rate of -0.611,
results from the methodology of Araujo et al. suggest real exchange rate overvaluation of about
10 percent. The Bems and Carvalho methodology, which abstracts from returns on investment,
indicates an overvaluation between 9 and 15 percent. Although Gabon’s real effective exchange rate
has remained relatively stable compared to other oil exporters over the past decade, both
methodologies point to a strong need to reinforce external competitiveness by accelerating the
pace of human capital development and business climate reforms.

4.
The methodology of Araujo et al. (2013) suggests that the effective real exchange rate
is overvalued. 22 This methodology solves for a current account norm resulting from a welfare
maximization problem in which productive investment needs may be financed by contracting
external debt that will be repaid from income flows from oil resources windfalls. It takes into account
absorptive capacity constraints associated with investment, reflecting the fact that ambitious public
and private investment programs in developing countries are often plagued by poor planning and
poor coordination which associated to weak oversight contribute to large cost overruns.33 Results

Trade elasticity is estimated assuming exports volume and imports volume elasticities equal to zero as in Hakura
and Billmeier, 2008, "Trade Elasticities in the Middle East and Central Asia: What is the Role of Oil?", IMF Working

Comparing investment flows to the physical measure variations of the public capital stock in Columbia and Mexico
over the period 1981-95, Arestoff and Hurlin (2006) estimates that one peso of public investments created around
0.40 pesos of public capital. Pritchett (1996) reports that in a typical developing country in earlier decades, less than
50 cents of capital were created for each public dollar invested.

from this methodology suggest an overvaluation of 9.9 and 9.7 percent under cost overrun
assumptions of 40 and 20 percent. Higher cost overruns lead to relatively higher investment needs
to cover for the larger inefficiencies, which in turn imply a higher current account balance norm.

Appendix III. Reform of Fuel Subsidies: Progress and Remaining
Agenda16
1.
The government has made progress in reducing its fuel subsidies. The main reform has
been the partial elimination of the subsidy to industrial diesel (excluding food processing, fishing,
cement production, and forestry). Another measure was the addition of imports duties to the
calculation of the notional market price on which the calculation of the subsidy is made.
2.
Fuel subsidies declined in 2014 as a result
of reforms and a decline in the oil price.
Preliminary estimates indicate that the gross subsidy
came down from CFAF 220 billion in 2013 to CFAF
125 billion in 2014 (see Figure), and because of the
decline in oil prices, the subsidy is expected to come
down to CFAF 24 billion in 2015 despite an increase
in volume.

3.
Further reforms are still needed given the
tight fiscal situation. Fuel subsidies took up 1.5 percent of GDP from government resources in
2014. In the context of lower oil prices the government could seize the opportunity and significantly
phase out the fuel subsidy scheme. Reforms in the short term could include: removal of the SOGARA
refinery markup and renegotiation of cost/margin in the pump price structure, and introduction of
competitive tenders for procurement of refined products. Eventual elimination of fuel subsidies
should be the ultimate objective, starting with elimination of the rest of industrial diesel subsidies,
followed by a reduction in gasoline subsidies.
4.
Lessons from experience in other countries point to the need for a comprehensive
strategy for the eventual elimination of fuel subsidies. The introduction of fuel pricing reforms
involves large trade-offs between different social and macroeconomic objectives. Recent work has
highlighted key elements of a successful reform strategy based on international experience:27
Analyze the costs and benefits of the subsidy system to the various stakeholders, and the
macroeconomic impact of possible reforms.
Consult widely with all stakeholders.
Communicate clearly: initiate a wide program to broaden the policy debate on fuel pricing by
mobilizing thought leaders and using far-reaching media.

Decide early on important parameters of the reform initiative, e.g., pace of price adjustment. The
reform commitment must be seen as irreversible.
Roll out tangible accompanying mitigating measures to provide offsets to stakeholders who are
adversely affected by the reforms, with particular emphasis on vulnerable households. Ideally,
targeting should be informed by a poverty mapping based on household surveys. In Gabon
there is an urgent need to conduct one, as the previous one is out of date. Possible mitigating
measures could include cash transfers and vouchers for public transportation.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By

Prepared by the staff of the International Monetary Fund

Anne-Marie Gulde-Wolf
and Daneshwar Ghura
While Gabon’s public and external debt remain at moderate levels, they have considerably
increased since the previous Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA), published two years ago.
In the context of a tight fiscal stance and with oil prices projected at about half of their
level in recent years, Gabon is implementing a major fiscal adjustment. Under a baseline
scenario that assumes that the needed adjustment takes place, debt is projected to
increase rapidly only temporarily and briefly exceed the government’s public debt ceiling
(of 35 percent of GDP). Lower than projected GDP growth, fiscal revenues, or current
account balances could lead to a dramatic increase in debt indicators, far above the
government’s debt ceiling. Therefore there is a need to gradually rebuild fiscal buffers.

GABON

PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Public debt level and structure. Gabon’s public debt has rapidly increased in recent years as the
government sought additional funds to finance the PSGE. From approximately 16.7 percent of GDP
in 2008, total public debt reached 27.3 percent of GDP in 2013. Gabon’s government debt is mostly
external (external debt accounts for 90 percent of total public debt) and medium-to-long term. It is
worth noting that while the CEMAC regional group sets a public debt ceiling at 70 percent of GDP
(deemed too high in recent CEMAC regional surveillance staff reports), Gabon sets a more
conservative ceiling of 35 percent of GDP.
Baseline scenario. The baseline scenario reflects projections made in the macroeconomic
framework described in Tables 1 to 6. This scenario assumes that the government, significantly
eliminates tax exemptions, rapidly removes most of the existing oil subsidies, further adjusts public
investment spending, and curbs other current spending items from 2017. International oil and other
commodity prices, as well as exchange rates reflect World Economic Outlook projections through
2020. The public DSA shows that the macroeconomic framework presented in this staff report would
result in debt levels that briefly exceed the government’s debt ceiling in 2016 and gradually
decrease from 2017.
Shocks. A historical scenario, in which financial needs are much lower than in the baseline, translates
into a reduction in public debt levels over the projection period. On the other hand, assuming that
the primary fiscal balance remains in deficit (equivalent to 1.3 percent of GDP), which could result
from insufficient fiscal adjustment, leads to a substantial accumulation of public debt, surpassing
60 percent of GDP. Assuming real GDP growth is 1 percentage point lower in the projection period
(a supply shock) leads to a substantial increase in public debt up to almost 60 percent of GDP. This
is similar to the result of a combined shock of a reduction in government revenues by 2 percentage
points of GDP (which could result if oil prices decline by 20 percent, for example) and a reduction in
GDP growth by 1 percentage point.

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
External debt level and structure. After a considerable restructuring and consequent reduction in
the late 2000s, Gabon’s external debt went up from US$2.1 billion in 2009 to about US$4.3 billion in
2013 (equivalent to 24.8 percent of 2013 GDP). Such an increase is partly the result of the issuance
of a US$1.5 billion eurobond in 2013. By end-2013, debt to multilateral institutions accounted for
13 percent of total external debt, bilateral debt for 23 percent, debt to commercial institutions for
24 percent and the remaining 40 percent was placed in financial markets.
Baseline scenario. The baseline scenario is the same as in the public debt sustainability analysis,
reflecting projections made in the macroeconomic framework described in Tables 1 to 6. With
respect to external debt, the macroeconomic framework assumes that the authorities are able to
issue eurobonds for US$500 million in 2015 and for US$250 million in 2016, half of what they had
previously intended, due to tighter market conditions. The framework assumes that the international
bond for US$1 billion that was issued in 2007 is not rolled over, as is the case in projections
provided by the authorities. Under this scenario, the external debt sustainability framework projects
an increase in external debt-to-GDP ratio to a peak of 31.7 percent in 2016, after which external
debt gradually declines to 28.1 percent in 2020.
Shocks. Alternative scenarios include a historical scenario in which main variables are assumed to be
the same as in the past ten years, and others that incorporate a 0.25 standard deviation applied to
real interest rate, growth rate, and the current account balance. While the historical scenario, in
which financial needs are much lower than in the baseline, lead to a drastic reduction in external
debt, other shocks to the baseline lead to a substantial debt escalation. Most notably, shocks to the
non-interest rate current account and the real exchange rate lead to an increase in external debt by
2020 up to 41 and 42 percent of GDP, respectively.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.



Relations with the Fund. Gabon has been a member of the International Monetary
Fund since 1963. Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC)
member countries accepted the obligations of Article VIII in June/July 1996. The
three-year SBA for about US $118 million expired in May 2010, with only the first
three reviews completed. Recurrent fiscal slippages made it difficult to sustain the
Fund-supported program. The last Article IV Consultation was concluded on February
13, 2013.



Relations with the World Bank. A US$ 58 million IBRD Loan for the Central African
Regional and National Backbone project (CAB4) supporting the development of high
speed telecommunication infrastructure was signed in May 2012. The World Bank is
preparing two US$ 100 million loans, one to finance basic urban services and another
to strengthen youth training.



Exchange rate regime: Gabon is a member of CEMAC. The common currency, the
CFA franc, is pegged at the fixed rate of 655.957 CFA franc per euro. Gabon’s tax on
wire transfers constitutes a restriction on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions subject to approval under Article VIII, Section 2 (a)
of the Articles of Agreement.



Statistical Issues. Gabon has subscribed to the General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS). While data are broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, staff analysis was
affected by the timeliness and coverage of fiscal data, the poor quality of balance of
payments and financial stability data, and the limited information on labor cost and
productivity.

Safeguards Assessments:
The Bank of the Central African States (BEAC) is the regional central bank of CEMAC. As with other
regional central banks, the BEAC is subject to a safeguards assessment every four years. The 2013
assessment, completed in November, spanned a period of change at the BEAC and occurred against
the backdrop of reforms initiated to address governance challenges and control failures that
emerged in 2009. These events led to close engagement with the IMF through monitoring of
safeguards “rolling measures” in the context of new program requests and reviews for CEMAC
countries. The BEAC had also initiated an action plan to reform its governance, strengthen key
safeguards, and build capacity. The 2013 assessment found that the BEAC has made some progress
in reinforcing its safeguards framework, but risks remained elevated. Further actions are needed to
fully restore sound governance and control, including through amendments to the BEAC charter and
commitment to achieve implementation of the reform and modernization plan. Governance at the
BEAC continues to be undermined by a legal framework that does not adequately protect
institutional autonomy, and problematic partial adherence of several member states to the reserves
pooling obligation that is fundamental to the operation of the currency union. The assessment also
concluded that annual IMF staff visits to monitor priority recommendations and progress on the
BEAC’s reform plan would continue as part of the safeguards “rolling measures” approach.
Consistent with this approach, a safeguards staff visit to the BEAC was conducted in April 2014. Staff
concluded that the BEAC has made good progress in implementing recommendations from the 2013
assessment and is advancing its reform plan to strengthen controls. That said, the BEAC continues to
face challenges on institutional autonomy and broader governance reforms remain paramount in the
medium-term. Staff will maintain close engagement with the BEAC to assess sustainability of the
measures already in place, and implementation of the reforms going forward. Developments on
implementation of these measures will allow staff to consider whether sufficient progress has been
made to discontinue the annual monitoring of safeguards rolling measures and thereby revert to the
four-year cycle of assessments for regional central banks.
Exchange Rate Arrangement:
The regional currency is the CFA franc. From 1948 to 1999, it was pegged to the French franc.
Since the euro was introduced in 1999, it has been pegged to the euro at the rate of
CFAF 655.957 per euro.
Gabon (and the other CEMAC members) became Article VIII members on June 26, 1996. Like other
members of CEMAC, Gabon has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Section 2, 3 and 4 of the IMF
Articles of Agreement. Gabon levies a tax on wire transfers, including for the making of payments
and transfers for current international transactions, which gives rise to an exchange restriction
subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a) of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement, The
authorities have exempted certain transactions from the tax; however, the tax continues to apply to
other transfers subject to Fund jurisdiction.

FSAP Participation and ROSCs:
A national module for Gabon of the joint IMF/World Bank Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP) was completed in 2002 and discussed by the Executive Board in March 2002 (IMF Country
Report No. 02/98). The first regional Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) was carried out
January-March 2006, and a regional FSAP Update is currently under preparation. Regional Reports
on Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSCs) were done in the areas of monetary and financial
policy transparency, banking supervision, and anti-money laundering and combating the financing of
terrorism (AML/CFT) in June 2006.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
GABON—STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX

As of November 20, 2014
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General. Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Staff’s analysis
is affected by shortcomings in the accuracy, reliability and adequacy of periodicity and timeliness for
certain data, as well as consistency between datasets. The statistical producing agencies do not have
sufficient access to source data and lack an institutional framework in which to share information and
coordinate compilation efforts. To monitor progress in the implementation of PSGE, household surveys
should be conducted and disseminated regularly.
Gabon participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS), but has not updated the metadata
or plans for improvement since 2002. Except for consumer prices, the authorities do not report any real
sector or government finance statistics (GFS) to STA for publication in International Financial Statistics (IFS)
or for electronic dissemination. Detailed economic and financial statistics, including long historical time
series, are published in the Tendances de l’Économie, issued twice a year by the General Directorate of
Statistics and Economic Studies (DGSEE) of the Ministry of Economy, Trade, Industry, and Tourism. More
recent sectoral developments are described in detail in the Tableau de Bord de l'Économie, issued
quarterly by the Ministry of the Economy.
National Accounts. Central AFRITAC (AFC) is working with authorities to incorporate the System of
National Accounts 1993 methodological recommendations. A new series of national accounts, covering
the period 2001-2009 has been prepared. Compilation of national accounts for 2010-2013 is underway,
and the whole new series should be released soon after the 2010-2013 accounts have been completed.
AFC is also assisting Gabon with the implementation of quarterly national accounts and related indicators.
Employment and unemployment. Data on unemployment and the total labor force are not
systematically available.
Price Statistics. In 2007 the authorities began publishing an improved CPI index, which covers the same
basket of goods and services as the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC)
Harmonized Consumer Price Index (HCPI) and uses a weighting scheme derived from Gabon’s 2005
household expenditure survey. The CPI only covers the capital city of Libreville.
Government Finance Statistics. A major shortcoming is limited institutional coverage, as social security
operations are not included in the Statement of Operations of either the central or the general
government. Audited accounts of oil sector operations are generally available annually and sometimes
quarterly, but with a significant reporting lag. Other needed improvements include the recording of
government-owned capital formation financed by oil companies and the recording of government
arrears. Data provided for surveillance purposes are based on GFSM 1986. Gabon does not provide GFS
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

GABON

data to the IMF for inclusion in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook nor the International Financial
Statistics.
Monetary and Financial Statistics. The Bank of Central African States (BEAC) regularly reports in
electronic form monthly monetary, interest rate, and exchange rate statistics for Gabon and other CEMAC
member countries for publication in the IFS, but delays occur sometimes in the submission of data.
Institutional coverage of the monetary statistics for Gabon is comprehensive, but accuracy is affected by
cross-border movements of currency among CEMAC member countries.
In mid-2007, the BEAC started a project to migrate monetary statistics of CEMAC member countries to the
methodology of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). As part of this project, a regional
workshop was organized by the BEAC in December 2007 to finalize the mapping of source data from
commercial banks to the MFSM concepts and framework. STA participated in this workshop to provide
guidance and advice. The BEAC has recently submitted test monetary data for Gabon using the
standardized report forms for the period January 2000–December 2007.
Financial Sector Surveillance.
Gabon Does not report Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs) to STA.
External Sector Statistics. Balance of payments statistics are compiled by the national directorate of the
BEAC and the estimates are validated by staff from BEAC headquarters. Data are disseminated with
considerable delay and they have not been submitted for publication in the IFS since 2006. Since 1995,
compilation of balance of payments statistics has conformed to the Balance of Payments Manual, 5th
edition. Source data are collected through: (i) surveys of enterprises by the central bank (the main source
of data); (ii) reports from banks and the postal administration on foreign exchange transactions of other
enterprises, retailers, and private individuals; and (iii) BEAC reports on banknote movements between
Gabon and other BEAC countries. External trade data are mostly based on estimates, which are not crosschecked with customs data. Data on other items of the current account are not very reliable or accurate
due to low response rates to enterprise surveys, despite partial correction through adjustments. Foreign
direct investment in the financial account is likely to be underestimated owing to insufficient detail in the
oil sector survey. The magnitude and detailed breakdown of private capital flows, particularly short term,
suffer because data are not comprehensive.
There are comprehensive data on the stock of external public debt and its composition, as well as detailed
projections on debt service due. Data are provided, usually to Fund missions, by the General Directorate
of Public Debt and Accounting (Direction générale de la comptabilité publique) of the Ministry of Budget
and Public Accounts.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Gabon
On February 18, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Gabon.
Gabon’s growth performance has recently been strong, but fiscal pressures have increased
significantly. Real GDP growth has averaged about 6 percent in the last four years on the back of
substantial scaling-up of capital spending as the authorities implement their strategy Plan
Stratégique Gabon Emergent (PSGE) to promote economic diversification and growth
inclusiveness. The external current account has been in surplus, while inflation has remained in
the low single digits. Partly as a result of the scaling up in public investment, the fiscal situation
has come under pressure and arrears have been accumulated, notwithstanding historically high
oil prices until recently.
The medium-term growth outlook has weakened as a result of the sharp decline in oil prices, but
is expected to remain relatively strong. Growth is expected to be driven by a number of projects
underway in agro-industry, mining, and wood processing. The government is aiming to keep
public debt below its target of 35 percent of GDP in the medium run by broadening the non-oil
tax base, controlling growth in current spending, and moderating public investment growth after
significantly cutting it in 2014. To protect infrastructure investment in the face falling oil
revenues spending, the government intends to have recourse to the international capital markets
for financing.
The main downside risks to the economic outlook in the short to medium term is an insufficient
adjustment to fiscal policy, leading to further depletion of fiscal buffers, and weak investment
execution capacity. Both could lead to further depletion of fiscal buffers and insufficient fiscal
space to implement the PSGE and address binding constraints to growth, such as infrastructure
bottlenecks, lack of qualified labor, and a weak business environment. In turn, lower oil prices

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

and failure to implement PSGE could considerably reduce much needed non-oil growth. In the
longer run, there is upside potential to raise growth if the binding constraints are addressed.
Executive Board Assessment2
Directors welcomed the robust economic growth in recent years under favorable economic
conditions, but regretted that growth has not been sufficiently inclusive or broad-based, with
poverty and unemployment rates remaining high. Directors expressed support for the authorities’
diversification strategy, predicated on improvements in infrastructure and human capital
development, and an acceleration in business climate reforms. With the recent major decline in
oil prices, Directors underscored the need for the diversification strategy to be financed
sustainably.
Directors supported the authorities’ efforts to adjust the fiscal stance in 2014, in order to avoid a
rapid escalation of public debt levels and an accumulation of arrears, given weaker oil revenues.
Noting that investment spending was unsustainably high during 2010-13, Directors agreed that
the expenditure cuts in 2014 preserved infrastructure development while promoting fiscal
sustainability. They also welcomed the authorities’ intention to adopt a revised budget for 2015
reflecting recent oil price trends.
Looking ahead, Directors underscored the need for further fiscal adjustment to rebuild policy
buffers while preserving medium-term fiscal sustainability. They noted that this would require
curbing growth in current spending, including the wage bill, and effectively phasing out general
oil subsidies, while safeguarding priority infrastructure and social spending. Directors also
highlighted the need to expand the non-oil tax base, notably by reducing tax exemptions and
improving tax administration. In addition, efforts to improve the management and transparency
of the public finances should be sustained, and the quality of public investment improved. In this
context, Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to increase the transparency of natural
resource revenues and commitment to become compliant with the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative (EITI) during 2015.
Directors called for stepped-up efforts to boost external competitiveness through structural
reforms designed to reduce factor costs. They recommended “horizontal” policies aimed at
improving the business climate—such as addressing infrastructure bottlenecks in energy and
transport; boosting investment in human capital; and strengthening the business regulatory
framework. Noting the potential for regional spillovers, Directors encouraged the authorities to
lead by example and play a constructive role in setting and implementing appropriate common

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

policies within CEMAC (Economic Community of Central African States) to support regional
stability and growth.
Directors supported efforts to improve financial depth and inclusion, including through the
establishment of a credit registry. They called for a strengthening in the supervisory capacity of
the regional banking supervisory authority, COBAC (Commission Bancaire de l’Afrique
Centrale), and for prompt actions to address the weak financial situation of the three distressed
public banks and to enhance the monitoring of the microfinance sector. Directors looked forward
to the completion of the ongoing regional FSAP (Financial Sector Assessment Program)
exercise.
Directors encouraged the authorities to improve data quality and timeliness, with Fund technical
assistance. They also noted that Gabon maintains a tax on wire transfers, which is inconsistent
with its obligations under Article VIII

Statement by Mr. Ngueto Tiraina Yambaye, Executive Director for Gabon
and Mr. Nguema-Affane, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director
February 18, 2015
On behalf of my Gabonese authorities, I would like to express my appreciation to the
Executive Board, Management and staff for their continued advice and technical
assistance to Gabon. My authorities found very useful the Article IV discussions with
staff held in Libreville in November 2014. They appreciate staff recommendations and
inputs in their economic policy agenda.
Over the past two years, my Gabonese authorities have pursued the implementation of
their national development plan, Plan Stratégique Gabon Emergent (PSGE), which was
rolled out in 2010. This plan, which is underpinned by a large public investment program
and a set of institutional and structural reforms, aims at accelerating the structural
transformation of the Gabonese economy in order to diversify sources of growth and
reduce its dependence on oil. My authorities seized the opportunity offered by continued
high level of oil prices in the past few years to accelerate the implementation of the
PSGE, which is boosting economic activity in the country. GDP grew consistently by
more than 5 percent annually since 2010 driven by the large public infrastructure projects
and expansion of the non oil sector. In order to make growth more inclusive, the social
component of the PGSE was strengthened following a study on poverty in Gabon by a
global management consulting firm and a national roundtable on social policy held in
April 2014.
However, in light of the experience gained during the four years of implementation of the
PSGE, my Gabonese authorities decided to slow down its pace in order to align related
expenditures with the absorptive capacity of the country and the level of budgetary
resources, and preserve fiscal sustainability. The 2014 budget was revised accordingly in
July 2014 with notably a halving of the public investment spending. Furthermore, as
international oil prices declined sharply toward end-2014, my authorities withdrew the
initial draft 2015 budget they had already submitted to the Parliament to prepare a new
draft with more conservative revenue assumptions. In January 2015, following a 3-day
governmental retreat to further examine the impact of the oil price shock, several
adjustment policies were adopted to maintain the fiscal sustainability of the PSGE. Many
of the measures taken are consistent with staff recommendations and will be reflected in
the 2015 budget under revision.
Recent economic developments
Real growth slowed down but remained high in 2014 at 5.1 percent, down from 5.6
percent in 2013. The lower growth reflects the cutback in public investment spending
decided in mid-2014. Growth was driven by a good performance in the mining and

2
wood-processing sectors. Due to base effects, inflation rose sharply from 0.5 percent in
2013 to 4.4 percent in 2014. The sustained high level of international commodity prices
translated in large current account surpluses since 2010. As those prices weakened
towards the end of 2014, the current account surplus declined in 2014.
The fiscal position continued to be under pressure due to the high level of expenditures
related to the implementation of the PSGE. Despite curtailing public investment, the
fiscal overall balance in cash basis turned negative in 2014, owing to an acceleration of
arrears payments and VAT reimbursements. Public debt remained low at 27.6 percent of
GDP in 2014, well below the regional convergence criterion of 70 percent and the
Gabonese authorities’ self-imposed debt ceiling of 35 percent. Gabon successfully issued
a US$ 1.5-billion eurobond in December 2013.
The financial soundness indicators show that the banking sector is liquid, profitable and
well-capitalized, with a low level of non-performing loans (NPLs). My authorities have
appointed international experts to undertake an assessment of the three banks
experiencing financial difficulties and define an action plan towards their resolution.
On the structural front, my authorities pursued policies aimed at improving the business
climate. In particular, they streamlined the institutional framework for investment
promotion with the creation of a special agency for that purpose in 2014. In addition,
delays to open a business, process construction permits and get utility connections for
businesses have been considerably reduced. As regard transparency in oil revenue
management, my authorities have adopted an action plan to become EITI-compliant in
2015.
As indicated above, social policy took a center stage in the PSGE following a study on
poverty in Gabon conducted in 2013 showing that poverty remains widespread despite
having one of the largest per capita GDP in Africa and posting a strong growth
performance. Therefore, in order to forcefully address unemployment and poverty, my
authorities launched in 2014 several initiatives that aim, among others, at promoting
income-generating activities, developing human capital and improving the social
conditions of the most vulnerable segments of the population. In particular, an
agricultural program, Programme GRAINE, developed in partnership with a Singaporebased multinational corporation, was launched to promote the development of agriculture
through the provision of a multiform assistance to producers organized in cooperatives.
Through this program, my authorities expect to increase individual empowerment and
tackle rural exodus while improving land use planning and contributing to economic
diversification.
In the same vein, institutions in charge of providing vocational training and promoting
employment are being reformed or created to better respond to labor market needs and

3
increase prospects of professional integration and reintegration. In particular, an Oil and
Gas Institute has been inaugurated in early 2014 and a Mining and Metallurgy school is
expected to open in September 2015. Moreover, the national employment office will
open branches in the main cities, besides the capital city, to better assist jobseekers.
Furthermore, social safety nets are being strengthened through various schemes to
facilitate access to utilities, health services and affordable housing.
Policies for 2015 and beyond
My authorities are determined to maintain economic and social growth over the medium
term while preserving macroeconomic stability and fiscal sustainability. They agree that
the recent oil price shock is complicating the implementation of their development plan
and has adversely affected the country’s medium term economic prospects. Nevertheless
they remain committed to further progress in upgrading infrastructure while enhancing
the quality of investment, developing human capital and accelerating structural reforms in
order to remove bottlenecks to economic diversification and improve the country’s
competitiveness.
As Gabon continues to maintain good sovereign ratings from international rating
agencies despite the adverse international environment, my authorities agree that
preserving these ratings hinges on their ability to pursue prudent policies in order to
maintain fiscal and debt sustainability and improve the attractiveness of the country. This
is all the more important that they plan to tap international markets in 2015 to finance
capital spending over the medium-term. This consideration, together with the objective of
sustained economic and social growth, was prominently reflected in the recent package of
adjustment policies identified during the governmental retreat last month to respond to
the oil price shock.
These policies aim to improve oil revenue management, improve domestic revenue
mobilization, contain current expenditures, and accelerate public financial management
reforms. My authorities have already started to act on these recommendations with the
adoption of many measures including the suppression of petroleum subsidies, the creation
of an oil price stabilization fund, the launching of a civil service reform and the merger of
two large public works agencies with similar missions. Short-term measures to improve
non oil revenue performance and reduce nonessential expenditures have also been
adopted. All these measures will be reflected in the 2015 budget currently being
finalized.
The budget for 2015 is being revised with very conservative oil price and exchange rate
assumptions. The budget envisages a significant reduction of current expenditures while
preserving social and investment spending. Despite the fiscal adjustment measures taken
and contemplated, a financing gap is expected to emerge, which my authorities envisage

4
to fill through rescheduling domestic debt and issuing a eurobond. Until the finalization
of the budget, only 15 percent of the initial draft budget for 2015 will be executed. My
authorities are committed to remain current in VAT reimbursements and pursue the
payments of external arrears.
My authorities will accelerate fiscal-related reforms, with the assistance of international
organizations. Public financial management and tax administration will be strengthened
in line with the recommendations in the PEFA report and Fund TA reports. In addition,
the civil service reform underway aims, among others, at improving the management of
civil service administration and reviewing the compensation system with a view to
containing the wage bill.
On tax policy, my authorities continue to believe that tax on non-bank wire transfers does
not affect cash transfers and is consistent with proposals in the international arena to tax
capital flows. Furthermore, the removal of this tax remains a politically sensitive issue as
the proceeds of this tax go to the health insurance fund. Likewise, they do not intend to
make changes to the incentives for businesses operating in the special economic zones
(SEZs) as these incentives are critical to the successful development of the zones.
However, they plan to follow through on the governmental retreat’s recommendation to
eliminate existing tax exemptions with no legal basis, in order to improve domestic
revenue mobilization.
As regards the development of the financial sector, my authorities will continue reforms
to increase financial access and depth in the economy. In particular, the credit registry
being set up is expected to lower barriers to finance. They will continue to monitor
closely the development of microfinance to preserve the soundness of this growing
segment of the financial sector.
My authorities agree with the staff’s assessment of risks to Gabon’s growth outlook and
the expected impact on the economy if they materialize. They believe that the actions
already taken go in the right direction towards reducing downside risks identified by
staff. They remain committed to implement their adjustment policies and stand ready to
take additional adjustment measures if necessary.
Conclusion
My Gabonese authorities have continued to implement their ambitious development plan
in 2013 and 2014 and have strengthened its social component to ensure a more inclusive
growth. They have adjusted its pace of implementation to make it consistent with the
country’s absorptive capacity and level of resources. More recently, my authorities took
additional adjustment measures to cope with the oil price shock. In particular, they
decided to set up an oil revenue stabilization fund in order to shield the budget from the

5
oil price swings in the future and hence preserve the fiscal sustainability of the PSGE.
Looking forward, my authorities agree that maintaining growth momentum in 2015
represents a significant challenge given the current adverse external conditions. They are
committed to pursuing prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms in order to
improve the competitiveness of the economy and rebuild buffers. They will continue to
monitor economic developments and take additional actions to meet their policy
objectives as needed.
