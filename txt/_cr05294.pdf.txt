EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report is for the first Article IV Consultation with Iraq in 25 years. The last
Article IV Consultation was in 1979. The last time the Board met to discuss Iraq was on
September 29, 2004 for the approval of Emergency Post Conflict Assistance (EPCA) in
support of Iraq’s economic program for 2004 and 2005. The authorities hope to enter into a
stand-by arrangement later in 2005.
The statistical information that the Iraqis have been able to provide is just adequate for
surveillance. There is sufficient data on the oil sector (which comprises three quarters of
GDP) but very little on non-oil economic activity. Inflation data is timely, but incomplete in
geographical coverage. Monetary data is currently available only for the Central Bank of Iraq
(CBI) balance sheet. Fiscal data availability is subject to significant lags.
Because of the ongoing insurgency and the slow pace of reconstruction, implementation
of the EPCA program has been slow. Nevertheless, the authorities have achieved a degree
of macroeconomic stability and have initiated some reforms. The exchange rate has been de
facto pegged to the US dollar since May 2004, reserves ended the year well above the floor
specified in the EPCA program, and the fiscal deficit for 2004 was only slightly higher than
projected in the EPCA program.
The exchange rate has come under some pressure in recent months. The authorities have
responded to this by rationing the supply of dollars on a few occasions. The staff have urged
them to satisfy the demand for dollars in full, in view of the comfortable level of reserves,
and to raise interest rates as needed. The authorities have been advised to avoid the use of
restrictions.
A large ex ante fiscal financing gap is emerging for 2005 and 2006, reflecting additional
spending pressures and the delay in implementing the reduction on domestic oil product
price subsidies. The staff have urged the authorities to take action to significantly reduce
domestic petroleum subsidies to raise revenue, and to ensure that spending is kept under
control so as to avoid the accumulation of payments arrears.
The authorities understand the need to ensure that all of Iraq’s external debt should be
resolved in a manner comparable and consistent with the Paris Club agreement of
November 2004. The authorities have made progress in reconciling external claims with
Paris Club creditors, though progress with non-Paris Club creditors has been relatively slow.
They understand the need to engage private creditors in good faith should Iraq enter into a
stand-by arrangement in line with the Fund’s lending into arrears policy.
Iraq is encouraged to build on its track record of policy implementation by continuing
to follow the EPCA program. Iraq needs to move forward, in improving the flow of timely
and reliable data, auditing of the central bank according to International Standards of
Auditing, and implementing a plan to significantly reduce the very substantial domestic
petroleum product subsidy.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The last (1979) Article IV Consultation with Iraq was concluded on
February 29, 1980. A staff report for the 1983 Article IV consultation was issued to the
Executive Board on August 5, 1983, but there was no Board meeting.1
2.
On September 29, 2004, the Executive Board approved a request by the
Government of Iraq for a purchase in an amount equivalent to SDR 297.1 million
(25 percent of quota) under the Fund’s policy on Emergency Post Conflict Assistance
(EPCA).2 In addition to facilitating negotiations with the Paris Club on debt relief, the
approval of EPCA was intended to help Iraq meet some of its urgent balance of payments
needs. In their request for EPCA, the authorities indicated that they planned to seek further
financial support from the Fund in the form of an upper credit tranche stand-by arrangement
in 2005, on the assumption that sufficient progress had been made in strengthening
administrative and institutional capacity under the program.
3.
Upon the approval of EPCA, Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment
to a comprehensive economic and financial program. Directors commended the
authorities’ strategy of caution in projecting oil revenues in 2005, but stressed that it was
important for the authorities to adhere to their commitment to prioritize any windfall oil
revenues in favor of additional reconstruction investment, and/or help meet budgetary needs
in 2006 and beyond. Directors also welcomed the commitment of the authorities to begin to
increase the domestic price of petroleum products. Directors urged the authorities to make
monetary policy more adaptable by widening the menu of instruments for managing liquidity
conditions. Directors further emphasized the need for the authorities to focus their structural
reform efforts in areas including tax administration, payments and settlements systems, stateowned enterprise restructuring, and governance and transparency of the oil sector.
II. BACKGROUND
A. Social and Human Development Indicators
4.
There has been a marked deterioration in Iraq’s human development indicators
over the last twenty years. In 1990, Iraq was ranked 50th on the United Nations
Development Program’s (UNDP) Human Development Index; just over a decade later it was
ranked 126th. Moreover, compared to other countries in the Middle East, Iraq now scores low
relative to the UN Millennium Development Goals (Box 1).

1

Iraq continues to avail itself of the transitional arrangements under Article XIV. Additional information on
Iraq’s foreign exchange laws, regulations, and practices is being sought to determine whether Iraq maintains any
exchange restrictions subject to Fund jurisdiction.

Box 1. Iraq and the Millennium Development Goals
A survey of living conditions was conducted in the second half of 2004 by the UNDP, in collaboration
with the Iraqi Ministry of Planning and Development. This survey found that the policies of the former
regime, the three military conflicts since 1980, and the long period of sanctions, have taken a significant
toll on the welfare of Iraq’s people, on the provision of basic services, and on infrastructure.
Goal 1. Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger. Reliable data on household income is limited.
However, the UNDP survey reports that, using subjective measures of poverty, about 7 percent of
households are considered poor. Moreover, about 96 percent of households receive monthly food rations.
Malnutrition is widespread: 23 percent of children aged between six months and five years suffer from
chronic malnutrition, 12 percent suffer from general malnutrition, and 8 percent suffer from acute
malnutrition.
Goal 2. Universal primary education. Net primary school enrollment in Iraq is 79 percent, compared to
93 percent in Jordan and 96 percent in Syria. Overall, 22 percent of the adult population in Iraq have
never attended school and 15 percent have not completed primary school. The youth (15–24 years)
literacy rate is 74 percent, and the adult literacy rate is 65 percent.
Goal 3. Gender equality. Presently, girls have a significantly lower enrollment rate in primary schools
than boys: 40 percent of girls in rural areas are not enrolled in primary education, compared to 20 percent
in urban areas. The number of women aged 25–34 years who have not completed elementary school is
now 36 percent. The ratio of literate females to males is 50 percent, compared to 60 percent in Yemen
and 100 percent in Jordan.
Goal 4. Reduce child mortality. Under five years mortality is estimated at 115 (compared to 33 in
Jordan and 107 in Yemen). Infant mortality is currently estimated at 102 per 1,000 live births, compared
105 in sub–Saharan Africa.
Goal 5. Improve maternal health. Maternal mortality is relatively high at 193 per 100,000 births
(compared to 41 in Jordan but below 350 in Yemen). The level of postnatal care is low, with 58 percent
of women not receiving any health checks in the 40 days following delivery.
Goal 6. Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases. Typhoid, cholera, and malaria are endemic.
The reported incidence of tuberculosis (at 132 per 100,000 people) is very high relative to neighboring
countries. Iraq is categorized as highly vulnerable to HIV/AIDS, but the number of cases remains low.
Goal 7. Environmental sustainability. Major risks include the lack of appropriate sanitary landfills;
open burning of solid waste, lack of working sewage infrastructure, oil fires, and excessive car
emissions.

5.
Unemployment remains very high in Iraq. There are a number of different
estimates of unemployment in Iraq. The UNDP survey of living conditions in Iraq in 2004
estimates unemployment—calculated on the basis of the International Labor Organization
(ILO) methodology—at about 10.5 percent.3,4 Of particular concern is the UNDP report’s
3

Iraq Living Conditions Survey 2004, UNDP and ministry of planning and development cooperation.

4

The ILO definition refers to the complete absence of work; this figure also excludes discouraged workers.

-7-

estimate of 37 percent unemployment among the educated young (including discouraged
workers). A much higher unemployment rate is suggested by estimates produced by the
ministry of planning (28 percent); the Coalition Provisional Authority (30 percent); the
Brookings Institution (30–45 percent); and Baghdad University (70 percent).
6.
The coverage of public services has improved, but reliability remains a serious
problem. According to the UNDP survey, 98 percent of households are connected to the
electricity grid, although three-quarters of households report their electricity supply to be
extremely unreliable; 78 percent of homes have access to piped water, and 37 percent of all
homes are connected to the sewage system, but two-thirds of households report poor
reliability in the provision of safe water and sewage services.
B. Political and Security Environment
7.
The political process has proceeded more gradually than originally envisaged.
Parliamentary elections for the new Transitional National Assembly (TNA) were held on
January 30, 2005, but negotiations toward forming a government were protracted.
Eventually, on April 4, the TNA elected its leadership, including Jalal Talabani as Iraq’s
President. On April 7, the Presidential Council nominated Ibrahim al–Jaafari as Prime
Minister, who was subsequently ratified by the TNA. On April 28, the TNA approved the
cabinet submitted by the prime minister. The new government was sworn in on May 3, 2005.
8.
A TNA committee (comprising 55 members) is assigned to work on drafting a
permanent constitution for Iraq (as envisaged under the Transitional Administrative Law
(TAL)). The draft constitution, which is expected to be finalized and approved by
August 15, 2005, would be submitted to public referendum by October 15, 2005. If
approved, elections for a new government under the constitution should be held by
December 31, 2005.5
9.
Persistent violence continues to hamper economic and social recovery. Although
attacks on coalition forces have diminished to some extent, attacks on Iraqi civilians and
security and police forces have escalated. The violence has deterred trade and investment
flows.6 The lack of a secure environment has also impeded the effectiveness of
reconstruction spending, with contractors and donors reporting security and insurance
outlays in the range of 30–50 percent of total costs.

5

The general referendum will be successful and the draft constitution ratified if a majority of the voters in Iraq
approve and if two-thirds of the voters in at least three governorates do not reject it. The TAL allows for a onetime six–month extension of the August 15 deadline for submission of the draft constitution for approval by the
TNA, if requested by the constitutional committee.

6

For example, to date, none of the foreign banks granted licenses in 2003 have started operations in Iraq.

-8-

C. Institutional and Administrative Capacity
10.
Iraq lacks a fully functional statistical framework. The statistical information that
the Iraqi authorities are able to provide to the Fund is only just adequate for surveillance
purposes. While data on the oil sector, which comprises three-quarters of Iraqi GDP, is
generally good and timely, there is very little information on non-oil economic activity or on
the balance of payments. Consumer price data are available with relatively short lags, but the
data do not cover the Kurdish region.
11.
Timely and accurate assessments of the fiscal and monetary stance in 2004 and
early 2005 has been problematic. This reflects a lack of progress in establishing proper
financial management mechanisms and in developing adequate data reporting frameworks.
Fiscal monitoring has suffered from long reporting lags and coverage gaps in data concerning
transactions and balances of the Development Fund for Iraq (DFI), expenditure financed by
letters of credit issued under the UN oil-for-food program (OFFP), current and capital
spending financed by donors, and government balances in the banking system. In the
monetary area, a full-fledged monetary survey (including deposit corporations) has yet to be
completed. In the meantime, the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) has had to assess monetary
developments chiefly on the basis of its own balance sheet, which has not yet been prepared
in line with internationally accepted accounting standards or audited in line with
International Standards on Auditing (ISA).
12.
The International Advisory and Monitoring Board (IAMB) was established on
October 21, 2003, pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1483, for the
purposes of overseeing audits of the operations of the DFI and oil export sales.
Membership of the IAMB was expanded in June 2004 to include a member designated by the
Government of Iraq. In its most recent review (May 2005), the IAMB has noted the audit
report findings of evidence of major weaknesses in the administration of DFI resources and
oil operations.7
13.
The Fund continues to implement its off-site technical assistance work program
for Iraq toward improving Iraq’s administrative capacity. Over the past year, and in
coordination with the World Bank and bilateral donors, Fund staff has provided advice on
fiscal federalism issues, tax regimes for the oil sector, budget classification, public
expenditure management, banking supervision, payment systems, macroeconomic statistics,
and macroeconomic policy training (see Appendix I).
7

These weaknesses include: (i) incomplete DFI accounting records; (ii) untimely recording, reporting,
reconciliation and follow-up of spending by Iraqi ministries; (iii) incomplete records maintained by U.S.
agencies, including disbursements that were not recorded in the Iraqi budget; (iv) lack of documented
justification for limited competition for contracts at the Iraqi ministries; (v) unreconciled quantities of oil and oil
products exported indicating a lack of control and possible misappropriation of oil revenues; (vi) non-deposit of
proceeds of export sales of petroleum products into the appropriate accounts, and (vii) significant difficulties in
ensuring completeness and accuracy of Iraqi budgets and controls over expenditures.

-9-

D. Recent Economic Developments
14.
Gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have rebounded by nearly
50 percent in 2004, driven mainly by the recovery of the oil sector (Table 2).8 Oil
production expanded by 74 percent from 1.2 million barrels per day (mbpd) on average in
2003 to 2.0 mbpd in 2004 (although this is still below the pre-war production level of
2.5 mbpd and slightly below EPCA program projections). Non-oil GDP is estimated to have
expanded more moderately in 2004, as lack of security, electricity shortages, and poor
communications hampered the recovery in private sector activity. Some state-owned
enterprises (mainly in construction and petro-chemicals) have reactivated production.
15.
Consumer price inflation in the year to December 2004 reached 31.7 percent,
compared with a projected 7 percent under the EPCA program.9 During the first half of
2004 prices were broadly stable, but inflation picked up sharply in August and remained high
for the remainder of the year. This surge in prices appears to have been related primarily to
supply shortages of key goods (gasoline and food) consequent upon the intensification of
violence in the run up to the elections in January, 2005. After another large jump in January,
prices fell from February through May as the supply of goods improved, and the cumulative
increase for the first five months of 2005 was reduced to 4.7 percent. Year-on-year inflation
in May 2005 was nonetheless still quite high at 33.9 percent, and well above the EPCA
program objective of 15 percent for end 2005.
16.
The fiscal deficit for 2004 was slightly larger than envisaged under the EPCA
program (Tables 3 and 4). Oil export prices averaged $31.6 per barrel in 2004, compared to
$30.5 per barrel assumed under the EPCA program, while oil export volumes were close to
target, resulting in an additional ID1 trillion in oil export revenues in 2004 relative to the
amount of ID25.3 trillion assumed in the program. While wage and pension outlays were
slightly lower than budgeted for 2004, spending on goods and services was higher than under
the budget (reflecting in part contractual commitments made by the Coalition Provisional
Authority (CPA) prior to its dissolution and not included in the budget).
17.
Investment overall was in line with the budget, but grant-financed (non-oil)
reconstruction expenditure in 2004 fell short. Donors to the International Reconstruction
Fund Facility for Iraq (IRFFI)—a two–window trust fund facility administered by the World
Bank and the UN—deposited about US$1 billion into this facility. Most of these funds have
already been committed to reconstruction projects. Disbursements under these large projects
will take place over a number of years, but in 2004 (the launch year) only about $103 million
was actually disbursed to finance projects. Moreover, the largest direct bilateral donor (the
United States) reportedly spent about $2.2 billion in 2004, but only two-thirds of these funds
are estimated to have been spent in the domestic economy (and up to one-half of this was on

security). By contrast, investment in the oil industry (mainly financed out of the Iraq’s own
resources) was slightly higher than programmed.
18.
The 2005 budget was based on a cautious oil revenue projection. Oil prices in
2005 were assumed to be only $26 per barrel, significantly below what might have been
expected based on the prevailing WEO projection when the program was designed
(September 2004). Oil exports were projected to increase from 1.4 mbpd in 2004 to
1.8 mbpd. The budget also assumed that a start would have been made in reducing the
domestic petroleum subsidy by the beginning of the year. Spending plans were constrained
so as to ensure that the budget would be fully financed from revenues and available balances
abroad (in the DFI and from the winding up of the OFFP).
19.
Oil export revenues in the first five months of 2005 were broadly in line with the
program, but only because lower oil export volumes were offset by higher oil prices. Oil
export volumes in the first five months of 2005 remained at an average of 1.4 mbpd (the
same as the average outturn in 2004 and well below the program target), while average oil
export prices rose to $36.4 per barrel. The increase in Iraqi oil prices during this period was
significantly less than the increase in oil prices generally, reflecting a substantial widening of
the price differential on Iraqi oil relative to world market prices. The differential relative to
the WEO benchmark oil price (an average of Brent, West Texas, and Dubai) increased from
$6.4 per barrel on average in 2004, to $13.4 per barrel in the first quarter of 2005, before
narrowing to $8.6 per barrel in April–May 2005. The reasons for these movements in the
differential are not well understood. The authorities were able to provide an explanation for
part of the change in the differential, but not for all of it.10
20.
Implementation of the EPCA commitment to increase domestic prices of refined
oil products has yet to occur. Under the EPCA timeline, the authorities were supposed to
have begun the adjustment of domestic prices by the end of 2004 (see Box 2). Gasoline
prices in the black market have risen to very high levels recently, but the authorities continue
to supply gasoline locally at heavily subsidized prices (about 1.3 US cents per liter of regular
gasoline), including by importing these products at international prices (private imports of
petroleum products are not permitted).

10

Movements in the differential can be partly (but not wholly) explained by oil “spiking” which lowers quality,
escalating freight cost clauses, increased perceived delivery risk, and temporary competition for sweeter crudes
from U.S. refineries in early 2005 which depressed prices for more sour crudes from Iraq and Saudi Arabia.

- 11 -

Box 2. Iraq: Subsidies on Petroleum Products
Official prices for refined petroleum products sold in Iraq are set well below international prices. In addition to
subsidizing sales from domestic production, the government imports petroleum products ($3.2 billion in 2004)
for sale domestically at subsidized prices. This results in a substantial loss of revenues for the budget,
equivalent to nearly $8 billion (or some 30 percent of 2004 GDP).

21.
The growth in reserve money supply in 2004 was rapid, but largely mirrored by
the expansion in the CBI’s external reserves. Reserve money in 2004 grew by 117 percent,
exactly in line with the EPCA projection (Table 5). With the CBI prohibited from lending to
the government, almost all the increase in reserve money derived from higher external
reserves, reflecting dollar purchases from the government net of auction sales of dollars to
the market. Currency in circulation increased at a slower rate (at 75 percent for the year,
compared with the EPCA projection of 118 percent). The difference in the growth of the two
measures of money was reflected in a large build up in banks’ free reserves with the CBI.

- 12 -

22.
The CBI has recently broadened its range of monetary policy instruments and
tightened liquidity conditions. On March 14, 2005, the CBI activated separate dinar and
dollar overnight deposit facilities paying interest at 4 percent and 2 percent per annum,
respectively.11 This initiative was influenced, in part, by a desire to mop up some of the
banks’ excess liquidity and thereby preempt pressures on prices and/or the exchange market.
As of end-May, banks had deposited ID1.7 trillion in the dinar facility and $540 million in
the dollar facility. By end-March, reserve money growth had slowed appreciably to only 6
percent in the first quarter of 2005. On April 1, 2005, the CBI also reintroduced coverage of
required reserves to include government deposits (which had been lifted in the context of the
unification of reserve requirements that went into effect in November 2004).12
23.
Interest rates at the CBI’s bi-weekly treasury bill auction averaged 4 percent in
2004, but rates began to rise in May 2005, reaching 7 percent by mid-June. The low rate
of interest emerging from these auctions in 2004 was believed to relate to either (i) the high
level of bank liquidity, or (ii) collusion between public sector banks so as to lower the
government’s funding costs. The increase in the interest rate in May/June could reflect the
tightening of monetary conditions described above.
24.
After appreciating in early 2004 following the new currency’s introduction, the
exchange rate of the dinar has been de facto pegged to the U.S. dollar since May 2004.
The exchange rate has lately come under some pressure: while the volume of dollar sales at
the daily CBI foreign exchange auctions was relatively stable during 2004 and early 2005 at
about $25 million per day, dollar sales increased sharply to about $50 million a day from
mid-April. The CBI responded to this sharp increase in sales by, on a few occasions,
rationing the supply of dollars at auction.
25.
External reserves held by the CBI grew strongly during 2004, ending the year at
$7.4 billion (net), well above the EPCA target of $4 billion. Reserves increased further in
January and February 2005, but fell back in March to $7.7 billion. Reserves are estimated to
have stayed around this level through end-May. The rise in dollar sales, and the relative
stability of the CBI’s reserves suggests that the growth in money demand is slowing—
perhaps indicating a slowing rate of growth in the economy by comparison to 2004.

11

The rate of interest on the dollar facility was increased to 2.5 percent on June 1, 2005. The rate of interest on
the dinar overnight facility was raised to 5 percent on July 3, 2005, and new 14 day and 30 day deposit facilities
were also introduced at this time, with interest rates of 6 and 7 percent respectively.

12

A planned restructuring of CBI claims on the government, which might have subsequently led to the creation
of additional (marketable) monetary policy instruments, has been shelved pending a review of the proposal by
the new minister of finance in light of a forthcoming audit of the CBI balance sheet.

- 13 -

26.
The balance of payments is dominated by oil exports. There is relatively little firm
data on the balance of payments other than on oil exports, government imports of goods and
services, and external reserves. There were large current account deficits in 2004 and 2005,
reflecting high levels of imports related to reconstruction and recovery. These current
account deficits were financed chiefly from assets held abroad, including in the DFI. An
estimated balance of payments is shown in Table 6.
E. External Debt Management
27.
On November 21, 2004, the Paris Club agreed to debt reduction terms for Iraq,
equivalent to 80 percent in net present value terms (NPV), in three stages. The first stage
comprised a 30 percent debt reduction and interest deferral on the outstanding balance and
went into effect upon signing the agreement. The second stage will comprise a further
30 percent debt reduction and will go into effect upon approval of an upper credit tranche
arrangement (expected by end-2005). The final stage will comprise an additional 20 percent
debt reduction, and will follow completion of the IMF’s Executive Board’s final review of
three years of one (or more) upper credit tranche arrangement(s).
28.
With the first stage of debt reduction, Iraq’s debt is still estimated to be some
$78 billion (reduced from $114 billion pre-Paris Club), or the equivalent of three times
GDP. Appendix IV shows that Iraq’s debt will remain unsustainable in the absence of the
additional stages of debt reduction envisaged under the Paris Club agreement.
29.
The Iraqi Government has (with their legal and financial advisors) begun to
engage with official creditors in line with the Paris Club agreement. The vast majority of
Paris Club claims has now been reconciled. By contrast, the proportion of non-Paris Club
official debt reconciled so far is still small. Negotiations with Gulf country creditors are
being handled separately from other non-Paris Club official creditors. Discussions are also
ongoing toward securing bilateral agreements, and all creditors will be expected to agree
terms either equivalent to (or more favorable than) those defined under the Paris Club agreed
minutes.13
30.
The Iraqi authorities met with private creditors in Dubai on May 4, 2005. The
authorities made clear their intention to apply Paris Club comparability in settling claims and
adhere to the principle of equal treatment for all creditors. An official website has been
created inviting private creditors to submit their claims. So far a total of about $10 billion of
claims have been submitted for consideration. The majority of private creditor claims (in
value as well as quantity) relate to supplier credits. Some of the banks (which represent a
much smaller group) have convened a “London Club Coordinating Group” to represent their
interests, and have pressed Iraq to recognize this group as a separate entity.
13

The only bilateral agreement signed so far is with the United States (in November 2004), which granted Iraq
100 percent debt cancellation. A further five Paris Club members are very close to signing agreements. There is
also agreement in principle with four of the 48 non-Paris Club creditors, and notable progress with another nine.

- 14 -

F. Trade and Exchange Rate Regime
31.
Iraq maintains an open trade and investment regime (Box 3). Iraq applies a
5 percent custom duty (“reconstruction levy”) on imports, but there are many exemptions.
According to the 2003 law on foreign direct investment, all sectors are open for foreign
investment, except direct and indirect ownership of natural resources involving primary
extraction and initial processing. Iraq otherwise permits 100 percent foreign ownership and
provides equal treatment for domestic and foreign investors. Iraq’s exports to the United
States receive preferential treatment under the Generalized System of Preference (GSP). Iraq
applied for WTO membership in 2004.
Box 3. Iraq: Trade and Investment Policies
Since April 2004, Iraq has applied a 5 percent custom duty (“reconstruction levy”) on all imported
goods except some commodities including food, medicine, clothing, and goods delivered as humanitarian
assistance. Imports by coalition forces, nonprofit organizations, foreign governments, and foreign companies
undertaking reconstruction projects in Iraq are also exempt.
In September 2004, Iraq submitted a formal request for WTO accession to the Director General of the
WTO. In December 2004, the General Council of the WTO established a working party to examine the
membership applications of Iraq. However, the working party has not yet met and Iraq has not yet submitted a
Memorandum on the Foreign Trade Regime.
Regarding inward investment, Iraq permits 100 percent foreign ownership and applies equal treatment
for foreign and domestic investors. Foreign investment may be made in any part of Iraq, and foreign
investors may open trade representation offices and branches in Iraq. All economic sectors in Iraq are also
open for foreign investment, except direct and indirect ownership of natural resources involving primary
extraction and initial processing. Foreign investors involved in the retail sector are required to deposit
US$100,000 in a non-interest-bearing account at an Iraqi bank for the duration of the retail activity. Foreign
investors may hold long-term and renewable leases of real property, but not ownership.

32.
Iraq maintains a broadly liberal exchange regime in practice, though (as noted
above) it is unclear whether there remain any exchange restrictions in the regulations subject
to Fund jurisdiction. The authorities confirmed that a number of exchange regulations (dating
from the previous regime) that might constitute restrictions are no longer enforced, although
these regulations have not been formally revoked. Box 4 summarizes the staff’s findings on
the current practice in foreign exchange arrangements.
G. Structural Reform
33.
Implementation of structural benchmarks specified in the EPCA program has
been delayed relative to schedule (Table 8). Reforms related to the development of a
functioning payments system, the full implementation of a financial management information
system (FMIS), and the establishment of an automated payroll system, are likely to take

- 15 -

considerably longer than originally expected. This is due to the continuing lack of security,
communications problems, and the need to tailor the required systems to the circumstances
of Iraq. Nevertheless, progress has been made with Fund staff assistance in developing a
monetary survey, drafting a new payments system legislation, and improving the banking
regulatory framework.
Box 4. Iraq: Foreign Exchange Arrangements 1/
Exchange arrangements: the currency of Iraq is the Iraqi dinar, with an exchange rate determined in the
foreign exchange market; auctions are held daily, and eligible bidders may buy and sell foreign exchange at
freely determined rates; all final transactions are allocated at a single settlement price.
Payments and receipts: settlement can be made in any convertible currency; there is no control on the use
either dinar or foreign currency for transactions in Iraq; there are no bilateral and regional payment
arrangements; payments to and receipts from Israel are prohibited.
Controls on trade in banknotes: Iraqi citizens may take out of the country up to 100,000 dinars in dinar
banknotes and up to $10,000 in foreign currency notes; foreigners may take out foreign currency up to the
amount they declare when they enter Iraq; both Iraqis and foreigners may bring in foreign currency banknotes
(except Israeli currency) in unlimited amounts, provided that they declare it; amounts not intended to be taken
out of the country are exempt from declaration.
Resident and nonresident accounts: residents and non-residents are allowed to open foreign currency accounts
at commercial banks and use balances in these accounts without restriction; non-residents are allowed to open
domestic currency accounts.
Payments for current and capital transactions: there is no restriction on payments as long as underlying
transactions are supported by valid documentation.
1/ Information on practice collected during policy discussions with the authorities. Some regulations and laws
may exist which, although not enforced, comprise restrictions.

34.
Budgetary management remained weak in 2004, although some improvements
have been made in 2005. In 2004, the ministry of finance began to receive reports on budget
outturns from line ministries and treasury branches in governorates, although the reporting
lag is still more than three months. The continuing problems in large part reflect the
fragmentation of fiscal operations (Box 5). Fiscal monitoring and execution in 2004 suffered
from the multiplicity of DFI subaccounts, limited reporting by donors on their spending, and
budget reallocations toward security spending made outside the budgetary process in the last
quarter of 2004.14 From 2005 onwards the authorities are committed to approve additional
spending only in the context of a supplementary budget.15

14

A modern financial management law was adopted in 2004, but implementing regulations still need to be
introduced.
15

Some limited allowances for hazard duty were approved outside of the budget in early 2005.

- 16 -

Box 5. Iraq: The Fragmentation of Iraq’s Fiscal Accounts
Iraq fiscal operations comprise the following:
The government’s official budget: this covers recurrent and capital spending in Iraq’s 18 governorates, though
the Northern governorates allocate their spending autonomously and send only limited reports on their budget
outturns to the central government. The budget is financed by tax and non tax revenues and by Iraqi assets held
in the Development Fund for Iraq (DFI), an account managed by the Central Bank of Iraq at the New York
Federal Reserve on behalf of the Iraqi Ministry of Finance. The DFI receives Iraqi assets frozen abroad during
the period of sanctions, outstanding balances from the oil-for-food program, and 95 percent of Iraq’s oil export
sales (the other 5 percent are used for the payment of war reparations to Kuwait).
Spending made by the United States Government out of the DFI: in the second half of 2004 and 2005 the
U.S. continued to be responsible for (mostly capital) spending financed from two DFI subaccounts, the “vested”
account to which Iraqi assets previously frozen in the U.S. had been transferred in late 2003, and the
“transaction” account created on June 28, 2004, (pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1546)
to finance contractual commitments made by the CPA, and replenished by funds transferred from the main DFI
account. The U.S. is also in charge of spending financed by cash assets “seized” from the Saddam Hussein
regime in April 2003.
Letters of credit (LCs) issued under the oil-for-food program managed by the UN: these LCs are fully
financed by proceeds of past oil exports sequestered in a bank account at the Banque National de Paris. If LCs
expire before they are executed, the funds are to be transferred to the UN treasury account in New York, and
from that account to the DFI.
Expenditures financed by donors: these include bilateral and multilateral grants to Iraq, in particular: (a) U.S.
assistance to Iraq which is either disbursed abroad in U.S. dollars or paid directly in U.S. dollar bank notes in
the country to finance investment projects as well as wages, goods, and services; and (b) other donor assistance
which is paid directly to suppliers abroad, or to correspondent banks of Iraqi banks. The sums are then
transferred directly to the individual ministries’ accounts. The Iraqi Strategic Review Board, which is chaired by
the ministry of planning, has been assigned the responsibility of coordinating these programs with the Iraqi
budget, but has received limited reports from donors, who have often dealt directly with individual ministries.
The Transitional Government is reassessing its donor coordination strategy.
Operations of oil-related state-owned enterprises not included in the budget: these cover mainly domestic
oil sales which finance oil-sector operating expenditures.

H. Banking Sector Issues
35.
Iraq’s banking system is barely functional, with weak institutions and little
financial intermediation. Iraq’s banking system comprises the CBI and 26 chartered
banking institutions:
•

Two state-owned commercial banks (Rafidain and Rasheed) account for over
90 percent of commercial banking assets and 75 percent of the branch bank network.
These banks are heavily overstaffed, and staff skills are weak;

- 17 -

•

Four specialized, state-owned banks serving the agriculture, industry, real estate, and
social sectors, respectively;

•

19 private commercial banks; and

•

A trade bank established in the aftermath of the war to provide U.S. dollar letters of
credit for imports.

36.
The banking system in Iraq reportedly has the equivalent of only around
$2 billion in aggregate assets (about 7 percent of GDP), and is undercapitalized. Most of
the banks’ assets are in the form of treasury bills. These features underscore the marginal role
played by this sector in the past either as a financial intermediary for the private sector or as
a store for financial savings. The banks’ loan portfolio is very small and bank staff do not
have the expertise needed to offer appropriate credit facilities or assess the risks involved.
37.
The payment system in Iraq is outdated and lacks an appropriate technical
infrastructure. The banking sector is unable to process payments electronically and has a
rudimentary check clearing system.16 Businesses tend to settle large payments in cash, while
households have no incentive to use the banking system other than to hold savings. The CBI
is in the process of trying to modernize the payment infrastructure.
38.
Banks are subject to both on-site (security permitting) and off-site supervision.
The CBI has been receiving technical assistance from the IMF and the World Bank as well as
other governments, mainly focusing on introducing best supervisory practices and for
moving from a rule-based to a prudential-based system. Prudential regulations are in the
process of being revised.
39.
Iraq adopted modern central bank, commercial bank, and anti-money
laundering (AML) laws in 2004. Related implementing regulations are in the process of
being finalized.
III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
40.
The discussions with the authorities were productive, and there was a
considerable convergence of views on many issues. The discussions were conducted in the
special circumstances defined by the transitional nature of the present government, by the
evolving political situation and ongoing preparation of the constitution, and by the
continuing insurgency. Despite some continuing problems with data provision (due to long
lags in their production), the mission received just sufficient data to allow staff to prepare an
adequate assessment of the economic situation and the current economic policy stance.
16

Anecdotal evidence suggest that while checks in Baghdad could take up to 10 days to be cleared, those
outside Baghdad could take as much as a month.

- 18 -

41.
The two issues that currently confront the authorities and which dominated the
discussions concerned (i) the possibility of (unfunded) spending increases in the 2005
budget and (ii) recent pressure on the exchange rate. Because of (inter alia) delays in
raising domestic petroleum prices (originally slated for end-2004 in the EPCA program), an
incipient financing gap is emerging for the 2005 budget. In addition, pressures are mounting
for additional fiscal spending (to be included in a supplementary budget) without sufficient
identified funding. Perhaps reflecting political uncertainty and increasing security concerns,
the exchange rate has been under pressure since late April. CBI sales of dollars at the daily
auction have increased, but the CBI has also intensified the screening of bids prior to auction
and occasionally rationing the supply of dollars offered at the auction cut-off price.
A. Macroeconomic Framework for 2005
42.
The authorities and staff agreed on an updated short-term outlook, with real
GDP growth in 2005 revised down to 4 percent (from 17 percent in the program). This
reflects downward revisions to oil production, now expected to reach only 2.0 mbpd in 2005
(compared with an original program goal of 2.4 mbpd) because of the continuing sabotage of
installations and the resulting halting of oil exports from the north (amounting to 0.3 mbpd).
43.
The inflation projection for end-2005 has been revised up to 20 percent
(compared with a goal of 15 percent under the EPCA program). Although there has been
some easing in inflationary pressures in the first half of 2005, supply shortages could resume
in the second half. The reconstruction program may also continue to put upward pressure on
(mainly nontraded) goods prices. The authorities believe that there could also be some
upward effect on prices if there were to be adjustments to domestic petroleum prices.
44.
The authorities agreed that a large fiscal financing gap could emerge in the
second half of 2005. In line with lower production, oil export volumes for 2005 as a whole
have been revised down to 1.4 mbpd on average (from 1.8 mbpd under the program). This
shortfall in exports is expected to be offset by higher than programmed oil export prices—oil
prices are projected to be $36 per barrel (close to the average actually observed in the first
five months of 2005). But fiscal revenues in 2005 have also been adversely affected by the
delay in raising official domestic prices of petroleum products. This measure was supposed
to have raised the equivalent of $1.0 billion in the EPCA program, and $1.5 billion in the
approved Iraqi budget. If oil export prices turn out higher than programmed (because for
example, the Iraqi oil price differential returns to a more normal level), it is possible that this
gap could be closed without additional measures. But the authorities were persuaded that
some corrective action may be needed, including in the context of a supplementary budget.
45.
The authorities are contemplating a possible supplementary budget for 2005,
although the details remain to be worked out. The minister of finance is giving serious
consideration to including some significant upward adjustments to the prices of oil products

- 19 -

as part of this budget in order, inter alia, to raise revenue.17 The staff pressed the authorities
to raise prices of domestic oil products, both to remove a damaging economic distortion and
restore fiscal viability. The authorities concurred, while noting that this was a politically
difficult step to take and would require a well crafted public education campaign. However,
the budget is also likely to incorporate a number of additional spending commitments. This
additional spending could offset or even exceed the budget’s revenue measures for 2005. The
authorities may have to reallocate spending within the existing budget allocation. The
authorities agreed with the staff that it was important that any additional spending
commitments be fully funded by government revenues or from liquidation of government
assets held abroad (including from seized or frozen assets). The minister of finance affirmed
his intention to respect the “no-overdraft” rule and avoid recourse to financing from the CBI.
46.
The authorities shared the staff’s concerns about exchange rate pressures that
have emerged since late April. Following the large increase in net international reserves
achieved in 2004, the accumulation of reserves has been much smaller so far in 2005. The
monetary projection for 2005 that was discussed with the authorities suggests that reserves
might increase by an additional $1.7 billion in 2005, but the increase in the five months
through end-May is only about $0.5 billion. The full year projections might be hard to
achieve if the daily sales of dollars at auction stay as high as $50 million (compared to the
more usual $25 million recorded during 2004 and early 2005).18
47.
The CBI has sought to reduce dollar sales by screening out bids on grounds of
their origination from crime or money laundering, and have occasionally rationed the
supply of dollars at the cut-off price. The CBI regretted the rationing, observing that it had
occurred on only a few occasions. They noted staff concerns that rationing could undermine
market confidence, as well as constitute an exchange restriction. The staff also cautioned
against misusing screening for criminal activity as an exchange control device. The staff
urged the authorities to satisfy the demand for dollars in full, since reserves were at
comfortable levels. The authorities agreed with the staff that the defense of the exchange rate
could be bolstered by raising dinar interest rates in addition to selling dollars.
48.
The authorities wondered whether the increase in demand for dollars might
emanate from increasing dollarization in certain regions. Dollarization is believed to be
extensive in Iraq (though it is hard to measure), and has been exacerbated by the practice of
key donors (the United States) of paying local contractors and employees in U.S. dollars
17

The details of the adjustment of domestic petroleum product prices remain to be worked out, but such a plan
could include substantial upward adjustments for regular and premium gasoline. Private importation of the latter
could also be liberalized, enabling the government to gradually withdraw from supplying this segment of the
market (there is no domestic production of premium gasoline, which the government must currently import and
sell at a loss). The authorities recognize that efforts to compensate consumers for higher petroleum prices would
be hard to implement or target effectively and could potentially be very costly.
18

The government is expected to sell (from its oil revenues) an average of around $35 million per day to the
CBI to finance its domestic spending in 2005.

- 20 -

rather than Iraqi dinars. Efforts are underway to reorient the denomination of donor spending
toward the Iraq dinar.
49.
The CBI has been considering the advantages and disadvantages of moving to a
more flexible exchange rate system. It was noted that the fixed exchange has not ensured
price stability, though it was accepted that some real appreciation of the exchange rate may
be the inevitable consequence of reconstruction spending and economic recovery (Figure 1).
The staff cautioned the authorities against premature abandonment of the peg, and noted that
if the authorities were to decide to depart from the existing de facto peg, they would need to
develop an alternative nominal anchor to guide monetary policy, so as to maintain price
stability. A flexible exchange rate regime would also imply a need for (i) an appropriate
intervention and reserve management policy, (ii) the development of a true foreign exchange
market, and (iii) a strengthened capacity of commercial banks and companies to manage
exchange risk.
B. Structural Reforms
50.
The authorities agreed on the need to strengthen budget management. They
expressed their intention to prepare consolidated government accounts (including donors’
operations) toward improving understanding of the impact of fiscal operations in Iraq. The
staff advised that budget appropriations should be set close to the expected outcome to limit
the need for supplementary budgets, and to cast the budget in a medium-term framework.
51.
The authorities expressed their determination to combat corruption and
improve governance. In particular, the authorities indicated their intention to make
substantial savings by scrutinizing procurement processes. They also planned to operate oilrelated state-owned enterprises on a commercial basis. The staff underscored the need to
ensure transparency in accounting for oil revenues by continuing to have an international
accounting firm audit proceeds of oil export sales and DFI operations. Regarding the
recommendations of the IAMB, the authorities commented that Iraqi inspectors now
routinely checked the quantities of oil loaded at each of the seven export points and that
leakages were mostly the result of saboteurs. They agreed that oil metering would be an
important aid to oil accounting, but said that efforts to install meters were being hampered by
the ongoing security situation.
52.
The authorities agreed with the staff that there was a need to press forward with
improving public financial management. The staff encouraged the authorities to adopt a
chart of accounts compliant with international (GFSM) standards for the preparation and
execution of the 2007 budget, and to introduce a new FMIS and automated payroll system in
due course. The authorities shared staff concerns about “ghost workers” and the need for a
payroll survey (for which the World Bank has offered technical assistance).

53.
The authorities are determined to improve the functioning of the financial
system, with a strong focus on capacity building. A detailed plan to implement a real time
gross settlement (RTGS) system and an automated clearing house (ACH) by early 2006 has
been developed. The CBI also intends to implement a check-clearing system and is drafting
rules and regulations to form the basis for a modern regulatory framework. As regards
financial data, progress has been made in compiling monetary data for the depository
corporations in accordance with the methodology of the 2001 Monetary and Financial
Statistics Manual (MFSM). The CBI intends to implement a revised reporting form for the
commercial banks with sectorization and classification consistent with the MFSM and to
compile a preliminary depository corporations survey by September 2005.

- 22 -

54.
The authorities are looking at ways to develop the banking sector and allowing
greater competition, but are cautious about the scope and speed of the restructuring of
state-owned banks. Proposals being considered include the restructuring of the Trade Bank
of Iraq to undertake commercial and possibly investment banking functions, inviting foreign
participation in Rafidain and Rasheed banks, amalgamating the four smaller and specialized
banks into two regional development banks, and setting up Islamic banks.
55.
The authorities are keen to implement a deposit insurance scheme to foster
financial stability. However, they agreed with the staff that they should not proceed too
quickly in implementing an insurance scheme, bearing in mind the need to improve
regulation and supervision and to improving the condition of the state-owned banks (before
restructuring or privatization) prior to implementation. Modalities relating to the funding for
the scheme, membership, and the level of coverage are being discussed.
56.
Over the medium term, the authorities intend to implement international
accounting and auditing standards, and improve disclosure requirements. The
authorities expressed an interest in completing the AML/CFT questionnaire, but noted that
this may have to wait until the operational instructions of the AML law are finalized.
57.
The CBI has requested tenders from international auditors to audit its accounts
in line with International Standards on Auditing. The deadline for tenders (originally set
for end-June) has been extended to end-July and the audit could be underway shortly
thereafter. Completion of this audit should contribute toward the IMF safeguards assessment
process. The authorities are also in the process of providing other materials requested by staff
in connection with the safeguards assessment, and have appointed one of the deputy
governors as a liaison officer for this exercise. Progress in this area would be a key
consideration for Iraq’s possible use of Fund resources under a future stand-by arrangement.
C. External Debt
58.
The authorities indicated that they are making progress in reconciling external
debt claims and reaching tentative bilateral agreements in line with the Paris Club
agreement. The staff acknowledged that progress with Paris Club creditors was generally
good, but urged the authorities to press ahead in reconciling non-Paris Club claims,
especially with Gulf countries, as these were much larger in total than those of the Paris
Club. The staff suggested that the Iraqi authorities approach these creditors directly, as well
as via their legal and financial advisers.
59.
The authorities said that their advisers had followed up on the Dubai meeting
with private creditors with further meetings with private creditors and creditor
representatives. They noted that they were looking at the possibility of offering a menu of
options to private creditors with a view to providing flexibility while at the same time
adhering to the principle of comparability of treatment with the Paris Club. The authorities
recognized the importance of complying with the Fund’s policy on lending into arrears
should the country enter into a stand-by arrangement with the Fund. They understood the

- 23 -

importance for Iraq to be acting in “good faith” in its discussions with private creditors, even
though it may take time for their claims to be resolved.
D. Medium-term Prospects and Vulnerabilities
60.
Iraq’s medium term economic outlook appears satisfactory as long as the
expansion in oil production proceeds without undue interruption and world oil prices
remain at favorable levels (Tables 2–4, and 6). Such a prognosis also assumes that Iraq’s
reconstruction is undertaken relatively smoothly, that security is progressively restored, and
that the political transition goes forward as planned. The medium term scenario was
discussed with the authorities. They accepted, however, that there are considerable downside
risks to the scenario, particularly as oil prices are subject to a great deal of uncertainty, the
insurgency could continue unabated for some time, and the political transformation of Iraq is
still ongoing.
61.
Overall GDP growth is expected to reach 17 percent in 2006 and then decline
slowly to 7 percent by 2010. The recovery in economic growth is predicated upon a
resumption in the expansion of oil production to 2.4 mbpd in 2006 (following stagnation in
2005), and to 3.5 mbpd by 2010. Non-oil real GDP growth is projected to remain strong
throughout the period, sustained by high levels of (mostly public) investment. Inflation is
expected to fall to single digits over the medium term as shortages end and upward pressure
on prices from reconstruction slowly eases.
62.
The fiscal position over the medium term should be sustainable provided the
authorities contain the growth of recurrent expenditures and revenues do not fall.
While financing gaps exist for both 2005 and 2006, thereafter they largely disappear.
However, the scenario reveals little room for maneuver, and no space for slippages in fiscal
discipline or a deterioration in oil prices.
63.
The fiscal revenue forecast depends crucially on oil price projections. Iraqi oil
prices have been based on WEO oil price projections, adjusted downward by $7 per barrel on
average to reflect transportation costs and quality factors specific to Iraqi oil, and by an
additional discount of $4.5 per barrel to account for the uncertainty related to the WEO
projections.19 The scenario assumes that the existing subsidy of domestic petroleum prices is
maintained. This is not, however, a policy recommendation. The absence of any buffer to
protect the scenario from adverse developments and shocks highlights the importance of
taking action to raise domestic petroleum prices in order to establish the necessary fiscal
margin to make this scenario robust. The EPCA program envisaged a phased elimination of
the subsidy over a five year period ending in 2009. By way of illustration, under this plan,
19

The adjustment factor of $4.5 dollars per barrel is equivalent to one standard deviation in the variation of
monthly oil prices over the past 20 years. This downward adjustment to allow for uncertainty was also made to
staff projections for the medium term scenario prepared in conjunction with the staff report for the Iraqi request
for EPCA (IMF Country Report 04/325) in September 2004.

- 24 -

revenues would have been $1 billion higher in 2005 and $3.5 billion higher in 2006.20 This
would have covered a large part of the financing gap that has since emerged for 2005, and
more than covered it for 2006 (although this does not take account of additional spending
that may be included in a supplemental budget). The scenario does not assume any additional
tax measures. However, the authorities are considering converting the temporary 5 percent
reconstruction levy on imports into a permanent import duty of 10 percent, and strengthening
customs collection by the creation of bonded zones with neighboring countries.21 Other new
taxes and duties could also be introduced starting in 2006.22
64.
The scenario assumes that efforts are made to contain recurrent spending, while
allowing sufficient room for investment and reconstruction. The staff stressed the need to
keep the wage and pension bill at around 12 percent of GDP from 2006, and to reduce the
share of transfers over the medium-term. The authorities noted that they were considering
reducing the number of non-essential commodities in the commodity distribution system as
an expenditure saving measure. They also stressed that Iraq needed to develop an adequate
safety net system over the medium term, preferably cash-based. The staff cautioned that a
safety net should be targeted. The authorities noted that there may be pressures to increase
transfers to regions and provinces if spending responsibilities are devolved in the
forthcoming constitution.23 They also indicated their plan to restructure and privatize some of
the state-owned enterprises over the medium term but noted that this might require some
additional financial support in the next couple of years. If oil revenues prove in the end to
stronger than projected in this scenario, the staff would encourage the authorities to prioritize
these additional resources in favor of reconstruction investment, and/or to help meet
budgetary needs in future years (per their commitment in the EPCA program).
65.
The balance of payments is projected to improve over the medium term as oil
exports grow and imports related to reconstruction stabilize. The balance of trade, in
substantial deficit in 2005, is expected to move into comfortable surplus by 2007. The
projection for the current account presumes only the first stage of debt relief (per the Paris
Club agreement), so that accrued interest remains a large item throughout the medium term
and keeps the current account in deficit.24 If the second and third stages of debt relief were to
20

See IMF Country Report 04/325.

21

Although the reconstruction levy allows a number of product exemptions (e.g., food, medicine, and clothing)
which should be rationalized, other reasons for the relatively low revenue take from this levy include (i) poor
enforcement and administration, and (ii) the exemption of imports by donors and coalition forces.
22

The minister of finance is considering the adoption of a surcharge on trucks entering Iraq, a 10 percent
additional tax on profits of cell phone companies, license fees for cars and weapons and charges for work
permits for foreign workers, and special visas for visitors of shrines.
23

There are a number of different federal models that could emerge in the constitution, including a unitary state,
a state with a semi-autonomous Kurdish sector, and a federal system with regional or provincial autonomy.
Within these models there are overlapping issues of revenue sharing or grant allocation.

The scenario assumes treatment for all creditors (including private) comparable to the Paris Club.

go forward as scheduled, then the current account position would improve significantly (and
would be approximately balanced by 2010).
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
66.
The staff commends the authorities for having achieved and maintained a
degree of macroeconomic stability, and initiated some structural reforms, despite
extremely difficult circumstances. But there is still much to be done, and plenty of scope
for the economy to derail before it has really started its recovery and transformation into a
growing market-based economy. The authorities will need to remain vigilant to protect the
economy from macroeconomic imbalances, whether from spending pressures, revenue
shortfalls, or monetary developments. The authorities should also be encouraged to
accelerate the momentum of reform, and to ensure continuity in policy (to the extent
possible) despite the transitional nature of the government.
67.
Iraq faces enormous challenges in reconstructing its economy over the medium
term. Iraq’s social indicators have deteriorated significantly over the past quarter century,
reflecting the decline in its infrastructure, persistent economic mismanagement, and three
devastating wars. Rebuilding Iraq’s economy and restoring the health and welfare of its
people will place significant demands upon the country’s resources. The authorities will
therefore need to ensure that these resources are prioritized appropriately, and that recurrent
spending, particularly on wages, pensions, transfers, and non-essential projects, are kept
under control.
68.
The staff is concerned that pressures are mounting for additional (mainly
recurrent) spending without sufficient identified funding. The authorities are urged to
pursue a cautious fiscal stance by continuing to observe the no overdraft rule, to aim at a
spending level in 2005 that can be financed within the available resource envelope (including
expected oil revenues, domestic revenues, (liquid) funds held abroad, and external grant
resources), and to avoid the accumulation of arrears. In this context, any agreements between
the central government and governorates regarding revenue sharing and assumption of
spending responsibilities should pay close attention to safeguarding macroeconomic stability
and should establish a comprehensive fiscal reporting system to permit adequate fiscal
monitoring.
69.
The staff urges the authorities to quickly reduce government subsidies for
petroleum products. Such action will not only alleviate damaging market distortions but
will also generate additional resources for the budget—resources which currently accrue to
black market dealers and smugglers. A substantial reduction of the petroleum subsidy will be
critical both to help close the emerging financing gap under existing policies, and also help
finance such additional spending as may be included in the supplementary budget.
70.
The authorities’ reliance on exchange rate stability as a framework for
monetary policy has served them well. Although there has been an appreciation of the real
exchange rate—reflecting Iraq’s relatively high inflation rate—some of this will be unwound

- 26 -

by the recent fall in the price of commodities earlier subject to shortages. However, the
recent significant increase in the amount of dollars demanded at the CBI’s daily dollar
auction over the past two months—which the CBI has not always satisfied in full—may
signal a weakening of demand for the dinar. It is too early to say whether these pressures will
be sustained or warrant a reconsideration of the monetary policy framework. The staff
recommend that the authorities continue to support the exchange rate peg to the dollar.
71.
The staff urges the CBI to fully satisfy dollar demand at the auction cut-off rate,
and avoid resort to administrative measures to limit the amount of dollars sold. The
CBI’s external reserves are more than adequate at present levels (and well above the net
international reserves objective specified in the EPCA program). The CBI therefore has
plenty of room to deploy its reserves in defense of the exchange rate. Use of reserves in this
way will automatically tighten the dinar money supply. Screening and rationing will quickly
result in the development of a parallel exchange rate more depreciated than the official rate,
and this in turn will compound the market’s demand for dollars. Staff are seeking additional
information related to the foreign exchange auctions to determine whether they give rise to
exchange restrictions or multiple currency practices subject to Fund jurisdiction.
72.
The staff recommends that the CBI raise dinar interest rates to bolster the
defense of the exchange rate. If the CBI is reluctant to use its dollars to reduce the dinar
money supply, then it must drain liquidity using the dinar deposit facility (the only domestic
monetary instrument presently at its disposal). The CBI has guidance from the recent
treasury bill auction, where interest rates have risen to 9.9 percent, by comparison to a dinar
deposit rate of 5 percent (increased from 4 percent on July 3, 2005).
73.
The staff urges the authorities to push ahead with their reform program. The
reforms identified in the program supported by EPCA have been extensively delayed, partly
because of the continuing security problems. There is a good deal of catching up to do.
Looking ahead, the authorities’ reform agenda should focus on: developing a strategy for
restructuring the state banks and other state–owned enterprises (including those in the oil
sector); preparing an overall restructuring plan for the oil sector, including by reviewing the
fiscal framework governing the sector; formulating a strategy for the reform and
monetization of the in-kind social safety net (public distribution system (PDS)) in parallel
with the reform of the payments system; and modernizing prudential banking regulations and
the supervisory framework.
74.
The staff encourages the authorities to bolster the budget execution process and
financial management efforts. In this regard, the staff urge the authorities to fully account
for the operations of the Development Fund for Iraq (DFI) and to publish the DFI accounts
on a monthly basis. The staff underscores the need to ensure that the Financial Management
Information System (FMIS), which is being developed with foreign assistance, addresses
properly the financial management needs of Iraq and is done in line with the GFSM
compliant chart of accounts. In addition, the staff encourages the authorities to adopt
implementing regulations for the financial management law in the area of budget preparation.
The staff also encourages the authorities to take steps to establish a roster of government

- 27 -

employees, and eventually develop an automated government payroll and human resource
management system; and to strengthen other key areas of public financial management
including debt management.
75.
The staff urges the authorities to strengthen governance and the management of
oil sector operations. The staff underscores the need to implement without delay the
recommendations of the IAMB, particularly the metering of oil production and strengthening
of internal controls and audit in ministries.
76.
The staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to establish a liberal foreign trade
and exchange regime. At the present time, it is not possible to make a determination
whether or not any restrictions exist that might fall under Fund jurisdiction. As a result, it is
not possible to determine whether a decision under Article XIV is required, though Iraq
continues to avail itself of the transitional arrangements under Article XIV, Section 2. The
authorities should review and overhaul their legislation and regulations to remove any such
restrictions. As and when they are confident that all such restrictions have been removed,
they can move forward toward acceptance of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4.
77.
The staff welcomes the recent steps taken by the CBI towards seeking the
appointment of an international auditor to conduct an audit of its operations. Such an
audit will help facilitate the IMF’s safeguards assessment process, without which it would
not be possible for Iraq to enter into a stand-by arrangement with the Fund. This audit will
also be useful for the CBI’s assessment of its balance sheet, and help guide consideration of
the restructuring of CBI claims on the government.
78.
The staff underscores the need to agree debt rescheduling terms for non–Paris
Club and private creditors comparable to those recently agreed with Paris Club
creditors in order to reach bilateral agreements as soon as possible. The staff welcomes
the intentions of the authorities to proceed in good faith toward the resolution of its external
debt arrears, including by taking all necessary steps to enter into a constructive dialogue with
all creditors, and consulting with the Paris Club with respect to comparability of treatment.
79.
The staff believes that the medium term economic outlook for Iraq is
satisfactory provided the expansion in oil production goes according to plan and world
oil prices remain favorable. There are, however, significant downside risks to this favorable
medium-term outlook, particularly as oil prices are subject to a great deal of uncertainty and
the political transformation of Iraq has not reached its conclusion. The staff therefore believe
that it would be important to bolster this scenario with additional revenue measures,
particularly by raising the prices of domestic petroleum products.
80.
The staff notes the authorities’ desire for Iraq to enter into a stand-by
arrangement by the end of 2005. Progression to a stand-by arrangement would help
underpin a sound macroeconomic framework for the continuation of Iraq’s reconstruction
and recovery, as well as pave the way for Iraq to move forward to a sustainable external debt
situation under the terms of the Paris Club. The staff urges the authorities to build on their

- 28 -

track record of policy implementation by continuing to follow the program supported by
EPCA, with an urgent focus on improving the flow of timely and reliable data (especially the
fiscal accounts), auditing the CBI according to International Standards on Auditing, and
implementing a plan to significantly increase domestic petroleum prices.
81.
The staff recommends the next consultation to be held on the standard 12 month
cycle.

Nominal GDP
Sources: Iraqi authorities, and staff estimates and projections.

1/ Revised projections for 2005 are based on the 2005 budget, expenditures committed by the Coalition Provisional Authorities, information on revenues and expenditures of oil-related state-owned,
enterprises, indicative information on donors' activities, and information on oil-for-food program, but excludes possible spending or revenues from a supplementary budget.
2/ Medium-term projections do not include possible revenue measures or additional spending (e.g. on transfers) to be discussed by the cabinet.
3/ Projections for 2005 are based on average oil price ($36 per barrel) and volume (1.4 mbpd) for the first five months of 2005.
4/ Projections are based on the fact that no formal agreement has yet been reached on increasing domestic price of light petroleum products, but do not represent the staff's recommendations.
5/ EPCA (2004 and 2005) data, and estimates for 2004, do not include wages and salaries for the Kurdish area, which are included in other transfers. 2004 estimates for wages include ID2.2 trillion in advances
to be reclassified.
6/ Includes spending by the U.S. from seized and vested assets in 2004.
7/ Overhead costs associated with donor-financed reconstruction are believed to be spent mostly outside of Iraq. No firm figures were received from donors to date.
8/ Other goods and services financed by donors include security spending associated with the implementation of reconstruction projects. No firm figures were received from donors to date.
9/ 2005 figures are from the budget. It is assumed that the private sector will import an increasing share of light petroleum products starting in 2005.
10/ 2004 and 2005 EPCA data and estimates for 2004 include wages and goods for the Kurdish area.
11/ Calculated as 5 percent of oil exports as per UN Security Council Resolution 1483 to finance war reparations to Kuwait. The 2005 data is from the budget. 5 percent of any additional revenue
recorded in 2005 should be paid as war reparation.
12/ Projections for 2005 include ID1.4 trillion reportedly committed by the Coalition Provisional Authorities, to be paid by the U.S. out of a special subaccount of the DFI, and unrecorded in the budget,
projects in the north previously classified as transfers, and ID1.9 trillion in maintenance expenditure previously classified as goods.
13/ Estimates for 2005 are based on reported balances of Development Fund for Iraq (DFI) managed by the Iraqi authorities, and balances on the DFI subaccount managed by the U.S.
14/ Includes financing from letters of credit previously issued under the UN oil-for-food program.
15/ Residual in 2004 could be explained advances currently classified as expenditure.

Sources: Iraqi authorities and staff estimates and projections.

1/ Revised projections for 2005 are based on the 2005 budget, expenditures committed by the Coalition Provisional Authorities, information on revenues and expenditures of oil-related state-owned,
enterprises, indicative information on donors' activities, and information on oil-for-food program, but exclude possible spending or revenues from a supplementary budget.
2/ Medium-term projections do not include possible revenue measures or additional spending (e.g. on transfers) to be discussed by the cabinet.
3/ Projections for 2005 are based on average oil price ($36 per barrel) and volume (1.4 mbpd) for the first five months of 2005.
4/ Projections are based on the fact that no formal agreement has yet been reached on increasing domestic price of light petroleum products, but do not represent the staff's recommendations.
5/ EPCA (2004 and 2005) data, and estimates for 2004, do not include wages and salaries for the Kurdish area, which are included in other transfers. 2004 estimates for wages include ID2.2 trillion in advances
to be reclassified.
6/ Includes spending by the US from seized and vested assets in 2004.
7/ Overhead costs associated with donor-financed reconstruction are believed to be spent mostly outside of Iraq. No firm figures were received from donors to date.
8/ Other goods and services financed by donors include security spending associated with the implementation of reconstruction projects. No firm figures were received from donors to date.
9/ 2005 figures are from the budget. It is assumed that the private sector will import an increasing share of light petroleum products starting in 2005.
10/ 2004 and 2005 EPCA data and estimates for 2004 include wages and goods for the Kurdish area.
11/ Calculated as 5 percent of oil exports as per UN Security Council Resolution 1483 to finance war reparations to Kuwait. The 2005 data is from the budget. 5 percent of any additional revenue
recorded in 2005 should be paid as war reparation.
12/ Projections for 2005 include ID1.4 trillion reportedly committed by the Coalition Provisional Authorities, to be paid by the US out of a special subaccount of the DFI, and unrecorded in the budget,
projects in the North previously classified as transfers, and ID1.9 trillion in maintenance expenditure previously classified as goods.
13/ Estimates for 2005 are based on reported balances of Development Fund for Iraq (DFI) managed by the Iraqi authorities, and balances on the DFI subaccount managed by the U.S.
14/ Includes financing from letters of credit previously issued under the UN oil-for-food program.
15/ Residual in 2004 could be explained advances currently classified as expenditure.

Iraq: Relations with the World Bank Group
1.
Iraq, a founding member of the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD), received six loans from the IBRD between 1950 and 1973 for
agriculture, education, flood control, telecommunications, and transport. The last loan closed
in 1979. Iraq was in non-accrual status from 1990 to December 2004, when it paid its arrears
to IBRD (about US$108 million).
A. The Bank Group Strategy and Operations
2.
On January 29, 2004, the World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors discussed a
first Interim Strategy Note (ISN) of the World Bank Group for Iraq and authorized the Bank
to act as Administrator of the World Bank Iraq Trust Fund (ITF) within the International
Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq.
3.
The first ISN was designed to rely on the ITF to finance emergency operations and on
the Bank’s own budget to finance analytical and advisory services. It initiated activity on
three tracks: (i) build Iraqi institutional capacity, especially to establish a mechanism of
transparency and accountability urgently needed for utilizing external funding for Iraq’s
reconstruction; (ii) prepare and start implementing emergency operations to address
urgent needs, especially to generate employment and kick-start economic activity and to
restore essential infrastructure and services; and (iii) lay the groundwork for Iraq’s
medium-term reconstruction and development program and begin assisting in the
transition from central planning to a market-driven economy, through policy advice and
analytical work. To this end, it presented a range of potential interventions, aiming to provide
as much support as possible for Iraq’s reconstruction and development under difficult and
evolving circumstances.
4.
Over the past 16 months, the Bank has worked within the framework of the first ISN.
Between March and December 2004, the Bank approved and launched nine emergency
projects at a total value of about US$366 million, thereby committing nearly all donor
deposits in the ITF:
•

First Capacity Building Project (US$3.6 million)

•

Second Capacity Building Project (US$7 million)

•

Emergency Textbook Project (US$40 million)

•

Emergency School Rehabilitation and Construction Project (US$60 million)

•

Emergency Private Sector Development Project (US$55 million)

•

Emergency Baghdad Water Supply and Sanitation Project (US$65 million)

- 40 -

APPENDIX II

•

Emergency Urban Water and Sanitation and Urban Reconstruction Project
(US$90 million)

•

Emergency Community Infrastructure Project (US$25 million)

•

Emergency Health Rehabilitation Project (US$20 million)

5.
The Bank has used it own budget to provide policy advice on core reform issues, and
to undertake diagnostic and analytical sector work. To fully exploit cross-sectoral synergies,
the economic and sector work program has been grouped into three clusters: (i) economic
reform and transition; (ii) poverty, safety nets, and social development; and (iii) public sector
reform and governance. The Bank’s economic and sector work includes short notes to
provide timely policy advice, and detailed reports that offer more comprehensive analytical
assessments. The Bank also supported Iraq’s elaboration of a National Development Strategy
(NDS), which was presented to donors in October 2004. The Bank is in the process of
finalizing a Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) that draws on sectoral studies of Iraq’s
economy and policy discussions with Iraqi officials over 2003–05.
6.
The World Bank is a member of the International Advisory Monitoring Board
(IAMB), which commenced in December 2003.
7.
The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has focused on supporting the financial
sector and small and medium enterprises (SME) through both investment and technical
assistance. On the investment side, IFC signed an agreement in March 2005 to acquire a
minority stake in the Credit Bank of Iraq, in partnership with the National Bank of Kuwait
(NBK). IFC and NBK plan to increase the capital of the Credit Bank of Iraq in stages to put
it in a strong position within the domestic financial market. This investment will have a
demonstration effect and pave the way for other international banks to invest in and transfer
knowledge to the Iraqi market. The Iraq Small Business Financing Facility (SBFF) combines
investment and technical assistance to support the financing of the SME sector. Partially
funded by donors and partly funded by IFC, the SBFF will provide financing, including a
first loss component, and technical partners to the nascent local banking sector. The first
participating bank has been identified, a joint venture partner bank has invested to increase
the bank’s capital, and an agreement with a technical assistance provider is about to be
signed. The first commitment is expected this fiscal year, following challenges in registering
the shares of the joint venture partner and delays caused by security concerns. IFC has also
been active in technical assistance in Iraq through the Private Enterprise Partnership for the
Middle East and North Africa (PEP-MENA), which carried out a five-month bank training
program for Iraq from September 2004 to February 2005 to discuss strategic options for the
development of the Iraqi banking sector going forward.
8.
The Government of Iraq requested resources from IDA in December 2004 and met
with the Bank in February 2005 to begin discussing a possible lending program and to
provide inputs into a Second Interim Strategy Note, which is expected to provide a
framework for up to US$500 million of IDA lending as well as additional ITF resources.

- 41 -

APPENDIX II

B. IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
9.
The Bank is working closely with the Fund on the reform program in Iraq. The two
institutions have conducted a number of joint missions and organized policy workshops and
training courses for Iraqi civil servants and academics, covering public financial
management, oil revenue management, intergovernmental finance, investment climate,
payment system, banking supervision, social safety nets, and the like. There are no major
differences of views between the two institutions on policy issues. The staffs are in broad
agreement on the core reform program in Iraq, namely: (i) reinforcing public governance and
institutions, including management of oil revenues; (ii) ensuring coherent and wellsequenced market-focused reforms; (iii) strengthening social safety nets; and (iv) improving
the delivery of essential services, including education and health.
C. Areas in Which the World Bank Leads and There is No Direct IMF Involvement
10.
Through ITF-funded projects, the Bank is providing emergency support to
rehabilitate vital public services—education, health, water supply and sanitation, urban
infrastructure, and telecommunications (all under implementation). The Bank anchors its
project work in focused analysis of sector issues, and supports Iraqi capacity-building via
policy workshops and training courses. The Bank leads work on gender issues; and it plans to
support Iraq to undertake a Household Socio-Economic Survey and a Poverty Assessment.
D. Areas in Which the World Bank Leads and Its Analysis Serves as Input Into the
IMF-Supported Program
11.
The Bank has provided policy advice and inputs to the Prime Minister’s Supreme
Economic Committee and to key ministries. Specific Bank inputs are provided in the form of
just-in-time policy notes on key reform areas and sectors, such as subsidy reforms, pension
system, SOE restructuring and investment climate, trade policy and trade facilitation, and
telecommunications. The World Bank is working with the World Food Program on food
market issues. Work is underway on social safety nets, state bank restructuring, agriculture
reform, intergovernmental finance, and civil service reform.
12.
The Fund has a strong interest in the areas listed above from the macroeconomic
perspective (economic growth and fiscal sustainability, including the phasing out of
nontransparent quasi-fiscal operations). The Fund has also a strong interest in governance
issues, in particular with regards to oil revenue management.
E. Areas of Shared Responsibility
13.
The World Bank and the IMF are working together on macroeconomic and fiscal
sustainability, revenue management, the reform of domestic subsidies, financial sector
reform (comprising state bank restructuring, system and banking supervision and regulation),
public finance, public debt management, and statistical capacity building. The Bank and the
Fund closely coordinate their capacity building activities in macroeconomic management,

- 42 -

APPENDIX II

public sector governance, private sector development, and social safety nets. The Bank also
coordinates with the Fund its macro-modeling work (which includes the formulation of an
aggregate CGE model to evaluate the impact of major reforms). The design of the Bank’s
Household Socio-Economic Survey benefited from comments provided by the Fund team.
F. Areas in Which the Fund Leads and Its Analysis Serves as Input Into the World
Bank–Supported Programs
14.
The Fund leads the dialogue on core macroeconomic policies and has taken the lead
on debt sustainability analysis, monetary policy, the management of aggregate expenditures,
and public expenditure management. The Bank is working with the Fund to ensure
consistency of the overall macroeconomic and fiscal framework.
G. Areas in Which the IMF Leads and There is No Direct World Bank Involvement
15.
The Fund leads the dialogue on monetary and credit policies, exchange rate
management, tax administration, and balance of payments issues.

Iraq: Statistical Issues
A. Background
16.
Iraq’s macroeconomic statistics, which were once among the most developed in the
region, have suffered from years of neglect. Statistics were mostly confidential and had
limited use. There was little or no incentive to improve or even preserve quality. There was
not much contact with the outside world, and only a few Iraqi statisticians were able to gain
knowledge of the latest statistical manuals. Recent turmoil has added to the difficulties.
Given all these setbacks, the extent to which statistical data are available is remarkable.
17.
The long period of neglect of government institutions under the previous regime has
had devastating effects in many respects and has reduced statistical capacity. Although the
Central Organization for Statistics and Information Technology (COSIT) remained in place,
its technical expertise was at best obsolete. For instance, national accounts experience was
solely with System of National Accounts, 1968 (1968 SNA). The CBI’s statistical capacity is
slightly better, although the staff needs training.
18.
The Statistics Department (STA) has provided technical assistance (TA) in statistics
since 2003. After the June 2003 Fund assessment mission in which STA also took part, a first
monetary statistics mission visited Baghdad in July as part of an MFD-led mission. In
December 2003, a multisector statistics mission met with Iraqi representatives from the CBI,
COSIT, and the ministry of planning (MoP) in Amman, Jordan. The mission covered money
and financial statistics, balance of payments and foreign trade statistics, national accounts,
and consumer price statistics. In January 2004, STA hosted two workshops for Iraqi
statisticians, also in Amman, one workshop on national accounts and one workshop on
consumer price indices. During FY 2005, follow-up missions, held in Amman, were
conducted in national accounts, price statistics, and balance of payments statistics. In May
2005, STA, the IMF’s Middle East Technical Assistance Center, and the World Bank jointly
hosted a workshop for Iraqi statisticians and statisticians from the West Bank and Gaza,
again in Amman, on General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) metadata development.
The objective of the workshop was to assist the authorities in drafting GDDS metadata in a
view of their participation in the GDDS. STA continues to deliver its TA mission program
taking due account of the absorptive capacity of the statistical agencies involved, and the
contributions of other donors.
B. Shortcomings with Statistical Framework
National accounts
19.
The COSIT compiles national accounts statistics mainly for government use and the
existing Statistical Act has the COSIT reporting to the minister of planning who has to agree
on the data before its release. This procedure affects the COSIT’s statistical independence.
COSIT releases national accounts statistics to the public only in a limited form. It publishes

- 45 -

APPENDIX III

current price estimates in the Statistical Yearbook, but this has limited circulation. It is
available but only after application to, and the approval of, the minister of planning.
20.
The national accounts follow the 1968 SNA but there are gaps and flaws in its
implementation. There are deficiencies in the scope of the accounts, both in the geographical
and industrial coverage. The accounts do not—since 1991—include the northern region of
the country (Kurdistan). The national accounts do not cover the informal sector and the
surveys used are out of date. Also, they miss a significant portion of the building industry.
Further, there are many gaps in the coverage of business, community, social, and personal
services. The COSIT uses out-of-date classifications, which do not follow standard
international best practice.
21.
The data collections are reasonably comprehensive for current price data in the
formal sector. Under current procedures, businesses employing more than 10 people should
report calendar year data by the following October, and small businesses need to report by
the following June. Because there are sizable penalties for noncompliance, respondents
usually meet these deadlines. However, with recent changes in the country, one can expect
the timeliness of this data reporting to worsen.
22.
There is a shortage of quarterly and monthly indicators of economic activity and a
lack of timely data for services. For several industries, extrapolating from out-of-date
benchmarks adversely affects data quality.
23.
Technical assistance by STA consultants is continuing. Areas in need of improvement
include the implementation of 1993 SNA, improvement of data on external trade and capital
formation, the compilation of the accounts by institutional sectors, and updating of surveys.
Consumer price index
24.
The staff is inadequate in number and has only recently received training during STA
technical assistance missions. There is not enough computer hardware and software to
process the CPI efficiently. Recent technical assistance missions have focused on providing
hands-on training on methodologies for compiling the consumer price index (CPI) and on
methods for making adjustments in the CPI for changes in the quality of goods and
seasonality. Improvements in the CPI are limited by outdated weights, which date to 1993,
but these cannot be updated until the next household budget survey is conducted in
2005/2006. Limited training has also been provided on methods for constructing the
producer price index (PPI) and the wholesale price index (WPI) and on documenting the
procedures and methods used to compile the CPI (metadata); work in this area is continuing.
Monetary and financial statistics
25.
CBI staff compiling monetary statistics seem sufficient in number, but they need
training on methods of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). Availability
of computers is far from satisfactory.

- 46 -

APPENDIX III

26.
The monetary data for Iraq does not include banking activity data from the northern
region of the country (Kurdistan). Staff have provided the CBI with the standardized
reporting forms for the CBI and the other depository corporations and explained the
concepts, linkages, and presentation formats of the Central Bank Survey (CBS), the Other
Depository Corporations Survey (ODCS), and the Depository Corporations Survey (DCS).
The CBI staff have begun to compile the CBS, in parallel with their current reporting format.
Problems of classification, inadequate sectorization, and valuation are being reviewed.
27.
Commercial bank balance sheet data are patchy. Inadequate reporting from branches
have hampered proper coverage and sectorization, classification, and valuation problems
exist. In that regard, Bearing Point/USAID consultants are providing technical assistance in
Baghdad. A monetary and financial statistics mission is scheduled to take place during
July 23–28, 2005.
Balance of payments statistics
28.
There are time series available from 1988 to 2002 presented according to the IMF’s
Balance of Payments Manual, fourth edition (BPM4) format. However, there are deviations
in definitions, data coverage, classification, valuation, and sectorization for the BPM4 time
series. For 2002 to 2004, the balance of payments statistics are also in the IMF’s Balance of
Payments Manual, fifth edition (BPM5) format. Although the quality of the information for
the past three years has improved, the presentation is still limited with deviations from the
internationally acceptable methodologies.
29.
A balance of payments technical assistance mission met with Iraqi counterparts of
Balance of Payments Statistics Division’s (BOPSD) of the CBI in Jordan from
April 9-21, 2005. The mission provided assistance in improving collection and compilation
methods for the balance of payments components, applied hands-on training on several
aspects of external sector statistics methodology, and guided CBI staff in preparing a
methodological note describing current statistical production and dissemination practices of
external sector statistics.
30.
The mission found that some progress has been made since the multisector mission in
December 2003 in the following areas: (a) the new CBI Law and the Banking Law make
reference to the compulsory reporting of information of banks and any other entities for
publication, among others, of balance of payments statistics; (b) the exchange rate problems
have been largely eliminated as most transactions are currently reported and compiled in
U.S. dollars; (c) the stock data have been removed from the historical transactions series; and
(d) new reporting forms for the commercial banks have been designed.
31.
The mission noted that the quality of information has been seriously hampered
because of the incorrect interpretation of key balance of payments concepts; the lack of
human and technological resources; lack of internal cooperation within the CBI; nonresponse
to surveys and reporting forms by external sources; difficulties in collecting information due

- 47 -

APPENDIX III

to the current security situation; and the exclusion of the Kurdish areas in most of the balance
of payments statistics components.
32.
These problems have made the balance of payments largely dependent on the
BOPSD’s ad-hoc observations and estimates. The lack of information is affecting the quality
of the data in various components, notably in services, income, and transfers in the current
account, and for all components in the capital and financial account.
33.

The mission’s main recommendations were to:

•

improve human and technological resources for the BOPSD;

•

improve the legal framework for collecting and compiling balance of payments
statistics;

•

align the concept of residence with the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments
Manual (BPM5) in order to be consistent with international methodologies;

•

present the balance of payments with the required BPM5 components and breakdown
by sector;

•

reintroduce customs forms for compiling goods data;

•

improve coverage of services, income and current transfers account, by introducing
the new surveys developed by the mission;

•

use the results of the exploratory survey by the ministry of planning conducted in
2003 to create a business directory register and participate in the review of the
forthcoming FDI survey to be implemented by the ministry of planning in 2005;

•

compile financial account data, within the current limitations of the compilers, with
more reliable data sources; and

•

compile and disseminate data on external debt consistent with the international
guidelines.

External trade statistics
34.
The COSIT does not have enough staff in the section responsible for compiling
external trade data. The software for data entry is out of date. There is only one computer
available, which is also out of date. The staff’s main responsibility is checking the customs
declaration forms for consistency and keypunching relevant data into computer files. In
addition, gaps in the customs data occur in 2003 and 2004 because there were no customs
inspections at the borders.

- 48 -

APPENDIX III

35.
The customs declaration forms reflect an outdated declaration method. The Customs
Department declaration forms are old, often unreadable, and miss important information.
There is currently a customs form for exports; however, it is not used by the CBI as the
primary source for compiling trade data. Furthermore, customs forms for imports ceased to
be used from 2003.
36.
The coverage of the external trade statistics does not include the northern region of
the country (Kurdistan). The Customs Department classifies items often by customs duties,
which makes it difficult for the COSIT to reclassify. As a result, there is a large margin of
error in the final product.
37.
The foreign trade data are monthly but there are serious problems of timeliness.
Sometimes, release of the data may take up to one year. There are no legal requirements on
the timeliness of source data.
38.
The external trade data from the COSIT and the data compiled by the CBI are not
consistent. The Balance of Payments Division of the CBI does not use external trade data
from the COSIT.
Government finance
39.
Iraq does not report government finance statistics for publication in the Government
Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) or International Financial Statistics (IFS). Currently
there are no fiscal statistics published by the government beyond the summary central
government budgetary estimates and outturn. The February 2005 government finance
statistics (GFS) mission—held jointly with a parallel FAD and World Bank mission—
discussed a work plan aimed at building up GFS reporting as an integral part within the
overall objective of major rehabilitation of the budgetary, accounting, and fiscal management
information system. The mission identified institutional, technical, resource, and
coordination issues that would need to be addressed prior to developing GFS for Iraq and
recommended the creation of a GFS unit. Key first steps of this unit will be to implement the
GFS classification for mapping the chart of accounts and budget classification onto the
format of the Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM) 2001, initiate a General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS) project to draw up plans for GFS development and
dissemination, and create preliminary estimates of GFS-compliant data for general
government on a best effort basis.

APPENDIX IV

Iraq: External Debt Outlook
40.
On November 21, 2004, the Paris Club agreed to a reduction of Iraq’s
outstanding debt at end-December 2004 in three stages: 30 percent debt reduction upon
the signing the agreement, combined with interest deferral on the outstanding balance;
30 percent additional debt reduction upon approval of an upper credit tranche arrangement
with the IMF (expected by end-2005), and a further 20 percent debt reduction following
completion of the IMF’s Executive Board’s final review of three years of one (or more)
upper credit tranche arrangement(s). The agreement also entails a rescheduling of the
remaining debt stock with repayments of the debt stock starting in July 2011 and ending in
January 2038. In addition, interest payments accrued during 2005–07 are fully capitalized,
and those accrued during 2008–10 are partially capitalized.
41.
The first stage of debt reduction significantly reduces Iraq’s debt burden. If all
creditors (Paris Club, Non Paris Club, and private creditors) provide debt reduction
comparable to that agreed by the Paris Club, debt forgiveness in 2004 would amount to some
$36 billion. The United States has already granted 100 percent debt cancellation, while other
countries are assumed to provide 30 percent. Japan and Russia have indicated that they
would opt for debt service reduction (rather than debt reduction) comparable to the agreed
amount of debt reduction in net present value terms. The Paris Club agreement also reduces
debt service over the medium term because it defers the principal and most interest payments
until 2011.25
42.
The first stage of debt reduction is nonetheless insufficient to bring the debt
stock to a sustainable level. With the first stage of debt reduction, the stock of external debt
outstanding at end 2004 is estimated to be about $78 billion, or about three times of Iraq’s
GDP. Without additional debt reduction, the external debt stock would increase to about
$103 billion by 2010 (about 170 percent of GDP), partly because the capitalization of the
majority of the interest payments during 2005–10. With the second and third stage of debt
reduction, on the other hand, the external debt stock would decline to about $34 billion
(57 percent of GDP) by 2010 (see Appendix IV, Table 1).
43.
Because of the deferral of most interest payments until 2010, Iraq would have
limited liquidity needs after the first stage of debt reduction, notwithstanding the very
high level of the stock of debt. Iraq would nonetheless be very vulnerable to a negative
oil shock. With the implementation of the first stage of the debt reduction, Iraq’s external
debt service would be relatively small through 2010 (Appendix IV, Table 1). However,
simulations for two oil shocks—a production shock which limits oil production to 3.0 mbpd
25

The deferral of the payments is formally linked to the second stage of debt reduction. Although the projection
in the baseline scenario assumes only the first stage of debt reduction, the assumption of deferred payment is
maintained.

- 51 -

APPENDIX IV

in 2008–10, and a price shock which lowers oil export price by $4.5 per barrel (equivalent to
one standard-deviation) in 2006–10—show that Iraq’s liquidity needs would increase
substantially, requiring significant borrowing on international markets to close the (ex ante)
financing gaps (Appendix IV, Table 2). Iraq’s already unsustainable debt stock would also
increase under these two scenarios.

IRAQ
Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the Middle East and Central Asia Department
Approved by Lorenzo Pérez and Carlos Muñiz
July 25, 2005
1.
This statement provides an update on developments since the issuance of the staff
report. The thrust of the staff appraisal remains unchanged.
2.
A donors' conference on Iraq was held in Jordan (Dead Sea) during July 18–19.
Donors reiterated their support for the government's reconstruction program and welcomed
the introduction of an Iraqi led donor coordination mechanism. Japan outlined an agreement
to provide $3.5 billion in low-interest loans for infrastructure projects as part of its efforts to
meet its Madrid conference aid pledge. Other donors also announced and reaffirmed pledges.
The World Bank announced a lending program of $500 million over the next two years. Iran
subsequently announced (outside the context of the donors’ conference) that it would grant
Iraq a $1 billion credit line.
3.
The overall Consumer Price Index (CPI) index increased by 1.0 percent in June. The
CPI increased by a cumulative 5.7 percent in the first six months of 2005, or by 37.2 percent
in the year to June 2005. Fuel prices, which rose by 237 percent during July through
December 2004, fell by 48 percent during January through June 2005.
4.
The cumulative increase in reserve money in the five months to May 2005, was
1.2 percent, while the increase in currency in circulation for the same period was
18.8 percent. The difference in the growth of the two monetary measures mainly reflects the
impact of the recently introduced overnight deposit facility, which by end-May had attracted
about ID 1,753 billion (the equivalent of 14.2 percent of reserve money) from the banks’ free
reserves and thereby reduced the growth of reserve money.
5.
External reserves of the CBI continue to grow during the first five months of 2005,
though at a slower pace than in 2004. Reserves increased to $8.8 billion in May, compared
with $7.7 billion in March, and $7.4 billion in December, 2004.
6.
The CBI adopted the following measures effective July 3, 2005: (i) an increase in the
interest rate on the overnight dinar deposit facility from 4 to 5 percent per annum; and (ii) the

-2-

introduction of a 14-day and a 30-day deposit facilities yielding 6 percent and 7 percent,
respectively. The interest rate rose to 9.9 percent in the July 4 treasury bill auction.
7.
The exchange rate has continued to be under some pressure. The exchange rate in the
first three weeks of July has ranged between ID1,476 to ID1,470 per dollar, from an average
of ID1,460 in June.
8.
Oil export volume in June was 1.5 million barrels per day (mbpd), compared with an
average of 1.4 mbpd in the first five months of 2005. Average oil export prices in June were
$39 per barrel compared with an average of $36.4 in the first five months of 2005. The
Northern Oil pipeline resumed operation in mid-July, allowing the shipment of about
250,000 barrels per day.

Statement by A. Shakour Shaalan, Executive Director for Iraq
August 1, 2005
1.
Today marks another defining moment in the relationship between Iraq and the Fund:
the resumption, after a quarter century of interruption of the Board’s review of an Article IV
consultation for Iraq. The authorities would like to thank the Fund’s board, management and
particularly the staff, for their ongoing commitment in assisting Iraq through a long and
arduous road and in furthering the normalization of the country’s standing in the international
community. Moreover, I would like to convey the authorities’ continued commitment to
sound policies and to needed structural reforms, that will contribute to rebuilding the
economy and its institutions, and recover the prosperous position it once held in the not too
distant past.
Background
2.
The economic situation—particularly in Iraq—needs to be assessed in its larger social
and political context, given its tremendous bearing on economic developments. It is easy to
overlook that the establishment and maintenance of relative macroeconomic stability in the
midst of violence and a security chaos is an achievement in itself. It required strong and
continuous efforts on the part of the authorities, along with firm assistance from the
international community and in particular the Fund. Indeed, the staff’s advice and technical
assistance have strongly contributed to the identification of priorities, the assessment of
capabilities and the formulation of desired policies in this difficult context.
3.
The implementation of policies in Iraq, and especially their pace, is severely
constrained by the new and fragile institutional setting in which it is formulated, the limited
administrative capacity and the precarious social, political and security situation. Large
segments of the Iraqi population continue to live in hardship, with an unemployment rate
estimated by the Ministry of Planning to be around 28 percent, probably an underestimate.
The recent UNDP survey portrays some of the daunting social challenges, including
widespread chronic children malnutrition and endemic diseases. Moreover, basic household
needs, such as reliable access to water, sewage services and electricity are poorly provided
for, and further underscore the urgency of assisting the population to cope with the ongoing
conflict. In light of these large social needs, the politically charged atmosphere and the
security breakdown, the timing of the introduction of major reforms such as that of the
petroleum subsidy—to which the authorities are firmly committed—is critical. Tangible
improvements in daily life and compensatory measures to alleviate the burden on the
population would be crucial to ensure the feasibility of introducing politically contentious
reforms. An acceleration of disbursements of the donor’s commitments to Iraq—which has
received only a small fraction of the pledges made so far—would go a long way in creating a
policy space for the authorities and allow a more vigorous pace of economic restructuring.

-2-

Recent Developments
4.
Political reforms have advanced substantially even if the process appeared protracted
at some junctures. Successful parliamentary elections were held in January 2005 for the
Transitional National Assembly, which was followed by the election of the president of the
republic followed by the formation of a new cabinet in April of this year. Moreover, a
committee from the Assembly has been set up and has started its deliberations to draft a new
constitution for the country. A public referendum on the constitution will follow shortly after.
5.
In parallel with this active and eventful political dynamics, the economic process also
moved along with resolve, even if in an uneven way. The rebuilding of the economic
institutions has been pursued relentlessly in order to create a vibrant market based economy
and increase the efficiency of the use of its natural resources. GDP growth in 2004 has been
close to 50 percent (albeit from a low level), reflecting increases in oil production to about 2
mbpd—as a result of public investment in the oil sector—and sustained growth in the non-oil
sector. While violence and insecurity have limited the further expansion of oil production this
year so far, it is expected that it would rebound in 2006 with a strong prospect for real GDP
growth to be in the double digits again. Iraq’ s proven oil reserves, estimated at around 115
billion barrels, are the world’s third largest. The potential development of the oil sector is
considerable given that a large portion of the country remains unexplored. Oil production
could expand to 2.4 mbpd in 2006 and to a further 3.5 mbpd by 2010, pending improvements
in general security as well as decreased sabotage to northern pipelines.
Monetary Policy
6.
High inflation has accompanied the high growth rate in 2004, essentially due to
violence-related shortages of essential goods. Prices have, however, stabilized relatively in
2005, but will nonetheless imply a higher than expected rate for the year, requiring an
adjustment of the EPCA target to 20 percent for end-2005. The Central Bank of Iraq (CBI)
has recently introduced separate dinar and dollar deposit facilities in an effort to reduce
liquidity and help stem price pressures. In early July, the CBI increased the remuneration on
the dinar’s overnight rate from 4 to 5 percent annually, and introduced 14 and 30-day deposit
facilities, with a 6 and 7 percent interest rate respectively, signaling a tightening of monetary
conditions. These facilities widened the range of monetary policy instruments of the CBI and
additional instrument are under consideration. The monetary tightening was reflected in the
CBI treasury bills’ rates which have increased from 4 percent in 2004 to 7 percent in June
2005.
7.
The rate increases should help ease some of the pressures on the exchange rate that
were witnessed earlier this year. The authorities note that only on few occasions was the
supply of dollars rationed and they understand the importance of satisfying the demand for
foreign exchange. While the authorities have considered moving to a flexible exchange
regime to alleviate the pressure on reserves in trying to achieve price stability, they recognize
the need for a nominal anchor for monetary policy and agree that the peg to the dollar has
been relatively effective in this respect. The rapid buildup of international reserves at the CBI

-3-

beyond the EPCA target, almost reaching US$9 billion in May provides a safety cushion for
the continued support of the peg. The authorities fully recognize that prudent monetary and
fiscal policies are needed to support the peg.
Fiscal Sector
8.
The fiscal deficit in 2004 was slightly higher than the EPCA’s target. Higher oil
revenues and lower than expected wage and pension outlays helped contain the net effect of
an increase in spending in goods and services, the latter being, to a large degree, due to
unbudgeted commitments by the Coalition Provisional Authority the year before. Investment
spending was also lower, reflecting a weak disbursement in donor-financed non-oil
reconstruction projects. On the other hand, the Iraqi investment spending on the oil sector
was close to target.
9.
While further oil price increases are keeping oil revenue targets in line with the
program so far in 2005, thus compensating for the lower-than-programmed oil export
volumes, the authorities are aware of the volatility of oil prices and the risk it entails for the
fiscal outlook. Moreover, with a doubling of the differential between the price of Iraqi oil
exports and world prices this year, Iraq is not reaping the full benefits of stronger prices. The
authorities are looking into the matter to explain the origin of the differential and hope to be
able to take any measure they can to narrow this differential, and thus increase revenues. The
major fiscal issue, however, as staff points out, remains the foregone revenues of the
petroleum product subsidy. The authorities are aware of the importance of this measure for
the medium and long term sustainability of the fiscal stance. As we noted earlier, they are
subject to stringent political constraints in this regard, but are committed to start reducing
significantly the subsidy as soon as feasible. They, moreover, emphasize the need for a good
communication and education strategy to be developed in this regard.
10.
The authorities agree that in view of the delay in implementing the reduction of
subsidies and the pressures to increase spending including on security, a financing gap might
emerge for 2005 and 2006. They further agree that in the event that the gap is not closed by
higher oil revenues, additional measures may have to be undertaken in the context of a
supplementary budget and that any additional spending commitment would have to be
funded from government revenues and the sale of assets held abroad. The accumulation of
arrears will continue to be avoided as has been the case so far.
Structural Reforms
11.
Budgetary management has improved in 2005 with the reporting on budget outturns
in line ministries, albeit with a significant delay. To deal with the fragmentation of fiscal
operations and off budget operations, the MOF is committed to approve additional spending
only in the context of a supplementary budget. The authorities will work on strengthening
further governance and budget management, including through the preparation of
consolidated government accounts. They intend to follow up on the recommendation of the
International Advisory and Monitoring Board regarding the Development Fund for Iraq and

-4-

the audit of the oil sector, and inspections and verification of oil exports is already taking
place. Further measures to increase savings and enhance revenue will be undertaken ,
including scrutinizing procurement practices while strengthening and diversifying the
sources of revenues. The authorities are considering the conversion of the levy on imports
into a permanent import duty and the strengthening of customs collection and administration
in order to increase the relatively low levels of revenues from this source. Other taxes and
surcharges, including on profits in the cell phone sector, are also being contemplated.
12.
The CBI is intent on the reform and modernization of the financial sector in general
and the banking sector in particular, especially in view of the low financial sector
intermediation and the prevalence of cash transactions in the economy. Modern central bank,
commercial bank, and AML laws are being adopted. Moreover, a modern payment system,
including a real time gross settlement system and an automated check-clearing system, and
its accompanying regulation, is being developed. With a modernized payment infrastructure
and regulation the promotion of a competitive financial sector will be sought next. This will
include the restructuring of existing banks and inviting foreign participation in the
commercial banks. It is important to note in this regard that the security situation has slowed
the development of the banking sector as none of the international banks granted a license to
operate in Iraq has established a presence there yet. In due time, the authorities will consider
the creation of a deposit insurance scheme after the supervisory framework has been well
established, and intend to apply international auditing and accounting standards in the sector.
The CBI has proceeded with the request for tenders for an international auditor to audit its
own operations according to the International Standards on Auditing, which the authorities
understand is a requirement for its safeguard assessment process, a pre-condition for an SBA
with the Fund. The audit could take place shortly after the end-July deadline for the tender.
Other material necessary for the safeguard assessment is being provided as well.
Debt Restructuring
13.
The Paris Club agreement in November 2004 paved the way for a major restructuring
of Iraqi’s external debt towards a sustainable position. Iraq has made good progress with
official Paris Club creditors in reconciling debt claims, and has engaged non-Paris Club
creditors, including the Gulf countries, in discussions with the aim of securing similar debt
restructuring terms. Iraq is also engaging in good faith commercial creditors while clarifying
the essential principle of Paris Club comparability in settling claims. The Iraqi authorities
have met with the private creditors in Dubai in May of this year, and have subsequently made
an offer to settle such claims in a press release on July 26. Further details on this offer will be
communicated to the Board shortly. Given the structure of the Paris-Club agreement and the
conditioning of further debt relief on an arrangement with the Fund, the authorities are
seeking to enter into a stand-by arrangement with the Fund towards the end of the year.
Conclusion
14.
The authorities are very well aware of the daunting challenges facing Iraq and of the
major risks to the economic outlook looking forward, given the many political and security

-5-

obstacles facing the country. They also understand the necessity of sweeping reforms in the
fiscal, monetary, and oil sectors as well as the importance to attend to the large social and
humanitarian needs of the population. The authorities remain confident that with the
continuous support of the international community, their commitment to political, economic,
and social reforms will allow the resumption of a sustainable growth and an improvement in
living standards commensurate with the aspirations of the Iraqi citizens.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation
with Iraq
On August 1, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Iraq.1
Background
The last Article IV consultation with Iraq was concluded by the Executive Board 25 years ago,
on February 29, 1980. Following the resumption of normal relations with Iraq, the Executive
Board approved a request by the government of Iraq for a purchase in an amount equivalent to
SDR 297.1 million (about US$436.3 million; 25 percent of quota) under the Fund’s policy on
Emergency Post Conflict Assistance (see Press Release No. 04/206). The EPCA-supported
program, which runs through the end of 2005, underscored the authorities’ commitment to a
comprehensive economic and financial program. However, the implementation of the EPCA
program has been hampered by the difficult security situation, a slow-moving process of
reconstruction, the protracted electoral process, and slower-than-expected progress in
strengthening administrative and institutional capacity. As a result, performance under the
EPCA program has been mixed.
Economic activity rebounded in 2004, with real GDP estimated to have increased by nearly
50 percent, mainly reflecting the recovery of the oil sector. After an upsurge in consumer
prices in late 2004 and January 2005—mostly due to supply shocks—inflationary pressures
have subsequently subsided, but the 12-month inflation rate through June (at 37 percent) still
exceeds by a wide margin the original EPCA-supported program projection for end-2005 of
15 percent.
The Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) reports net international reserves of US$7.4 billion at endDecember 2004, well above the program floor of US$4 billion. After appreciating in early 2004

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team collects economic and financial information, and
discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to
headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities.

-2following the introduction of the new currency, the exchange rate of the dinar has remained
broadly stable since May 2004. More recently the exchange rate has been under pressure,
with dollar sales volumes at the daily CBI foreign exchange auctions having almost doubled.
Recently, the CBI broadened its menu of monetary policy instruments by activating separate
dinar and dollar overnight deposit facilities to better manage overall liquidity in the banking
system.
The fiscal deficit for 2004 was somewhat larger than targeted under the EPCA program.
Spending on goods and services was higher than under the budget, with larger outlays for
defense and security. Grant-financed reconstruction expenditure in 2004 fell significantly short
of expectations. Although donors to the International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq
deposited about US$1 billion into this facility, only about US$103 million were disbursed to
finance projects in 2004.
The implementation of all structural benchmarks under the EPCA program has been delayed,
including the commitment to increase domestic prices of refined oil products, the development
of payment systems, the full implementation of a financial management information system,
and the establishment of an automated payroll system. This is due to the continuing lack of
security, communications problems, and the need to tailor the required systems to the
circumstances of Iraq. Nevertheless, progress has been made in developing a monetary
survey, in drafting a new payments system legislation, and improving the banking regulatory
framework.
On November 21, 2004, the Paris Club creditors agreed to debt reduction terms for Iraq to be
implemented in three stages and amounting to a total of 80 percent debt reduction. The Iraqi
government has begun to reconcile external claims and move toward concluding bilateral
agreements with Paris Club and most non-Paris Club official creditors. The Iraqi authorities
also held a meeting for private creditors in Dubai on May 4.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the resumption of Article IV consultations with Iraq, which
represents a further important milestone in Iraq’s relations with the Fund, and in its
reintegration into the global economy. Directors commended the authorities for having
established and maintained a degree of macroeconomic stability under extremely difficult
circumstances, and for having initiated structural reforms. However, the economy remains
fragile, and much work remains to be done to transform Iraq into a market economy, firmly
based on a path of sustained growth. Directors stressed that, in the near term, the authorities
will need to be ready to act resolutely to contain potential macroeconomic imbalances, most
importantly, those that may arise from spending pressures, fluctuations in oil revenue, or
adverse monetary developments. While recognizing that the pace of reconstruction and
recovery will to a large extent depend on how the political and security situation evolves, they
also urged the authorities to proceed with the most urgent structural reforms, and to maintain
the policy momentum overall.
Directors noted that rebuilding Iraq’s economy and infrastructure, while at the same time
improving the standard of living of its people, will place significant demands on the country’s
limited resources. While the long-run prospects are well supported by its substantial resource
base, Iraq still faces daunting challenges and downside risks in reconstructing its economy.
To speed up investment in essential infrastructure, social services, and poverty reduction,

-3Directors underscored the importance of strong action on fiscal and oil sector reforms, along
with the timely disbursement of aid commitments.
Directors stressed the critical importance of putting in place a coherent fiscal strategy aimed at
prioritizing the use of available resources, while containing recurrent expenditures, particularly
on wages, pensions, transfers, and non-essential projects. In this connection, Directors
encouraged the authorities to maintain a cautious fiscal stance by strengthening public
expenditure management, continuing to adhere to the “no overdraft” rule, and avoiding the
accumulation of arrears. Directors noted that a key challenge facing the authorities is the
elimination of existing price distortions, with a view to alleviating market distortions and
sources of corruption, and generating additional budget resources to support priority sectors,
such as education, health, and security. While recognizing the politically and socially difficult
context, they urged the authorities to start phasing out the significant government subsidies on
petroleum products as quickly as feasible. Directors underscored that the successful
implementation of this measure will require careful preparation and supportive policies,
including an effective communication and public education strategy, consideration of a
pre-announced schedule, and careful social impact assessment. The role for technical
assistance from the Fund and World Bank in helping the authorities in these areas was
emphasized.
Directors welcomed the recent steps to enhance transparency and accountability in
government activities, particularly the intention to appoint an international auditor to conduct an
audit of the operations of the central bank, and the steps being taken to modernize the
payments system and tackle corruption. They considered that these efforts will need to be
broadened with additional measures to support budget execution and financial management,
as well as with action to strengthen governance and the management of oil sector operations.
In this context, Directors urged the full implementation of the Financial Management Law.
They underscored, in particular, the need to implement without delay the recommendations of
the International Advisory and Monitoring Board, specifically those regarding the metering of
oil production and exports, and strengthening of internal controls and audit in ministries.
The authorities were also encouraged to subscribe to the Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative (EITI) to help ensure improved transparency of oil revenues.
Directors agreed that the authorities’ reliance on exchange rate stability as the pillar of their
framework for monetary policy has served the economy well. They advised continuation of the
exchange rate peg to the dollar in view of the relative stability achieved thus far and the
absence of a suitable alternative nominal anchor. Directors stressed however that, in order for
the peg to be credible, the central bank should refrain from resorting to administrative
measures to limit the amount of dollars sold in the foreign exchange auctions and should
satisfy the total amount demanded at the cutoff rate. Persistent pressures on the exchange
rate should instead be met with a tightening of monetary policy, including by raising interest
rates on the central bank’s overnight deposit facility, and Directors welcomed the recent move
in this direction. They encouraged the authorities to remain vigilant and closely monitor
developments that may threaten their inflation objective, including by actively using their
monetary policy instruments to adjust liquidity conditions as needed. Going forward, the
development of additional monetary instruments would also facilitate the implementation of
monetary policy.
Directors urged the authorities to take steps to advance their structural reform efforts.
While recognizing that continuing security problems have contributed to delaying the reforms
identified in the program supported by the 2004 EPCA, Directors stressed that steady progress

-4on a well-focused reform agenda will be key to creating the conditions for sustainable, broadbased growth. This should include: the development of a strategy for restructuring the state
banks and other state-owned enterprises as part of a strategy toward reducing the role of the
state over the medium term; the preparation of an overall restructuring plan for the oil sector,
including by reviewing the fiscal framework governing the sector; the formulation of a strategy
for the reform and monetization of the in-kind social safety net in parallel with the ongoing
reform of the payments system; the phasing out of price distortions; and the modernization of
prudential banking regulations and the supervisory framework. Further steps to strengthen
financial management in the public sector, diversify revenues and the economy more
generally, and enhance governance will also be important. Directors noted that the
international community will have a continued role to play in supporting the authorities’ reform
and institution-building efforts.
Directors underscored the need for Iraq to reach agreement on debt rescheduling terms for
non–Paris Club and private creditors comparable to those agreed last year with Paris Club
creditors. They urged the authorities to accelerate the process of debt reconciliation with
official creditors, so as to facilitate progress toward securing bilateral agreements as soon as
possible. Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to proceed in good faith toward the
resolution of Iraq’s external debt arrears. They were encouraged by the steps being taken, and
called on the authorities to pursue a constructive dialogue with all creditors, and to consult with
the Paris Club with respect to comparability of treatment.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to establish a liberal foreign trade and exchange
regime and looked forward to Iraq’s acceptance of the relevant Article VIII obligations. In order
to facilitate the process of acceptance, the authorities should move expeditiously to review and
overhaul their legislation and regulations in order to remove any possible exchange restrictions
that may fall under Fund jurisdiction. Directors noted the progress made on putting in place a
legal framework for Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism
(AML/CFT) matters, and looked forward to its implementation.
Notwithstanding some progress in the preparation and dissemination of statistics, Directors
noted that the statistical information that the Iraqi authorities are able to provide to the Fund is
just adequate for surveillance purposes. They urged the authorities to make further efforts to
strengthen their statistical framework, in particular in the fiscal area.
Directors took note of the authorities’ desire to enter into a Stand-By Arrangement by the end
of 2005. They pointed out that progression to a Stand-By Arrangement would help underpin a
sound macroeconomic framework for the continuation of Iraq’s reconstruction and recovery, as
well as pave the way for Iraq to move forward to a sustainable external debt situation under
the terms of the Paris Club. They urged the authorities to continue to build on their track record
of policy implementation by continuing to implement the program supported by EPCA, focusing
on a reinvigoration of structural reforms and further steps to improve governance and the
country’s institutional and administrative capacity. A strengthening of the quality and timeliness
of basic economic data that are essential for program monitoring will also be needed.
