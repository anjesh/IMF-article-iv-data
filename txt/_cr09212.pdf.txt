UNITED KINGDOM
Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2009 Consultation with the United Kingdom
(In consultation with other Departments)
Approved by Marek Belka and Tamim Bayoumi
June 23, 2009
•

This report is based on discussions held in London during May 7–20. The
team comprised Mr. Chopra (head), Ms. Iakova, Messrs. Meier and Tang (all
EUR), Mr. Bornhorst (FAD), and Mr. Moore (MCM).

•

The mission met with Chancellor Darling, Bank of England (BoE) Governor
King, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) Chairman Turner, and other
senior officials, academics, think tanks, and private sector representatives.

•

The mission's concluding statement was published on May 20, 2009 and can
be found at: http://www.imf.org/external/np/ms/2009/052009a.htm

•

Context of past surveillance. In recent years, the Fund and the authorities
agreed on the broad policy priorities—maintaining confidence in the UK’s
fiscal and monetary policy frameworks and enhancing financial sector
stability. Given concerns about growing imbalances in the economy, the Fund
has advocated strong fiscal discipline to improve resilience to shocks. In the
event, the unfolding financial crisis has tested the UK’s policy frameworks
much more severely than had been anticipated. The authorities’ policy
response to the crisis has incorporated key elements of Fund advice from the
2008 Art. IV consultation, notably the need to strengthen bank capital and the
creation of a special resolution framework.

•

The sterling exchange rate is market determined. The United Kingdom has
accepted the obligations of Article VIII. The exchange system is free of
restrictions on current international transactions, with the exceptions of those
notified to the Fund in accordance with Executive Board Decision 144 and
UN-sanctioned restrictions on external payments for security reasons.

•

It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12month cycle.

I. STAFF APPRAISAL
1.
The United Kingdom has been hit hard by the global financial crisis. The
economy was particularly exposed to the crisis because of its large financial sector, high
household indebtedness, and strong cross-border links. Economic activity has contracted
sharply, the unemployment rate has increased, property prices have plunged, and inflation
has fallen despite a significant depreciation of sterling.
2.
The authorities’ policy response to the deep recession and financial crisis has
been forceful and wide ranging. Public capital has been injected into weak banks and
their troubled assets are being ring-fenced. Banking sector liquidity has been shored up.
Economic activity is being supported by an unprecedented easing of monetary policy and
temporary discretionary fiscal stimulus. These aggressive policies have successfully
contained the crisis, and there are tentative signs that confidence is returning. In addition,
the floating exchange rate has acted as a shock absorber, with the depreciation of sterling
offsetting to some extent the weakening of external demand.
3.
Looking ahead, the economic recovery is expected to be subdued and gradual
as banks and households go through a difficult balance sheet adjustment. With the
economic downturn heightening the risk of further large credit losses, banks have tightened
the supply of credit. The high level of household indebtedness is also likely to constrain the
pace of economic recovery. GDP is projected to fall by about 4¼ percent this year, with
quarterly growth picking up gradually through 2010. The speed and strength of the
recovery, however, remain highly uncertain, given the unprecedented nature of the crisis
and the importance of confidence effects.
4.
Notwithstanding recent signs of stabilization, underlying vulnerabilities in the
UK are sizeable. The financial crisis has brought about a dramatic deterioration in public
finances. Public debt, although starting from a relatively low level, is projected to double in
five years. The sharp increase in government borrowing and contingent liabilities, together
with continued financial sector fragility, are significant vulnerabilities. In these
circumstances, a severe shock has the potential to disrupt domestic and external stability.
This highlights the importance of credible and consistent policies to truncate downside
risks and strengthen market confidence. The main policy priorities remain, first, resolving
the problems in the financial sector to buttress stability and promote normalization of credit
supply, and second, setting monetary and fiscal policies consistent with a firm commitment
to the existing policy anchors of price stability and fiscal sustainability.
5.
Repairing the financial system is essential for achieving a sustained recovery.
The authorities’ policy interventions have averted a systemic breakdown in the financial
sector. But the financial system may not yet be repaired to level where banks are ready to
increase lending sufficiently to underpin a strong recovery. Although major banks are
expected to remain above minimum regulatory capital requirements, recession-related

5
credit losses will lead to an erosion of capital buffers. At the same time, it is doubtful that
increased capital market funding can compensate for shortfalls in bank lending. It will
therefore be important for the authorities to continue to:
•

Seek further strengthening of banks' capital positions by encouraging banks to take
advantage of improving market conditions to augment their capital base and, if
necessary, providing further public capital support.

•

Promote options to preserve capital cushions and improve capital structures, for
example by restraining dividend payouts not supported by profits and converting
preference shares to common shares.

•

Develop contingency plans in the event that further shocks threaten the stability of
financial institutions.

•

Support credit supply through targeted and appropriately designed intervention in
dysfunctional credit markets.

6.
Beyond the short term, the crisis has highlighted the need to strengthen the UK
prudential framework. The adoption of a new Banking Act, which creates a special
resolution regime for failing banks, together with the move to a more hands-on supervisory
regime, are welcome improvements to the regulatory infrastructure. The shift to a more
systematic approach to supervision should be complemented by enhanced disclosure of
financial information by both banks and the FSA to reduce uncertainty and enhance public
surveillance. The Turner Review represents an important contribution to the international
debate on enhancing the regulatory and supervisory system. Progress on the following
aspects, pursued in collaboration with international partners, will be particularly important
to ensure future stability:
•

Phased introduction of a maximum gross leverage ratio as a backstop against excessive
balance sheet growth.

•

Development of new macro-prudential instruments to mitigate the amplitude of the
credit cycle and reduce feedback loops between the financial sector and the real
economy.

•

Overhaul of the EU’s regulatory and supervisory arrangements, and in parallel
strengthening cross-border arrangements for crisis management and orderly exit of
large internationally active banks.

7.
The Bank of England’s strategy of aggressive monetary easing is appropriate.
On balance, the prospect is for inflation to fall and stay below the 2 percent target for an
extended period. With policy rates near zero and conventional transmission channels
partially impaired, the BoE has started purchasing assets financed by expanding central
bank reserves. It is too early to judge the overall effectiveness of this quantitative easing
policy, although the initial results are moderately encouraging—government bond rates

6
have been kept low and liquidity in targeted private credit markets has improved.
Diversifying further the Bank’s private asset purchases could help improve the functioning
of viable capital markets and sustain the flow of credit to the real economy.
8.
The success of unconventional monetary policy rests on the robust institutional
framework underpinning the Bank of England’s operational independence. The
prudent setup of the Asset Purchase Facility, which operates as a separate legal entity under
comprehensive indemnity assurances from the Treasury, is therefore welcome. It protects
the integrity of the BoE’s balance sheet, a key prerequisite for monetary policy to remain
focused strictly on price stability. It is also reassuring that the Monetary Policy Committee
(MPC) will not need Treasury approval to determine and implement a future exit from
quantitative easing as required to meet the inflation target. The exit could include a
combination of asset sales, other liquidity-draining operations, and higher interest rates.
9.
More fundamentally, the success of the current policy package hinges on
continued trust in the sustainability of the fiscal position. A strong commitment to
reverse the sharp deterioration of public finances within a reasonable timeframe is crucial.
Therefore, once the economic recovery is established, implementing an ambitious fiscal
consolidation plan will be essential. The focus should be on putting public debt on a firmly
downward path faster than envisaged in the 2009 Budget. The credibility of such plans
would be enhanced by clarifying early the specific measures needed to achieve the
adjustment, including in the context of the next Comprehensive Spending Review. The
emphasis in current plans to weigh the adjustment toward expenditure reduction is
appropriate in light of international experience that expenditure-based consolidations are
more durable. Long-term sustainability would also be helped by implementing structural
reforms to address the rising costs associated with demographic change. Building a broad
public consensus on the need for sizeable fiscal adjustment will be essential in meeting
fiscal challenges.
II. BALANCE SHEET STRAINS
10.
Imbalances and balance sheet strains had emerged even before the recent
global shocks triggered a sharp decline in economic activity (Figure 1 and Table 1).
These included overheating in property markets, low domestic saving rates, high current
account deficits, large external liabilities, rising (albeit still low) public debt, and
significant increases in the leverage of financial sector and household balance sheets.
A. Financial Institutions
11.
Banks are under pressure to deleverage. Banks’ balance sheets expanded rapidly
in the run up to the crisis. Assets relative to GDP nearly doubled over the last decade, with
growth financed disproportionately through wholesale funding. At the same time, leverage
steadily increased. Now, faced with deteriorating credit quality, large write-downs, and

12.
Financial strains have started to ease, although the situation remains far from
normal. Aggressive policy actions have largely dispelled concerns about liquidity, helping
to ease conditions in interbank term lending markets (see Annex I for a full list of the
policy measures). Some large institutions have also been able to issue unsecured debt and
fresh equity recently, suggesting improving market confidence. Nonetheless, major banks’
equity prices remain significantly below pre-crisis levels, despite a recent rebound, and
debt issuance is still largely dependent on government debt guarantee schemes. Risk
premia also indicate continued stress—spreads on bank debt, credit default swaps, term
lending, and currency swaps all remain above historical averages (Figure 2). Meanwhile,
asset-backed security markets are essentially closed.
13.
The persistence of difficult funding conditions is a symptom of lingering
concerns about the extent of potential credit losses. UK banks reported record writedowns and losses for 2008 (especially on their foreign exposures), although strong revenue
allowed some banks to return to net profit in the first quarter of 2009. Substantial further
write-downs are expected in 2009 and 2010. The government has stepped in to support
banks in distress, providing large capital injections to RBS and Lloyds. The two banks also
placed £585 billion of assets under the government’s Asset Protection Scheme, which
provides insurance against large downside risks on these assets. Nonetheless, with the weak
state of the economy, uncertainty about the extent of potential future losses in the banking
system remains high. In this environment, the building society sector is facing particular
vulnerabilities arising from a concentration in real estate lending, a strained funding model,
and limited access to new capital.

B. Households and Corporations
14.
Household balance sheets are also highly leveraged. In the run-up to the crisis
household debt increased to 175 percent of disposable income—one of the highest levels
among advanced countries (Figure 3). The rise in debt was matched by an increase in the
value of housing, pension funds, and other financial assets held by households. However,
the sharp fall of asset prices since the beginning of the crisis has eroded the value of
household portfolios. Net household wealth in the UK is estimated to have declined by
about 15 percent in 2008, and may fall further in 2009.
15.
House prices have dropped by more than 20 percent from their peak and
commercial real estate prices are down by 40 percent. So far, prices have been falling
much faster than in the previous major real estate price correction during the early 1990s
(Figure 4). Mortgage arrears and bank repossessions of properties have increased, although
they are still relatively low as a share of existing mortgages. The foreclosure rate in 2008
was only 0.35 percent, compared to 4¼ percent in the United States. Delinquency rates on
non-conforming mortgage-backed securities of the newer vintages are going up, but are
still not far above the rates on older vintages (and are much lower than the delinquency
rates on US subprime mortgages). Despite some recent positive news, forward-looking
indicators such as mortgage approvals and the sales-to-stock ratio suggest that the housing
price adjustment is yet to be completed.
16.
Consumer spending has weakened on falling wealth, rising unemployment,
and tighter credit constraints. Employment is declining, and the unemployment rate
reached 7.2 percent in the three months

Firms entered the crisis with relatively strong balance sheets, but
vulnerabilities are increasing. The rise in non-financial corporate debt over the last
decade has been moderate, and firms have held substantial liquid financial assets
(Figure 3). However, the profit outlook has deteriorated as demand continues to contract
and credit conditions remain tight. Business investment has declined steadily over the last
year, and surveys suggest that both demand for and supply of credit to corporations have
contracted. Default rates have started to rise, although from a low base. The steep fall in
commercial property prices has reduced further the net worth of corporations.
C. Macro-Financial Linkages
18.
Over the past year, adverse feedback loops developed between deteriorating
financial conditions and a weakening economy. Banks, constrained by tight capital
positions and a difficult funding environment, reduced lending to the private sector. As
house prices kept falling, the value of pensions and other financial assets declined, and job
security became elusive, consumers retrenched their spending. The decline in consumption,
in turn, reduced business profits and depressed investment, leading to further falls in
employment and income. Demand for credit also weakened as households and businesses
tried to repair their balance sheets. The actual and prospective rise in defaults and
bankruptcies has weakened further the balance sheets of banks and their ability and
willingness to restart lending.
19.
As a result, credit flows have stagnated and lending rate spreads remain high.
The monthly growth of both secured and unsecured household credit has fallen almost to
zero. A pick up in the issuance of bonds by the corporate sector in recent months has not
been sufficient to offset the net decline in business credit from banks. Indeed, the reduction
in credit growth is steeper than in previous recessions. At the same time, lending spreads
remain wide, reflecting a perception of high credit risks and increased capital costs.
Corporate bond spreads over government bonds also remain elevated (Figures 5 and 6).

D. The Public Sector Balance Sheet
20.
The financial crisis and the recession have led to a sharp deterioration of
public finances. Revenue in the UK is sensitive not only to the economic cycle, but also to
asset prices and the level of financial sector activity. The synchronized downturn of the
economic and asset price cycles led to a rapid decline in income and corporation taxes,
VAT, and asset price-related revenues. The headline deficit in 2008/09 was 6½ percent of
GDP and deficits of about 13 percent of GDP are projected for 2009 and 2010 (Table 2).
Discretionary fiscal stimulus of 2 percent of GDP is being implemented. The main
components of the stimulus package are a temporary reduction of the VAT rate, larger
personal income tax allowances and pension transfers, and advancing of planned capital
expenditure. Nonetheless, the size of the discretionary stimulus and its impact on debt
levels is small compared with the effect of automatic stabilizers and the loss of asset pricerelated revenue (Figure 7).

Public debt is rising fast. The structural fiscal position was already weak at the
onset of the crisis—government expenditure as a share of GDP has increased substantially
in the last decade, while some of the revenue strength financing the increase has proved to
be unsustainable (see chart above). Sizable fiscal deficits were recorded even as the cycle
reached its peak. The post-crisis increase in net borrowing is projected to result in a
doubling of gross general government debt over the next 5 years to about 99 percent of
GDP. 1 At the same time, contingent liabilities of the government from financial sector
interventions have increased sharply. Gross resources committed to financial sector support
measures so far have exceeded 60 percent of GDP, although the net cost to taxpayers is
likely to be much smaller (see table). 2

Based on staff’s projections (Table 6). General government gross debt refers to the consolidated gross
liabilities of the central and local governments. It includes the gross cash cost of financial sector interventions
(which are excluded from the public sector net debt unless specifically noted). Public sector net debt measures
the liabilities net of liquid assets of the general government, public corporations, and the Bank of England. A
broader measure of public sector net debt will also include the liabilities of the nationalized banks, net of liquid
assets.

The 2009 Budget assumed that the net cost of financial interventions will be 3.5 percent of GDP.

E. Sterling and the UK External Position
22.
The depreciation of sterling has helped improve the UK’s external position.
Reflecting an increased risk premium, sterling depreciated by 27 percent between mid2007 and April 2009 in real effective terms

(Annex II). The trade deficit has narrowed,

reducing the current account deficit (Figure 8

and Table 3). Moreover, with most of UK’s
large external assets (and a smaller fraction of

III. CROSS-BORDER SPILLOVERS
23.
The UK is closely integrated with the world economy, through both trade and
financial links. On the trade side, the currency depreciation and the limited dependence on
durable goods exports have helped mitigate the decline in export demand. Nonetheless,
with the global economy in a deep recession and income effects dominating the price
effects, export volumes dropped by 20 percent annualized in the last quarter of 2008 and
the first quarter of 2009. The decline in imports was equally dramatic, affecting in
particular trading partners in the euro area.

Shocks to the global financial system are quickly transmitted to the domestic
financial system. The five largest UK-owned banks are very active internationally—their
external assets exceed 200 percent of UK GDP. UK banks have substantial operations in
the United States, Western Europe, and some Asian economies, including strong linkages
with foreign financial institutions (text chart above). Developments in these economies will
continue to influence the health of the UK’s financial system. Indeed, statistical analysis
shows that the stock prices of several large UK banks are heavily affected by changes in
US banks’ equity values (more so than other large European banks, text chart below).
Conversely, shocks to the UK banking system could have spillovers across the globe (see
Box 1).

Box 1. Potential Spillovers from the UK Financial System to the Rest of the World
UK-owned banks maintain very significant global operations. Their consolidated foreign
claims stood at almost US$3.7 trillion at end-2008. Although interbank loans account for about
one quarter of these claims, UK banks also maintain a significant retail business with firms and
households abroad, through both subsidiaries and branches (mimicking the significant presence
of foreign-owned banks in the UK banking market).
A sharp deleveraging drive, therefore, presents a particular spillover threat. The final
quarter of 2008 saw a rapid trimming of overseas exposures (minus 16½ percent quarter-onquarter), most notably in the interbank market. Sharp further deleveraging of UK-owned
banks—perhaps triggered by new adverse shocks—would imply a significant withdrawal of
credit from many countries of operation. To illustrate the relative vulnerabilities, a hypothetical
across-the-board cut in UK banks’ foreign lending by 50 percent, a very harsh shock by any
historical standard, was examined.
Figure: Withdrawal of Countries’ External Credit as a Result of UK Bank Deleveraging

Source: IMF Research Department; based on BIS data as of end-December 2008.
The impact would be concentrated in Western Europe and the US, but leave few other
countries unscathed. In absolute terms, the largest effects would be felt in advanced countries
with globally integrated banking systems. Relative to domestic GDP, however, a sudden
withdrawal of UK banks’ credit would also weigh on a range of countries in Africa, Asia, and
the Middle East. Reduced external credit to these countries, in turn, could set in motion a
further deleveraging spiral.
Although a highly disruptive deleveraging is unlikely, its potential consequences heighten
the need to restore stability in the UK financial system. The scenario considered here is
illustrative. Crucially, its true global impact would depend on the nature of the underlying
claims—with curbs in balanced interbank flows ultimately less damaging than a complete exit
from overseas retail business—as well as on the speed of the credit withdrawal. Indeed, given
the large-scale support provided by the UK authorities, a large-scale disorderly unwinding of
foreign exposures should be viewed only as a tail risk. Nonetheless, the UK’s close financial
links with the rest of the world represent a key systemic vulnerability, highlighting the
importance of successful stabilization now.

23
25.
There are signs of rising financial home bias globally, adding to the drop in
credit supply in the UK. Both external claims and external liabilities of UK-owned
financial institutions have declined over the last year, partially reflecting a reduction in
cross-border interbank activity. At the same time, some foreign financial institutions have
limited or closed their operations in the UK. The withdrawal of foreign (especially
European) lenders from the UK market, combined with the drying up of global
securitization markets, has accentuated the domestic credit squeeze.

The recovery is likely to be gradual (Table 5). The UK economy entered the

25
the cumulative loss of potential output over 2008–10 could be as large as 4 to 5 percentage
points (the 2009 Budget has assumed a similar loss of output). In the medium term, the
potential growth rate may be ½ to ¾ percentage point below the pre-crisis trend growth
(see Annex III).
B. Risks and Underlying Vulnerabilities
29.
Uncertainty around the central scenario is substantial, given the
unprecedented nature of the crisis and the importance of confidence effects. The crisis
has been characterized by a wide-spread loss of confidence and a high degree of
uncertainty about the outlook. Future economic developments would depend largely on the
success of policy actions in restoring confidence and putting the financial sector on a sound
footing. The central projection reflects staff’s view on the likely outcome, based on current
policies. The risks around this projection are broadly balanced:
•

•

•

The key uncertainty is the pace and extent of adjustment of bank and household
balance sheets. The high level of household indebtedness is likely to constrain the
pace of economic recovery as consumers retrench spending to reduce debt and
rebuild savings. With the economic downturn heightening the risk of further large
credit losses, banks have tightened the supply of credit. It remains to be seen whether
the recent efforts to recapitalize banks will be sufficient to sustain credit provision at
levels required for a robust economic recovery, and whether capital market funding
can adequately compensate for shortfalls in bank loans.
On the upside, with significant monetary and fiscal stimulus in train, a successful
stabilization of the financial sector, a durable recovery of asset prices, and a fasterthan-expected pick up of global activity could restore confidence of economic agents
and set the economy on a path to rapid recovery. The large inventory decline over the
past six months could be a sign that adjustment is proceeding more rapidly than in
the baseline and robust growth could resume toward the end of 2009.
On the downside, greater-than-expected realized credit losses could result in further
deterioration of the health of the financial sector, leading to more credit contraction
and a deeper downturn. A substantial further decline of asset prices would hurt
balance sheets even more, dampening consumption, investment, employment, and
exacerbating the strains in the financial system. Meanwhile, a sharper-than-envisaged
contraction of foreign demand would lead to a further fall in exports. An increasing
home bias in financial and other services may reduce demand for UK services
abroad.

30.
Notwithstanding recent signs of stabilization, the UK economy’s resilience to
potential shocks is not yet assured. The sharp increase in public sector borrowing and
contingent government liabilities, together with continued financial sector fragility, are
significant vulnerabilities. If there was a renewed and abrupt loss of confidence, possibly
triggered from outside the UK, it could spark further financial sector instability, undermine
faith in fiscal sustainability and unhinge inflation expectations, thus disrupting domestic

26
and external stability. Although the probability of such a crisis is low, its impact could be
substantial, highlighting the need for credible and consistent policies to limit downside
risks and strengthen market confidence. The main policy priorities are:
•
•

First, continued emphasis on resolving the problems in the financial sector to support
stability and promote normalization of credit supply.
Second, setting monetary and fiscal policies consistent with a firm commitment to
the existing policy objectives of price stability and fiscal sustainability.

The authorities were in broad agreement with this assessment of vulnerabilities, but
stressed that current and planned policy actions consistent with the priorities noted above
truncate such tail risks. They noted that the effectiveness of their own efforts in these areas
would be enhanced if they are complemented by coordinated multilateral action to
rebalance global demand and achieve more sustainable external positions across countries.
V. REPAIRING THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
31.
Wide-ranging policy measures have helped forestall a systemic breakdown.
The initial rescue package in October 2008 introduced large-scale guarantees of bank
liabilities and an initial round of public capital injection in several large banks. The Bank of
England expanded the special liquidity scheme, eased collateral requirements on open
market operations, revamped its emergency lending facilities, and provided banks with
significant amounts of US dollar funding under a swap line with the US Federal Reserve.
Informed by detailed examinations and stress tests for key banks, a second set of measures,
announced in early 2009, included new capital injections and an Asset Protection Scheme
(APS), designed to ring-fence bad assets and provide contingent capital. 4 Guarantee
schemes for bank debt and asset-backed securities and support for new lending have also
been introduced.
32.
Efforts to improve liquidity and strengthen capital were complemented by
regulatory measures. A higher ceiling on retail deposit insurance was introduced in
October 2008, and a new Special Resolution Regime for dealing with failing banks was
legislated in February 2009. 5 In addition, resources for the supervision of systemically
important institutions have been increased.

4

The FSA stress test assumes a peak-to-trough fall in output of over 6 percent, unemployment rising above 12
percent, and cumulative declines in residential/commercial real estate prices of 50/60 percent.
http://www.fsa.gov.uk/pages/Library/Communication/PR/2009/068.shtml
5

Since the beginning of the crisis, two medium-sized banks have been nationalized (Northern Rock and
Bradford and Bingley). Meanwhile, two other banks (HBOS and Alliance and Leicester) and several building
societies have been taken over by stronger institutions.

27
A. Restoring Credit Flows
33.
However, the financial system may not yet be repaired to a level where banks
are ready to increase lending sufficiently to underpin a strong recovery (see Box 2).
Large uncertainties remain about the value of existing distressed assets and the adverse
impact of the recession on credit quality. Although, based on the recent stress tests, banks
are expected to continue to maintain a ratio of core tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets
above 4 percent, substantial further write-downs would lead to an erosion of capital buffers.
A considerably weaker and more prolonged recovery than currently envisaged may even
lead to renewed doubts about the adequacy of capital in individual banks. These lingering
uncertainties are restraining lending.
34.
Only sufficiently large capital buffers, if necessary provided by the
government, would enable banks to resume normal credit activities. With capital under
pressure, banks may become too risk averse and limit credit extension. Conversely, some
banks might be tempted to take on excessive risk in “a gamble for resurrection”. To
strengthen capital cushions and further mitigate risks, the authorities should:
•

Encourage banks to take advantage of improving market conditions to augment their
capital base, and also stand ready to provide further public support where needed.

•

Promote options to preserve capital cushions and improve capital structures, for
example by restraining dividends not supported by profits, and if necessary converting
preference shares to common shares.

•

Continue the development of contingency plans in the event that further shocks threaten
the stability of financial institutions. For banks with strong cross-border links, this
effort will require greater international coordination based on the Financial Stability
Board’s principles of crisis management.

The authorities explained that the main goal of recent rescue packages was to increase
capital to levels sufficient to restore stability. In choosing their actions, they had to balance
a number of sometimes conflicting objectives, such as restoring confidence, containing
taxpayers’ costs, protecting property rights, limiting the extent of government involvement
in the financial sector, and respecting European competition law. The authorities also
pointed out that stress tests do not provide a binary outcome and that the situation remains
under review, and they remain committed to taking all necessary actions to ensure stability.
35.
Detailed information should be released on the pool of assets covered by the
APS once the contracts are finalized. That should reduce uncertainty as market
participants will be able to evaluate better the balance sheet strength of institutions
participating in the scheme. With respect to management of the assets protected by the
APS, disposal through a bad bank arrangement should remain under consideration as one
of the resolution options.

28
36.
While banks go through a difficult but necessary balance sheet restructuring,
additional efforts to support credit supply are warranted in the short term. The
targeted intervention in dysfunctional credit markets through the BoE’s Asset Purchase
Box 2. Capitalization of the UK Banking System
Estimates of capital needs are inherently uncertain, depending among others on the chosen
benchmark for capital sufficiency and on macroeconomic assumptions, asset price
developments, and revenue strength. These methodological challenges are compounded by
incomplete information on balance sheet structure, asset quality, and collateral positions. With
these limitations in mind, staff has estimated UK banks’ capital needs using two different
approaches.
The April 2009 GFSR applied a top-down approach based on stylized balance sheets. The
results suggest that at end-2008 the UK banking system would need £88 billion (US$125
billion, or about 6 percent of GDP) in fresh equity to reach a target leverage ratio of 4 percent.
To complement this estimate, the UK mission team conducted a separate bottom-up analysis
considering specific loss rate scenarios for broad asset categories across individual bank
balance sheets. The median estimate of that analysis is in line with the GFSR result.
Measured against the staff’s numbers, actual capital raising from private and public sources has
fallen short. Nonetheless, the authorities are confident that there will not be a need for further
large-scale government support beyond the steps already taken: two banks, RBS and Lloyds,
received a £37 billion public capital injection in October 2008, and an additional injection of
£35 billion in nonvoting B-shares is pending in conjunction with the Asset Protection Scheme
(APS) announced in the first quarter of 2009. The authorities’ assessment is based on bank-bybank stress tests. Accordingly, all systemically relevant large UK banks will be sufficiently
capitalized to maintain a core tier 1 ratio above 4 percent even under stress over a five year
time horizon.
What accounts for the difference between staff’s estimates of capital needs and the authorities’
stress test results?
•

Capital benchmark: Staff defined target capitalization levels by a simple leverage ratio
(tangible equity over tangible assets) of 4 percent. By contrast, the FSA’s stress tests used
the core tier 1 ratio. This measure includes the APS-related B-shares as capital in the
numerator and applies risk weights to the assets in the denominator, which together raises
the capitalization ratio. Staff’s choice of a simple leverage ratio reflects a conservative
approach, given concerns about sometimes inappropriately low risk weights and limited
loss absorption provided by forms of bank capital other than equity. It also reflects
informational constraints.

29
Box 2. Capitalization of the UK Banking System (continued)
•

Impact of APS: Staff’s bottom-up estimates anticipate the explicit provision of new capital
under the APS but do not capture the contingent capital feature of the scheme. Once
contracts are finalized, the APS will protect RBS and Lloyds from extreme losses on £325
billion and £260 billion of exposures respectively, as the two banks would bear only
10 percent of losses beyond first-loss amounts of £42 billion and £35 billion.1 While this
clearly reduces the risk associated with the insured assets, staff’s estimates do not reduce
the total assets by the level of the protected assets, nor do they adjust equity for the banks’
first loss commitments.

•

Granularity of information: For its bottom-up exercise, staff used detailed bank-by-bank
information on balance sheet exposures from the largest banks’ financial statements.
However, published information did not provide in every case a very detailed breakdown
of assets into precise risk categories. These data constraints made it necessary to use
somewhat crude assumptions on loss rates in various asset classes.

•

Existing commitments: The authorities’ stress tests may give some credit for unannounced
bank plans to reduce leverage through asset divestitures or specific capital measures. Such
prospective steps are not taken into account in staff’s estimates.

Staff’s overall judgment, based on discussions with the authorities, is that capital bases now
appear strong enough to avert a renewed systemic crisis. Nevertheless, uncertainty remains
about the speed and strength of recovery. A particularly slow or weak recovery has the
potential to cycle back on funding and credit conditions, which may reintroduce doubts about
bank capital levels. There is a case, therefore, for erring on the side of caution and seeking a
further strengthening of banks’ capital positions. Larger capital cushions will also afford
greater lending capacity to underpin the economic recovery.
_______________________________

First loss amounts are inclusive of existing provisions.

Facility is welcome. Lending guarantee schemes are also appropriate as long as they are
designed to support viable new lending. In the current circumstances, bank-specific lending
commitments, as envisaged by the authorities, can serve as a useful coordination device to
avert a credit crunch, provided there are safeguards to ensure that new lending is done on
commercial terms and under sound risk management practices.
37.
More generally, measures should be geared at facilitating orderly deleveraging
of balance sheets, rather than preventing the necessary adjustment. It is important to
acknowledge that financial sector activity and lending growth may not revert to their precrisis pace for some time, if at all.
B. Regulatory Response
38.
Beyond the short-term firefighting, the crisis has highlighted the need for
strengthening the UK’s prudential framework. The UK’s approach was premised on the

30
belief that markets are in general self-correcting, with market discipline and the
responsibility of senior management of firms to manage risks being more effective tools
than regulation or supervisory oversight, dubbed by some as a “light-touch” approach.
Recognizing the deficiencies of this approach, the FSA has moved to more aggressive,
hands-on supervision. The funding of the FSA has been strengthened and greater resources
are allocated to the assessment of large financial institutions and the evaluation of systemic
risk.
39.
The new Special Resolution Regime will facilitate interventions in troubled
financial institutions. The February 2009 Banking Act provides the legal framework for
expeditious resolution of failing financial institutions (including large cross-border banks).
Its effectiveness will require timely and comprehensive information sharing among the
tripartite authorities. The increased reliance on stress tests as a tool for higher frequency
evaluation of individual banks and the financial system resilience is welcome.
40.
The Turner Review represents an important contribution to the international
debate on reform of the regulatory and oversight system for financial institutions. The
Review appropriately calls for higher capital requirements within a risk-based capital
framework for trading book and off-balance sheet assets and for the introduction of a
maximum leverage ratio as a backstop against excessive growth in balance sheets. The
proposed strengthening of liquidity supervision, with a special emphasis on stress tests
covering system-wide risks, is also appropriate. These measures should be complemented
by the development of new macro-prudential instruments to mitigate the amplitude of the
credit cycle and reduce feedback loops between the financial sector and the real economy.
In addition, as emphasized in the Review, regulatory and supervisory coverage should
follow the principle of economic substance, not legal form. Regulators should have
expanded powers to gather information on all significant financial institutions (including
hedge funds) to allow assessment of overall system-wide risks.
41.
Improved disclosure practices would reduce uncertainty and strengthen
market discipline and public surveillance. Specifically, there would be merit in
increasing the coverage and frequency of financial reporting on banks’ finances. The UK
lags behind a number of G-20 countries in this area (see text table). Financial institutions
should be encouraged to provide comparable and more comprehensive disclosure of
financial results at quarterly intervals (RBS released an interim management statement in
the first quarter of 2009, which could serve as an example of good quarterly disclosure for
other banks). Over the medium term, the authorities should consider publishing noncommercially sensitive bank-by-bank regulatory financial information, also at quarterly
intervals. Such increased transparency would improve consistency and comparability of
financial reporting that will facilitate monitoring of risks by investors and counterparties.
The FSA pointed out that increased disclosure entails costs that have to be weighed against
the potential benefits.

Special emphasis should be given to working with international partners to
strengthen cross-border financial stability arrangements. This will require continued
collaboration on the development of effective arrangements for crisis management and
orderly exit of cross-border banks, including accelerated efforts to establish a dedicated
resolution framework for the EU’s cross-border banks. In addition, working with partner
countries to implement quickly the proposed ambitious overhaul of the EU’s regulatory and
supervisory arrangements is a priority. 6 Securing adequate resources, effective decisionmaking mechanisms, independence for the new institutions, and an unconstrained flow of
information among the various bodies will be essential for the effectiveness of the proposed
new architecture.
VI. MONETARY POLICY IN UNCONVENTIONAL TERRITORY
A. The Outlook for Inflation
43.
Inflation is set to continue falling and remain below target for some time.
Although 12-month CPI inflation is currently still slightly above the 2-percent target, it is
projected to fall to 1 percent later in 2009 as domestic energy cost pressures ease and rising
spare capacity weakens firms’ pricing power and workers’ wage demands (Figure 9).
6

Specific suggestions along those lines are discussed in more detail in the forthcoming Staff Report for the
2009 Article IV Consultation with member countries of the euro area.

Looking further ahead, the expected slow recovery should keep inflation below target for
an extended period. However, as noted in the May 2009 Inflation Report, the outlook is
subject to significant uncertainties. On the one hand, experience from historical banking
crises suggests the possibility of even more protracted disinflation if very weak demand
conditions persist. A slip into outright deflation is unlikely but cannot be ruled out in this
case. 7 On the other hand, there are some upside risks, related to the pass-through of
exchange rate weakness and a stronger-than-expected rebound in global commodity prices.

B. Launching Unconventional Easing Operations
44.
Against this backdrop, the Bank of England has adopted an aggressive
monetary strategy, including the launch of unconventional easing operations.
•

Bank Rate was reduced by a cumulative 450 basis points to 0.5 percent between
October 2008 and March 2009. This level is expected to mark the floor for policy
rates, as the MPC views lower rates as potentially counterproductive: many retail
lending products are indexed to Bank Rate, and with deposit rates already close to
zero, further Bank Rate cuts would squeeze lenders’ interest margins and possibly
further tighten credit supply.

•

With Bank Rate at its lower bound, the MPC moved to “quantitative easing” (QE) in
March 2009. Under this policy, the BoE is on course to buy £125 billion in assets
through its Asset Purchase Facility—out of £150 billion initially authorized by the
Treasury—within five months, financed by an expansion of base money. The

7

One traditional measure of UK inflation, the Retail Price Index (RPI), has actually dipped into negative
territory in recent months. However, this is largely accounted for by the sharp drop in mortgage interest rates,
which are included as a proxy for housing costs in the RPI but not the CPI.

34
purchases are concentrated on long-term gilts, reflecting the Bank’s goal to inject
large amounts of liquidity into private portfolios without assuming credit risk.
However, the BoE is also buying selected high-quality private assets, notably
commercial paper and corporate bonds, with a view to improving the functioning of
these markets. The overall volume of purchases is quantitatively important in relation
to the initial monetary base (some £90 billion) as well as the stock of relevant assets
outstanding (see also Annex IV for an international perspective on central bank asset
purchases).

However, it is yet too early to judge the effectiveness of QE. In principle, the
significant liquidity injection should induce investors to rebalance their portfolios, thus
lifting asset valuations, generating positive wealth effects, and facilitating new issuance.
Targeted purchases of private assets can complement these effects by directly reducing
excessive risk premia and reviving market activity. The initial evidence has been
moderately encouraging as gilt yields have remained low since the launch of QE, despite
the countervailing effect of large new government debt issuance. Meanwhile, spreads on
commercial paper and corporate bonds have narrowed, amid a broader recovery of asset
prices. It remains to be seen, however, whether these effects will be sufficiently strong and
lasting to generate the desired rise in aggregate demand. This uncertainty strengthens the
case for further diversifying the BoE’s asset purchases, especially by targeting private
credit markets that are currently dysfunctional but deemed to be viable in the long run. The
BoE noted that efforts in this direction were underway but that setting up appropriate
facilities took time. In mid-June, it announced its intention to start buying certain types of
asset-backed commercial paper.

C. Addressing Risks
47.
The success of QE rests on the BoE’s capacity to keep monetary policy strictly
focused on price stability. In this regard, the prudent setup of the Asset Purchase Facility,
which operates as a separate legal entity under comprehensive indemnity assurances from
the Treasury, is welcome. This arrangement protects the integrity of the BoE’s balance
sheet, a key prerequisite for independent monetary policy. In the same vein, it is reassuring
that Treasury approval will not be required for the MPC to stop or unwind asset purchases
in the future. This puts the MPC in a strong position to determine and implement an exit
from QE as appropriate to meet the inflation target. To be sure, timing the exit will be a
difficult judgment call, requiring vigilance in monitoring trends in monetary aggregates and
inflation expectations. However, the exit should not pose major technical challenges as the
BoE can rely on a combination of asset sales, other liquidity-draining operations, and
higher interest rates. Clear communication by the BoE of its thinking on these aspects of
QE would further underpin market confidence.
48.
At a more fundamental level, trust in the BoE’s operational independence
hinges on the stability of public finances. Despite the prudent institutional setup of the
Asset Purchase Facility, some observers have voiced concerns about a conflation of fiscal
and monetary policies. Large-scale gilt purchases, in particular, risk being perceived as a
slippery slope toward monetization of the UK’s widening fiscal deficits. Countering such
concerns, the government has reaffirmed its commitment to price stability, most recently in
renewing the MPC’s remit with respect to the 2-percent inflation target. However, to
remove residual doubts and preserve full confidence in the UK’s policy frameworks, sound
communication and implementation of monetary policy ultimately needs to be underpinned
by a sustainable path of fiscal policy.
VII. RESTORING FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY
49.
The challenge facing the Treasury is to revitalize the financial sector and
support the economy, while committing credibly to long-term fiscal sustainability.
With the private sector focused on raising savings and mending balance sheets, the
government has the task of facilitating and smoothing the adjustment. This is not an easy
task. The fiscal balance has deteriorated sharply and substantial deficits are projected for
the medium term. In addition, contingent liabilities of the government from financial sector
interventions have increased sharply. Against this background, the measured temporary
fiscal stimulus implemented in the 2008 Pre-Budget Report and the 2009 Budget, together
with free operation of the automatic stabilizers, is appropriate.
50.
The 2009 Budget acknowledged transparently the scale of deterioration of the
fiscal position. Of particular note, it comes to the conservative judgment that the structural
component of the deficit is almost 10 percent of GDP, or about four-fifths of the total
deficit in 2009/10 (Table 2 and text table). The authorities and staff agreed that, with asset

37
prices and the level of financial activity likely to remain subdued in the medium term, some
of the reduction in the revenue-to-output ratio is likely to persist even after the economy
recovers. The budget envisaged a moderate consolidation, which would bring the
cyclically-adjusted current account into balance by 2017/18. Net public sector debt is
projected to peak in 2013/14, consistent with the temporary operating rule. 8 However, as
acknowledged in the budget, there are substantial risks around the projected medium term
fiscal path (Annex V). As bond yields tend to increase with debt levels, the burden of debt
service may rise by more than expected. Should the recovery be slower than forecast, or
should potential output fall more than envisaged, reducing the deficit would be even more
challenging. Finally, potential losses from government guarantees and other contingent
liabilities pose risks to the baseline debt projection, offset in part by the assumption that
there is no recovery on past capital injections over the projection period.

Despite the rise in net borrowing, rollover risks are limited by the long average
maturity of the public debt. The stock of UK debt has an average maturity of 14 years,
higher than most OECD countries. Nonetheless, gross financing needs of the general
government could reach 16 percent of GDP in 2009/10. 9 The Debt Management Office has

The temporary operating rule adopted in Pre-Budget 2008 aims “to set policies to improve the balance on the
cyclically-adjusted current budget every year, once the economy emerges from the downturn, so it reaches balance
and debt is falling as a proportion of GDP once the global shocks have worked their way through the economy in
full."
9

Standard and Poor’s lowered its outlook on UK public debt from stable to negative in May 2009, citing the
prospect of debt reaching very high levels, even after factoring in some fiscal tightening. In the press release, it
was noted that further rating action would depend on the credibility of the next government’s fiscal
consolidation plans.

Going forward, a strong commitment to medium-term fiscal consolidation is
crucial. Indeed, the success of the current policy package hinges on the trust of the public
in the solvency of the government. Should fiscal sustainability come into question, interest
rates would rise despite monetary easing efforts, the ability of the government to provide
support to the financial sector would be severely limited, and pressures on the currency
could emerge. To limit such risks and increase resilience to shocks, the authorities need to
commit to a credible plan to reverse the deterioration of the fiscal position in the medium
term and build a broad public consensus around a concrete consolidation plan. Restoring
fiscal sustainability should be supported by the following steps:
•

Once the economic recovery is established, a more ambitious fiscal adjustment should
be implemented. The focus of this adjustment should be to put public debt on a firmly
downward path faster than envisaged in the 2009 budget. In the current framework,
public debt can reach very high levels while the temporary fiscal rule is still satisfied. It
would be appropriate to put greater emphasis on stabilizing the debt at a relatively low
level within a reasonable time frame. This will require a significant fiscal effort. For
example, based on staff’s projection, achieving general government gross debt of
90 percent of GDP by 2014/15 (compared to 100 percent of GDP in the baseline) would
require 1½ percentage points average improvement in the cyclically-adjusted overall
balance per year (compared to ¾ percentage points in the baseline). The authorities
noted that the fiscal adjustment path would be reassessed as economic circumstances
change.

•

The adjustment paths outlined above are illustrative examples. More important than a
specific medium-term fiscal goal is the credibility of consolidation plans. Credibility
would be enhanced by providing greater clarity on the specific revenue and expenditure
measures to achieve the needed adjustment. The emphasis in current plans to weigh the

39
•

adjustment toward expenditure reduction is appropriate in light of international
experience that expenditure-based consolidations are more durable (Box 3), although
given the size of the adjustment, revenue measures would also be necessary. The
forthcoming Comprehensive Spending Review would provide an opportunity for
committing to concrete expenditure measures.

•

Any upside surprises to growth or revenue should be used to reduce deficits more
aggressively.

•

Interventions in the financial sector should be unwound gradually, with a goal of
minimizing market disruptions and taxpayers’ costs.

•

Long-term sustainability would
be strengthened by implementing
structural reforms to address the
rising costs related to
demographic change, especially
in health care.

Box 3. Fiscal Adjustment: International Experience
The timing, speed and size of fiscal adjustment are important for its success.1 In
general, fiscal adjustment following a recession should coincide with the beginning
economic expansion to avoid contractionary first-round effects, and be coordinated
with other macroeconomic policies. Frontloading adjustment increases credibility and
reduces overall fiscal costs. The magnitude of the required adjustment is typically
linked to the amount necessary to achieve a fiscally sustainable position.
Empirical analysis suggests that the success of fiscal adjustment relates to its
composition, initial conditions, and institutional factors. Econometric evidence
from OECD countries2 shows that although changes in revenue and expenditure
contribute to closing the fiscal gap, expenditure restraint brings about longer lasting
and larger adjustment episodes, which are more successful in achieving a debtstabilizing fiscal position. Expenditure reduction demonstrates a firmer commitment to
feasible and substantial consolidation, and may trigger lower interest rates and boost
private demand. Large initial imbalances and high interest rates are also associated
with sizeable adjustments. Finally, fiscal rules have been shown to contribute to
successful adjustments, and elections tend to increase the likelihood of entering a
consolidation episode.

Annex I. Selected Policy Measures in Response to the Crisis since July 2008 1
Liquidity Support
…to alleviate funding market strains
•

Expanded the size and frequency of BoE’s long-term repo operations, and the range of
eligible collateral to boost banks’ access to term funding

•

Introduced the Discount Window Facility (DWF) as a permanent liquidity insurance
facility for the banking system.

•

Extended the drawdown period for the Special Liquidity Scheme (a T bills-illiquid asset
swap program), and lengthened the DWF’s maximum maturity to 364 days (in addition
to the standard option to draw for 30 days) upon the closure of SLS’s drawdown window
in January 2009. A total of £185 billion of T bills were lent through the SLS.

•

Established an unlimited US dollar swap line with the Federal Reserve to relieve
pressure in the US dollar funding markets. The swap line arrangement is in place until
February 2010.

Financial Sector Assistance
...to boost banks’ capital and foster confidence
•

Provided up to £78.1 billion in capital injections in Lloyds/HBOS and RBS (including
£22.1 billion in the banks’ payment of shares as fees for asset insurance). The
government has taken significant voting stakes in the banks. Lloyds has since repaid
£2.3 billion to the government.

•

Set up Asset Protection Scheme to insure banks, for a fee, against excessive losses on
troubled assets for at least 5 years. Participating banks will fully absorb the first loss, and
the Treasury will absorb 90 percent of any remaining losses. So far, RBS and Lloyds
have placed a total of £585 billion of assets under the scheme. As part of the agreement,
the two banks have committed to increasing their lending.

•

Clarified FSA’s minimum capital ratio benchmark and disclosed key stress test
assumptions to increase transparency of FSA’s supervisory requirements.

•

Enacted temporary short sale ban (in the four months to January 2009) on banking and
other financial firm stocks.

...to support credit flows and private-sector assets
1

Prepared by MK Tang.

46
•

Introduced Credit Guarantee Scheme by the Treasury to provide guarantees for
unsecured bank debts for up to five years (including rollover), and Asset-Backed
Securities Guarantee Scheme to insure investors against credit and extension risks of
new issues of AAA-rated UK RMBS.

•

Launched program to purchase high-quality private sector assets. Under the Asset
Purchase Facility, the BoE may buy up to £50 billion of private assets, including
investment-grade sterling commercial paper and corporate bonds

•

Reversed decision to run down Northern Rock’s mortgage book in an effort to support
mortgage lending. Northern Rock will now increase mortgage lending by up to £14
billion in 2009 and 2010.

Resolution and Prudential Measures
...to resolve failing banks
•

Resolved Bradford & Bingley, promptly transferring its branch network and retail
deposit book to another bank to ensure undisrupted access by depositors, while the
remaining parts of the business were taken into temporary public ownership.

•

Expedited a merger between Lloyds and HBOS.

...to fortify the prudential framework
•

Raised the ceiling of retail deposit guarantee to £50,000 from £35,000. Prefunding the
insurance scheme (FSCS) with levies on the industry remains an option.

•

Introduced the Special Resolution Regime, a permanent regime to deal with failing
banks. The BoE can make independent recommendations to the FSA regarding
triggering the resolution regime.

•

Introduced a new capital instrument, Profit Participating Deferred Shares (PPDS), to
allow building societies to raise core tier 1 capital from external sources.

•

Phasing in significant reforms to FSA’s regulatory approach, notably strengthening
liquidity and capital requirements on banks

•

Strengthened through legislation the BoE’s role in maintaining financial stability.

Monetary Policy Actions
...to ease monetary conditions
•

Reduced policy rates rapidly to a historical low of 0.5 percent.

47
•

Flexibly adjusted the operational arrangements of the standing facilities (the width of
the interest rate corridor between the facilities and of the target range of reserves
balance) to allow more effective implementation of monetary policy objectives.

•

Introduced unconventional monetary policy. In March, the BoE began unsterilized
purchase of assets (£125 billion planned until July). Gilts of 5-25 year maturities
constitute a majority of the purchase.

Macroeconomic Stabilization Efforts
...to lift domestic demand
•

Adopted a fiscal stimulus package of about 2 percent of GDP, implemented over 20082010. Key measures included a 13-month VAT reduction (from 17.5 to 15 percent),
advancing infrastructure investment, and various tax incentives for businesses. The twin
fiscal rules have been suspended and replaced with a more flexible temporary operating
rule.

•

Introduced subsidies to companies hiring jobless people (“golden hellos”). Subsidies are
expected to total about £500 million.

•

Provided a job offer, work-focused training or work experience to every 18-24 year old
who has been claiming unemployment benefit for 12 months.

…to provide relief to distressed homeowners
•

Encouraged banks to more widely pursue mortgage workouts and avoid repossessions.

•

Provided guarantees for deferred mortgage interest payments by distressed
borrowers for up to 2 years. Contingent liability associated with the Homeowners
Support Mortgage Scheme is estimated at £1 billion.

•

Extended stamp duty holiday for all houses up to £175,000.

… to provide support for businesses:
•

Introduced a trade credit insurance scheme, various credit guarantee schemes (e.g., the
Working Capital Scheme), and a £750 million Strategic Investment Fund to support
investment.

The steep depreciation of sterling in the last two years followed a period of growing
external imbalances. In the context of robust capital inflows—including due to central
banks’ increased accumulation of sterling-denominated assets, strong domestic demand, and
declining investment income, the UK’s current account deficit had swelled to 3½ percent of
GDP and net liabilities

UK’s net investment position swiftly rose to 6 percent of GDP at end-2008.
The dramatic scale and rapidity of the external adjustment in part reflect the broad
shifts in the trend of global capital flows. Increases in market volatility and pressure to
deleverage since the outbreak of the crisis have led to a general repricing of currencies of
high-external deficit, high-interest rate countries. Furthermore, the retrenchment of cross110

More generally, the premium required to compensate for the risk of sterling appears to
have risen sharply amid heightened global risk aversion, and weighed heavily on the
currency. The Bank of England has been engaged in aggressive monetary easing efforts
since October 2008. But as the recent issues of the Bank of England’s Inflation Report point
out, the resulting reduction in interest rate differentials between sterling and other major
currencies is unlikely to fully account for the subsequent fall in the currency. Meanwhile,
market perceptions of risk of the sterling exchange rate appear to closely track the global
investment sentiment. Until the recent improvement in the financial market conditions, the
exchange rate risk—as measured by market instruments—had been elevated and significantly
tilted to the downside. Such unfavorable risk assessments by the market likely pushed up
sterling’s risk premium and contributed to the currency’s weakness.

intermediating most of the cross-border capital flows. Such a financing structure
leaves the UK’s external position vulnerable to exchange rate fluctuations, and may
lead to a deeper feedback loop between banking sector strains and capital inflow
retrenchment.

Second, the public sector is expected to become an increasingly large net debtor, even
though the UK’s aggregate net liabilities have fallen. The projected sizable rise in
government borrowing, the considerable contingent liabilities from the banking
sector, and the lack of full clarity about the future fiscal consolidation path pose risks
to confidence in the public sector’s debt sustainability.

There are two important caveats in interpreting the data. First, the balance of payments data on which the chart
is based are not consolidated on the firm-level basis—a large portion of the external FX assets and liabilities
shown in the data may represent intra-firm transactions, and the actual inter-firm position may be much smaller.
Second, many UK-resident banks may have access to FX liquidity support from foreign central banks through
their overseas units.

3

Notably, official FX liquidity assistance to a bank is contingent upon its ability to produce eligible collaterals,
which may become scarce in times of severe banking strains.

The value of sterling appears to be currently broadly in line with the fundamentals.
Multilaterally consistent estimates, using the IMF’s CGER methodology, indicate that an
external current account deficit of 2½ percent of GDP would be consistent with the UK’s
structural economic factors. The April 2009 CGER exercise—based on March REER—

Annex III. Assessing the Impact of the Financial Crisis on Potential Growth 1
The deep and protracted financial crisis is likely to reduce the UK economy’s potential
to grow, in both the near and medium terms. In the near term, key factors that would hamper
potential supply include:
•

a slower rate of net capital accumulation (including due to more rapid capital scrapping
reflecting forced discontinuation of ongoing capital projects);

•

a likely decline in migrant worker inflows (in response to the UK’s dimmer employment
outlook and the dramatic sterling depreciation);

•

a possible decrease in the labor participation rate due to dropout of discouraged job
seekers, and a rise in the structural unemployment rate caused by shifts in the sectoral
composition of the economy;

•

increased technological frictions (e.g., less efficient transfers of assets, scarcer financing
of R&D investments) resulting from severe strains in credit flows; and

•

a loss of labor skills arising from prolonged unemployment.

Even in the medium term when the cyclical fluctuations in the factor markets have
dissipated, the ongoing adjustment in certain sectors—notably the financial sector—are
likely to have an enduring impact on economy-wide productivity and potential supply. In a
recent paper based on the experiences of OECD countries, for instance, Furceri and
Mourougane (2009) find that a severe financial crisis appears to lower potential output by 4
percent on average, with the loss spread over several years. 2
Although there are multiple methodologies for estimating potential growth, this annex
relies on a simple production function approach to focus on structural factors.
Specifically, the likely changes in the factor markets due to the current crisis are first
evaluated quantitatively. Estimates are then made on the effects of possible financial sector
shrinkage on the growth residual—taking into account both the direct impact and the
associated spillover implications for the rest of the economy. Finally, these factors are
aggregated into a range of probable estimates on the UK’s potential growth in the near and
medium term.
The main objective of this annex is to present an illustrative quantification of the key
factors relevant for potential supply, rather than providing a definitive assessment on the

Evidence from OECD Countries.” OECD Economics Department Working Papers No. 699.

53
UK’s future growth potential. With many determining factors still in flux, the estimates are
tentative and subject to substantial uncertainty.
Simple Production Function Approach
A production function approach provides a structural mapping of the input factors and
the growth residual into a potential growth estimate. Before the outbreak of the crisis,
historical data suggested that potential growth was about 2¾ percent—with the labor, capital
stock, and growth residual components contributing approximately ¾ , ½ , and 1½
percentage points, respectively. 3
A. Productive capital stock
Due to both demand uncertainly, credit tightening, and abrupt structural shifts, gross
productive investments are expected to fall rapidly and capital scrapping is likely to occur at
a faster pace. The rate of net capital stock accumulation is hence likely to slow sharply in the
near term. Comparing to the pre-crisis estimate of 2¼ percent, net growth of capital stock is
currently projected to decline to 1¼ percent in 2008 and to 0 percent in 2010, before slowly
rising to 1 percent in 2014.
B. Labor supply
Reflecting past sterling depreciation and dimmer employment prospects, the current
downward trend of migrant worker inflows is likely to persist in the near term. 4 The exercise
assumes that migrant worker inflows will decline in line with the expected increase in the
unemployment rate. The annual net migrant worker inflows would then fall to 0.2 percent of
the workforce in 2010 from the pre-crisis estimate of 0.6 percent of the workforce, before
rebounding as the unemployment rate recedes. Moreover, a likely decline in the labor
participation rate and increase in the structural component of the unemployment rate—due to
prolonged unemployment and skill mismatch—would further reduce the labor factor’s
contributions to potential growth.
C. Growth residual and financial sector adjustment
(i) Direct impact of financial sector retrenchment
The UK’s financial sector had been a strong economic driver, making significant
contribution to the “growth residual” of the overall economy in recent years. Indeed, the UK
ranks near the top among the advanced economies in terms of the pace of growth of the
financial sector.

A simple Cobb-Douglas model with a labor share of 0.7 and capital share of 0.3 is assumed.

The number of migrant workers from new Eastern European EU member states dropped by 35 percent in the
four quarters to Q1 2009, compared to the previous year.

to 3¾ percent of total gross value added. 5

Looking ahead, with the ongoing crisis casting doubt on the sustainability of the existing
business models as well as the past gains, the financial sector is likely to go through a
protracted adjustment that would impinge on both its importance to the economy and its
future growth rates. The associated consequences for the overall potential supply would
depend upon, among other factors, the extent to which the financial sector’s non-labor inputs
can retain their productive value and continue to provide the kind of growth impetus to the
overall economy as before, and how completely worker skills can be transferred from the
financial sector to other industries. 6

5

The financial sector’s net operating surplus (i.e., after deduction of fixed capital consumption) has risen by a
similar amount, from ¾ percent of total gross value added in 2000 to 3¼ percent in 2007.

6

In real terms, on average between 2000 and 2007, the financial sector grew 3¼ percentage points per year
faster than the overall economy—with most of the growth differential accounted for by non-labor inputs. Given
a weight of about 7 percent of the economy, a drop in growth rates of the financial sector to the economy-wide

55
(ii) Spillover implications for the rest of the economy
Explicit consideration of the financial sector’s linkage to other industries provides a
perspective to assess the potential effects of the sector’s adjustment on the rest of the
economy. The literature suggests that to the extent that financial development generates
positive spillovers to the rest of the economy, the fortune of those industries that are more
reliant on external finance would tend to depend more heavily on the strength of the financial
sector.
6

For the UK, the data suggests that this
channel of financial spillovers indeed
appears to be present. While on the
aggregate level there has not been a
systematic rise in the output growth of nonfinancial industries (after adjusting for
employment) over the past few years, a
sectoral decomposition reveals that
industries that are more dependent on
external finance tend to grow more rapidly
as the UK’s financial sector expands.

Specifically, a simple exercise is carried out first to categorize the UK’s 21 main industries
into two groups according to their intrinsic dependence on external finance. Then the two
groups’ growth performances are assessed in relation to the financial sector’s, after adjusting
for each industry’s unobserved fixed factors. 7 Results show that growth of the external
finance-dependent industries is significantly correlated with the financial sector’s growth. 8
By contrast—in an indication that the finding is unlikely driven by spurious relationships—
no such correlation is found for the UK’s less external finance-dependent industries.

average would imply roughly a fall of ¼ percentage point in the overall economic growth. Potential errors in
measuring the past price deflator of financial sector output, however, might bias the result.
7

The industry-level measure of external finance dependence is taken from De Serres, A., S. Kobayakawa, T.
Slok, and L. Vartia (2006) "Regulation of Financial Systems and Economic Growth." OECD Economics
Department Working Papers No. 506. They extend the methodology in Rajan, R. and L. Zingales (1998)
"Financial Dependence and Growth." American Economic Review vol. 88(3), pp. 559-86 to include services
industries and update the measure with more recent date.

8

In particular, a 1 percentage point increase in financial sector growth appears to raise growth of external
finance-dependent industries by 0.6 percentage point on average.

2/ Average growth of all external finance-dependent industries

Based the observed linkage of the financial sector with the external finance-dependent
industries, a 1 percentage point reduction in financial sector growth is estimated to translate
into approximately a ¼ percentage point decline in the output growth of the other industries. 9
Over a long horizon, though, the composition of the economy may shift (in favor of less
external-dependent industries) in response to the downsizing of the financial sector, possibly
reducing the negative impact of the decreased financial spillovers on the rest of the economy.
D. Aggregated impacts on potential growth
Overall, taking together the prospective impact on the capital stock, the labor supply, as well
as the direct and indirect effects of financial sector retrenchment on the growth residual, a
range of probable scenarios suggest a fall in potential growth to ¼ to 1¼ percent in the near
term, before a subsequent pickup to around 1¾ to 2¼ percent in the medium term.

While no explicit attempts are made to separate the effect on the growth residual from that on the factor inputs
of the nonfinancial sectors, the latter effect is likely small at the (annual) frequency on which the result is based.

57
Uncertainty around the estimates
The assumed economic relationships could be mis-specified. Generally, parameters
underlying potential growth estimation are derived from historical observations. In times of
significant regime change—as in the current circumstances—there are obvious risks that past
observations can no longer provide valid economic inferences .
Uncertainty around the estimates is further amplified by the fact that many key factors
affecting potential supply are still very much in flux. For instance, as the crisis is still
evolving, the ultimate extent of the economic downturn and the financial sector
transformation are not yet clear. Also, as an open economy, the UK’s potential supply is
strongly influenced by the likely changes in other major economies’ own growth potential.
Furthermore, there are risks that the fast deteriorating fiscal outlook would adversely affect
potential growth through its impact on long-term interest rates, although so far this channel
appears muted.

58
Annex IV. Central Bank Asset Purchases in a Cross-Country Perspective 1
Central bank balance sheets have expanded significantly since the beginning of the
financial crisis. At end-May 2009, the total assets of Fed, BoE, and ECB were between 45–
170 percent above pre-crisis levels, despite some decline from their October 2008 peaks.
Balance sheets have grown as central banks have provided unparalleled amounts of liquidity
to the financial system, created new funding facilities, and, in some cases, started outright
asset purchases. Although some of the extra liquidity has been absorbed through offsetting
open market operations, monetary bases have also increased considerably. The Bank of Japan
marks the only outlier among the major central banks, having seen only a modest increase in
its balance sheet so far.

Recently launched asset purchase programs are further boosting balance sheets, most
notably at the Fed and BoE. All major central banks have set out programs to purchase
selected financial assets, aiming for some combination of improved market liquidity, higher
asset prices, increased new issuance, and a greater money supply. The Fed’s program is the
most ambitious in terms of volume and reach, providing for large-scale purchases of private,
public, and quasi-public (agency) debt instruments—on top of massive funding support for
other investors’ asset purchases, notably under the US$ 1,000 billion Term Asset-Backed
Securities Loan Facility. The BoE’s Asset Purchase Facility ranks second in terms of relative
size. The Bank of Japan, in turn, has announced comparatively limited asset purchases, but is
the only major central bank to also buy equities (from Japanese banks). Lastly, prospective
ECB asset purchases are relatively small-scale and likely to be at least partly sterilized.
The cross-sectional variation in the scale and nature of asset purchases arguably
reflects different economic circumstances as well as specific judgments about the costs
and benefits of these operations. In principle, central bank asset purchases would be
expected to be larger, the stronger the perceived need for monetary stimulus going beyond
low policy rates; the more favorably the central bank assesses their expansionary impact
compared to other unconventional policy tools, such as communication about future policy

rates or extended-term refinancing operations; and the less they are seen as posing risks to
the operational independence of the central bank. The composition of asset purchases, in
turn, will likely mirror differences in the size of private capital markets as well as different
central bank attitudes toward credit risk.

3/ Purchases of agency (Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac/Ginnie Mae) bonds and agency-guaranteed bonds account for an additional 64.1 percent of total
purchases thus far.

While conducting asset purchases at a large scale, the BoE has pursued a cautious
approach with respect to credit risk. This is apparent from (i) its strong focus on
government bonds, which account for more than 95 percent of all purchases so far; (ii) the
targeting of only high-quality private sector assets; and (iii) the design of its private asset
purchases as a mere backstop for private market activity: the BoE undertakes to buy at
spreads that are calibrated to be above “normal” but below distressed levels, implying a
decline in purchases as market conditions have normalized in recent weeks. The BoE’s
conservative approach is noteworthy, as it coincides with exemplary protection against
balance sheet risk, i.e., through explicit, comprehensive, and ex ante indemnity assurances
from the fiscal authority. Thus, the BoE’s operations are designed not only to limit financial
damage to its balance sheet—a concern that circumscribes the room for maneuver in all
central banks bent on preserving operational independence—but also to contain reputational
risk and avoid assuming quasi-fiscal responsibilities, such as providing (implicit) subsidies to
private agents.
At the same time, the relative effectiveness of government bond purchases is an open
question. One important channel for central bank asset purchases to affect economic activity
is by directly boosting asset valuations, or reducing market interest rates. The BoE’s gilt
purchases are very sizeable relative to the initial stock outstanding in the targeted segment
(text chart), suggesting some potential to affect prices. However, yields can ultimately fall on
a sustained basis only (i) if the central bank convinces agents to expect a lower path of future

60
short-term rates or (ii) if risk premia representing liquidity, term, or credit risk come down.
Large-scale buying of gilts could be construed as an implicit statement about future shortterm rates, thus aiming for the same expectational effects as the Fed’s explicit

trade-off.

Annex V. Public Debt Sustainability 1
The UK’s public debt indicators were favorable at the outset of the crisis (Figure A1).
Debt levels in the UK were below the average of European peers and the debt portfolio is
characterized by long maturities and minimal rollover amounts. A broad range of debt
instruments and placement mechanisms is available to ensure successful funding of
government operations.
However, general government gross debt is projected to increase from 43 percent of
GDP in 2007/08 to about 100 percent of GDP by 2014/15. The baseline scenario for this
debt sustainability analysis builds on staff’s central scenario and focuses on general
government gross debt (see Box A1). The primary deficit will peak at 11.1 percent of GDP in
2009/10, premised on the adjustment path outlined in Budget 2009, and is forecast to decline
gradually to 1.4 percent of GDP by 2015/16, when it reaches the debt stabilizing level (Table
A1). Gross financing needs in the near term are high—they are expected to reach 18 percent
of GDP in 2010/11, driven by the high overall deficit, amortization, and an increased share of
short term debt.
Alternative scenarios and bound tests highlight the uncertainties surrounding the
projected debt path (Figure A2a). Higher interest rates, different growth scenarios, and
assumptions on primary balances as outlined below significantly affect debt outcomes.
Customized bound tests further show the debt dynamics resulting from the recognition of
contingent liabilities, unwinding existing financial sector interventions, and additional bank
recapitalization. In particular:
• Interest rate. Real interest rates in the baseline scenario are assumed to average 1.5
percent over the projection period, reflecting the current low interest rate environment.
Nonetheless, interest expenditure is projected to rise significantly as a share of total
expenditure. Should real interest rates increase above the historical average of 3.2 and
reach 3.5 percent, debt would increase to 108 percent of GDP by 2014/15, some 8
percentage points of GDP above the baseline.
• Growth. Assuming expenditure plans remain unchanged, the debt-to-GDP ratio could
reach 109 percent of GDP by 2014/15 should growth be ½ percentage point lower each
year. Likewise, under a more favorable upside growth scenario (½ percentage point
higher each year) the debt-to-GDP ratio could fall to 96 percent.
• Contingent liabilities. Losses on guarantees issued to support the financial sector during
2008/09 could increase debt by 7 percent of GDP, assuming that net losses total 14
percent on the £ 777 billion, distributed over 5 years. In a more pessimistic scenario,
where losses reach 28 percent, the debt-to-GDP ratio could rise by 13 percent of GDP. 2
• Unwinding existing direct financial sector support. Reversing the (cash) bank
recapitalization undertaken in 2008/09 has upside risks to debt of up to 6 percentage

points. Figure A2b compares two exit strategies where shares are disposed of over the
next 5 years at purchase price or at double the purchase price. Should shares become
worthless, gross government debt would remain unchanged but the public sector’s net
worth would decrease.
Further direct financial sector support. The potential impact of further public capital
provision is illustrated in Figure A2b. Specifically, the scenario assumes that an
additional £88 billion in public capital would be provided (see Box 2), increasing the
debt-to-GDP ratio to 105 percent by 2014/15.

Treasury’s indemnification of the Bank of England from any losses incurred in
connection with the conduct of monetary policy is not included in this analysis. Any
losses from the Special Liquidity Scheme are expected to be very low, given the high quality
of the purchased assets, the amount of collateral involved, and fees charged for participation.
Potential losses on purchases under the Asset Purchase Facility are also not included in the
analysis.
While practically all public debt is denominated in sterling, roughly one-third of gilts
are held by foreigners. Foreign investors play an important role in the funding of the budget
deficit. The sterling denomination protects the government from exchange rate risk; however,
exchange rate expectations are an important determinant of overseas demand for UK
securities.

Box A1. Which measure of debt?
This debt sustainability analysis focuses on the consolidated gross debt of the
general government. Financial sector interventions and monetary policy conduct
render other measures of public sector debt less informative when assessing the
sustainability of government operations. Gross general government debt closely tracks
the Maastricht treaty definition of debt. It includes the gross cash cost of financial
sector interventions (which are excluded from the public sector net debt unless
specifically noted).1 The pending statistical classification of RBS and Lloyds as public
sector corporations will cause public sector net debt to increase dramatically since only
a small fraction of the banks’ assets count towards public sector liquid assets. The
pending statistical treatment of assets bought under the Bank of England’s Asset
Purchase Facility could also affect the public sector net debt measure.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on the United Kingdom
July 10, 2009
1.
This statement provides information that has become available since the Staff Report
was circulated to the Executive Board on June 25, 2009. The information does not alter the
staff’s broad assessment of policy issues and recommendations contained in the staff report.
2.
On July 8, the UK Treasury released a white paper, which lays out a strategy for
further regulatory reform (http://www.hm-reasury.gov.uk/reforming_financial_markets.htm).
The following priorities are identified in the paper:
•

•

•

•

Strengthening the UK’s regulatory institutional framework. The white paper
endorses the current tripartite arrangement, but the government seeks to strengthen its
operation and risk assessment capacity by creating a “Council for Financial Stability” to
replace the existing standing committee. Further, the government intends to provide the
FSA with a formal, statutory objective for financial stability, along with clearer legal
authority to take into account systemic implications when setting prudential rules. The
FSA would also obtain enhanced regulatory powers to deal with misconduct, and a
possible extension of its information gathering powers to support its more intensive
supervisory approach. Deposit insurance would transit to a prefunded system over the
medium term.
Dealing with systemically important financial institutions. The white paper rejects
proposals to impose regulatory limits on the size or complexity of financial firms.
Instead, the government’s approach rests on better market discipline, notably through
reforms to corporate governance and remuneration policies, and an enhanced supervisory
focus on “high impact” firms that may be seen as being “too big to fail.” Such firms
would be required to prepare detailed practical plans for their own resolution in case of
failure, and be subject to more stringent regulation, including higher capital and liquidity
requirements.
Greater emphasis on monitoring and managing system-wide risks. The white paper
stresses the need to improve transparency, including through more consistent accounting
and valuation standards, and to make wholesale markets more robust, especially for
securitization and over-the-counter derivatives. Efforts would concentrate on promoting
standardization and central counterparty arrangements. Moreover, the government
supports the development of macroprudential tools—both rules-based and
discretionary—to counteract the build-up of large systemic risks.
Close cooperation with international partners to deliver regulatory reform in areas
where a coordinated approach is required. This covers, notably, the government’s
support for key recommendations from the Turner Review, i.e., to mandate more and
higher-quality capital requirements, introduce a backstop leverage ratio, enhance the
regulation of liquidity, and develop macroprudential tools. The white paper also endorses

2
the June 2009 European Council conclusions to strengthen the EU supervisory and
regulatory framework.
3.
To take the proposed program forward the government intends to consult with the
FSA, the Bank of England, other relevant parties, and its international partners over the
coming months. Concrete legislative action is envisaged to start later in 2009.
4.
On June 25, the Bank of England released its latest Financial Stability Report (FSR),
(http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/fsr/2009/index.htm). The FSR notes that
given their leverage and funding positions, banks in the UK (and internationally) will remain
sensitive to further shocks for some time. Further, although private demand for
non-guaranteed bank debt has begun to return, funding pressure is likely to persist in the
coming years as banks need to secure substantial private financing to replace the current
official funding support. If the economic recovery were to stall because of weak bank
lending, losses on assets could rise, further affecting confidence in the banking sector. To
increase the resilience of the financial system the FSR calls for stronger market discipline,
including through more granular and frequent disclosure by banks; greater self-insurance,
including by holding higher capital and liquidity buffers; and improved management of risks
arising from interactions, including by improved information on connections between
financial institutions and countercyclical prudential policy to limit the growth of financial
imbalances.
5.
The proposals put forth in the Treasury’s white paper and the BoE’s FSR complement
those in the Turner Review (released in February 2009) and are consistent with the thrust of
the staff report’s recommendations. The UK authorities are encouraged to continue work on
the implementation of the proposed actions in close collaboration with international partners.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article
IV Consultation with the United Kingdom
On July 10, 2009 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the United Kingdom. 1
Background
The United Kingdom has been hit hard by the global financial crisis. The economy was
particularly vulnerable to the crisis because of the large size of its financial sector, high
household indebtedness, and strong cross-border links. Economic growth has turned sharply
negative since mid-2008, house prices have fallen by more than 20 percent from their peak, the
unemployment rate has increased and inflation has come down. Driven by increased risk
perceptions, sterling has depreciated significantly between mid-2007 and early 2009, helping to
narrow the UK’s external imbalances, before regaining some strength in recent months. With
banks focused on reducing leverage, the growth of credit to the private sector has fallen to
nearly zero, and is expected to remain low in the near term.
In response to the crisis, the authorities have taken wide-ranging measures to stabilize the
financial system and support demand. The measures included expansion of the Bank of
England’s liquidity facilities, significant public capital injections in several large banks, an Asset
Protection Scheme to limit losses on troubled bank assets, and guarantees for banks’ debt.
Considerable policy stimulus has also been introduced to support the economy. The Bank of
England reduced interest rates to a historic low of 0.5 percent by March 2009 and began
purchasing assets, financed by an expansion of base money (quantitative easing). Meanwhile,
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
the government has put in place a discretionary fiscal stimulus package of around 2 percent of
GDP. These policies have helped avert a systemic breakdown in the financial system, although
vulnerabilities remain.
The crisis and the ensuing recession have led to a rapid deterioration of public finances. With
revenues highly sensitive to the economic cycle, financial sector activity, and asset prices, fiscal
deficits have widened sharply and are expected to be about 13 percent of GDP in 2009 and
2010. Gross general government debt is set to double over the next five years to nearly 100
percent of GDP. At the same time, contingent liabilities of the government have increased
rapidly.
The economic outlook is highly uncertain. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has
begun to stabilize. However, the recovery is likely to be slow and subdued as banks and
households go through a difficult balance sheet adjustment. GDP is expected to contract by
4.2 percent in 2009, with growth picking up gradually in 2010. As spare capacity continues to
increase, inflation is expected to fall below the 2-percent target in the second half of 2009 and
remain low for an extended period of time.
Executive Board Assessment
The Executive Directors noted that the UK economy has been hit hard by the global financial
crisis and welcomed the UK authorities’ aggressive policy response. The measures taken to
stabilize the financial system have been successful in averting a systemic breakdown. The
significant fiscal and monetary stimulus underway will help support activity in the near-term.
There are tentative signs that economic activity is stabilizing. However, Directors pointed out
that the outlook for the UK economy is highly uncertain and will depend on, among other
factors, the pace and extent of deleveraging of financial institutions’ and households’ balance
sheets.
Directors considered that, looking forward, the projected sharp increase in public debt, the
accumulation of sizable contingent liabilities, and continued financial sector fragility represent
significant vulnerabilities. They therefore emphasized the importance of following credible and
consistent policies to maintain domestic and external stability, limit downside risks, and
strengthen market confidence. Resolving the problems in the financial sector and setting
monetary and fiscal policies consistent with a firm commitment to price stability and fiscal
sustainability are the main policy priorities.
Directors stressed that the most important policy task remains repairing the financial system.
Significant uncertainties remain about the adverse impact of the recession on asset quality.
Substantial further write-downs would result in an erosion of capital buffers and might lead to
renewed doubts about the capital adequacy of individual financial institutions. These lingering
uncertainties are restraining lending growth. Directors suggested that the authorities should
encourage banks to strengthen their capital base and explore options to improve capital

3
structures. The authorities should also continue their contingency planning, and a number of
Directors agreed that they should be prepared to provide further public capital, if needed.
Directors welcomed the adoption of the Special Resolution Regime for financial institutions and
noted that its effective implementation would require timely and comprehensive information
sharing and cooperation among the tripartite authorities. The UK authorities should continue to
work with international partners, including the EU, on strengthening cross-border financial
stability arrangements and resolution frameworks, for example through the development of
effective arrangements for crisis management and orderly exit of cross-border banks.
Directors supported a number of the proposals for enhancing the UK’s prudential framework
presented in the Turner Review and in the white paper on reforming financial markets published
by the Treasury. In particular, Directors endorsed the proposed enhancement of liquidity
regulation, the increased emphasis on identifying system-wide risks, and proposals for a
Council for Financial Stability. They encouraged the authorities to continue working with
international partners on the development of new macro-prudential instruments that could help
mitigate the amplitude of credit cycles. Many Directors considered that a phased introduction of
a maximum gross leverage ratio could act as a useful backstop against excessive balance
sheet growth. Finally, Directors recommended improving the frequency and quality of disclosure
of financial information by banks.
Executive Directors considered the Bank of England’s strategy of aggressive monetary easing,
aimed at maintaining inflation close to target, to be appropriate, while noting it is too early to
judge the overall effectiveness of quantitative easing. Directors noted that diversifying the Bank
of England’s private asset purchases further could help improve the functioning of capital
markets. They welcomed the robust institutional arrangement underpinning the Bank of
England’s unconventional operations, including comprehensive indemnity assurances from the
Treasury. These arrangements preserve the Bank of England’s operational independence and
will help assure a smooth exit from quantitative easing when warranted by economic conditions.
Directors emphasized that the success of the current policy package depends on continued
trust in the sustainability of the fiscal position. A strong commitment to reverse the sharp
deterioration of the public finances once the economic recovery has been established, within
the context of a coherent and ambitious fiscal framework, will be essential. The focus of fiscal
consolidation plans should be on putting public debt on a firmly downward path within a
reasonable timeframe. Credibility would be enhanced by specifying concrete expenditure and
revenue measures to achieve the desired adjustment. Long-term sustainability would also be
helped by implementing structural reforms to limit the rise in ageing-related costs.

Statement by Alex Gibbs, Executive Director for the United Kingdom
July 10, 2009
My authorities held a very open and productive consultation with the IMF staff Mission in
May. They agree with the broad thrust of the staff report, and in particular welcome its
support for the strength of the UK’s policy response to the global crisis. The staff report
rightly identifies the exceptional uncertainties that characterise policymaking in the current
environment, as well as the longer term challenges that will need to be addressed once the
crisis has passed. My statement seeks to complement the staff report by setting out my
authorities’ approach to these issues in more detail and noting some areas where views differ.
Outlook and recent developments
The UK economy has contracted in the period since the last Article IV in July 2008. Whilst
the outlook remains subject to significant uncertainties, the forecast set out in the Treasury’s
April 2009 Budget is for a -3¾ to -3¼ percent reduction in GDP in 2009, followed by a 1 to
1½ percent growth in 2010. In addition, the Treasury assumed a phased downward
adjustment to the trend level of output of around 5 percent. However, as spare capacity in the
economy is brought back to productive use by 2011, GDP is forecast to grow by 3½ percent.
The economic outlook is, of course, highly uncertain at the current juncture and there are
risks both to the upside and downside as highlighted by the IMF staff. Nevertheless, my
authorities see some potential reasons for growth to recover more quickly than staff forecast:
•
•
•
•

•

the effect of the unprecedented and aggressive policy stimulus is expected to
increasingly take hold;
despite the recent contraction of global demand, the lower level of sterling should
shift both domestic and overseas expenditure towards UK goods and services;
the UK is already at a well-advanced stage in the inventory cycle, which should act to
boost, rather than detract from, growth in the coming quarters;
to the extent that the deterioration in financial conditions has acted to weigh on
economic activity in the downswing, the normalisation of credit conditions as a result
of the UK’s financial sector interventions should act as a bulwark to growth in the
upswing;
although we agree with staff that uncertainty around employment prospects could
slow recovery, we expect the UK's flexible labour market to allow firms, households
and consumers to adjust relatively rapidly.

The latest Budget inflation forecast is broadly in line with the IMF Staff forecast for 2009
and 2010. My authorities agree that strong downward pressure from increasing spare
capacity and lower energy prices means that CPI inflation will continue to ease, moving well
below its target of 2 percent by the end of the year. CPI inflation is likely to remain below
target during 2010 when the negative output gap is forecast to trough, though downward
pressure on inflation will be countered by monetary policy support further taking hold. My
authorities forecast a stronger rebound in inflation than the Staff and consider the risk of
deflation in the CPI measure of inflation to be small given the monetary policy stimulus in

2
place and the upward pressure on prices from the continued pass-through of the exchange
rate depreciation. As stated in the Staff report, medium-term inflation expectations remain
anchored to the inflation target, further mitigating the downside risk of a deflationary
scenario.
Fiscal Policy
Recent economic developments across the globe are having a profound effect on the fiscal
positions of many countries and debt is likely to rise significantly in all advanced economies.
The UK Government’s objectives for fiscal policy in the face of these developments remain
unchanged. They are: in the short term to support monetary policy and to allow the automatic
stabilisers to help smooth the path of the economy; over the medium term, to ensure sound
public finances and a fair impact of spending and taxation within and between generations.
Short- term stimulus
To support the economy in the short-term, the 2008 Pre-Budget Report announced a timely,
targeted and temporary fiscal stimulus package worth around 1 percent of GDP in 2009–10,
including a temporary reduction in the rate of VAT to 15 percent and bringing forward
£3 billion of capital spending. The 2009 Budget announced further targeted support to assist
recovery including measures to provide temporary support for employment and investment.
This amounts to fiscal support worth 4 percent of GDP in 2009–10 from announced measures
and the operation of the automatic stabilisers.
Medium- term consolidation
My authorities fully agree with Staff that in addition to providing short-term stimulus,
ensuring the sustainability and credibility of the fiscal position, and setting a path towards
consolidation are extremely important. They also share staff’s view that the pace of recovery
will be important in shaping the consolidation. My authorities are firmly committed to
delivering the needed fiscal consolidation and have taken a number of steps to do so beyond
the withdrawal of temporary stimulus measures.
First, as welcomed by Staff, the Government has taken a transparent and cautious approach
to the fiscal projections. The fiscal forecast assumes that the majority of the deterioration in
the fiscal position is structural. It is based on the lower end of the projected GDP forecast
range. It uses independently audited assumptions on oil prices and equity prices and the VAT
gap. Further, reflecting the principle of transparency, the fiscal forecasts include the high end
of a range for a provisional estimate of the net impact of unrealized losses on financial sector
interventions, equal to 3½ percent of GDP.
Second, in light of the current uncertain outlook, the Government has set a temporary fiscal
operating rule: to set policies to improve the cyclically-adjusted current budget each year,
once the economy emerges from the downturn, so it reaches balance and debt is falling as a
proportion of GDP once the global shocks have worked their way through the economy in
full. Setting a rule focused on steady improvement in the public finances allows the

3
Government flexibility to adjust to unanticipated developments in the economy, while
constraining fiscal policy to deliver sound public finances over the medium term.
Third, plans are in place to deliver a sustained fiscal consolidation once the economy
emerges from the downturn, including a combination of adjustments to tax and spending.
Reflecting uncertainty around prospects for the economy and therefore the public finances,
the need to support the economy through the early stages of recovery and the need to deliver
sound public finances, the Government has set out steps to ensure they are on a sustainable
path. The plans entail a projected improvement in the cyclically-adjusted balance of, on
average, over 0.8 percent a year from 2010–11 to 2013–14. Based on cautious fiscal
forecasting assumptions, public sector net borrowing is projected to more than halve over
4 years to stand at 5.5 percent of GDP in 2013–14. As a result, net debt is projected to
stabilize at 79 percent of GDP, including potential losses on financial sector interventions.
Consistent with the temporary operating rule, these fiscal plans set public finances on a path
to achieve cyclically-adjusted current balance by 2017–18 and debt falling as a share of GDP
by 2015–16.
My authorities will continue to do whatever is necessary to ensure sustainable public
finances, while continuing to invest in public services and infrastructure.
Monetary Policy
The UK’s current monetary policy framework is well-established and, following its
introduction in 1997, delivered over a decade of low and stable inflation. It enshrines a
symmetric inflation target that has enabled a decisive response by the Bank of England’s
Monetary Policy Committee as aggregate demand weakened and the outlook for inflation
was revised downwards. Following the credit market dislocation precipitated by the collapse
of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, Bank Rate was reduced by 450 basis points in just
six months.
In addition, the Government established the Asset Purchase Facility to enable the Bank of
England to increase the availability of corporate credit and to provide a framework for the
MPC to use asset purchases for monetary policy purposes in January. Since its inception, the
Bank of England has announced asset purchases of £125bn. As noted by the Staff, the Bank
of England’s conventional and unconventional monetary easing has been both ‘timely and
appropriate’. Of course, ascertaining the effect of this policy will take time, although the
sharp drop in gilt yields on announcement provide some indication of the market’s view of
its likely effectiveness. In line with Staff’s recommendations, diversifications of the Bank’s
asset purchases are currently under active consideration, and consultations have taken place
on both a secured commercial paper (SCP) facility and a possible supply chain finance
facility.
My authorities agree that the success of the QE policy hinges crucially on the Bank of
England maintaining a strict focus on price stability. As Staff note, the design of the QE
framework is helpful in this regard. First the March 2009 exchange of letters between the
Governor of the Bank of England and the Chancellor establishing the Asset Purchase Facility

4
make clear that the MPC retains operational independence, with its remit unchanged.
Accordingly, the MPC will decide the timing and size of asset purchases and sales, together
with the level of Bank Rate; with the outlook for inflation determining the rate at which the
current exceptional monetary stimulus is withdrawn. Second, the operational framework of
the Asset Purchase Facility Fund, as a separate legal entity with a separate balance sheet,
indemnified by the Treasury, acts to underline the operational independence of the Bank. An
indication of the potential inflationary risks of this stimulus is provided by the stability of the
latest medium-term inflation expectations surveys (as noted by the Staff in the report). These
surveys suggest that expectations continue to be well-anchored to the inflation target.
Financial sector
Over the past year the UK financial sector has experienced a period of significant distress. In
line with their approach to monetary and fiscal policy, the UK authorities have taken
wide-ranging action to stabilise the situation in the short term, whilst also focusing on action
needed to strengthen the sector over the medium term, and ensuring it can make a strong
contribution to delivering economic recovery.
As the crisis heightened last year, my authorities deployed various measures (as listed in
Annex I of the Staff Report) to support banks, protect depositors and maintain stability. The
recapitalization scheme of October last year, and the introduction of the Asset Protection
Scheme (APS) in February this year have been particularly important in stabilising banks,
strengthening their capital positions, and helping to foster improved confidence. The APS
provides insurance for those assets where there is the greatest degree of uncertainty about
their future performance, allowing it to absorb losses and strengthen banks’ capital position.
The Government has also replaced its preference shares in Lloyds and RBS with new
ordinary shares, which has further strengthened their capital positions.
Additionally, to help ensure credit starts to flow into the economy again, lending
commitments have been agreed with both Lloyds and RBS. RBS will lend an additional
£25 billion on commercial terms over the 12 months from March 2009 — £9 billion of
mortgage lending and £16 billion of business lending. Lloyds will lend an additional £14
billion on commercial terms over the 12 months from March 2009 — £3 billion of mortgage
lending and £11 billion of business lending. Similar lending commitments have been made in
respect of the subsequent 12 months and will be reviewed to ensure they reflect economic
circumstances at that time.
Since the Article IV Mission, the vulnerability of the building society sector’s limited access
to capital has been addressed with the introduction of Profit Participation Deferred Schemes,
which were used in the recapitalization of West Bromwich Building Society. Eligibility for
the Government’s Recapitalisation and Credit Guarantee Schemes has also been extended to
building societies and the Government will shortly consult on measures to enable building
societies to offer a floating charge over their assets to the Bank of England or other
institution offering financial assistance. The February 2009 Banking Act, which was under
development at the time of the last Article IV and which provides a strengthened framework
for the resolution of deposit taking institutions has been put into almost immediate use, in the
resolution of another building society in March 2009.

5

Despite ongoing uncertainties, there are a number of signs that financial conditions are
slowly improving, including since the conclusion of the Staff Mission in May. Notably, the
latest Bank of England credit conditions survey — published last week — suggests that there
has been an increase in credit availability for both households and corporates, reversing the
tightening of availability that has been seen for much of the past two years. Banks also
expect credit availability to improve further in the next three months for both corporates and
households. It is worth noting that much of the fall in lending has come from a reduction in
non-bank credit, securities market activity and lending from foreign banks. Over the past few
months lending by UK-incorporated banks has continued to expand, albeit at a decelerating
rate. Recent data also suggests that house prices are starting to stabilize. Bank funding
conditions - as measured by the libor/OIS spread — have continued to improve and are now
at their most favourable levels since the collapse of Lehmans. More generally global
financial conditions have generally eased and equity prices have continued to recover,
including equity prices for UK banks.
Looking ahead, my authorities agree with Staff that further reforms are needed to strengthen
the financial sector, in the UK and globally. The supervision of financial institutions is one
area where urgent improvement in needed. Lord Turner’s report1 on this subject provides a
thorough analysis of the key areas for reform, the interactions between them, and the
implications of regulatory changes. Given the global nature of financial markets and
increasing cross-border nature of bank operations those recommendations need to be
considered alongside those from the G20 Heads of Government summit, and the reports
coming from the EU. The UK Government will also publish a paper about its long-term
vision for the financial sector later this week.
The work of Basel Committee to deliver a global framework for promoting stronger bank
liquidity buffers, including greater consistency in the treatment of cross-border banking
groups is also strongly welcomed by my authorities.
As agreed by all G20 Leaders when they met in Washington DC last November, my
authorities are committed to undertaking a further FSAP, and expect the next exercise to be
undertaken in 2011.
External spillovers
As noted by staff, the significant fall in the (real) external value of sterling over the past
twelve months has improved the UK current account considerably, mostly reflecting stronger
investment income. My authorities remain fully committed to allowing the value of sterling
to be determined by market forces and indeed the sterling effective exchange rate has risen
by 13 percent since its trough in December 2008. Reflecting this flexible approach, the
exchange rate has acted as an effective shock absorber helping smooth the adjustment as the
economy contracts.

The Turner Review: A regulatory response to the global banking crisis, March 2009

6
My authorities believe Article IV surveillance needs to strengthen understanding of policy
spillovers and international linkages and welcomes such analysis in the report. However,
like staff, we think that the hypothetical shock (illustrated in Box 1, page 22) which assesses
spillovers from the UK financial system with an illustrative cut in UK banks’ foreign lending
of 50 percent is a very extreme one, and one which has a very low risk of materialising. At
the height of the financial crisis in the fourth quarter of 2008, consolidated foreign claims of
UK banks declined by only 14 percent and foreign lending by only 7.9 percent over their
levels in September 2008.
Looking ahead
A year of significant challenge for the UK economy has been supported by wide-ranging and
decisive policy action. My authorities approach the year ahead with confidence that is
nevertheless tempered with caution given the challenges ahead. International collaboration
on the policy response to the crisis as it evolves strengthens the prospect of success. The
evolution of the UK economy will continue to be affected by international developments and
global as well as domestic policy actions. My authorities therefore stand ready to work with
others, and take whatever steps are necessary to restore non-inflationary growth and
sustainable public finances. We welcome the IMF’s continued policy advice.
