EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
The impact of the global financial crisis on Syria has been relatively moderate and
mostly through linkages to trading partners in the region and Europe. Non-oil growth is
estimated to have declined by 1.5 percentage points in 2009 to 4.5 percent. The fiscal and
current account deficits are estimated to have widened somewhat, but remained at sustainable
levels, and the level of official net foreign assets remained comfortable.



Authorities’ views
Measures taken in response to the global crisis and to support lending to investment
projects are temporary and will be phased out over time.


Quasi-fiscal operations that are conducted by public enterprises and state-owned banks
will continue to be streamlined.



Plans to modernize the monetary policy framework will be advanced, including by
developing indirect monetary policy instruments such as treasury bills.


Implementation of financial sector and other structural reforms will continue to promote
the private sector, diversify the economy, and accelerate growth and employment creation.


Staff recommendations
Gradually resume fiscal consolidation, including by revisiting the large increase in
public investment budgeted for 2010, maintaining current expenditure restraint, and building
on the progress made in reforming subsidies.



Complete the remaining preparations for the introduction of the VAT in 2011 and
improve public financial management.



Continue with the implementation of the 2008 FSAP recommendations, and reform
public banks. Reverse the increase in the regulatory ceiling on credit exposure, and phase out
the differentiated reserves requirement.

Allow exchange rate fluctuations within the de jure band around the SDR and gradually
increase flexibility over the medium-term.


Accelerate structural reforms, including by modernizing regulations, continuing to
streamline the extensive subsidies system, and further liberalizing trade.



I. BACKGROUND AND RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
1.
The Syrian authorities have been implementing gradual, but wide-ranging
reforms. These reforms are motivated by the challenges posed by the decline in oil
production and the strategy initiated in the early 2000s to transition toward a social market
economy. The exchange rate has been effectively unified and restrictions on access to
foreign exchange for current transactions appear to have been mostly eliminated. Private
banks are now leading financial sector growth, and the Damascus stock exchange recently
re-opened after being closed for 40 years. Taxes have been streamlined and the trade regime
significantly liberalized. There was a limited cabinet reshuffle in January, but no change in
economic policy is expected.
2.
The impact of the global financial crisis on Syria has been relatively moderate

The external current account deficit widened to about 4.5 percent, as the decline
in exports exceeded that of imports. However, tourism receipts were buoyant, and both FDI
and remittances dropped only slightly. Gross reserves remained comfortable, at about
US$17 billion.
5.
With the Syrian pound pegged to a basket (within a band), broad money is
estimated to have grown by about 10 percent in 2009. Credit to public enterprises
decelerated sharply due to the reduction in energy subsidies, which were financed by

6

borrowing. Nonetheless, growth of credit to the private sector remained at about 25 percent,
driven by the expansion of private banks.
6.
The Central Bank of Syria (CBS) took some measures to ease the monetary
stance and support lending to investment projects. These included: (i) reducing the
reserve requirements by up to 5 percent for banks that increase lending to investment
projects; (ii) requiring selected banks to cancel penalty on overdue debts and extend
maturities; (iii) reducing the indicative deposit interest rates from 7-9 percent to 6-8 percent;
and (iv) increasing the credit exposure limit for development projects from 25 percent to
35 percent for a single project. The CBS introduced additional conditions on the credit
associated with the latter measure in order to safeguard its quality. The authorities also
established a Lender of Last Resort facility, and increased the minimum capital requirement
for banks from $30 million to $200 million for conventional banks, and from $100 to
$300 million for Islamic banks (with 3 years grace period). Concomitantly, the ceiling on
foreign ownership of banks’ was increased from 49 percent to 60 percent.
7.
The authorities also undertook a series of actions to mitigate the impact of the
drought and higher diesel prices on agriculture. These included tax breaks for farmers,
rescheduling of loans, cancelation of penalty on arrears, and increasing procurement prices
of key crops. The government established the Agricultural Support Fund (ASF) in 2008 to
replace some input subsidies with cash transfers to farmers. The ASF was allocated
SP10 billion in the 2009 budget. In addition, the Ministry of Finance (MoF) introduced tax
incentives to encourage companies to contribute to strategic objectives such as locating in
remote areas, increase hiring, and placing initial public offers in the stock market.
8.
Some progress has been made in advancing structural reforms, including
simplifying investment procedures, modernizing accounting standards, and streamlining the
tax system. Effective June 2009, the authorities raised the minimum thresholds for
exemption from wage taxes. As an offsetting measure, the top income tax rate for
individuals was increased to 22 percent (from 20 percent). However, the authorities recently
introduced reference prices and customs duties that vary by country of origin to protect
against unfair trade practices.
II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
2B

A. Outlook and Risks
9.
The outlook for 2010 points to an overall strengthening in economic
performance. The ongoing recovery in Syria’s trading partners is expected to contribute to
a gradual increase in exports, remittances, and FDI in 2010. Agriculture is likely to continue
to recover from the severe drought of the past two years. Therefore, growth is projected at
about 5 percent. The overall fiscal deficit is expected to narrow by about 1 percentage point

7

of GDP, on account of current expenditure restraint and a rise in oil revenues. The external
current account deficit is envisaged to narrow slightly, partly due to the moderation in the
domestic public consumption.

In percent of GDP

10.
The medium-term outlook is projected to continue to improve with the gradual
global recovery and progress in domestic economic reforms. Growth is expected to
strengthen to about 5.5 percent by 2014, despite the envisaged decline in oil output, with the
ongoing rebound in agriculture and global recovery. The authorities’ medium-term fiscal
strategy aims to contain the

stabilize at 3.7 percent of GDP due to strengthening of non-oil exports and tourism receipts.
A delay in global recovery or faltering reform implementation could worsen the outlook and
impede Syria’s economic growth.

B. Fiscal Policy
11.
The consolidation of public finances over the past few years provided room for
the authorities to take counter-cyclical measures to mitigate the effects of the global
economic crisis. Assuming somewhat similar implementation ratios as in the past, the 2010
budget implies a moderate tightening of the fiscal stance underpinned by a slight
improvement in revenue and current expenditure restraint. In nominal terms, the budget
provides for a 12.5 percent expenditure growth over the 2009 preliminary outcome. It
includes a small increase in current expenditure, mostly due to a moderate increase in
wages. It also provides for a 30 percent increase in capital outlays compared to the 2009
preliminary outcome (and 19 percent compared to the 2009 revised budget). Cash transfers
replacing the diesel coupons are envisaged to increase by about 0.5 percent of GDP. The
authorities are confident that the projected economic recovery in 2010 will allow them to
resume fiscal consolidation. They intend to continue to restrain current expenditures and
rationalize capital outlays. In recent years, the fiscal deficit has been smaller than what was
envisaged in the original state budget. The authorities also aim at continuing to allow the

8

private sector to take the lead in implementing some investment programs, including in the
context of public-private partnership (PPP) arrangements with adequate safeguards.
12.
The authorities are determined to continue to modernize the subsidies system to
further enhance fiscal gains, efficiency, and the targeting of assistance. They replaced
the universal diesel coupons with targeted cash transfers to compensate vulnerable
households. Furthermore, many agricultural subsidies are now being delivered in the form
of targeted cash transfers through the ASF.

Box I. Debt Sustainability Analysis
Public debt remains low since the 2005 rescheduling of the debt to Russia, and fiscal reforms have
advanced. However, the authorities need to continue their fiscal effort reform in the period ahead in view
of the likely expenditure pressures associated with plans to improve infrastructure and increase access to
basic services.
Based on the authorities’ ongoing reforms, public debt should remain at manageable levels. Debt is
expected to increase only moderately, to about 25 percent of GDP by 2014, despite the substantial decline
in oil revenue. The outlook is also sustainable if the recent years’ trend is used to derive assumptions.
Holding the key debt-dynamics variables (e.g. the real GDP growth and the primary fiscal balance)
constant at their 10-year historical averages produces an improvement in the debt-to-GDP ratio by about
10 percent by 2014. Holding the primary deficit constant at about 5 percent of GDP, the preliminary
outcome of 2009, would lead to an increase in the debt ratio to about 30 percent by 2014.
Sensitivity analysis of the baseline scenario indicates that public debt would remain sustainable
under various shocks. A one-half standard

However, if the reforms underlying the baseline scenario falter, the fiscal outlook would significantly
deteriorate. For example, a substantial delay in the implementation of the VAT, a re-emergence of large
implicit fuel subsidies, and waning efforts to control wages and rationalize capital spending could lead to
growing fiscal deficits and public debt ratios rising to about 50 percent of GDP.

9

13.
The MoF plans to introduce the VAT in 2011. Achievements in this area include
the drafting of the VAT law and a tax procedures code, the establishment of the large
taxpayer office and the General Commission for Taxes and Fees (GCTF), and substantial
modernization of customs. The authorities stressed that the delay experienced in launching
the VAT, which was originally planned for 2008, was due to vital preparations of the tax
administration and the public to ensure a successful introduction.
14.
The authorities are cognizant of the need to further improve public expenditure
monitoring and management. The current and capital budgets have been effectively
integrated, and are now prepared and implemented by the MoF. For the first time, a
program- and performance-based budgeting approach was adopted for the agriculture and
education sectors in the 2010 budget. The authorities intend to further streamline the
substantial quasi-fiscal operations that are conducted by public enterprises and state-owned
banks. They plan to gradually bring on budget the remaining quasi-fiscal operations that are
conducted by these entities, and improve the timeliness of expenditure reporting by the
regional entities.
C. Monetary Policy and Financial Sector Reform
15.
The scope for monetary policy independence will remain limited over the
medium-term in view of the exchange rate arrangement. The authorities intend to
continue their efforts to enhance the monetary policy framework. As part of their reform
agenda, they are planning to gradually replace administrative tools for conducting monetary
policy with market-based tools. If issuance of treasury bills is further delayed, the CBS
would consider issuing its own certificates of deposits. The authorities indicated that the
transfer of international reserves from the Commercial Bank of Syria (CBoS) to CBS has
been completed, in line with the FSAP recommendation.
16.
In the authorities’ view, some measures taken in response to the global crisis
and to support lending to investment projects are temporary and will be phased out
over time. Staff noted that differentiated reserve requirements, based on the volume of
lending for investment purposes, can encourage bank financing of less profitable projects.
Also, it will be important to phase out the public banks’ preferential lending schemes in
order for banks to allocate their credit based on their own internal lending criteria.
Furthermore, the recent increase in the credit exposure limit for development projects could
increase banks’ vulnerabilities.

10

Box II. Subsidy Reform
The authorities have taken important steps in reforming the energy subsidies. The prices of key
petroleum products were increased in 2008, saving about 7 percent of GDP in implicit subsidies. To mitigate
the impact of the higher prices, the

The universal diesel coupons were
replaced by targeted cash transfers in 2009. The criteria applied in determining eligibility for transfers are
based on income, asset ownership, and the utility bill. Approximately half of the Syrian households are
likely to benefit from these transfers. Furthermore, unlike the cost of the coupons which was born by the
state-owned oil distribution company, the cash transfers will be funded directly from the budget.

with the drop in international oil prices
in 2009. Nonetheless, the cumulative compensatory measure is estimated at about 6 percent of GDP,
resulting in a still large, but more efficient subsidy to consumers. However, if domestic prices are not
adjusted to reflect future changes in international prices, the current price gap will widen again, and so will
leakage.
The government also took important steps to reform agricultural subsidies through the introduction
of ASF to manage and streamline inputs subsidies. To mitigate the effects of the reduction in the implicit
diesel subsidy and the liberalization of the fertilizer market in 2009, the ASF started to make targeted cash
transfers to farmers.

17.
The CBS views further strengthening of bank supervision as a priority. In
particular, public banks now report on a regular basis their key financial sector indicators to
the CBS. However, data for some of these banks may not reflect their true condition due to
outdated accounting practices. The CBS has made progress in implementing the 2008 FSAP
recommendations. Nonetheless, realization of a number of these recommendations requires
amending the central bank law. Efforts are underway to prepare banks for the
implementation of Basle II, including by requiring them to strengthen their internal risk
assessment procedures. The authorities do not see a problem with the strong growth of
private credit in view of the strengthening of the supervisory framework, low level of

11

financial intermediation, and the fact that many of the new banks are subsidiaries of well
established foreign banks with good risk assessment capabilities.
18.
The impact of the global crisis on the financial sector has been limited due to
the low degree of its global exposure and CBS’s prudential requirements. The capital
adequacy ratio for the consolidated banking sector is reported at about 20 percent. Banks
continued to be liquid and moderately profitable. The average non-performing loans (NPL)
ratio is low. However, the NPL of public banks (6 percent) is likely to be significantly
understated as these banks do not classify many of their loans that are in arrears as bad loans
since most of them are implicitly guaranteed by the government. In general, roll-over of bad
loans is extensive, hindering a meaningful calculation of NPLs. The recent CBS regulation
limiting roll-overs should help clarify the true position of these banks in the period ahead.
Also, recent decisions to reschedule loans will be limited to sectors strongly impacted by the
global crisis and the drought.
19.
The Syrian pound appreciated by about 7 percent against the dollar in 2008 in
nominal terms. This contributed, along with the high domestic inflation that year, to a real
effective appreciation of about 14 percent. About half of that real appreciation was reversed
during 2009 with the substantial depreciation of the dollar against the Euro and the decline
in Syria’s domestic inflation. Econometric estimates, which suffer from serious data
shortcomings, suggest that the real exchange rate of the pound may be moderately
overvalued relative to its medium-term equilibrium level (Box IV). The authorities have
stressed that the exchange rate reflects market forces and that it is competitive as evidenced
by the rapid growth of exports prior to the global recession of 2009. The staff does not
recommend a change in the current nominal exchange rate level in the present context, and
in view of the data shortcomings highlighted above.

12

Box III. Financial Sector Developments
The Syrian authorities have embarked on an ambitious reform agenda to modernize the financial
sector and improve intermediation. A number

Furthermore, modernization of the CBS has
continued, and substantial progress toward
60
current account convertibility and exchange rate
unification has been made. Moreover, the
40
authorities fully liberalized bank lending rates
and rates on foreign currency deposits and
20
loans.
The share of private banks has grown
considerably since they were first established
in 2004. As of September 2009, there were 12
private banks (including 2 Islamic banks) with
assets equivalent to about 24 percent of total
banking sector assets. Their total deposits have
grown by about 12-16 percent annually since 2006.
Overall, banking intermediation has increased
substantially, although it still remains low by
regional standards.

Box IV. Exchange Rate Assessment
Econometric estimates suggest that the pound may be moderately overvalued in real effective terms
at end-2008. This has been partly corrected during 2009 with the depreciation of the dollar against the
euro. However, the estimates, which utilized CGER methodologies 1/, are not reliable due to serious data
shortcomings. Syrian balance of payments statistics and national accounts need significant improvement,
and the data used by staff are in many cases
only estimates.

indicates an overvaluation of the pound by
about 10-15 percent. Based on a panel
regression, the equilibrium current account
norm for Syria would be a surplus of about
1 percent of GDP. This compares with a
projected deficit of about 3.7 percent of
GDP. The set of determinant variables in this
approach include the fiscal balance,
population growth, NFA, oil balance, and per
capita income.
The equilibrium real exchange rate
(ERER) methodology points to an
overvaluation of the pound by about 1525 percent at end-2008. This methodology
utilizes a vector error correction model to
estimate the ERER using as the determining
variables oil income, net foreign assets,
openness to trade, government expenditure,
and relative productivity.
The external sustainability approach also
indicates an overvaluation of the pound.
The results range from 10-15 percent,
depending on the assumptions used. The
outcome depends on whether the objective is to keep constant the annuity from oil wealth in real terms, in
real terms per capita, or as a percent of GDP.

D. Structural Reforms and Other Issues
20.
The authorities intend to continue to advance structural reforms in order to
accelerate growth, diversify the economy, and create employment. Progress has been
made in many areas, including reducing import tariffs, shortening the import negative list,
reforming fuel and agricultural subsidies, and establishing a one-stop window for approving
private investment. Furthermore, to further liberalize current transactions, each citizen is
now allowed to purchase up to $10,000 per month from a local bank and to transfer them
abroad in payment for current transactions or credit cards bills. The authorities noted that

14

reference prices and customs duties that vary by country of origin were put in place in order
to protect against unfair trade practices.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
21.
The impact of the global financial crisis on Syria has been relatively moderate.
Preliminary data for 2009 indicate that non-oil growth decelerated as lower growth in most
sectors was only partially offset by a moderate recovery in agriculture. Inflation declined
sharply, reflecting trends in the global prices of basic commodities. Despite the important
progress made in subsidies reforms, the fiscal deficit widened as the consolidation of public
finances in the past few years provided room for the authorities to implement countercyclical measures to mitigate the effects of the global economic crisis. The current account
deficit increased slightly, as the decline in exports exceeded that of imports. Tourism
receipts, however, remained buoyant, and both FDI and remittances dropped only slightly
despite the global economic crisis.
22.
The widening in the fiscal deficit in 2009 was appropriate to mitigate the impact
of the global recession. Furthermore, this widening in the fiscal deficit in 2009 partly
reflects enhanced fiscal transparency as substantial extra-budgetary spending related to
petroleum subsidies was brought on budget. A gradual resumption of fiscal consolidation
going forward is necessary in order to preserve fiscal sustainability. In this connection, it
would be important to revisit the large increase in public investment budgeted for 2010,
especially after its large increase in 2009. This would be more in line with absorptive
capacity and would help reduce the overall fiscal deficit to about 4.5 percent of GDP.
Furthermore, the staff urges the authorities to ensure that increases in public wages are
linked to performance and to civil service reform.
23.
The commendable recent reforms of petroleum subsidies have led to
considerable efficiency gains and a reduction in waste and leakages as reflected in the
decline in domestic consumption. The replacement in December 2009 of the diesel
coupons with cash transfers is likely to enhance the targeting of assistance and consolidate
efficiency and fiscal gains. The staff encourages the authorities to prevent a re-emergence of
the large inefficient price subsidies of the past.
24.
The substantial progress in the preparation for the VAT is welcome, but
further efforts are needed. In particular, it would be important to make progress in
reorganizing tax administration, including by shifting more responsibilities to the GCTF.
The staff supports the streamlining of the tax system, and advises against a further increase
in the personal income tax rates. The staff encourages the authorities to streamline excise
taxes in line with the recommendations of past technical assistance missions.

15

25.
The efforts to improve public financial management are welcome and should
continue. The budget classification should be further enhanced to reflect standardized
economic classifications. In addition, it is important to support the plan to cast the budget
formulation and execution in a medium-term framework by further empowering the newly
established Fiscal Forecasting and Planning Units at the MoF and facilitating a more timely
flow of data and information between these units and the different departments at the MoF.
The staff encourages the authorities to expand the use of the program- and performancebased budgeting approach. It would also be important to bring on budget the remaining
quasi-fiscal operations.
26.
The staff recommends a shift in the financing of the budget deficit from bank
borrowing to issuing treasury bills. The interest rate on these bills should be marketdetermined. At the same time, it would be important to ensure that public investment projects
yield high economic and social return in order to justify the cost of their financing.
27.
The staff welcomes the progress made in implementing the reform agenda to
modernize the CBS and the monetary policy framework. Enhancing the CBS operational
independence will be important to strengthen its ability to formulate and implement monetary
policy. The staff also encourages the authorities to utilize treasury bills as an instrument of
monetary policy to withdraw excess liquidity. Otherwise, the CBS would have to issue its
own certificates of deposit. Considerations should also be given to securitizing the stock of
government debt to the CBS.
28.
Staff encourages the authorities to phase-out some of the decisions that were
taken in response to the global crisis. The legitimate intended objectives of differentiated
reserve requirements or increased credit exposure limits for development projects can be
achieved through other means that are more effective and entail lower risks for banks and
lesser burden for the supervision department.
29.
The staff welcomes the good start at implementing the recommendations of
the 2008 FSAP report, including by strengthening the regulatory and supervisory
framework and improving collection of data on public banks. The authorities are encouraged
to continue to strengthen supervision in order to maintain the health of the financial sector,
especially in view of the rapid growth of private banks’ credit. The staff also encourages the
authorities to adopt the amended central bank law as soon as possible.
30.
Priority in the period ahead should be placed on public banks’ reform. The staff
welcomes the closer collaboration between the MoF and the CBS regarding supervision of
these banks. Strengthening the CBS’s supervisory and regulatory independence with respect
to these banks would ensure their compliance with prudential regulations and help address
deficiencies identified in the supervisory process.

16

31.
The Syrian pound’s de jure peg to a band around the SDR can provide a strong
monetary anchor, while allowing some flexibility in the pound’s rate vis-à-vis major
currencies. In practice, the pound appears to be de facto pegged to a basket in which the
dollar has a larger weight than its weight in the SDR basket. Adjusting the de facto basket in
line with the de jure regime would be more consistent with Syria’s direction of trade. The
dollar has the largest share in the SDR basket, which is also consistent with the key role it
has in foreign exchange markets and international trade pricing and payments. A gradual
move toward greater flexibility over the medium-term as the monetary policy framework
develops would further increase monetary policy independence and maintain external stability.
Preliminary econometric estimates suggest that the pound may be moderately overvalued in real
effective terms, although they are still subject to uncertainties given the serious data
shortcomings. The staff, however, does not recommend a change in the current nominal
exchange rate level in the present context.
32.
The progress made in transition to a market economy is welcome, but the
remaining structural reform agenda is substantial. Emphasis should be placed on further
reducing the number of goods subject to administrative pricing, and modernizing of the legal
and regulatory framework in order to encourage private investment and enhance
competitiveness. The staff recommends that the authorities reverse the recent introduction of
customs duties that vary by country of origin, and address suspected unfair trade practices by
other measures such as enhancing customs’ capacity to examine invoices through
computerization and cross border cooperation.
33.
The staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to accept the obligations of
Article VIII of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement. The staff recommends that the authorities
remove any remaining restrictions in preparation for the acceptance of the obligations of
Article VIII. The staff stands ready to conduct a comprehensive review of the exchange
system upon the authorities’ request.
34.
Staff urges the authorities to improve data quality and provision to facilitate
better analysis of developments and guide policy formulation.
35.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreigncurrency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ The implied change in other key variables under this scenario is discussed in the text.

Exchange Rate Arrangement

The Central Bank of Syria issues on a daily basis quotations for the buying and selling
exchange rates for the Syrian pound against major currencies. The official budget exchange
rate, which was applied to all public sector transactions, was pegged to the U.S. dollar until
end-December 2006. Since the abolition of the official “budget” rate on January 1, 2007 and
its unification with the private sector exchange rate, the central bank has been managing the
value of the currency vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar within a tight trading range. The authorities
switched the reference currency from the U.S. dollar to the SDR in August 2007. The
de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a peg to a basket.

VIII. Article IV Consultations
Syria is on an annual consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation was held in
November 2008 and was completed by the Board on January 7, 2008 (SM/08/358).
IX.

Article XIV and Article VIII Restrictions

Syria continues to maintain, under Article XIV, restrictions on payments and transfers for
current international transactions, including administrative allocation of foreign exchange.
Syria also maintains exchange measures that are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII:
(i) prohibition against purchases by private parties of foreign exchange from the banking
system for some current international transactions; (ii) a multiple currency practice resulting
from divergences of more than 2 percent between the official exchange rate and officially
recognized market exchange rates; (iii) a non-interest-bearing advance import deposit
requirement of 75–100 percent for public sector imports; and (iv) an exchange restriction
arising from the net debt under inoperative bilateral payments arrangements with the Islamic
Republic of Iran, and Sri Lanka.
The Executive Board adopted decision No. 14520 (10/1) on December 30, 2009:
36.
Fund takes this decision in concluding the 2009 Article XIV consultation with the
Syrian Arab Republic.
37.
The Syrian Arab Republic continues to maintain restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions, including administrative
allocation of foreign exchange, under the transitional arrangements under Article XIV section
2, as described in EBD/09/91, Rev. 1. In addition, the Syrian Arab Republic maintains three
exchange restrictions and one multiple currency practice subject to approval under Article
VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3, as described in EBD/09/91, Rev. 1. The Fund encourages the
Syrian Arab Republic to eliminate the measures maintained under Article XIV as soon as its
balance of payments position permits, and urges the Syrian Arab Republic to eliminate the
exchange restrictions and multiple currency practice that are subject to approval under
Article VIII as soon as possible. (EBD/09/91, Rev. 1, 12/23/09) (EBD/09/91, 12/22/09)

ANNEX II. SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP2
(End-January 2010)
Syria joined the World Bank in 1947. Between 1963 and 1974, IDA approved four credits for
Syria totaling US$48.6 million. Following Syria’s graduation from IDA in 1974, IBRD
approved 15 loans during the period 1974-86. In 1986 Syria ceased debt service payments to
the Bank, which prompted a suspension of Bank disbursements. Following several rounds of
negotiations with the Bank, by July 1, 2002, Syria settled all its overdue service payments to
IBRD and IDA, thereby reinstating the country’s eligibility for disbursement.
There is currently no World Bank Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Syria. A
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) covering the period 2005-07 provided the framework
for the Bank’s program of advisory and analytical (AAA) services. The MoU allowed the
Bank to support reforms in areas of economic growth and transition, along with human
development and social protection. Activities have included, among others: (i) advise on
restructuring public banks and establishing a government securities market; (ii) FIAS support
provided in reviewing the recently adopted Investment Law; and (iii) analytical work on
energy subsidies and advise on drafting a Basic Finance Law and improving public financial
management.
The Bank’s current assistance to Syria comprises a program of technical assistance and
advisory services in support of economic growth and transition, including policy advice on
private sector development, as well as on human development, social protection and
environmental sustainability. Activities cover the following areas:
 Economic Growth and Transition Support. Trade policy reform; Public Expenditure
policies; Sources of non-oil growth (Country Economic Memorandum); Private sector
development and business environment; Public – Private Partnerships (PPP); Governance
and Public Financial Management Reform; Statistical capacity.
 Human Development and Social Protection. Labor market and employment; Enhancing
policymaking and implementation capacity in social protection; Reform options for social
insurance; Education sector strategy, Support to avian influenza preparedness.
 Sustainable Development. Electricity sector strategy; Agriculture and irrigation sector
reform; Transport sector technical assistance.
IFC has been active in Syria since 1999 when the Board approved the corporation’s first
investment in the country—a $1 million equity stake in a manufacturer of drip irrigation
systems. Since that time, IFC has made two other investments, including an equity position
in the first private sector bank in Syria and a loan to a chemicals company. The total held
portfolio is $20.2 million. IFC has also conducted technical assistance work, including
studies of aspects of the financial sector.

World Bank TA mission focusing on trade, fiscal issues, and the development of a SAM for Syria will
overlap with the 2008 Article IV Consultation mission, facilitating Bank-Fund coordination.

ANNEX III. SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data provision has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance. The
weak statistical infrastructure has been unable to cope with the acceleration of structural
reforms, and the inherent difficulties in recording the flows of people, goods, and money to and
from Iraq have added to this challenge. The staff’s assessment of economic developments and
policies is constrained by these circumstances. In the context of Article IV missions, the
authorities have expressed an intention to improve the statistical system. With the assistance of
the 2007 multisector statistics mission, Syria began participating in the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS) in December 2007, and the plans for improving the statistical
system are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board.
A. Real Sector Statistics
2.
Annual national accounts by expenditure data are reported for publication in the
International Financial Statistics (IFS) with about 2-years lag. In addition, significant
weaknesses remain in the source data and statistical techniques for national accounts statistics.
3.
A STA-resident statistics advisor has been in place since July 2008 to help implement
the recommendations of the December 2007 STA multisector mission in the area of national
accounts. During the past two years, METAC has also provided technical assistance for
improving data sources and methods for the compilation of national accounts statistics in
accordance with the System of National Accounts, 1993 (1993 SNA). Guidance has also being
provided for using existing data for improving gross domestic product (GDP) estimates at
current and constant prices and for the appropriate treatment in the national accounts of implicit
subsidies to some public enterprises. The Central Bureau of Statistics (CBStat) made a steady
progress for implementing recommendations made by the technical assistance missions.
Economic surveys covering private sector enterprises had been conducted for years 2004–2006.
The central purpose of these surveys was to serve as main data source for improving national
accounts statistics in accordance with the 1993 SNA; however, the results are yet to be fully
processed and validated.
B. Government Finance Statistics
4.
Government finance statistics (GFS) suffer from major deficiencies with respect
to definitions, coverage, classification, methodology, accuracy, reliability, and timeliness
that generate severe inconsistencies with monetary and balance of payments statistics. Fiscal
statistics are not provided for publication in the IFS. The multisector mission of June 2004
found that compilation is adversely affected by cumbersome institutional arrangements,
inadequate resources, and unresolved methodological problems. The methodology used for
compilation does not follow either GFSM 2001 or GFSM 1986. While budget data are available
with very long lags (two years for final budget accounts), financing data are not available. There
is no dissemination of GFS data, and even access to key data sources by GFS compilers within
the Ministry of Finance (MOF), such as the breakdown of debt service into interest and

31
amortization, is problematic. This contributes to discrepancies in external financing as reported
in the budget and the balance of payments statistics.
5.
The largest, most persistent and volatile discrepancies, are between the financing
requirements of the budget, as reported by the MOF, and government financing as reported by
the Central Bank of Syria (CBS). The lack of a common and regularly updated coverage of the
government sector between the MOF and the CBS, misclassification of public enterprises
investment expenditure, as well as timing and valuation issues, are mainly responsible for those
discrepancies.
6.
Other discrepancies between fiscal and monetary accounts relate to the unorthodox
treatment by the CBS of some transactions with government, such as the parallel rise of
government deposits and claims on government in the CBS balance sheet, which is likely due to
government withdrawals being counted as credit and never netted out against deposits, and
profits transferred to government treated as permanent claim on the government.
7.
To address the methodological issues, the June 2004 multisector mission developed a
preliminary bridge table that maps the budgetary source data codes to the GFSM 2001
classification codes, and conducted a seminar to clarify various aspects of the GFSM 2001
methodology to the MOF officials. To help the Directorate of Planning and Statistics (DPS)
implement a proper sectorization scheme, the mission provided an updated institutional table
showing the current coverage of government and public enterprises―the investment
expenditure of public enterprises is included in government’s capital expenditure―for
circulation to all relevant agencies. Moreover, the mission formulated a detailed work plan
centered around the provision of adequate resources and training for the DPS to fulfill its tasks.
The work plan calls for the DPS to access core source data necessary for compilation―initially
on a cash basis―of annual GFS data according to the GFSM 2001, and for the resumption
of data reporting to STA for publication in GFSY and IFS, together with improved reporting, in
terms of coverage and classification, to the IMF’s Middle East and Central Asia Department
(MCD). The mission also recommended improvement in the timeliness of annual data,
including data on financing, and a start on the compilation of sub-annual data.
C. Monetary and Financial Statistics
8.
Monetary statistics suffer from major deficiencies which hamper the staff’s ability to
conduct meaningful analysis of monetary developments. Monthly monetary statistics are
reported for publication in the IFS with about 10-month lags, falling short of recommended
dissemination practices under the GDDS of 3-month lags. Progress has been made in addressing
some issues identified by the multisector statistics mission in June 2004, namely including in the
monetary survey the private banks, the Savings Bank, and banks/bank branches operating in the
Free Zones. Although the format of monetary statistics is largely consistent with the structure of
the MFSM-recommended sectoral surveys, there are deficiencies in the source data arising from,
inter alia, (i) the use of different exchange rates at the CBS and at the other banks for valuing

32
their foreign-currency positions; (ii) financial positions are not valued at market prices or
market-price equivalents; (iii) a number of accounting procedures for the maintenance of public
sector accounts cause distortions in the measurement of gross positions; and (iv) there are
disparities between the institutional coverage of public sector in monetary statistics and the
government finance statistics.
9.
A technical assistance mission during November–December 2008 worked with the
authorities on developing data reporting based on the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs), which
reflect the MFSM-recommended compilation principles. The mission’s work was underpinned
by detailed data recently provided by the authorities.
D. External Sector Statistics
10.
Balance of payments statistics are compiled by the CBS on a provisional basis. Trade
data are compiled monthly by the Customs Department and reported quarterly by the CBStat in
local currency units with a six-month lag. The BOP is presented in BPM5 format, but its
compilation method is not entirely consistent with the BPM5 methodology.
11.
In February 2006, a STA assessment mission assessed the status of the work program as
a basis for developing a METAC technical assistance program on external sector statistics. In
December 2007, STA conducted a multisector statistics mission in collaboration with METAC
and follow-up METAC missions took place in January and July 2008.
12.
In September 2008, a STA inspection visit followed up on the recommendations of the
2007 multisector mission and METAC’s work program and discussed the reporting and
publication of data on international liquidity for IFS, which has been an outstanding issue for
over three years.
13.
Regarding the balance of payments, the mission found that the CBS had made progress
in improving source statistics through surveys and International Transactions Reporting System
(ITRS), by adopting appropriate classifications, and improving consistency with other data sets.
The CBS’s new organizational structure is designed to include a balance of payments division
of five staff (currently two staff are assigned to BOP work but plans are in place to fully staff
the division).
14.
The October 2008 STA balance of payments statistics mission worked to provide advice
on international reserves, trade data, and the treatment of Iraqi immigrants was provided, to the
extent possible. Data for 2007 were adjusted where needed and the mission assisted the CBS
staff to compile January‒July 2008 balance of payments in BPM5 format.
15.
Despite recent progress, further efforts are needed to improve the accuracy of the BOP
data and the International Investment Position (IIP) to meet data needs for surveillance
purposes, in particular; (i) continue data collection initiatives (ITRS and surveys) that have
been developed with a view to strengthening source data, and ensuring coverage of free zones,

33
(ii) improve the undercoverage of imports, (iii) examine the scope of transfers, including the
treatment of inflows related to Iraqi immigrants, (iv) review the coverage of reserves, and (iv)
improve the coverage of financial account data of the private sector (bank and nonbank).
16.
The authorities have made some progress in the compilation of international
merchandise trade statistics. The Customs Department has adopted Automated System for
Customs Data (ASYCUDA) as its operating system and is presently implementing it and a
Statistical Committee on Foreign Trade Statistics has been formed to assist with trade
methodology. However, significant weaknesses remain in the source data and statistical
techniques for foreign trade statistics.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with
the Syrian Arab Republic
On February 26, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Syrian Arab Republic on a lapse of time
basis.1
Background
The impact of the global financial crisis on Syria has been relatively moderate and mostly
through linkages to trading partners in the GCC and Europe. GDP growth is estimated to
have decelerated in 2009 by 1 percentage point to 4 percent. Lower growth in
manufacturing, construction, and services was partially offset by a moderate recovery in
agriculture and a small increase in oil production. Unemployment is estimated to have
increased to almost 11 percent. Inflation declined sharply to about 2.5 percent, reflecting
trends in global prices. Fiscal policy aimed at mitigating the impact of the global crisis.
The Fiscal deficit increased by about 2.5 percentage points to 5.5 percent in 2009. Total
expenditure grew by about 5 percent of GDP, reflecting increases in public investments,
as well as the wage bill and transfers to compensate for raising fuel prices and removal of
petroleum subsidies. Non-oil revenue increased, partly due to strong tax collection, which
resulted from improved administration and incentives to settle arrears.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and
discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters,
the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the
conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views
of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.

36

The external current account deficit widened to about 4.5 percent, as the decline in
exports exceeded that of imports. However, tourism receipts were buoyant, and both FDI
and remittances dropped only slightly. Gross reserves remained comfortable, at about
US$17 billion.
With the Syrian pound pegged to a basket (within a band), broad money is estimated to
have grown by about 10 percent in 2009. Credit to public enterprises decelerated sharply
due to the reduction in energy subsidies, which were financed by borrowing. Nonetheless,
growth of credit to the private sector remained at about 25 percent, driven by the
expansion of private banks.
The outlook for 2010 and beyond point to an overall strengthening in economic
performance. The ongoing recovery in Syria’s trading partners is expected to contribute to
a gradual increase in exports, remittances, and FDI. Agriculture is likely to continue to
recover from the severe drought of the past two years. The fiscal and current account are
expected to stabilize as a result of the fiscal reforms, including the introduction of value
added tax (VAT) in 2011, a further deepening of subsidies reform, and expenditure
restraint. A delay in global recovery or faltering reform implementation could worsen the
outlook and impede Syria’s economic growth.
While some progress has been made in advancing structural reforms, there were a few
negative developments. Steps were taken to simplify investment procedures, modernize
accounting standards, and streamline the tax system. Effective June 2009, the authorities
raised the minimum thresholds for exemption from wage taxes. As an offsetting measure,
the top income tax rate for individuals was increased to 22 percent (from 20 percent). The
authorities also introduced reference prices and customs duties that vary by country of
origin to protect against unfair trade practices.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors concurred that the impact of the global financial crisis on Syria has
been relatively moderate. Preliminary data for 2009 indicate that non-oil growth
decelerated as lower growth in most sectors was only partially offset by a moderate
recovery in agriculture. Inflation declined sharply, reflecting trends in the global prices of
basic commodities. Despite the important progress made in subsidies reforms, the fiscal
deficit widened as the consolidation of public finances in the past few years provided
room for the authorities to implement counter-cyclical measures to mitigate the effects of
the global economic crisis. The current account deficit increased slightly, as the decline in
exports exceeded that of imports. Tourism receipts, however, remained buoyant, and
both FDI and remittances dropped only slightly despite the global economic crisis.
Directors considered the widening in the fiscal deficit in 2009 to be appropriate to mitigate
the impact of the global recession. They noted that this widening in the fiscal deficit
in 2009 partly reflects enhanced fiscal transparency as substantial extra-budgetary
spending related to petroleum subsidies was brought on budget. However, Directors

37

underscored the need for a gradual resumption of fiscal consolidation going forward in
order to preserve fiscal sustainability. In this regard, they encouraged the authorities to
revisit the large increase in public investment budgeted for 2010, especially after its large
increase in 2009. They noted that this would be more in line with absorptive capacity and
would help reduce the overall fiscal deficit to about 4.5 percent of GDP. Directors also
urged the authorities to ensure that increases in public wages are linked to performance
and to civil service reform.
Directors commended the authorities for the recent reforms of petroleum subsidies that
have led to considerable efficiency gains and a reduction in waste and leakages as
reflected in the decline in domestic consumption. They noted that the replacement in
December 2009 of the diesel coupons with cash transfers is likely to enhance the
targeting of assistance and consolidate efficiency and fiscal gains. Directors encouraged
the authorities to prevent a re-emergence of the large inefficient price subsidies of the
past.
Directors welcomed the substantial progress in the preparation for the VAT, but
underscored the need for further efforts. They supported the emphasis on making
progress in reorganizing tax administration, including by shifting more responsibilities to
the General Commission for Taxes and Fees (GCTF). Directors welcomed the
streamlining of the tax system, and advised against a further increase in the personal
income tax rates. They encouraged the authorities to streamline excise taxes in line with
the recommendations of past technical assistance missions.
Directors welcomed the efforts to improve public financial management are welcome and
should continue. They recommended that the budget classification be further enhanced to
reflect standardized economic classifications. In addition, Directors underscored the
importance of supporting the plan to cast the budget formulation and execution in a
medium-term framework by further empowering the newly established Fiscal Forecasting
and Planning Units at the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and facilitating a more timely flow of
data and information between these units and the different departments at the MoF.
Directors encouraged the authorities to expand the use of the program- and performancebased budgeting approach. They also emphasized the importance of bringing on budget
the remaining quasi-fiscal operations.
Directors underscored the need for a shift in the financing of the budget deficit from bank
borrowing to issuing treasury bills. They recommended that the interest rate on these bills
be market-determined. At the same time, Directors underscored the importance of
ensuring that public investment projects yield high economic and social return in order to
justify the cost of their financing.
Directors welcomed the progress made in implementing the reform agenda to modernize
the Central Bank of Syria (CBS) and the monetary policy framework. They noted that
enhancing the CBS operational independence will be important to strengthen its ability to

38

formulate and implement monetary policy. Directors also encouraged the authorities to
utilize treasury bills as an instrument of monetary policy to withdraw excess liquidity. They
recommended that, otherwise, the CBS would have to issue its own certificates of
deposit. Directors concurred that considerations be given to securitizing the stock of
government debt to the CBS.
Directors encouraged the authorities to phase-out some of the decisions that were taken
in response to the global crisis. They recommended that the legitimate intended
objectives of differentiated reserve requirements or increased credit exposure limits for
development projects be achieved through other means that are more effective and entail
lower risks for banks and lesser burden for the supervision department.
Directors welcomed the good start at implementing the recommendations of the 2008
FSAP report, including by strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework and
improving collection of data on public banks. They encouraged the authorities to continue
to strengthen supervision in order to maintain the health of the financial sector, especially
in view of the rapid growth of private banks’ credit. Directors also encouraged the
authorities to adopt the amended central bank law as soon as possible.
Directors concurred that the priority in the period ahead be given to public banks’ reform.
They welcomed the closer collaboration between the MoF and the CBS regarding
supervision of these banks. Directors noted that strengthening the CBS’s supervisory and
regulatory independence with respect to these banks would ensure their compliance with
prudential regulations and help address deficiencies identified in the supervisory process.
Directors agreed that the Syrian pound’s de jure peg to a band around the SDR can
provide a strong monetary anchor, while allowing some flexibility in the pound’s rate vis-àvis major currencies. They noted that in practice, the pound appears to be de facto
pegged to a basket in which the dollar has a larger weight than its weight in the
SDR basket. Directors concurred that adjusting the de facto basket in line with the de jure
regime would be more consistent with Syria’s direction of trade. They noted that the dollar
has the largest share in the SDR basket, which is also consistent with the key role it has
in foreign exchange markets and international trade pricing and payments. Directors
considered that a gradual move toward greater flexibility over the medium-term as the
monetary policy framework develops would further increase monetary policy
independence and maintain external stability. Directors agreed that preliminary
econometric estimates suggest that the pound may be moderately overvalued in real
effective terms, although they are still subject to uncertainties given the serious data
shortcomings. Directors, however, did not recommend a change in the current nominal
exchange rate level in the present context.
Directors welcomed the progress made in transition to a market economy, but noted that
the remaining structural reform agenda is substantial. They supported the emphasis on
further reducing the number of goods subject to administrative pricing, and modernizing of

39

the legal and regulatory framework in order to encourage private investment and enhance
competitiveness. Directors recommended that the authorities reverse the recent
introduction of customs duties that vary by country of origin, and address suspected unfair
trade practices by other measures such as enhancing customs’ capacity to examine
invoices through computerization and cross border cooperation.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to accept the obligations of Article VIII of the
IMF’s Articles of Agreement. They recommended that the authorities remove any
remaining restrictions in preparation for the acceptance of the obligations of Article VIII.
Directors noted the staff readiness to conduct a comprehensive review of the exchange
system upon the authorities’ request.
Directors urged the authorities to improve data quality and provision to facilitate better
analysis of developments and guide policy formulation.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
