STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION
KEY ISSUES
Context: The Gambia is still recovering from the severe 2011 drought. Although growth
has been picking up, weaknesses in the balance of payments have persisted, leading to
depreciation pressures on the Gambian dalasi. Most recently, inconsistent policies have
exacerbated these pressures. Large fiscal deficits and a heavy debt burden continue to
pose major challenges. The Gambian Programme for Accelerated Growth and
Employment (PAGE) emphasizes fiscal adjustment, together with infrastructure
investment and structural reforms to support inclusive growth.
Outlook and risks: Despite near-term uncertainties, the medium-term outlook for
growth is generally favorable. The main downside risk arises from possible fiscal
slippages. There is also strong upside potential if critical reforms are achieved. In the
near term, however, policy inconsistencies need to be reduced.
Near-term stabilization: Ongoing monetary tightening needs to be supported by the
fiscal adjustment mapped out in the PAGE. Directives that interfere with the flexible
exchange rate policy have been counterproductive and should be avoided.
Fiscal adjustment: Fiscal adjustment is needed to ease the heavy debt burden, arising
mainly from domestic debt. Strengthening tax administration, the budget process, and
expenditure control would provide space for growth-enhancing spending.
Promoting inclusive growth and competitiveness: Execution of the PAGE, supported
by commitments from development partners, would help reduce poverty, especially in
rural areas, given a strong focus on agriculture.
Fund Relations: The authorities’ economic program—based upon the PAGE—is
supported by a three-year arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF)
approved by Executive Directors in May 2012. After some delays, the first review of the
ECF-supported program was completed in May 2013. The mission for the second review
is expected to take place in October 2013.

THE GAMBIA

BACKGROUND: ROBUST GROWTH, BUT INCREASING
RISK'S TO MACROECONOMIC STABILITY
1.
The Gambian economy has performed well over the past several years, although it is still
recovering from a severe drought in 2011 (Tables 1–7, Figure 1). Between 2007 and 2010, real GDP
growth averaged just over 6 percent a year, driven largely by an extended expansion in agriculture and
investment in telecommunications. The drought, however, led to a 45 percent drop in crop production
and a contraction in real GDP of just over 4 percent in 2011. The economy picked up the following year,
as the tourism sector gained momentum and agriculture began to rebound (crop production increased
by 30 percent). Inflation has ranged between 2½ and 7 percent (year-on-year) since 2007, as the
Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG) generally exercised monetary restraint. Nevertheless, there have been
periods of monetary expansion driven by fiscal dominance. Since late 2012, inflation has been rising
steadily (to 5.8 percent year-on-year in June 2013), as the authorities turned to central bank financing of
the fiscal deficit.
2.
Large fiscal deficits have led to excessive domestic borrowing in recent years. After
achieving a surplus in 2007, the overall fiscal balance fell sharply into deficit, exceeding 6 percent of
GDP by 2010. Government revenues (relative to GDP) fell by 2½ percentage points of GDP during this
period, to less than 15 percent of GDP in 2010, with collections declining from all major tax categories.
Episodes of large extrabudgetary expenditures also factored into the growing fiscal deficit, which was
mostly financed by domestic borrowing (nearly 5 percent of GDP in 2010). Beginning in 2011, the
authorities set out on a gradual fiscal adjustment to get government’s domestic borrowing under
control, but progress stalled the following year. In 2012, both the fiscal deficit and net domestic
borrowing (NDB) were roughly unchanged, with the latter at 3½ percent of GDP or roughly twice the
budgeted target.1
3.
Costly domestic debt has added to the government’s heavy debt burden. As of end-2012,
total government debt stood at 77 percent of GDP, of which 34 percent of GDP was domestic debt.
Interest on debt has consumed a rising share of
government resources, reaching 22½ percent of
government revenues in 2012, of which nearly
18½ percentage points was paid on domestic debt.
Moreover, domestic debt consists mostly of shortterm Treasury bills, which creates substantial rollover
risk. On the external side, despite having received
extensive debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor

Extrabudgetary spending on drought relief accounted for 0.7 percent of GDP of additional NDB in 2012.

THE GAMBIA

Countries (HIPC) Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), The Gambia remained at
high risk of debt distress, until quite recently when the classification improved to moderate.2
4.
The Gambia’s external position has weakened over the years. Once a leading trade center,
The Gambia’s role as an entrepôt diminished considerably with the harmonization of external tariffs in
the region and efficiency improvements in competing port facilities, notably in Senegal. Large fiscal
deficits have also contributed to a widening of the
current account deficit, which has mostly been financed
by non-debt creating capital inflows, notably, FDI and
project grants, as well as budget support grants.3
Bolstered by the Fund’s one-time SDR allocation
in 2009, The Gambia has maintained gross international
reserves at about 4½-5 months of import cover in
recent years. In 2012, in the aftermath of the drought,4
the external current account deficit (excluding grants) is
estimated to have jumped to nearly 20 percent of GDP,
as import requirements for food and seeds surged and groundnut exports collapsed. Although
international aid agencies and donors provided grants for drought relief, the dalasi started to face
depreciation pressures around mid-2012.
5.
Depreciation pressures on the Gambian dalasi intensified in 2013. Weaknesses in the
balance of payments (BOP) have persisted, following another below-average harvest in 2012.5 At the
same time donor assistance to help alleviate food shortages was sharply curtailed. Perhaps more
importantly, though, the emergence of policy inconsistencies appears to have shaken confidence in the
Gambian economy. A series of exchange rate directives that temporarily imposed over-valued fixed
exchange rates—issued in October 2012, June 2013, and again in July 2013—caused severe disruptions
in the foreign exchange market (Box 1). In the first two cases when the directives were lifted, the dalasi
depreciated sharply amid signs of capital flight and a dampening of remittances.6 Moreover, the largerthan-budgeted fiscal deficit in 2012 has halted progress toward fiscal consolidation, while the CBG’s
financing of the deficit contributed to an acceleration of money growth, which likely added to the pickup in inflation and exchange rate depreciation.7
2

See the recent debt sustainability analysis by World Bank and Fund staff (Country Report No. 13/139, Supplementary 1).

3

The quality of external sector data is poor. Fund staff estimates differ considerably from the authorities’ figures.

4

The harvest season takes place during Q4 and thus impacts exports and imports of the following calendar year.

5

Although crop production grew by 30 percent in 2012, the harvest was little more than half of the 2010 harvest.

6

The first two directives were both lifted after about 2-3 weeks. LEG, in consultation with MCM, is assessing if the second,
third, and fourth directives give rise to exchange restrictions or multiple currency practice (MCP) in breach of The
Gambia’s obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3, and resulting in the non-observance of the continuous
performance criterion under the current ECF arrangement for The Gambia. The fourth directive, which overrides the third
directive, is still in effect.
7

Money growth was concentrated in currency in circulation. Deposit growth was dampened by a rundown on time
deposits by the Social Security and Housing Finance Corporation (SSHFC) to finance other investments in transportation
and real estate development.

THE GAMBIA

Box 1. Exchange Rate Directives, 2012–13
Between October 2012 and August 2013, the Office of the President issued a series of directives that
imposed exchange rates appreciated relative to the market rate and other restrictions on the foreign
exchange (FX) market, ostensibly to eliminate speculation and illegal FX trading by unlicensed dealers.


October 22–November 15, 2012. Targeted an exchange rate of 28 GMD/USD compared
with the prevailing market rate of about 34 GMD/USD. Initially shipments of foreign
currencies were restricted, but this restriction was lifted after one day. Hoarding of FX was
banned and FX bureaus and unlicensed dealers were monitored by enforcement agents.



June 26–July 15, 2013. Targeted an exchange rate of 30-33 GMD/USD compared with the
prevailing market rate of about 37-39 GMD/USD. Initially shipments of foreign currencies
were restricted, but this restriction was lifted after one week. Hoarding of FX was banned and
FX bureaus and unlicensed dealers were monitored by enforcement agents.



July 26–August 14, 2013. Targeted an exchange rate of 37 GMD/USD, compared prevailing
market rate of about 40 GMD/USD. There were no restrictions of shipments of foreign
currencies by commercial banks. Once again, hoarding of FX was banned.



August 14, 2013–present. Overriding the previous directive, targets an exchange rate of

35 GMD/USD. Licenses of FX bureaus were declared null and void. Bureaus can apply to
the CBG for new licenses.
6.
Prior to the drought, The Gambia made significant progress in the fight against
poverty; however, poverty is still widespread. In particular, the expansion in agriculture was
critical in reducing the incidence of poverty from 58 percent in 2003 to 48½ percent in 2010.8
Various social indicators have shown strong improvement (Table 8), notably in education (primary
school enrollment and completion and youth literacy rates) and health (immunization and child and
maternal mortality rates). Good progress is also being made towards meeting selected millennium
development goals (Table 8).Despite this progress, nearly half of the population remains in poverty,
and the figure is still considerably higher in rural areas. Inequality and unemployment, especially
among the youth, also pose major challenges. In late 2011, the Gambian authorities launched the
Programme to Accelerate Growth and Employment (PAGE), a new poverty reduction strategy that
emphasized agriculture and investment in infrastructure to help boost incomes, particularly for the
rural poor. Undoubtedly, low crop production since the 2011 drought has been a major setback in
the fight against rural poverty.

8

The figures are based on the national poverty lines set at US$1.00 a day and US$1.25 a day (in current US dollars)
for 2003 and 2010, respectively. These figures are not directly comparable with the poverty incidence figures
calculated using the Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) approach.

Box 2: 2011 Article IV Consultation and New Arrangement under the Fund’s Extended
Credit Facility (ECF)
The Gambia’s 2011 Article IV consultation was concluded on January 18, 2012. Policy recommendations were consistent with
the Gambian authorities’ new poverty reduction strategy, the Programme for Accelerated Growth and Employment (PAGE)—
which was launched in December 2011. The corresponding macroeconomic policy framework and structural agenda were
later supported by a new three-year ECF arrangement approved by Executive Directors on May 25, 2012. Recommendations
focused on addressing risks arising from the government’s heavy debt burden, particularly the high cost and rollover risk of
domestic debt. These included:



Gradually reduce the fiscal deficit, so that government’s net domestic borrowing falls to ½ percent of GDP by 2014.



Pursue a comprehensive tax reform over the medium term—including introduction of a value-added tax (VAT)—to
rebuild revenues and improve competitiveness; Strengthen revenue administration.



Strengthen budget procedures and expenditure control.



Improve debt management.

Other recommendations included: eliminate fiscal dominance and develop tools for liquidity management; maintain intensive
surveillance of the banking system; maintain a flexible exchange rate policy and ample international reserves; pursue
structural reform and infrastructure investments for inclusive growth; improve economic statistics.
Advances in line with these recommendations include:



VAT implemented in January 2013; comprehensive tax reform has been debated; compliance by large taxpayers
improved.



Strategic plans developed for selected ministries (pilot cases)—initial step toward a medium-term expenditure
framework (MTEF); external debt data base and projections of debt service obligations improved.



Fiscal dominance reduced.



Annual intensive surveillance of the banking system carried out; although 2013 exercise still pending.



Major infrastructure investment in telecommunications completed. Support approved by development partners for
transportation infrastructure and agriculture.

However, policy implementation has weakened in some areas.



Substantial fiscal slippage in 2012, largely from extrabudgetary spending and lapses in expenditure control.



Flexible exchange rate policy compromised by exchange rate directives; slow growth in international reserves.



Liquidity management tools still not operational.



National energy strategy yet to be updated.



Quality of economic statistics has not improved.

THE GAMBIA

OUTLOOK AND RISKS FOR THE GAMBIAN ECONOMY
7.
Based on a prudent macroeconomic policy framework in line with the PAGE, growth
prospects for the Gambian economy are favorable; albeit with significant risks. Real GDP
growth is projected to increase modestly to 6-6½ percent in 2013, driven by further recovery in
agriculture.9 Growth continues to be strong in the tourism sector, but other sectors are likely to be
subdued. Over the medium term, real GDP growth is projected to be elevated through 2015, when
crop production is assumed to fully recover to its pre-drought level. Thereafter, real GDP growth is
projected to return to trend (about 5½ percent a year).10 Inflation is projected to continue rising in
the months ahead to about 7 percent (year-on-year) by end-2013, but is then expected to be limited
to around 5 percent a year—the CBG’s objective—over the medium term.
8.
As specified in the PAGE, the macroeconomic policy framework underlying the
baseline scenario is anchored upon a fiscal adjustment that reduces government’s domestic
borrowing needs. The overall fiscal deficit is projected to fall to 1½-2 percent of GDP a year
beginning in 2014, while the net domestic borrowing will be limited to ½ percent of GDP. Over the
medium term, this would ease pressure on the government’s heavy debt burden, essentially
eliminate crowding out of credit to the private sector, and eventually create fiscal savings from lower
interest costs that could be directed to spending on PAGE priorities. For 2013, the deficit is to be cut
to about 2½ percent of GDP, while NDB is limited to the budget target of 1.9 percent of GDP
in 2013 as envisaged under the authorities’ program supported by the ECF.11 Reducing the deficit
would also help strengthen the balance of payments and allow the CBG to gradually rebuild its
gross international reserves to 5 months of imports, which is consistent with staff’s estimates of an
adequate level of reserves (Appendix II)—by 2018.
9.
There are significant downside risks to this baseline outlook (Table 8), but there is also
strong upside potential. Staff’s analysis of alternative scenarios indicates that the main downside
risk arises from possible fiscal slippages (Figures 2-5). Failure to achieve the planned fiscal
adjustment and reduction in government’s NDB could put macroeconomic policies on an
unsustainable path, especially given the high rollover needs of domestic debt. Spillover effects of a
possible prolonged global economic slowdown, particularly in the Euro zone, however, would be
mixed. The negative impact on tourism and remittances would largely be offset by lower commodity
prices for imports of food and fuel. The Gambia is vulnerable to adverse commodity price shocks,
9

Crop production is expected to increase by 30-35 percent this year, which would yield a harvest of about ¾ of the
2010 pre-drought level. Under normal weather conditions, crop production is expected to grow by about 25 percent
and 10 percent in 2014 and 2015, respectively, before returning to trend of about 5½ percent a year, thereafter.
10

The baseline projection assumes that growth rates in non-agricultural sectors mostly return to trend beginning in
2014. Given the high volatility of past growth rates, trend is defined as the median growth rate in each sector from
2005 to 2012. The telecom sector is one exception, where projected growth runs above historical trend, because of
the recent completion of a major infrastructure project in the sector.
11

This target includes an increase of 0.3 percent of GDP from the original target to accommodate a shortfall of donor
assistance for the 2013 census, in line with the adjuster incorporated in the program supported by the ECF. Based on
preliminary data, NDB was slightly above target through end-June.

10

but the severity of the impact depends on whether the shock is passed through to domestic prices.
If there is no pass-through, an increase in world oil prices would not only have a more severe impact
on the balance of payments, but would also have negative fiscal effects from increased subsidies. As
evident from the 2011 drought, natural disasters also pose major risks to the economy’s agricultural
base. On the upside, structural reforms and major infrastructure investments supported by
development partners could lift medium-term growth significantly above the baseline.12

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
10.
The Article IV discussions took place during a highly fluid period for The Gambia’s
economic policy making. Immediate attention was focused on steps to stabilize the dalasi through
a tightening of macroeconomic policies. There was also active use of executive directives on the
exchange rate and government expenditures during the course of the discussions. Discussions on
the medium-term agenda focused on establishing a sound macroeconomic foundation to support
high growth and poverty reduction. The issues centered on adhering to an appropriate path for
fiscal adjustment, shoring up government revenues, strengthening public financial management,
employing market-based monetary policy instruments, facilitating financial intermediation,
maintaining a flexible exchange rate policy, enhancing international competitiveness through
structural reforms, and improving economic statistics. Major impediments to international
competitiveness, as well as to doing business more generally, include a costly and complicated tax
system, limited access to financing, and poor infrastructure, particularly in the electricity and
transportation sectors.

THE GAMBIA

A. Near-Term Agenda: Stabilizing the Dalasi and Rebuilding Confidence
11.
Staff’s view. A two-pronged approach for tightening macroeconomic policies is
needed to immediately stabilize the dalasi and rebuild confidence in the economy. First,
tighten monetary policy through an aggressive campaign to shift financing of government deficits
back to the market, rather than central bank financing. The weekly T-bill auctions should aim for
issuances in excess of the government’s net borrowing requirement, so that going forward the CBG
reduces its current holdings. Rising yields would attract investor interest and stem—or possibly
reverse—capital flight and dampen depreciation pressures. Second, achieve fiscal discipline. While
monetary tightening is needed to stop the bleeding, adhering to the fiscal adjustment is needed to
heal the wound. Curtailing government borrowing in line with existing targets is essential to restore
confidence that fiscal policy is returning to a sustainable path. Additionally, the government could
take some highly visible actions for revenue building or cost cutting. It is also important that the
government establish an effective communications strategy to inform investors and the general
public of policy implementation.13
12.
In addition to tightening macroeconomic policies, it is critical that recent exchange
rate directives are rescinded and a flexible exchange rate policy is maintained. By imposing an
over-valued exchange rate, the directives create an expectation of an upcoming dalasi depreciation,
which undermines the effectiveness of monetary tightening as a tool for containing/reversing capital
flight. An over-valued exchange rate would also seriously threaten The Gambia’s competitiveness for
the upcoming tourism season.
13.
Authorities’ view. The Gambian authorities agreed that a tightening of
macroeconomic policies is needed to restore stability to the dalasi; however, steps taken thus
far have differed from staff’s advice. The authorities’ first step was to tighten monetary policy by
increasing the policy rate twice (May and June 2013) and raising the reserve requirement on
deposits (from 12 percent to 15 percent) in late June.14 Yields on T-bills have subsequently been
driven up (by about 400 basis points). On the fiscal side, the authorities agreed to the importance of
disciplined budget execution, but noted that it was difficult to fully control spending, particularly
expenditures ordered by directives. The authorities described the exchange rate directives as
political decisions aimed at discouraging speculative elements in the market; they did not represent
a switch to a fixed exchange rate regime.

13

Based on preliminary data, NDB was slightly above target through end-June, but there has been no public
statement to that effect. Performance after the mid-year target is questionable.
14

The CBG raised the reserve requirement from 10 percent to 12 percent in late May. Preliminary data indicate that,
to a large extent, commercial banks ran down their holdings of T-bills in order to meet the reserve requirement. At
the same time, the CBG increased its holdings of T-bills, as well as its international reserves.

B. Medium-Term Policy Framework: Addressing Risks and Impediments to
Growth
Fiscal policy
14.
There was broad agreement that fiscal adjustment is necessary to achieve
sustainability and eventually reduce the high costs and heavy burden of government’s
domestic debt. Major tax measures thus far in 2013—the implementation of a new value-added tax
(VAT) and renewed fuel price adjustments to eliminate remaining subsidies15—reflect a strong effort
to build up government revenues. There was also broad agreement on public financial management
reforms to enhance the budget process by developing strategic plans for each ministry and
eventually implementing a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF). However, there were
differing views on the way forward, particularly on the path for NDB and further tax reform.
15.
Staff’s view. To restore the momentum of fiscal consolidation, the authorities should
adhere to the fiscal targets as set out in the 2013 budget and the PAGE. After the slippages
in 2012, adhering to the targets set in the 2013 budget would be a strong statement that fiscal
adjustment remains a top priority. And, given its prominence as the anchor to the macroeconomic
policy framework, it would be important to stick to the original target of limiting NDB to ½ percent
of GDP in 2014 and beyond, as stipulated in the PAGE. By following this path, domestic debt could
be reduced to less than 20 percent of GDP by 2018, which would generate substantial fiscal savings
from lower interest costs. To achieve these goals would require a further buildup in tax revenues and
spending discipline. While it is envisaged that the overall fiscal deficit would need to be reduced to
about 1½-2 percent of GDP a year, there is some scope for a higher deficit, if external financing is
available on concessional terms in line with recommendations from the recent joint Bank-Fund staff
debt sustainability analysis (Country Report No. 13/139, Supplement 1).
16.
In addition to building up revenues, a comprehensive tax reform is needed to enhance
economic growth and international competitiveness. Tax revenues in The Gambia are low
compared with other countries, as well as The Gambia’s own past (Appendix III), and are insufficient
especially given the demands for government spending under the PAGE. Recent tax measures—the
VAT and elimination of fuel subsidies16—are expected to yield an additional ½ percentage point of
GDP in 2014, but beyond that additional tax reform would be needed. In line with recent Fund
technical assistance,17 staff recommended reforms aimed at broadening the tax base and
simplification. Broadening would make the tax system more buoyant. Moreover, successfully
15

Fuel subsidies averaged about 6 percent of the full pass-through prices in early 2013. In a supplementary budget
to finance new expenditures approved in June 2013, the authorities re-instituted regular monthly price adjustments
until the subsidies are completely eliminated (most likely in 2014, given recent increases in world prices and the
dalasi’s depreciation.
16

Staff recommended directing additional revenues from the elimination of fuel subsidies to well-targeted pro-poor
programs. The authorities wish to explore scope for a basic national health insurance scheme.
17

The Fiscal Affairs Department provided technical assistance on tax policy in February 2013.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

THE GAMBIA

broadening the base of the personal and corporate income taxes would provide scope for reducing
tax rates, without losing revenues. Staff also advocated eventually eliminating investment incentives
and tax exemptions to simplify and broaden the base for corporate income taxes. A vast array of
low-yielding taxes, “nuisance” taxes, could be eliminated sooner. Ultimately, a simplified tax system
with broad tax bases and low rates would help to improve economic growth and The Gambia’s
international competitiveness. In the near term, the authorities could start to quantify the cost of tax
expenditures, including investment incentives and exemptions, and move toward including these
costs in the government’s budget. Continued efforts to strengthen tax administration, particularly
for large taxpayers and customs, are critical for increasing revenue collections and fairness of the tax
system. These efforts would benefit from reducing corruption and combating tax evasion, including
by mobilizing the anti-money laundering framework.
17.
On the spending side, greater progress is needed to control extrabudgetary
expenditures and enhance the budget process to ensure “value-for-money”.18 Although fiscal
savings created by reduced interest payments would create room for growth-enhancing
expenditures in the medium term within the envelope of the PAGE’s fiscal consolidation targets,
growth of discretionary current expenditures would need to be contained. Furthermore, directives
for extrabudgetary spending have been the leading cause for breakdowns in fiscal discipline. To
achieve planned fiscal adjustment and observe budget targets, it would be important to contain
extrabudgetary spending within the contingency component of the budget. Minimally, the cashbudgeting approach for near-term expenditure control should be strengthened. In addition,
implementation of an MTEF would greatly facilitate planning and allocation of scarce public
resources.
18.
There is need for further improvement in public debt management to help ease the
heavy debt burden. In line with the government’s medium-term debt strategy, issuing longer-term
bonds would eventually help to reduce the extraordinarily high rollover risk of domestic debt.
However, interest rates are prohibitively high at this time. Issuing longer-term bonds would need to
wait until fiscal adjustment has helped to reduce yields. To ensure sustainability of external debt,
with the exception of a recent loan from the Islamic Development Bank to support the groundnut
sector, external financing should be limited to loans on concessional terms.19 Of significant
importance, the authorities have recently made substantial progress improving its external debt
database, which now facilitates reliable projections of future debt service obligations. Establishing a
database on debts and contingent liabilities, especially of state-owned enterprises, would also be
prudent.
19.
Authorities’ views. Differences focused mainly on the pace of fiscal adjustment and tax
reforms. The authorities cautioned that despite performance in the first half, observing the NDB

Department mission in February 2013.

ceiling for 2013 as a whole will be a challenge. They also suggested a modest easing of the ceiling
for 2014. On tax reform, the authorities emphasized that the VAT needs to be firmly entrenched as
the foundation of the tax system before further changes to tax policy can be pursued. While tax
reform is put on hold, they will rely on revenue administration efforts to raise the tax-to-GDP ratio.20
The authorities are assessing the cost and benefits of investment incentives. At present, they believe
that incentives are needed to overcome other impediments to international competitiveness.

Monetary and exchange rate policies
20.
There was broad agreement on monetary and exchange rate policies, once the current
exchange rate situation stabilizes. The CBG will continue to target reserve money as an
intermediate instrument to contain broad money growth and inflation (at 5 percent a year). In light
of trends toward financial deepening, broad money growth should exceed expected nominal GDP
growth by a modest amount, with reserve money growth somewhat tighter to account for the effect
of improving efficiencies on the money multiplier. As the government contains its domestic
borrowing needs, the expansion in broad money should leave ample room for growth of
commercial banks’ credit to the private sector. The CBG also aims to maintain a flexible exchange
rate policy, which has served The Gambia well over the years, particularly in helping to maintain its
international competitiveness. The CBG will refrain from intervening in the foreign exchange market,
except to maintain orderly market behavior. The CBG may also enter the market to purchase foreign
exchange to meet its objectives for international reserves (5 months of import coverage over the
medium term). Exchange rate directives are highly disruptive and should cease completely.
21.
Staff’s views. Monetary policy is struggling to provide a stable environment for
financial intermediation and the economic activity. The CBG tends to focus on meeting its
monetary (and international reserve) targets at the end of each quarter, rather than pursuing a
consistent path throughout the period. In addition, the CBG still relies heavily on blunt non-market
based instruments—notably, the reserve requirement on deposits—to conduct monetary policy. To
improve the focus on managing reserve money on a daily basis, staff recommends targeting
average reserve money over some period (the final month of each quarter). This will require the CBG
to overcome the delays to making operational its liquidity management tools (REPO instruments).
While government’s financing needs can be unpredictable, making liquidity management difficult,
the CBG could develop strategies for mopping up unanticipated liquidity injections, for example.
22.
The recent increases in the reserve requirement on deposits are a setback to financial
intermediation. They substantially increase banks’ intermediation costs by depriving banks of
income generating assets. Over the next couple of years, the CBG should reduce the reserve
requirement ratio back to 10 percent. Reserve money targets will have to be tightened accordingly

20

Staff agreed with this argument. Revenue projections in the baseline macroeconomic framework were scaled back
accordingly.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

THE GAMBIA

to avoid effects on monetary policy from these steps. In the mean time, the CBG could consider
paying some interest on the higher reserve requirement.
23.
On international reserves, large purchases at the end of a quarter can put sudden
pressure on the exchange rate and should be avoided. Moreover, sometimes such foreign
exchange transactions lack transparency. Similar to the reserve money issue, the CBG needs to take
steps to manage its reserve accumulation on a more consistent basis.
24.
Authorities’ views. The CBG faces extraordinary challenges that are beyond its control,
but it will continue to strive to improve coordination with the fiscal authorities. The CBG
continues to seek better communication on the public sector borrowing requirements and also
foreign exchange flows associated with foreign financed government projects, which maintain
accounts at the CBG. The CBG anticipates that REPO instruments will soon be operational. As
experience is gained with the REPO market, the authorities plan to explore whether it may provide
the basis for a more effective policy interest rate.
Financial sector policies
25.
After a period of rapid expansion, the banking system has undergone a modest
consolidation (Appendix IV). Between 2007 and 2010, the number of banks in The Gambia
doubled (to 14 banks). This expansion led to intense competition and diminished profits for the
system as a whole. Since 2010, two banks went into voluntary liquidation, choosing not to meet the
two-step increase in the minimum capital requirement (MCR) implemented at end-2010 and
end-2012. The increases in the MCR ensured that the banking system has been adequately
capitalized, but still non-performing loans have remained high (Table 9). While most banks are
foreign-owned, there is very little direct exposure to foreign assets on their balance sheets. The
strong expansion of the banking sector helped to deepen financial intermediation, but credit to the
private sector in The Gambia has lagged behind regional peers (Figure 6), partly due to structural
bottlenecks in the credit market. The costs of financial intermediation remain high.
26.
There was broad agreement that banking supervision must remain vigilant. The CBG
has been building up its supervisory capacity through staff hires and new electronic data collection.
Capacity building is needed, however, for effective off-site analysis and assessments, which is critical
for moving to a more risk-based approach for supervision. The CBG remains active in the regional
college of banking supervisors and has maintained close surveillance of cross-border issues.
27.
Staff’s views. The CBG’s vigilance on banking supervision overall is positive, but the
authorities should maintain its procedures for intensive supervision. The CBG should continue
its annual assessment of individual banks’ prompt corrective action financial indicators and, if
necessary, engage banks in intensive supervision of banks that do not met the requisite thresholds.
The delay of this assessment in 2013 should be remedied as soon as possible. Of concern, there is
no effective supervision of the Social Security and Housing Finance Corporations (SSHFC). At this
time, the best option is to enhance transparency, such as by making the finalized external audits
16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THE GAMBIA

widely available, so there could at least be greater public scrutiny of the institution. Over the
medium term, it would be important to build supervisory capacity by a proper regulatory agency.
On helping to reduce intermediation costs, ensuring that the Credit Reference Bureau (CRB) can
maintain timely data on borrowers and establishing a collateral registry to facilitate secured lending
operations are two near-term reforms that could have a profound impact.
28.
Authorities’ view. The authorities largely concurred with staff’s analyses and
recommendations on financial sector stability. The CBG intends to conduct the bank-by-bank
analysis for intensive supervision soon and will strive to maintain a regular annual schedule for this
exercise. The authorities noted that there has been progress on resolving the technical glitches of
the CRB. They are also exploring the establishment of a collateral registry. The CBG agreed that its
capacity was too stretched to monitor the SSHFC and, for now, transparency is the best option.
External stability assessment, international competitiveness, and inclusive growth
29.
Staff’s views. Recent directives to introduce a temporarily fixed and over-valued
exchange rate have disrupted the foreign exchange market; however, when the authorities
have maintained a flexible exchange rate policy, the dalasi has been broadly aligned with
medium-term fundamentals (Box 3 and Appendix V). In addition, the recent directives can have
adverse effects on international competitiveness. For example, in the near term, they create a
substantial risk for The Gambia’s tourism sector. As highlighted in surveys, a burdensome tax system
and the high cost of financial intermediation are also impediments to competitiveness and the
business environment, as well as severe infrastructure problems.21 While the introduction of the VAT
is a major step forward in tax policy, it appears that further progress with a comprehensive tax
reform will be gradual. Similarly, recent efforts to facilitate financial intermediation have been mixed.
Staff cautioned against the use of investment incentives to compensate for impediments to
competitiveness. Such incentives, particularly tax holidays, can be difficult to administer, costly in
terms of forgone revenues, and tend to attract investors with short time horizons.
30.
Nevertheless, with substantial donor support, there is strong potential for inclusive
growth. Several donors have begun to support PAGE strategies for infrastructure investment. Major
advances are underway in telecommunications and construction of the Trans-Gambia Bridge could
generate opportunities to reinvigorate The Gambia’s role as a regional trade center.22 The
authorities are also preparing to address major problems in the energy sector, including the
insolvency of the National Water and Electricity Company (NAWEC) and the current monopoly of
fuel importation, which would be a significant step forward. Perhaps most promising, the authorities

Box 3. External Stability Assessment: Exchange Rate and Reserve Adequacy
Results from three CGER-type methodologies suggest that the dalasi is broadly in line with The Gambia’s
medium-term fundamentals, as long as the authorities stick to the flexible exchange rate policy and pursue
macroeconomic policies in line with the PAGE (Appendix V):

The macroeconomic balance approach finds an overvaluation of 13 percent, implied by the current
account gap calculated as the difference between the projected underlying medium-term current
account deficit of 12½ percent of GDP and the estimated current account “norm” deficit of 4 percent.
However, given the need for infrastructure investments of the country and its development stage, the
current account norm deficit of 4 percent estimated from the model could be viewed as a conservative
estimate.

The external stability approach indicates the dalasi is

The equilibrium real exchange rate approach, on the

addition, the equilibrium REER appreciated slightly

Meanwhile, results from a cost-benefit analysis suggest an optimal level of GIR between 3½ 5 months of
import cover, assuming unit costs of 4 and 3 percent, respectively (Appendix II). Under this analytical
framework, the optimal level of GIR is determined so that a country’s benefit from holding reserves (prevention
and mitigation of large external shock events) is balanced against the associated financial cost (interest rate
differential between domestic and US treasury bills), while taking into account the country’s fiscal position,
institutional strength, and the flexibility of the exchange rate. Under a stress scenario where all external shocks are
set to their worst historical values, the optimal level of reserves would rise to 4½–6 months of imports. These
results indicate that the current level of reserves is broadly adequate given the macroeconomic and external risks
facing The Gambia.

are working closely with a coordinated group of development partners in agriculture and water
management, which could reduce vulnerability to drought and boost rural incomes.23
31.
Although resource mobilization for the PAGE has improved, private sector
participation would be needed to step up implementation. However, for this to be productive,
the government needs to strengthen the capacity of the PPP (public-private partnerships) unit in the
Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs to vet potential projects.

Over US$130 million (nearly 15 percent of current GDP) of grant financing has been approved for disbursement
over the next four years.

32.
Authorities’ views. The authorities agreed with the conclusion that the exchange rate
was not misaligned. They argued that until the impediments to the business environment and
international competitiveness can be resolved, The Gambia would have to continue to offer
investment incentives. They noted that qualifying investments are closely monitored.

Improving the quality of economic data
33.
Data have serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance. National
accounts and balance of payments data are particularly problematic (see the Statistical Issues
Appendix). Staffing and capacity constraints at the Gambia Bureau of Statistics (GBoS), as well as
insufficient source data, have been major obstacles to deriving quality statistics. For the BOP, an
outdated methodology for estimating the re-export trade may be seriously distorting official trade
data. As a result, staff estimates of GDP and the BOP have often differed significantly from the
authorities’ figures. In addition, the base for the consumer price index (CPI) is outdated and there
are concerns that inflation has been understated. GBoS is in the process of updating and rebasing its
CPI data using the 2010 Integrated Household Survey. The authorities plan to work closely with
development partners to improve data, including necessary hiring of staff for the GBoS and funding
the collection of source data.

STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
The Gambian economy is still recovering from the severe 2011 drought. While the pace
of recovery has been promising, lingering weaknesses in the balance of payments have led to
depreciation pressures on the Gambian dalasi. These pressures have intensified recently, because of
policy inconsistencies. In particular, a series of directives that have recently imposed over-valued
exchange rates has disrupted the foreign exchange market and shaken confidence in the economy,
encouraging capital flight and dampening remittances. To stabilize the dalasi and restore
confidence, staff recommends an immediate return to a flexible exchange rate policy and a
tightening of macroeconomic policies—both monetary and fiscal.
35.
Prior to this recent turmoil, The Gambia had achieved a period of robust growth and
significant poverty reduction. Returning to the economic policy agenda mapped out in the
authorities’ Programme for Accelerated Growth and Employment (PAGE), would enable such inclusive
growth to continue. Moreover, implementing major structural reforms and infrastructure
investments supported by development partners in the agriculture, transportation, energy, and
telecom sectors, could significantly boost growth over the medium term.
36.
Steady fiscal adjustment aimed at reducing the escalating cost and risks of the
government’s heavy debt burden, particularly from domestic debt, lies at the heart of the
PAGE’s macroeconomic policy agenda. Fiscal slippages in 2012 halted progress toward fiscal
consolidation. Restoring momentum toward fiscal balance, critically by curtailing the government’s
net domestic borrowing would help to lower interest rates, ease crowding out of the private sector,
and eventually generate substantial fiscal savings that could be redirected to spending on PAGE
priorities.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

THE GAMBIA

37.
Staff agreed that further tax reform should await further entrenchment of the new
value-added tax as the foundation of the Gambian tax system. However, given that the current
tax system remains a major impediment to doing business and The Gambia’s international
competitiveness, it will be important to prepare a medium-term tax reform agenda aimed at
simplifying taxes and broadening the tax base, which would allow a lowering of tax rates without
losing revenues. In the mean time, revenue administration efforts, particularly for customs and large
taxpayers, need to be stepped up to bolster revenues. Monitoring tax expenditures—notably, from
investment incentives and fuel subsidies—would also provide important guidance for tax
simplification and base broadening.
38.
Enhancing the budget process and expenditure control is critical to ensure maximum
value from government spending, in addition to improving fiscal discipline. It is important that
spending by directive is minimized and kept within the allocation for contingencies.
39.
To provide a firm foundation for the financial system and the economy more broadly,
it is important that monetary policy is implemented on a consistent basis. Market-based
liquidity management tools need to be made operational as soon as possible. To reduce the high
cost of financial intermediation—another major impediment to doing business—the Central Bank of
The Gambia should refrain from using the reserve requirement on deposits as a monetary policy
tool and should aim to lower the requirement back to 10 percent over the next couple of years.
Other pending structural measures to facilitate intermediation should not be delayed.
40.
The banking system is well-capitalized and liquid, however, non-performing loans
have remained persistently high. Banking supervision has made good progress in recent years,
particularly in the areas of intensive supervision based on individual bank indicators, capacity
building, data collection, and cross-border communications/monitoring. It is important that the CBG
remains vigilant and continues its progress in these areas. For the Social Security and Housing
Finance Corporations, public scrutiny would encourage sound management. It will be important to
ensure maximum transparency of its accounts.
41.
A flexible exchange rate policy has served The Gambia well, particularly in helping to
preserve international competitiveness; however, recent directives to fix the exchange rate
temporarily at over-valued rates have been counterproductive. The directives have made
international transactions difficult, discouraged the inflow of much needed remittances, and
encouraged capital flight. As a small open economy, relying on imports for essential commodities, it
is important that The Gambia maintain an ample stock of international reserves. A return to a
predictable exchange rate policy would be essential to preserve both competitiveness and
macroeconomic stability.
42.
While there has been progress managing the government’s external debt burden,
there are still significant risks, especially if investments are unproductive. To minimize
exposure to external debt risks, staff urges the authorities to continue to seek grant or highly
concessional financing for its investment agenda.
20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THE GAMBIA

43.
Weak economic data continue to be a major impediment to policy making. The
authorities face an opportunity to engage development partners in a coordinated effort to support
capacity building at the Gambia Bureau of Statistics (GBoS). To ensure success of this initiative, it is
critical that the government meet its commitments on GBoS staffing and funding for collection of
source data. Also, the CBG needs to address long-standing weaknesses in the collection and
compilation of balance of payments data.
44.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with the Gambia be held in
accordance with the Board Decision No. 14747-(10/96), adopted September 28, 2010 (as
amended), on Article IV consultation cycles.

Protracted Slow Global Growth

scenario assumes a protracted growth slowdown in advanced economies in line with the latest WEO adverse
scenario. The main channel through which this scenario affects The Gambia is a reduction in tourism receipts and
remittances but this impact is partially offset by downward pressure on commodity prices.

scenario assumes higher international oil prices (by 20 percent than the baseline during 2013—15) with full passthrough to domestic fuel prices. This leads to a worsened external current account balance and higher inflation.

This scenario also assumes higher international oil prices (by 20 percent than the baseline during 2013—15) but with a
partial pass-through to domestic prices. The negative impact on the fiscal position, international reserves and credit to
private sector would be larger than under a full pass-through scenario reflecting the significance of the authorities’
commitment to eliminate fuel subsidies.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF
staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability
below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views as of
the end of the discussions with the authorities.

A looser fiscal policy without

Appendix I: Growth Inclusiveness in The Gambia11
This appendix examines The Gambia’s performance in reducing poverty and the extent of
inclusiveness of growth using the 2003 and 2010 household surveys and other literature. Over the
years, The Gambia has made significant progress in reducing the overall incidence of poverty but
poverty remains widespread especially in the rural areas. Furthermore, inequality and high
unemployment, especially among the youth, remain a challenge. In light of this, more could be
done to make growth more inclusive.

Poverty in Time and Regional Perspective

incidence of poverty over the past years, poverty remains widespread. According to national

school enrolment and completion and youth
literacy rates) and health (immunization and child and maternal mortality rates). Good progress is
also being made towards meeting selected millennium development goals (Table 8).
2.
Despite The Gambia’s progress in reducing poverty, inequality remains a challenge.
Inequality in The Gambia, measured by the Gini coefficient, is among the highest in the ECOWAS
region (figure 1). In addition, unemployment is high among the youth. According to the UNDP
Human Development Index (HDI), a composite measure of health, education and income, while
there have been significant improvements in the quality of life over the years; The Gambia is
trailing behind the SSA average, ranking 165th out of 187 among the countries covered by the
HDI index in 2012. The Gambia’s performance is also below the UNDP low human development
level which represents the threshold for the lowest socioeconomic development.

Output volatility caused by droughts impacts negatively on poverty, particularly in
the rural areas (Figure 2). Estimates from the post-harvest assessment of the 2011 drought by
the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) show that slightly over 700 000 people
(73 percent in the rural areas) were severely affected by the drought.

Who are the Poor in The Gambia?
4.
Poverty in The Gambia is multi-dimensional, and therefore requires well targeted
policy measures (Figure 3). Similar to most Sub Saharan African (SSA) countries, poverty in the
Gambia is concentrated in the rural areas, among people employed in the agriculture sector and

those with low educational attainment. Large family sizes also impact negatively on poverty while
remittances have helped to alleviate poverty.

Inclusiveness of Growth in The Gambia
5.
Growth is considered to be inclusive if it is high and sustained (a crucial condition
for poverty reduction); broad-based across sectors and inclusive of a large part of the
country’s labor force; and characterized by equality of opportunity in terms of access to
markets and resources (IMF 2013). Inclusive growth should therefore focus on sectors with the
highest potential for creating stable wage-paying jobs, McKinsey Global Institute (2012). How
inclusive has growth been in the Gambia?
6.
While the elasticity of poverty with respect to growth is high in the Gambia, there
are large regional variations in poverty. The decline in overall poverty rate to 48.4 percent
in 2010, down from 58.0 percent in 2003

suggests a fairly high elasticity of poverty with

between 2003 and 2010, the urban areas
experienced a much higher decline in poverty than the rural areas. High levels of inequality and
concentration of poverty in the rural areas do not bode well for the inclusivity of growth.

Policy Measures to make Growth more Inclusive
8.
The Gambian authorities should take steps to improve sustainability of growth and
to make growth more inclusive. As the authorities’ Programme for Accelerated Growth and
Employment (PAGE) places a strong emphasis on developing the agriculture sector, its execution
40

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THE GAMBIA

would play a key role in reducing poverty in the rural areas. There is therefore a need to shore up
execution of the PAGE. In that regard, large commitments of support by development partners
for development in the agriculture and transport sectors offer promise of higher and more
inclusive growth going forward. Authorities, however, need to ensure that donor-funded
agricultural projects are well coordinated and sustainable beyond the duration of donor
financing in order to make a noticeable impact on poverty. Strengthening of land tenure security
and provision of farmer education through a wide coverage of the agricultural extension services
would also enhance poverty reduction through agricultural activities.
9.
Sustained reforms are required to enhance the business environment, in order to
underpin sustainable economic growth and private sector employment. In the 2013 Doing
Business Report, The Gambia is ranked 147th out of 185 countries and has dropped in all
indicators except enforcing contracts. In addition, reforms in the energy and telecom sectors are
needed to unlock the potential of infrastructure in supporting high growth and employment,
especially for the youth.

Appendix II: Reserve Adequacy in The Gambia1
Staff estimates from a cost-benefit analysis for low-income countries indicate an optimal level of
gross international reserves between 3½–5 months of the following year’s imports for The Gambia.
This suggests The Gambia’s 4.8 months of reserves at the end of 2012 is broadly adequate given
the economy’s macroeconomic and external risks.

The Gambia’s gross international reserves (GIR) stood at about US$ 184 million at

Results from a cost-benefit analysis2 suggest an optimal level of GIR between 3½–
5.0 months of import cover, assuming opportunity costs of 4 and 3 percent, respectively.
Under this analytical framework, the optimal level of GIR is determined so that a country’s benefit
from holding reserves (prevention and mitigation of large external shock events) is balanced
against the associated financial cost (interest rate differential between domestic and US treasury
bills), while taking into account the country’s fiscal position, institutional strength, and the
flexibility of the exchange rate. The assumptions for the baseline assessment are presented in
Table 1.

3.
These results should be taken with caution, however. First, the estimated optimal
level is highly sensitive to the opportunity cost of holding reserves. In the case of The Gambia,
the real interest rate differential between domestic and US treasury bills averaged about
9½ percent during 2005–2012, pointing to an optimal import coverage of one month. However,
the economy’s inherent structural instability, risk of high inflation caused by global price shocks
and bad weather, as well as its high reliance on food imports for subsistence, provide strong
support for higher reserve buffer. Furthermore, despite The Gambia’s heavy reliance on
remittances for external financing, the panel regression model does not consider a sharp fall in
remittances among its external shock variables, which again leads to a potential underestimation
of the optimal level.
4.
Under a stress scenario where all external shocks are set to their worst historical
values, the optimal level of reserves would rise to 4½ – 6 months of imports. While
somewhat higher than in the baseline, these levels still remain mostly below the current
4.8 months cover. These results indicate that the current level of reserves is broadly adequate
given the macroeconomic and external risks facing The Gambia.

Appendix III. The Gambia—Tax Reform Options1
Background
1.
The tax burden in The Gambia remains relatively low compared with other SSA
countries. After rising to a peak in 2007, the tax revenue-to-GDP ratio declined in 2008–10. This
ratio has been lower in The Gambia than in regional peers in recent years (Figure 1). Tax revenue
seems to have been less sensitive to GDP growth in The Gambia compared with many other SSA
countries. Tax buoyancy, defined as the
Figure 1. Tax Revenue in percent of GDP

17
nominal GDP, was 0.67 in The Gambia
16
in 2000–11, compared with the SSA average

of 0.84. The tax revenue-to-GDP ratio in The

14.5 percent by 2012; but it was still lower
1. Simple average of each country's tax-GDP ratio
than the peers’ average (as of 2011) of
around 16 percent.
2.
In early 2013, The Gambia embarked on a gradual process of tax reforms. The
authorities introduced a value-added tax (VAT), to replace an outdated general sales tax, and a
simplified tax regime for small businesses. In the supplementary budget, which was submitted to
the National Assembly in late April 2013, the government specified a path for almost eliminating
the costly fuel subsidies by the end of 2013. Meanwhile, the exemption threshold for the
personal income tax (PIT) was raised by 140 percent, and rate brackets were reduced by
five percentage points without expanding the tax base.2

Estimates of The Gambia’s Tax Revenue Potential
3.
Panel estimates provide each country’s potential for tax revenue collection. In
recent years, various empirical studies attempted to measure taxable capacity of various
countries by regressing the tax revenue-to-GDP ratio for sample countries on explanatory
variables that serve as proxies for possible tax bases and other factors that might affect a
country’s ability to raise tax revenue. The estimated tax-to-GDP ratio from this regression is
interpreted as a measure of taxable capacity, i.e., tax revenue potential. Following Coondo, and
others (2003) and Davoodi and Grigorian (2007), this study calculates a wide range of countries’
potential tax revenue from a panel dataset that covers 173 countries from 1995 through 2011—
39 SSA countries are included. Explanatory variables for tax revenue potential are (i) size of

as of 2011, lagging behind the SSA average and the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS)—excluding The Gambia—members’ average (61¼ percent, Figure 3).5

Tax Reform Options for The Gambia
5.
The business taxation structure and tax incentives remain in need of
comprehensive reform, and the legal framework lacks transparency. The IMF Fiscal Affairs
Department (FAD) technical assistance (TA) mission that took place in early 2013 pointed out that
a complex system of business taxation penalizes investment with high effective tax rates and
significant compliance costs. More importantly, a complex system of amendments and decisions,
not always accessible by tax payers, and tax practices misaligned with the legal framework,
undermine the transparency and stability of the tax system. These concerns are echoed by the
business community, according to recent business surveys.6
6.
The FAD TA mission suggested a wide range of tax reform options for The Gambia.
Its recommendations are based on three principles: simplifying the tax system; broadening the
tax base to create room for lower rates; and enhancing transparency about the legal framework.
Rationalizing taxation of business income would address the first principle. Streamlining tax
incentives, expanding the PIT base, and exploiting underutilized taxes (excises and property tax)
would tackle the second principle. Finally, tax expenditure budgeting would take up the third
principle.
7.
Some of the TA recommendations could be done in the short term and provide a
significant revenue boost. First, a 15 percent withholding tax on interest and dividends is
already part of the PIT legislation but has not been applied. This could be enforced in the 2014
budget. It is estimated to increase PIT tax revenue by 0.3 percent of GDP.7 Second, as provided in
the law, customs duties and charges could be included in the base of excise in the 2014 budget.
This is estimated to increase revenue by 0.4 percent of GDP.
8.
In the medium term, business taxation needs to be rationalized, and tax incentives
should be streamlined. Although the authorities introduced a simplified income tax regime for
small- and medium-sized enterprises with turnover below the VAT threshold for voluntary
registration in early 2013, business taxation remains complex. Several tax incentives, often
granted with discretion, narrow the tax base, distort the allocation of resources, and lead to
incoherent tax treatments across firms and sectors. Cross-country empirical evidence suggests
that tax incentives rarely have any significant effect on investments.8 By eliminating minimum

See the background note on external stability and competitiveness.

7

Part of this revenue increase is likely to be offset by an increase in domestic interest costs because the
withholding tax on interest from T-Bills would lead to an increase in T-Bill yields.
8

For example, Klemm and Van Parys (2009) examine a panel of 40 countries from 1985–2004 and find no effect
of tax incentives on economic growth and aggregate investment.

46

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THE GAMBIA

taxes on specific types of income and reducing the minimum business income tax, together with
streamlining of the various existing exemptions and improvements to the allowance and
depreciation schedule over time would reduce effective taxation on businesses without leading
to revenue losses. In particular, by allowing the initial capital allowance and first annual
depreciation to run concurrently, The Gambia could enhance investment for various types of
equipment. These changes in depreciation rules would provide incentives for growth-and
employment- enhancing investments more effectively than tax holidays, which tend to attract
short-term, footloose, and highly profitable firms that likely disappear once the incentives expire.
The current tax holidays should be phased out over time as the series of changes in business
taxes mentioned above takes effect. These measures would improve the business environment in
the medium term.
9.
The PIT base should be expanded and property taxation by the local governments
should be strengthened in the medium term. The 2013 PIT reform is estimated to lead to a
revenue loss of about ½ percent of GDP, while it did not fully address the equity concerns of the
PIT system. The revenue loss and equity concerns would be addressed by broadening its base
over time. Specifically, PIT should be applied to public and pension benefits, and allowances paid
to civil servants should be included in the PIT in the medium term. Local governments do not
fully exploit the potential of their assigned immovable property taxes and rely excessively on
business taxation. This is due largely to the lack of capacity to maintain a comprehensive fiscal
cadastre and revalue properties. The government could improve the revenue capacity of local
governments over time by investing in infrastructure to levy property taxes. This would enable
the local governments to finance the gradual reduction and/or elimination of numerous local
business license fees and improve the business environment in the medium term.
10.
Tax expenditure budgeting should be integrated in the annual budget process over
time. Reporting on tax expenditure (i.e., tax incentives, exemptions) and on their costs for the
budget is very limited and not transparent in The Gambia. Identifying, quantifying, and reporting
tax expenditure are critical steps for understanding the overall impact of the tax system and its
hidden costs and for designing adequate policy actions. It would go a long way toward
improving fiscal transparency. Because this is a labor-intensive process, the authorities could
follow a step-by-step approach: (i) prepare a tax expenditure budget listing the main tax
expenditures and their intended purposes in the short run; (ii) then expand the tax expenditure
budget to include full costing of all main tax expenditures; (iii) finally, integrate tax expenditure
budgeting into the annual budget process in the medium term.
11.
Successful tax reforms in other SSA countries highlight the importance of
simplifying the system, broadening the base, and enhancing transparency. In Mozambique,
along with administrative changes, tax policy reforms like simplification and base-broadening
measures, and gradually doing away with tax expenditure to rationalize incentives have led to the
upward trend in tax revenue.9 Mauritius overhauled PIT and business taxes by introducing a

indicators—the highest ranking among SSA countries. While causation is not clear, tax revenue
has been significantly higher than that before 2007. Finally, in Senegal, a comprehensive study on
tax expenditure served as a key input for the tax system overhaul introduced in 2013.

THE GAMBIA

Appendix IV: Banking Sector Stability in The Gambia1
Background
1.
The Gambia’s financial system is dominated by commercial banks. Between 2007
and 2010, the number of banks doubled (to 14 banks) leading to intense competition and
diminished profits for the system as a whole. The banking system has since undergone a
modest consolidation, as two banks went into voluntary liquidation, rather than meeting the
two-step increase in the minimum capital requirement (MCR) implemented at end-2010 and
end-2012.
2.
Financial deepening, measured by the credit-to-GDP ratio, is still relatively low in
The Gambia, compared with its regional peers.2 High lending rates and constrained credit to
firms and households can largely be attributed to structural factors, notably banks’ high funding
and operating costs. Increased competition appears to have narrowed banks’ interest margins,
because of higher rates paid on deposits, especially as newer banks competed aggressively for
time deposits in a market that is characteristically concentrated.3 For example, those banks that
lack a core local deposit base, must bid aggressively for large deposits. Other notable
characteristics of the banking system include a relatively low rate of interbank lending; a high
concentration of government treasury bills as a share of banks’ total assets;4 and a largely
domestic source (deposit liabilities) of the banks’ funding, despite the dominance of foreignbased banks.
Major Risks in the Gambian Banking System
3.
The Gambia’s banking system as a whole is well capitalized and has ample liquidity,
but the share of loans that are non-performing has remained high. Particularly after the
increase in the MCR, the ratio of capital adequacy has been well above the prudential norm
(Table 1). The high ratio of liquid assets to total assets mainly reflects the large share of T-bills in
banks’ portfolios. Non-performing loans (NPL), although having declined fairly steadily over the
past few years, still comprise a large share of total loans. NPL is one of the core areas that need
intensive supervision. Fierce competition for deposits, loans and qualified staff have led to a high
cost of funds, provisions, and staff remuneration, respectively, eroding banks’ earnings.
4.
The Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework that the CBG implemented in 2010
stipulates that supervision should be incrementally stepped up for higher PCA ratings, with

banks that report a rating above three for any of the PCA components being subject to
intensive supervision.5 The aggregate PCA ratings have slightly worsened in early 2013 for, NPL,
earnings, and liquidity. It is important that the CBG continues to conduct its annual PCA
assessment on a bank-by-bank basis.
5.
The aggregate numbers mask vulnerabilities at the individual bank level. While the
newer banks tend to be highly capitalized, some of the oldest and largest banks have
significantly lower capital adequacy ratios (CARs) (Table 2). For instance, the CAR of the
largest 6 banks that account for 81 percent of banking system assets averages 11.9 percent
(ranging from 6.1 to 21.1 percent) against 31.9 percent for the smallest 6 banks (ranging
from 20.8 to 35.4 percent). Hence, the shock absorption capacity of some of the largest banks is
significantly lower than that the aggregate CAR indicates. These banks, however, remained
profitable as they invest heavily in T-bills with a relatively safe rate of return. Similarly, the
dispersion in NPL ratios shows that the older and larger banks struggle more with loan quality
issues than the newer banks. NPL ratios for the six largest banks averaged 11.8 percent
compared to 9.5 percent for six smallest banks. With respect to banks’ earnings, four of the 12
banks are loss-making―one medium and three small banks. As for liquidity, the share of assets
held by banks with PCA rating at 5 for liquid assets to total assets rose to 20 percent in 2013Q1
from zero in 2012Q1 (Figure 2).6
6.
The major risk faced by the Gambian banking system is credit risk. High NPL ratio
highlights the significance of credit risk. Although the banking system is highly liquid, banks
still could potentially be vulnerable to aggressive deposit withdrawals by large depositors given
the concentration of deposits among a small number of large corporations.

Credit Risks
7.
The extent of vulnerability to credit risk may very well be underestimated due to
weaknesses in the regulatory framework. The Gambia’s asset classification and provisioning
rule (text table) shows weaknesses in three key areas. First, it relies primarily on the delinquency
parameter, with forward-looking judgment on loan performance only marginally embedded in
regulation.7 Loans are classified as current up to 90 days of delinquency, with a corresponding
provisioning rate of only one percent. Second, the classification regime does not include a watch
or special-mention category that typically captures loans that are delinquent up to 90 days, and
requires a provisioning rate of 5 percent. Third, the regulation governing restructured loans is
5

PCA is a framework used in many countries in levying penalties against banks that exhibit progressively
deteriorating capital ratios with a view to providing incentives for banks to address issues. PCA rating ranges
from 1 to 5, score 1 being the best and score 5 requiring intensive supervision.

While the upper chart of figure 2 represents number of banks with corresponding PCA rating rate, the lower
chart is the percentage of total bank(s) system assets to banks total asset with a corresponding PCA rating rate.

requires a provisioning rate of 5 percent. Third, the regulation governing restructured loans is
too lenient: it allows banks to provision for restructured loans at a rate of only 5 percent.
8.
Concentration of the banks’ loan portfolio could potentially pose major credit risks.
The top four borrowers account for 54 percent of the loan portfolio, based on endDecember 2012 data. Single-borrower limit is set at 25 percent of capital, but only applies to
unsecured credit. This loophole in CBG regulation, flagged in the MCM TA Report in 2010, allows
banks to build up concentrated exposures beyond a level that is deemed sound. Moreover, given
the weaknesses in collateral registration and enforcement that reduce recovery rates on secured
credit, this distinction is somewhat arbitrary.

9.
Against this background, stretched supervisory resources are cause for concern.
Based on an informal analysis of the PCA indicators, 11 out of the 12 banks may need to be
subjected to intensive supervision for at least one of the PCA components. Although the CBG has
recently recruited additional staff in the supervision department, bringing the number of fulltime staff in CBG’s Financial Supervision Department to 26, there is little room to step up the
intensity of supervision or the frequency of on-site visits consistent with the PCA framework.8
CBG intends to hire six additional staff trained in International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS).

8

Currently, on-site visits take place at an annual frequency, where CBG decides it to be a full-scale or follow-up
visit based on off-site analysis.

Liquidity Risks
11.
Liquidity risk stress test results show that the banking system could withstand
severe shocks arising from deposit withdrawals. The stress testing on liquidity risk assessed
whether the banking sector could meet a sudden need for a large amount of cash due to a loss
of public confidence in the banking sector that generates a bank run. Given the high
concentration of depositors, the test shows for each bank how many days it would withstand
liquidity drain before having to resort to accessing liquidity from outside sources (other banks or
the CBG). The stress test results indicate that all banks, except the three medium banks, can
withstand up to three days of deposit runs without recourse to the CBG.9 By the fourth day of
deposit runs, all medium banks, two small banks, and one large bank would become illiquid
(Figure 3 and Table 3).
12.
However, its shock absorption capacity is highly dependent on the market liquidity
of government securities. The available liquid assets mainly consist of cash and Treasury bills,
while deposits account for the bulk of liquid liabilities (67 percent on average). As demonstrated
by the recent episodes, once the authorities’ commitments to the fiscal consolidation and flexible
exchange rate policy are called into questions, T-bill rates would spike and the government could
face difficulties in rolling over government’s securities. In case such strains persist, the Gambian

banks’ capacity to absorb liquidity shocks would be severely undermined. This highlights the
importance of prudent macroeconomic policy conduct by the authorities to keep the banking
system sound.

THE GAMBIA

Appendix V: External Stability Assessment148
The Gambia’s external balance is projected to remain broadly stable over the medium term given
the envisaged fiscal adjustment and ample international reserves but is still vulnerable to large
external shocks such as spikes in commodity prices and bad weather. Staff estimates from CGERtype analyses indicate that The Gambia’s exchange rate is broadly in line with medium-term
fundamentals, although poor quality of the balance of payments (BOP) statistics, as well as a wide
range of estimates, calls for caution against a definitive assessment. Meanwhile, survey-based
indicators show that recent depreciation has helped The Gambia maintain its relative external
competitiveness in the region, but the lack of progress in reforms aimed at addressing key
institutional bottlenecks could start eroding competitiveness.

Evolution of the Balance of Payments
1.
The Gambia’s current account deficit has steadily widened over the past years. The
current account deficit rose from 4.5 percent of GDP in 2004 to 17.5 percent in 2012, mainly
driven by the increasing merchandise trade deficit excluding re-exports. From 2004 to 2012,
merchandise exports fell from 6 percent of GDP to 1 percent, while imports for domestic
consumption climbed from 23 percent to 30 percent, resulting in an increase of net deficit from
17 percent to 29 percent. This widening of the trade deficit reflected a series of major external
shocks during this period, including two severe crop failures caused by drought (2005, 2011), oil
and food price hikes (2008, 2011), and the global financial crisis (2009). The two crop failures
were particularly damaging and had lingering negative effects on domestic exports, mainly
groundnuts.

The rising current account deficits were financed mostly by non-debt creating
capital inflows. On the back of a boom in the telecommunication and the tourism sectors,
foreign direct investment (FDI) was the dominant source of foreign capital prior to the global
financial crisis. After the crisis, however, FDI declined to an average of 8 percent, with external

receipts owing to continued marketing effort
and investment in relevant infrastructure. On the capital account, project grants relative to GDP is
projected to be maintained at about 6½ percent on average over the medium term, partly
reflecting the Trans-Gambia Bridge project with a projected total disbursement of
US$ 100 million. The main risks to this baseline projection include bad weather, terms of trade
shocks from a spike in global commodity prices, and fiscal slippages leading to higher imports
and a potentially unsustainable public debt path. The Gambia’s level of gross international
reserves, however, provides an adequate buffer to large external shocks.249
4.
A recent debt sustainability analysis (DSA) indicates that The Gambia is at moderate
risk of external debt distress, although vulnerable to various adverse shocks. Depending on
the DSA indicator in question, the worst shock varies between a one-time depreciation shock
(30 percent) and a higher interest rate for new borrowing, all of which lead to protracted
breaches of debt thresholds. These results highlight the need for the authorities to adhere to a
prudent borrowing plan associated with an approved medium-term debt management strategy.

Exchange Rate Assessment
5.
The real exchange rate has
depreciated by about 21 percent
from 2008 to 2012, reaching the
lowest level since 2003. Both the
nominal and CPI-based real effective
exchange rate appreciated by about
15 percent from 2005 to 2008, driven by
a foreign direct investment boom in the
tourism and the telecommunication
sectors. Following this brief period of

declining by an average of 6 percent a year during 2009–2012 in line with the widening current
account deficit. The depreciation pressure has intensified since the second half of 2012, partly
owing to high import needs associated with slow crop production recovery and the weak market
sentiment following the issuance of Presidential Directive in October 2012.

Results from three CGER-type methodologies suggest that the dalasi is broadly in
line with The Gambia’s medium-term fundamentals (Text Table 1). These methodologies
include the macroeconomic balance (MB) approach, the external sustainability (ES) approach,
and the equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) approach, which provide complementary
assessments of the real exchange rate misalignment relative fundamentals. The Gambia’s
underlying medium-term CA norm is estimated using a dynamic panel regression model
developed by Vitek (2013), which includes remittances and aid inflows in addition to the standard
CGER explanatory variables.

close this gap. In light of recent historical
averages, however, the model norm of 4 percent is unrealistic. When the average CA deficit
over 2000–2012 (9.8 percent of GDP) is taken as the norm, the misalignment is much lower at
4.5 percent.
8.
The external stability approach indicates the dalasi is overvalued by about 7.5–
10 percent. The key to this approach is choosing an appropriate benchmark NFA-to-GDP ratio.
Using the end-2012 NFA position of -87 percent of GDP as a benchmark, the current account
deficit needed to maintain this position is estimated at about 6 percent of GDP, indicating an
overvaluation of 10 percent. When the benchmark is set to the average NFA position of 105 percent over 2004–2012, the overvaluation is slightly lower at about 7.5 percent.

The equilibrium real exchange rate approach, on the other hand, suggests an
undervaluation of about 18.5 percent. The estimate is obtained from a data augmented
version of Vitek (2013) model using a proxy measure of the missing employment series.451 Unlike
the MB and ES approaches, the ERER approach attempts to directly estimate an equilibrium
exchange rate based on a country’s fundamentals and tends to be more sensitive to the recent
exchange rate trend. In the case of The Gambia, much of the 18.5 percent misalignment reflects
the currency’s ongoing large depreciation since 2008 that is projected to stay about 14 percent
below its historical average over the medium term, as well as the slight appreciation of the
projected equilibrium REER (about 4 percent above its historical average). The latter is largely
attributable to the projected strengthening of the terms of trade and to a lesser extent, an
improvement in the fiscal balance and a gradual increase in productivity.

Among the three standard CGER-type methodologies, staff views the MB approach
as the most appropriate and reliable methodology for The Gambia. This is largely in light of
the poor quality and limited availability of data for the other approaches. For example, the
potential under-reporting of inflation as mentioned in the staff report (Paragraph 33) would bias
the real exchange rate upward, leading to an assessment showing excessive undervaluation
under the ERER approach. In addition, staff takes the view that using the historical average of
9.8 percent of GDP as the “norm” for the

For many low-income countries with missing employment series, including The Gambia, the estimates of ERER
misalignment are unavailable in Vitek (2013), as the regression requires a measure of relative productivity
calculated from the employment data. To overcome this data gap, this note develops a proxy measure of
employment series from other available data for countries, such as the share of working-age population and
unemployment rate. The use of this proxy measure allows a substantial expansion of the cross-section sample
size from 89 to 153 countries, including many of the Sub-Saharan countries, and produces generally more
significant and intuitively convincing coefficients.

Competitiveness Assessment
11.
In terms of the overall business environment, The Gambia ranks poorly in the entire
sample of countries, albeit somewhat better than most other countries in the region.
The 2013 World Bank’s Doing Business Survey ranks The Gambia 147th globally and 5th among
ECOWAS countries in terms of overall ease of doing business and 3rd in cross-border trading and
enforcing contracts. The Gambia also has a relatively high overall ranking in the 2012–2013
Global Competitiveness Index (98th) compared to its neighbors, largely owing to its relatively
good overall infrastructure, flexible labor market, and well-educated workforce.

The lack of progress in addressing these
key institutional bottlenecks could begin to
undermine The Gambia’s relative
competitiveness in the region. The cumulative
change in Doing Business score from 2008
to 2013 indicates that The Gambia has made little
progress in improving its overall business
environment and is lagging behind all other
ECOWAS countries by a substantial margin. This
finding further highlights the importance of The
Gambia’s recent depreciation in maintaining the
economy’s external competitiveness.
13.
To stay competitive, The Gambia
needs to augment its structural reform
efforts. Simulation results show that even
moderate improvements in ensuring better
access to credit, better investor protection, and
removing impediments for paying taxes could
yield large competitiveness gains for The
Gambia. For example, by reducing the time to
prepare and pay taxes, as well as lowering total
tax rate measured as percentage of profit to

Safeguards assessments
Safeguards assessments of the Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG) were completed in February
2004, February 2007, November 2009, and July 2012. The 2012 update report concluded that the
CBG governance has strengthened since the 2009 assessment. The recent assessment stressed
that continued and effective oversight by both the Board and the Audit Committee will be
important to ensure that key areas of CBG operations such as transactions with the government,
controls around IT systems, and compilation of program data are adequately monitored to
mitigate heightened risk. The CBG is facing capacity issues in accounting and internal audit that
need to be addressed in the near term. Future amendment of the CBG Law would provide the
opportunity to strengthen CBG autonomy by the incorporation of safeguards recommendations
in this area.
Exchange rate arrangement
Until January 20, 1986, the Gambian currency, the dalasi, was pegged to the pound sterling at a
rate of D5 = £1. On January 20, 1986, an interbank market for foreign exchange was introduced,
and since then the exchange rate has been determined by market forces. Effective February 2,
2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from
managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to floating, retroactively to
April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. As of August 15, 2013, the
midpoint exchange rate in the interbank market was D35 per U.S. dollar. The Gambia has
accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3 and 4 and maintains an exchange system
free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions, except for restrictions maintained solely for the preservation of national or
international security, which have been notified to the Fund in accordance with the procedures
set forth in Executive Board decision 144-(52/51). A series of presidential exchange rate
directives, that imposed over-valued exchange rates, were issued in October 2012, June 2013,
July 2013, and August 2013. The first two directives were both lifted after 2-3 weeks. The fourth
directive, which overrides the third directive, is still in effect. LEG, in consultation with MCM, is
assessing if the second, third, and fourth directives give rise to any exchange restriction or
multiple currency practice (MCP) in breach of The Gambia’s obligations under Article VIII,
Sections 2(a) and 3, and resulting in the non-observance of the continuous performance criterion
under the current ECF arrangement for The Gambia.
Last Article IV consultation
The Executive Board concluded the 2011 Article IV consultation (SM/11/338) on January 18, 2012.
Technical assistance
The Fund has been providing The Gambia with extensive technical assistance in macroeconomic,
fiscal, and monetary areas, and in improving the compilation of macroeconomic statistics.

I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data have serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance. The most affected

areas are balance of payments, national accounts, and external debt statistics.

National Accounts: The main constraints to improving the national accounts include inadequate
source data due to inadequate survey coverage, poor quality of external sector data, and lack of
attention to other important sources (such as the livestock census and the census of industrial
production). The Gambia Bureau of Statistics (GBoS) continues to face human and financial constraints
to undertaking such surveys and to processing the data.

The Gambia participates in the Enhanced Data Dissemination Initiative (EDDI) which is funded by the
U.K. Department for International Development (DfID). In 2012-2013, STA missions and technical
experts financed by DfID advised the GBoS on improving national accounts, including price statistics.
In November 2012, with the help of donors, the government held a forum for dialogue among users
and producers of the National Statistical System.
The government has increased the budget allocations for GBoS for 2013 with a view to enabling GBoS
to recruit more staff and train them as well. Line ministries will contribute to the development of
sectoral statistics, particularly in agriculture, health, education, transport, and construction.

Price Statistics: The World Bank has been providing technical assistance to the GBoS to update the
consumer price index (CPI) using the 2003 household expenditure survey to better reflect current
consumption patterns. In early 2007, the GBoS began to publish a new national CPI based on an
August 2004 representative expenditure basket. Currently, the GBoS is working on rebasing the CPI
using the results of the 2010 integrated household survey.
Government Finance Statistics: The authorities release data on central government transactions with a
lag of about four weeks for both revenues and expenditures. With the introduction of the IFMIS in
2010, the compilation of expenditure data by functional category and by administration is now
possible. However, the authorities have not yet started to make them available to the public at regular
intervals, contrary to best practices. The compilation of project grant disbursements and project grant
use has been a challenge, leading to financing discrepancies. Monthly data on domestic government
financing are available with a delay of about four weeks.

At a meeting with STA in October 2007, the authorities expressed interest in technical assistance to
facilitate the migration to GFSM2001.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: The Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG) has improved data

reporting to the Fund. In June 2012, the CBG completed migration to the Standardized Report Forms
(SRFs) for the submission of its monetary and financial statistics (MFS) to the Fund.

THE GAMBIA

Additionally, in June 2012, the CBG launched an electronic reporting system for commercial banks
which will facilitate the accurate and timely submission of relevant information for supervision. In early
2013, the CBG started the collection of new data, including those on term structure of commercial
banks’ assets and liabilities. These will help improve the quality of the CBG’s onsite and offsite
supervision.
Despite this progress, MFS data are still in need of improvements in terms of financial institution
coverage. The depository corporation survey does not include data from non-bank deposit taking
institutions, a growing sector in the country.
Financial sector surveillance: Only basic market based indicators are available, and their coverage,
valuation and timeliness vary across such indicators. Data are not sufficiently available to conduct
stress tests of the banking system or Balance Sheet Approach analysis. Cross border exposure data
for financial corporations are not available.

External sector statistics: Despite some improvements, balance of payments statistics continue to be
affected by serious shortcomings. These include delays in the collection of trade, customs, and tourist
arrival data; outdated methods for estimating the re-export trade; poor data on capital flows; lack of a
register of firms and establishments engaged in external transactions; poor classification of balance of
payments data; and lack of a consistent methodology. Institutional weaknesses have also been a
major impediment to improving statistics. Official grant and loan disbursements and repayments are
generally well recorded, but there are some gaps in project disbursements. Due to the various data
shortcomings, there is a large discrepancy between the BOP data reported by the authorities to STA
and the adjusted data used by AFR. For example, data reported by the authorities to STA point to a
small current account surplus (except in 2012), while adjusted AFR data indicate that the country is
running a large current account deficit.

The CBG produces balance of payments statistics according to the Balance of Payments Manual, 5th
edition (BPM5). The CBG has been compiling quarterly balance of payments statistics through a Fundadministered technical assistance project funded by DfID. The most recent data available are for the
first quarter of 2013.
To improve the quality of BOP statistics, the CBG conducted surveys of tourism expenditures and reexports in 2011, and surveys of FDI and trade credits and advances in 2012. GBoS, CBG, and the
Gambian Revenue Authorities (GRA) have been holding regular quarterly meetings on re-exports, in
order to standardize procedures and reports for border stations. CBG also plans to rebuild staffing
levels and continuously build up capacity in the BOP unit at the Economic Research Department, in
line with recommendations from the DfID-funded STA TA mission held in early 2013.

III. Reporting to STA
The authorities provide some financial soundness indicators (FSIs) to the IMF database; however, not all
core FSIs are reported and the reported indicators are not timely.

No data are being reported for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook or in the
International Financial Statistics (IFS).
Since June 2012, monthly SRF-based monetary statistics have been reported to STA for publication in
IFS.
Balance of payments statistics are submitted for publication in the IFS and in the IMF Balance of
Payments Statistics Yearbook since 2005.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 13, 2013

Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with The Gambia
On September 11, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with The Gambia.1
The Gambian economy has generally performed well over the past several years, although it
is still recovering from the 2011 drought. The drought led to a large drop in crop production
and a sharp contraction in real Gross Domestic Production (GDP) in 2011. Although growth
has been picking up, weaknesses in the balance of payments have persisted, leading to
depreciation pressures on the Gambian dalasi. Most recently, inconsistent economic policies
have intensified these pressures.
Large fiscal deficits—financed mostly by domestic borrowing—have added to the
government’s heavy debt burden. Interest on debt has consumed a rising share of government
resources in recent years, reaching 22½ percent of government revenues in 2012, most of
which was paid on domestic debt. As outlined in the authorities’ Programme for Accelerated
Growth and Employment (PAGE) launched in December 2011, the government aims to
gradually reduce the fiscal deficit and ease its heavy debt burden.
Prior to the drought, The Gambia made significant progress in the fight against poverty;
however, poverty is still widespread. Execution of the PAGE, supported by commitments
from development partners, would help to further reduce poverty, especially in rural areas,
given a strong focus on agriculture.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary
is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found
here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2

The banking sector remains adequately capitalized, following a two-step increase in the
minimum capital requirement implemented at end-2010 and end-2012; however, nonperforming loans have remained high.
Despite near-term uncertainties, the medium-term outlook for growth is generally favorable.
Real GDP growth is projected to increase slightly to 6-6½ percent in 2013, driven by a
further recovery in agriculture. Inflation has been rising, but is expected to fall back to
around 5 percent a year over the medium term, as the Central Bank of The Gambia exercises
monetary restraint. The main downside risk arises from possible fiscal slippages. There is
also strong upside potential if critical reforms are achieved.
Executive Board Assessment
The Executive Directors welcomed The Gambia’s ongoing economic recovery from the 2011
drought and commended the authorities for achieving robust growth and significant poverty
reduction in recent years. However, Directors expressed concern that recent fiscal slippages
and inconsistent policies have increased risks and vulnerabilities. A return to the path
envisaged by the authorities’ Programme for Accelerated Growth and Employment (PAGE)
is needed to regain stability and foster inclusive growth.
Directors noted that recent exchange rate directives have disrupted the foreign exchange
market, encouraged capital flight, and dampened remittances from abroad. They cautioned
that a prolonged overvalued exchange rate would risk damaging The Gambia’s international
competitiveness. Directors therefore urged the authorities to maintain a flexible exchange
rate policy, which has served The Gambia well, and to tighten monetary and fiscal policies to
ensure stability and preserve adequate reserve levels.
Directors considered that undertaking the strong fiscal adjustment outlined in the PAGE
would reduce domestic borrowing needs and the cost and risks of the heavy public debt
burden. They commended the successful implementation of the VAT and the progress made
in phasing out fuel subsidies. However, further tax reforms will be needed over the medium
term to strengthen revenues and address costly tax expenditures, while improving
international competitiveness. Directors encouraged the authorities to enhance the budget
process, strengthen expenditure control, and rein in extra-budgetary expenditure. They
welcomed recent progress in managing the government’s external debt burden, and agreed
that the authorities should continue to rely on grants or highly concessional financing to
minimize exposure to external debt risks.
Directors called for a consistent implementation of monetary policy. They encouraged using
market-based monetary policy tools rather than reserve requirements on deposits, noting that
a gradual return to lower reserve requirements would help lower the high cost of financial
intermediation. Directors considered that the banking system is well capitalized and liquid,

3

and welcomed progress in areas of supervision, capacity building, and cross-border
monitoring. However, still-high non-performing loans require vigilance, including through
intensive supervision for individual banks as needed.
Directors noted that poor economic data remains an impediment to economic policymaking.
They welcomed ongoing initiatives, together with development partners, to strengthen
economic statistics, notably for the balance of payments, which will require adequate funding
and staffing.

Statement by Mr. Saho, Executive Director for The Gambia
September 11, 2013
Introduction
The impressive growth which characterized the economy of The Gambia in the past decade
slowed down following the severe drought in 2011 and efforts are being made by the
authorities to sustain macroeconomic stability and growth. In this regard, the country’s
economic policies and structural reforms are anchored on the Program for Accelerated
Growth and Employment (PAGE). As we pointed out in our Buff statement of May 22, 2013,
the PAGE focuses on improving infrastructure and human development, agriculture, energy
and tourism. This is aimed at achieving the country’s strategic objective of accelerating
diversified economic growth, strengthening the resilience of the economy and reducing
poverty. The attendant macroeconomic policy stance and structural reforms remain valid.
Key challenges include enhancing revenue performance in the medium term, containing
spending, reducing unemployment and addressing high rural poverty. In view of this, the
authorities remain committed to ensuring sustainable and high growth in order to create
employment and reduce poverty while maintaining macroeconomic stability and creating
fiscal space for growth enhancing expenditures. The structural reform agenda is aimed at
deepening the financial sector and improving the efficiency of public financial management.
My authorities are in general agreement with the thrust of the staff report as it provides a
candid assessment of recent economic developments and highlights the policy and structural
challenges facing The Gambia.
Recent economic developments
The Gambian economy has performed well in recent years. Real GDP grew on average by a
little over 6 percent per annum due to strong growth in the agriculture and services sectors.
Despite the adverse effect of the drought in 2011, real GDP growth remained fairly robust at
5.3 percent in 2012 led by the rebound in agriculture and recovery in the tourism sector.
However, headline inflation increased to 4.9 percent at end-2012 from 4.4 percent at the end
of the preceding year. The up-tick in consumer price inflation is partly explained by the
accommodating monetary policy of the central bank in the face of increasing government
spending. Fiscal performance weakened in the last quarter of 2009 and in 2010 following
increased spending to cushion the impact of rising global oil and food prices and the
substantial shortfall in budget support from donors. As a result, the authorities implemented a
mix of expenditure and revenue measures to correct the fiscal imbalance and public finances
improved in 2011. However, as drought related spending increased in 2012 the budget deficit
remained unchanged at the 2011 level of 4.5 percent of GDP.
On the external sector, the current account deficit narrowed from 16.0 percent of GDP in
2010 to 15.5 percent in 2011, reflecting improvements in the goods and services account. In
2012, the current account deficit widened to 17.0 percent of GDP due to imports for the 2011
drought relief and new projects. Gross international reserves in months of import cover rose

2
to 4.8 months of imports of goods and services from 4.4 months in 2010 and 2011
respectively.
Medium-term outlook and polices
The primary policy objective of the Gambian authorities over the near and medium term is to
maintain a stable macroeconomic environment to support strong and sustainable broad-based
growth, increase employment and hasten poverty reduction. To this end, the maintenance of
prudent fiscal and debt policies and consolidation of the recent gains in macroeconomic
stability will remain at the top of the authorities’ economic agenda. In view of this, real GDP
is projected to grow by 6.4 percent and 8.5 percent in 2013 and 2014 respectively, before
returning to trend growth in the outer years. Consumer price inflation stood at 5.9 percent in
July 2013 and is projected to reach 7.0 percent at the end of the year. In the medium term,
inflation is expected to be contained to not more than 5.0 percent as the central bank
continues to implement tight monetary policy. The external current account deficit is forecast
to narrow in 2013-14, reflecting improvement in the trade balance due to growth in exports.
Gross international reserves in months of import cover are projected at 4.5 and 4.7 months of
import cover in 2013 and 2014 respectively.
Fiscal policy
The overriding objective of the authorities’ fiscal policy is to keep expenditure under control
to reduce government’s borrowing requirements and ease pressures on monetary policy. This
will create the fiscal space needed to invest in infrastructure, agriculture and social services
in order to stimulate economic growth and development. The authorities will also intensify
reforms in public finance management to ensure improved fiscal discipline and strengthen
budget procedures as well as enhance the quality of expenditure outcomes.
Furthermore, the Gambian authorities will build on recent gains in tax administration,
especially for the large taxpayer unit and customs, and pursue further tax reforms. They
intend to continue with broadening the tax base and simplifying the tax system. Efforts will
also be made to rationalize tax exemptions and eventually conduct a cost-benefit analysis of
the investment incentive’s framework.
In response to the daunting challenges of the high demand for spending, the authorities will
continue to strengthen the implementation of the cash budget system to eliminate
nonstatutory. spending. At the same time, they are making progress towards implementing
the medium-term expenditure framework. Other expenditure measures include the phasing
out of fuel subsidies by end-2013 by applying monthly fuel price increases and restricting
extrabudgetary expenditures. It is hoped that the fiscal adjustment embarked upon will
improve public finances, keep the overall fiscal spending within budget limits and reduce
dependence on borrowing and grants.

Monetary and exchange rate policies
The focus of the authorities’ monetary policy will continue to be on containing inflation at
not more than 5 percent and maintaining exchange rate stability. To this end, the Central
Bank of The Gambia (CBG) will tighten monetary policy and rely on open market operations
to manage domestic liquidity. The monetary policy stance will be supported by fiscal
consolidation and reduced access by government to direct credit from the CBG. These policy
adjustments, together with sufficient stock of foreign reserves, should help counter recent
depreciation pressures and contain inflation. To enhance the potency of monetary policy
instruments in sterilizing domestic liquidity and deepening of the inter-bank market, the CBG
plans to introduce the repurchase facility (repos) before the end of 2013. In this regard, the
CBG is currently working on the modalities of conducting repos following the “go-live”
ofthe electronic security management system in April 2013. Also, the CBG may use the repo
rate as the policy rate to replace the rediscount rate once the repo is tested and liquidity well
anchored. The CBG will rely less on the reserve requirement as a primary instrument of
liquidity management, consistent with staff recommendations.
The CBG will continue to maintain a floating exchange rate policy, intervening only to
safeguard orderly market conditions. Whenever necessary, the CBG may purchase foreign
exchange from the domestic interbank market to meet its gross international reserves
requirement. Despite recent administrative orders relating to the exchange rate of the local
currency which aims to bring orderliness in the market, the CBG continues to manage and
implement foreign exchange and monetary policy in line with its mandate.
Financial sector policy
My authorities have increased the minimum capital requirement of banks twice in December
2010 and December 2012 to ensure that the banking system remains sound, solvent and
stable. As a result, the banking industry remains sound and satisfactorily capitalized to
absorb shocks. The risk-weighted capital adequacy ratio remains well above the statutory
requirements.
The authorities’ financial sector policy continues to focus on enhancing the regulatory and
supervisory framework of the banking system, with the aim of reducing the cost of financial
intermediation. In this regard, the CBG will continue to strengthen the capacity of its
financial Supervision Department both through maintaining adequate staffing levels and
training. In addition, to address the problem of delinquent credit facilities and improve the
credit environment, a more robust credit reference application system has been installed and
the system became operational in July 2013. Moreover, a Bill for an Act to make provision
for the creation of security interests over moveable assets, the establishment of a Security
Interests on Moveable Assets (Collateral) Registry is expected to be considered by the
National Assembly at its September 2013 sitting. Finally, the new electronic data submission
and off-site supervision system (V-RegCoSS) was completed.

Debt management policy
The Gambian authorities are dedicated to strengthening both external and domestic debt
management in order to avoid a dept trap. To this end, they are fully committed to creating
an enabling environment to attract the flow of non-debt creating foreign direct investment
and exploring productive opportunities for public private partnerships while limiting foreign
financing to concessional loans and grants. The authorities will continue to strengthen debt
management capacity at the national level, particularly at the Ministry of Finance, in order to
enhance the recording and management of public debt statistics, reviewing loan documents,
and assessing the concessionality levels of new loans.
Conclusion
The Gambian authorities are firmly committed to the continued pursuance of prudent fiscal
and monetary policies, sustained debt management practices and the deepening of structural
reforms to attain stable growth, expand job opportunities and hasten poverty reduction. They
appreciate the support they continue to receive from the IMF and the international
community and hope they can count on the continuation of such support to alleviate the
capacity and financial constraints that they face in pursuit of their macroeconomic policy
objectives.
