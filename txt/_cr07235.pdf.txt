REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by Staff Representatives for the
2007 Consultation with the Republic of Kazakhstan
Approved by David Owen and Scott Brown
June 1, 2007

•

Article IV consultation discussions were held April 16–27 with Prime Minister Massimov, Deputy
Prime Minister Mussin, National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) Governor Saidenov, other officials,
and the private sector. The staff team comprised Messrs./Mmes. Husain (head), Laframboise,
Ter Martirosyan, Vtyurina (all MCD), and Lohmus (MCM). Messrs. Khan, Owen (both MCD),
Kiekens, and Saudabaev (both OED) joined the discussions.

•

Kazakhstan accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 in 1996 and maintains an
exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions. The exchange rate regime is a managed float; de facto flexibility against
the dollar, after declining in the second half of 2006, has picked up again in 2007.

•

The authorities subscribe to the SDDS and the provision of data is adequate for surveillance
purposes.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The 2007 Article IV consultation discussions with Kazakhstan focused on the appropriate policy
response to mounting banking sector risks and continuing inflationary pressures.
Background
Kazakhstan’s key challenge is management of sharply rising oil revenues and capital inflows.
Impressive macroeconomic performance continued in 2006, with real GDP expanding by
10.6 percent––the seventh consecutive year of growth near or above 10 percent. The fiscal
position, supported by buoyant oil and nonoil revenues, is very strong, though tax cuts and an
acceleration in spending will narrow the overall surplus in 2007. Banking sector risks are
mounting and inflation remains relatively high. Credit growth has accelerated to almost triple
digits, fueled by an increase of $18 billion (22 percent of GDP) in banks’ external obligations in
2006, and inflation looks likely to pick up again.
Authorities’ views
The authorities intend to continue raising policy interest rates gradually and will reassess reserve
requirements in mid-July, with a view to raising them later in the year. They expect the exchange
rate to strengthen further, helping dampen inflation.
They are also considering tightening prudential regulations further to stem risks. The Financial
Supervision Agency’s (FSA) powers have been enhanced and a sizable increase in its resources
is expected shortly.
The fiscal stance in 2007 strikes a balance between increased spending––to meet pressing social
and infrastructure needs––and saving for future generations. Steps to improve spending
efficiency and quality are being taken.
Staff recommendations
Monetary tightening and exchange rate appreciation are needed to contain risks and dampen
inflation. Staff recommended early action to increase reserve requirements, possibly with a wider
differential between requirements on external versus domestic liabilities. A stronger and more
flexible tenge will also bring inflation down and curb speculative inflows.
Additional prudential tightening will help strengthen banks’ capacity to manage risks and
weather shocks. Staff suggested tougher provisioning regulations and/or higher risk weights.
Banking supervision needs to be enhanced to ensure compliance with prudential regulations.
The fiscal position remains comfortable, but the acceleration of public spending in 2007
exacerbates the burden on monetary and exchange rate policies to keep inflation from rising.
Further measures to enhance the efficiency of spending are needed.

4
I. BACKGROUND
A. Overview
1.
Kazakhstan has sustained very strong macroeconomic performance since the start
of the decade. Annual real GDP growth has averaged over 10 percent and per capita incomes
have now reached about five times the 1999 level in dollar terms. Employment has expanded
steadily and social indicators have improved. The fiscal position has remained very strong,
permitting substantial increases in public expenditures, especially social and infrastructure
spending, as well as an accumulation of large savings in the National Fund (NFRK) for future
generations.
2.
The key near-term policy challenges facing Kazakhstan are mounting
vulnerabilities in the banking sector and continuing inflationary pressures as the authorities
cope with sharply rising oil revenues and capital inflows. Accordingly, the discussions focused
on:
•

the appropriate stance of monetary and exchange rate policies in order to slow the pace of
bank credit growth and external borrowing, and dampen inflation;

•

prudential measures to strengthen banking system stability and banks’ capacity to absorb
shocks; and

•

the authorities’ plans in the fiscal and structural areas.

3.
In previous consultations, the Fund has commended Kazakhstan’s prudent policies.
It has called for tighter monetary policy and prudential regulations, as well as increased
exchange rate flexibility and appreciation, to dampen inflation, mitigate risks in the banking
sector, and support the authorities’ fiscal policy plans. The authorities have implemented most of
the recommendations, but more gradually than suggested.
B. Recent Developments
4.
Economic performance remained impressive in 2006, although relatively high
inflation persists and vulnerabilities have increased.

A jump in FDI and a surge in external

II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Outlook
5.
Economic activity is expected to remain strong and the balance of payments robust.
Nonoil GDP growth should remain close to 10 percent in 2007. Inflation is projected to pick up
again to above 8 percent because of abundant liquidity and the 30 percent increase in public
sector wages granted in January. The current account deficit is projected to widen to 3.3 percent
of GDP, mostly due to continued rapid import growth and higher interest payments. The
financial account surplus is likely to decline as FDI inflows ease to trend levels and foreign
borrowing by banks moderates during the course of the year.
6.
The baseline medium-term scenario is also favorable, although external debt has
risen significantly. Economic activity is expected to remain buoyant, notwithstanding some
moderation in nonoil sector growth. The external position should remain strong, with continued
substantial inflows of FDI. Kazakhstan’s gross external debt, excluding intracompany
obligations—the relevant measure for vulnerability analysis2—should remain manageable under
2

About one-third of external debt comprises intracompany obligations (mainly in the oil sector) without a fixed
repayment schedule. Public debt sustainability analysis was not undertaken in view of the very low level of gross
public debt (6.5 percent of GDP at end-2006).

7
the baseline scenario of continued rapid economic growth and tenge appreciation in an
environment of sustained high oil prices (Table 3 and Figure 1). External debt, which is almost
entirely private but is much higher than a year ago, should also remain manageable under most
shock scenarios.3 However, a sharp exchange rate depreciation would push up debt to a relatively
high level and, through its effect on household and corporate balance sheets, may result in a
significant deterioration in the quality of banks’ loan portfolios.
7.
The main risk to the outlook relates to vulnerabilities in the banking system. The
very rapid growth in bank credit in recent years could lead to a sharp deterioration in loan quality
should the credit cycle turn. Moreover, the banking system’s high reliance on external funding
gives rise to refinancing risks over the medium term. In addition, a decline in external creditors’
appetite for Kazakhstan exposure could have disruptive consequences for the real economy.
Conversely, continued rapid external borrowing by banks would exacerbate the risks highlighted
by the debt sustainability analysis.
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
Large foreign exchange inflows are complicating the task of monetary policy.
•

Despite measures to tighten liquidity, money
and credit aggregates have surged (Box 1 and
Table 4). The NBK broadened and raised
reserve requirements in mid-2006 and increased
its deposit rate by 100 basis points during the
year.

After substantial nominal appreciation of the

tenge appreciated during 2006 by 7½ percent
and 4 percent in real and nominal effective
terms, respectively. The tenge resumed its
upward trend in 2007, appreciating by about
6 percent against the dollar during January–
April.

Box 1. Monetization in Kazakhstan
A steady build-up of confidence in the banking system since the late 1990s has been reflected in strong money
demand and rapidly rising monetization. Although monetization in Kazakhstan remains well below the level in
Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries—suggesting that the process could have significantly further to
run—the pace in Kazakhstan has been faster than in most CEE and CIS economies. Indeed, the decline in
reserve money velocity over the past year has outpaced the trend, which itself has been accelerating. This may
indicate some stabilization of velocity in the months ahead, which could be reflected in a pickup in inflation.

The authorities noted that they have tightened monetary policy over the past year
and would tighten further if inflation did not remain on a downward trajectory. They
observed that the broadening of reserve requirements last July had effectively resulted in a
tripling of required reserves. The requirements would be reassessed in July with a view to further
increasing them later in the year if needed. The authorities also expected interest rates on NBK
notes to continue rising during the year, implying further gradual tightening of the monetary
policy stance. They were concerned, however, that higher domestic interest rates could prompt
more capital inflows and indicated that a substantial portion of outstanding NBK notes were
being held by banks on behalf of foreign clients.
10.
The authorities expected the tenge to strengthen further, which would also help
dampen inflation. They considered exchange rate appreciation consistent with longer-term
fundamentals and observed that recent NBK surveys indicated that even significant further
appreciation would not impair exporters’ competitiveness (Box 2). They were concerned,
however, about speculative inflows related to perceptions of a “one-way bet” and agreed that
flexibility of the tenge in both directions would help limit such flows.
C. Banking Sector Policies
11.
The accommodative monetary policy stance has contributed to a further
acceleration in the already heady growth in bank assets.
Banks have used external funding—which is
mostly of medium- and long-term maturity—
and buoyant growth in domestic deposits to
fund aggressive credit growth, including
lending abroad (mainly to entities in Russia
and other CIS countries). The share of foreign
liabilities in total liabilities has increased to
over one-half from one-quarter at end-2002.

Banks’ external borrowing accelerated further
in early 2007. Kazakhstani banks issued
$5.6 billion in foreign currency bonds in the
first quarter, about 15 percent of total
emerging market corporate bond issuance
during the quarter. This high issuance
volume, together with global financial market
turbulence in early 2007, led to marked
widening of spreads in March, although so far
bank issuance is proceeding apace.

The household and corporate sectors’ foreign
currency exposure has risen.4 As regards the
sectoral distribution of credit, mortgages, car loans,
construction loans, and unsecured consumer credit
have grown especially rapidly, although mortgage
lending (4 percent of GDP) remains lower than in
some peer countries (10–15 percent of GDP).
Aggregate financial soundness indicators remain
comfortable, but these tend to lag behind the credit
cycle (Table 5). The aggregate capital adequacy ratio
remains near 15 percent, bank profits are strong, and
the share of NPLs is relatively low. However, the
classified loans ratio (which includes doubtful loans
that are being serviced) has risen, despite the rapid
growth in total loans (the denominator).

Prudential regulations have been tightened in an effort to slow bank credit and
external borrowing. In the second half of 2006, limits on banks’ short-term external borrowing
were imposed, criteria on household debt service-to-income ratios were introduced, risk weights
on cross-border loans to subinvestment grade borrowers were increased, and regulations on
banks’ foreign currency exposures were tightened. With bank credit and external borrowing
continuing to grow rapidly, the FSA imposed further measures in April 2007, including limits on
external borrowing,5 tighter asset classification rules and differentiated risk weights, and stronger
collateral requirements.

4

In aggregate, banks’ net foreign currency position is broadly balanced. However, they are exposed to significant
indirect currency risk via their foreign currency lending to unhedged households and corporates.

5

6

Banks’ external borrowing is restricted to a multiple ranging from four to six of their regulatory capital. The upper
end of the range applies to banks with the greatest capital.

11

Box 2. Kazakhstan’s Real Exchange Rate
Four approaches to assess the current valuation of the tenge’s real exchange rate (RER) against its estimated equilibrium
level indicate widely different results, but on balance appear to suggest that, as of end-2006, the tenge may have been up
to 20 percent undervalued in real, trade-weighted terms from a medium-term perspective.

A.
B.
C/D.

The purchasing power parity approach estimates the deviation of Kazakhstan’s RER from its “long-run level”
based on an international comparison of price levels and productivity.
The equilibrium real exchange rate approach estimates an “equilibrium” level based on fundamental RER
determinants.
The external sustainability and macroeconomic balance approaches provide estimates of the RER adjustment
needed, respectively, to (i) stabilize the NFA/GDP ratio at its 2004 level; and (ii) eliminate the gap between an
estimated current account “norm” and the projected medium-term current account balance for Kazakhstan.

Estimate B warrants a high degree of caution because the assumption of a zero average misalignment over the sample
period likely did not hold for Kazakhstan. Estimates C and D may also be misleading because they do not incorporate
critical features of Kazakhstan’s economy. Approach C does not capture Kazakhstan’s untapped oil wealth (oil
production is projected to triple over the next decade), but does include foreign debt incurred to extract the oil. Hence, the
“true” NFA position in 2004 was much stronger, implying a substantially smaller undervaluation. Similarly, approach D
fails to take into account Kazakhstan’s relatively undeveloped, and mostly foreign-owned, oil production infrastructure.
Future oil-related capital investment (imports) to increase oil production and large income payments to foreign owners of
the oil production facilities imply a smaller current account surplus (“norm”) than is predicted by the model, in turn
suggesting much smaller overvaluation (or an undervaluation).

Box 3. Kazakhstan’s Credit Boom—Lessons from International Experience
Relative to country peers, the level of banking sector credit and the status of prudential indicators in Kazakhstan do
not appear out of line, but the rate of growth of credit in recent years ranks among the fastest and raises concerns.
The ratio of private sector credit (PSC) to GDP in
Kazakhstan is below the predicted equilibrium level,
based on cross-country regressions using fundamental
determinants such as per capita GDP and real interest
rates (see table). However, its rate of increase appears
excessive, in comparison with its trend and when
compared to a “predicted” level based on fundamentals,
particularly by late 2006.

80
Change in PSC / GDP (percent, 2006-1995)

•

Developments in the external current account and
inflation are at present consistent with observed
attributes of “good” credit booms, defined as those
that do not lead to financial distress (see Country
Report No. 06/19, Chapter IV). However, the
estimated deviation of the PSC/GDP ratio from trend
(albeit still below estimated equilibrium) and the
large capital inflows (associated with the external
funding of Kazakhstan’s boom) are more in line with
credit booms that were followed by financial crises.

Prudential indicators have deteriorated somewhat, but
by less than in other countries experiencing rapid credit
growth. The “distance to default” (the Z-score), which
measures how much the banking system’s return on
assets may fall before banks’ equity capital is
exhausted, has declined. This implies an increase in
solvency risk. However, the deterioration in the Z-score
has been smaller than the average in other countries
with similar rates of credit expansion.

The authorities observed that the prudential measures are having the desired
effects. The limits on short-term external borrowing had prompted banks to refinance their
obligations to longer maturities, thereby reducing near-term rollover risk. Moreover, the
announcement of capital-related limits on banks’ total external obligations had induced several
banks to increase their capital, and several more were expected to do so in the coming months.
While the authorities agreed that the new limits still allowed significant room for the banking
system in aggregate to further expand external borrowing, they believed that the limits would
curtail balance sheet growth of banks with relatively weak capital positions and, therefore,
greater vulnerability to shocks.
14.
While satisfied with the overall health of the banking system, the authorities are
monitoring possible vulnerabilities closely. They observed that the overall capital adequacy
ratio remains comfortably above the 12 percent minimum requirement, and loan-loss provisions
(5 percent of total loans) provide a reasonable buffer. Moreover, their latest stress test results, as
well as illustrative scenarios analyzed by staff, indicate that even sizable exchange rate and
interest rate shocks would have only a limited direct impact. Nevertheless, they are concerned
about the continued rapid expansion of bank credit, especially consumer lending. To mitigate
risks, they are considering further increasing provisioning requirements and/or risk weights,
particularly for unsecured consumer credits. They also noted that compilation of household
credit information by the credit bureau, which had recently started operations, would help reduce
risks related to consumer lending.
15.
Banking supervision is being enhanced. The authorities noted that recent legislation
had strengthened the FSA’s ability to supervise the banking system, including through
consolidated supervision over banking-industrial conglomerates, increased power to suspend
and/or revoke licenses, use of own assessments (as opposed to relying solely on information
provided by banks) to monitor compliance, and removal of managers of institutions not
complying with prudential regulations. Moreover, a sizable increase—amounting to 58 staff
positions—in the FSA’s resources was expected to be approved shortly. The FSA is also
enhancing cooperation with supervision agencies in neighboring countries.
16.
Contingency plans to deal with the emergence of distress are in place. Should a bank
experience liquidity problems, the NBK would serve as lender of last resort and could, if needed,
take over and/or liquidate banks in distress. The authorities observed that the recent liquidation
of a mid-sized bank had proceeded in an orderly fashion under existing procedures. Although the
authorities judge the likelihood of systemic distress to be low, a working group is nevertheless
formulating early warning indicators and drawing up contingency plans and responsibilities of
key agencies, including the role of the budget, to deal with such a scenario.

14
D. Fiscal Policy
17.
Fiscal policy remained prudent in 2006 and is likely to have kept inflation from
rising further, but will increase the burden on monetary policy in 2007.
The overall surplus rose to 7.5 percent of GDP
in 2006 due to shortfalls in the execution of
planned spending, continued strong oil
income, and buoyant nonoil revenues—related
mostly to improvements in tax administration
(Table 6). The nonoil deficit-to-GDP ratio
narrowed sharply.

The nonoil deficit is expected to widen to
4.3 percent of GDP in 2007 due to an
expansion in overall spending, including the
recent public sector wage increase and
supplementary spending currently being
considered by parliament, and to significant
changes in the tax regime, namely a cut in the
VAT rate from 15 percent to 14 percent and
the introduction of a 10 percent flat personal
income tax with a higher minimum threshold.
The overall surplus will narrow by more because
of lower prices. 6

The projected 2007 nonoil deficit will remain well

The authorities acknowledged that the fiscal stance in 2007 would not help dampen
inflationary pressures, but felt that it achieved the right balance between meeting pressing
social and infrastructure development needs and saving for future generations. They are
intensifying scrutiny over expenditure efficiency, and intend to conduct a review of public
financial management with assistance from the World Bank. They plan to reduce the number of
budgetary programs over the medium term, with a view to enhancing spending quality. While the
authorities believe further tax cuts, especially a cut in corporate income taxes to levels more in
line with those in neighboring countries, could speed up the economy’s diversification, they
intend to assess the effects of the 2007 tax reforms before proceeding with further changes in tax
policy.
E. Structural Reform and Other Issues
19.
A number of initiatives are underway to enhance diversification and improve the
nonoil economy’s productivity over the medium term. The authorities envisage that Samruk
and Kazagro—which have been formed to streamline and commercialize the operations of large
state enterprises and agricultural enterprises—will play a key role. In addition, the Sustainable
Development Fund (Kazyna) has been set up to oversee an expansion in the operations of
development institutions, which provide long-term financing for infrastructure and projects in
new industries. A program to privatize state enterprises presently run by various ministries has
been launched. A new law on business licensing adopted in January streamlines the number of
activities licensed from over 1000 to 350. The authorities also enacted a new law to regulate
natural monopolies, directed particularly at utilities, that aims to increase competition. The
authorities have established the Almaty Regional Financial Center (ARFC) to spearhead
development of the securities market.
20.
Some progress has been made in enhancing the investment climate. Negotiations for
Kazakhstan’s accession to the WTO are moving forward, and the authorities indicated that the
main outstanding issues are trade-related investment measures and intellectual property rights.
The authorities have made participation in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative
(EITI) mandatory for all new contracts and aim to publish the external audit report by year-end.
Kazakhstan achieved a ranking of 56 (out of 125 countries) in the World Economic Forum’s
2006 global competitiveness index, with relatively high scores for macro economy and market
efficiency. However, scores for institutions and health and primary education were markedly
lower, and the EBRD’s transition indicators and the World Bank’s doing business survey show
limited recent progress, particularly in governance, enterprise restructuring, competition policy,
and reducing costs of trading across borders.
21.
Progress has also been achieved in improving macroeconomic data monitoring. A
recent IMF Statistics Department mission found that Kazakhstan is in observance of the Special
Data Dissemination Standards and “observes” or “largely observes” all but two of the 132 best
practices outlined in the Fund’s Data Quality Assessment Framework. Over the past year,
notable progress has been made in reconciling external debt data prepared by different agencies,

16
compiling external debt statistics on a remaining maturity basis, and constructing an aggregate
debt service profile. Draft AML/CFT legislation has been prepared and is being considered by
parliament.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
22.
Kazakhstan’s rapid economic growth is continuing, but policy challenges to
sustaining the strong performance have intensified. While the positive external environment
is likely to prevail in the near term, inflation remains at a relatively high level and the banking
sector’s vulnerability to shocks has risen. Policy measures to lower inflation and mitigate
banking sector risks would help ensure a continued favorable macroeconomic outlook.
23.
Additional monetary policy tightening is needed to curb credit growth and mitigate
risks. The steps by the NBK to tighten monetary conditions over the past year are welcome, but
money and credit growth remain excessive. An expeditious move to further increase reserve
requirements will soak up banks’ liquidity, thereby helping to dampen inflationary pressures.
Moreover, a larger differential between requirements relating to external versus domestic
liabilities should help slow external borrowing by making it less attractive than domestic
funding. Higher policy interest rates will also help reduce liquidity. Although this could attract
greater capital inflows, increased reserve requirements should offset such an effect.
24.
A stronger tenge and greater exchange rate flexibility would support monetary
tightening in bringing inflation down. Allowing the tenge to appreciate further will facilitate a
scaling back of the NBK’s intervention in the foreign exchange market, as in recent months,
implying slower tenge liquidity growth. Greater exchange rate flexibility should help remove
perceptions of a “one-way bet” that may have encouraged capital inflows and foreign currency
borrowing. Furthermore, exchange rate appreciation will translate directly into lower tenge
prices for imports, which will dampen inflation. Conversely, limiting nominal appreciation at the
expense of higher inflation will not safeguard competitiveness and will make the eventual
disinflation more difficult and costly.
25.
Additional prudential tightening is also needed to contain risks related to the rapid
growth in bank credit and external debt. The FSA has appropriately tightened regulations in a
number of areas over the past year and, encouragingly, banks have responded by increasing the
maturity structure of their external obligations and some have also raised their capital base.
However, many banks still have considerable room to continue to borrow externally, as
evidenced by their announced borrowing plans, and credit growth remains very high. Thus,
vulnerabilities are likely to mount further, implying a need for additional prudential measures to
strengthen the banking system’s capacity to weather shocks. Measures could include a further
tightening of provisioning regulations, more stringent collateral regulations, and higher risk
weights, particularly for consumer loans, foreign currency loans to unhedged borrowers,
mortgages with high loan-to-value ratios, and, if warranted, cross-border lending.

17
26.
Banking supervision should be intensified to ensure banks’ compliance with
prudential regulations. The recent legislation enhancing the FSA’s supervisory powers, plans
to augment the FSA’s resources, and efforts to boost cross-border supervisory cooperation are
important steps. As a substantial increase in the frequency and depth of full-scale on-site
inspections will take time, more frequent limited-scope inspections should be undertaken in the
near term. In addition, inspections should seek to ensure that banks maintain, on a consolidated
basis, adequate risk management and internal control systems and comply with prudential
regulations. The FSA should be ready to deal with any violations of regulations expeditiously.
The formulation of early warning indicators and contingency plans to handle the emergence of
distress in the banking system are valuable proactive steps.
27.
Fiscal policy has been prudent, but the easing of the fiscal stance in 2007 will require
additional monetary tightening and exchange rate appreciation to keep inflation from
rising. While the acceleration of public spending should help address Kazakhstan’s still
substantial social and infrastructure development needs, it underscores the need for steps to
enhance spending efficiency. In this context, reducing the number of budgetary programs, along
with other measures to strengthen public financial management that may result from the
prospective review with the World Bank, will be useful.
28.
Intensified structural reforms will help sustain strong economic performance over
the medium term. Early WTO accession, customs administration reform, and further progress
in reducing cross-border trade costs should secure productivity gains. The staff welcomes the
program underway to privatize state enterprises, which should facilitate enterprise restructuring
and enhance competition policy, areas where Kazakhstan’s ranking in international structural
reform indicators is relatively weak. Plans to boost the development of the securities market,
which should result in enhanced corporate transparency and governance, are welcome, although
increased availability of financing through development institutions could reduce the corporate
sector’s demand for funding through the issuance of equity and debt securities, thereby impeding
the development of the capital market.
29.
Progress has been achieved in enhancing macroeconomic data monitoring, and
further steps would be desirable. Over the past year, important steps have been taken to
improve external debt data, particularly its monitoring on a remaining-maturity basis. The
assessment of vulnerabilities would be enhanced further by progress in disaggregating import
data across the oil and nonoil sectors of the economy. The staff also urges expeditious
completion of the project to broaden the concept of public debt to include obligations of state
enterprises and development institutions. While public debt ratios are likely to remain low after
this adjustment, it will present a more accurate and transparent picture of public sector
indebtedness.
30.
The staff welcomes the progress made in complying with the EITI and urges expeditious
completion and publication of the external audit report. The staff also encourages early passage
of AML/CFT legislation that meets international standards.

18

It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12-month
cycle.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms, g = real
GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising
inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
4/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both noninterest current account and nondebt inflows in percent of GDP.
5/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and nondebt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their
levels of the last projection year.

VIII. Exchange Rate Arrangements
The currency of Kazakhstan is the tenge, which was introduced in November 1993. The
official exchange rate is determined on the basis of foreign exchange auctions that are held
daily. Auctions are held for U.S. dollars, euros, and Russian rubles, and official rates are
quoted for over 30 other currencies on the basis of cross-rates. Since late 1999, the exchange
rate regime has been a managed float with no pre-announced path. On April 30, 2007, the
tenge/U.S. dollar rate was 120.2. The exchange rates at numerous exchange bureaus are very

3

close to the auction rate, and the spread between buying and selling rates is very small. The
exchange system is free from restrictions on payments and transfers for current international
transactions.
IX.

Article IV Consultation

Kazakhstan is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. The last consultation was
concluded on June 14, 2006 (see IMF Country Report No. 06/244).

FSAP Participation and ROSCs

Kazakhstan participated in the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) in 2000.
The staff report on the Financial Sector Stability Assessment (FSSA) was issued on
November 27, 2000 (FO/DIS/00/142). The FSSA included the following ROSC
modules: Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision, Core Principles for
Systemically Important Payment Systems, Code of Good Practices on Transparency in
Monetary and Financial Policies, IOSCO Objectives and Principles of Securities
Regulation, and IAIS Insurance Core Principles. An FSAP update mission took place in
February 2004. The fiscal transparency module was completed in October 2002 and the final
report published in April 2003. A data module mission took place in April/May 2002, and its
final report was published in March 2003. An update of the data ROSC was undertaken in
2006 and the report is being finalized (see Annex 5).
XI.

Technical Assistance

Kazakhstan has received technical assistance and training by the Fund in virtually every area
of economic policy, including through about 75 technical assistance missions provided
during 1993–2003 by FAD, LEG, MFD, STA, and the IMF Institute. In addition to shortterm missions, the Fund has provided resident advisors to the National Bank of Kazakhstan,
to the Agency of Statistics of the Republic of Kazakhstan, and to the Ministry of Finance.
Other international agencies and governments, including the World Bank, EU TACIS,
EBRD, UNDP, and OECD, also are providing a wide variety of technical assistance.
The following list summarizes the technical assistance provided by the Fund to Kazakhstan
since 2002.
Monetary and Financial Systems
Technical assistance has enabled steady progress to be made in a number of areas related to
monetary and exchange affairs, including banking legislation, central bank accounting,
payments system reform, central bank organization and management, foreign operations and
reserve management, banking supervision, monetary statistics, currency issuance, monetary
operations, and money-market development.

Annex II. Kazakhstan: Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of April 30, 2007)
Kazakhstan became a member of the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD) and International Development Association (IDA) in July 1992
and of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in September 1993. The Bank’s
lending program has been curtailed in recent years as a result of the country’s reduced
borrowing needs, but the program of economic research has expanded and in FY07 it
amounts to US$4 million, of which about 75 percent is directly financed by the authorities.
The research under this umbrella focuses on issues of overall competitiveness, fiscal and
expenditure management, human development, infrastructure, and the environment.
At present, there are ten active projects (nine IBRD loans and one Global
Environmental Facility (GEF) grant) with a total commitment of US$648 million, of
which US$370 million has been disbursed. In the active portfolio, there are five old loans
(Uzen Oil Field Rehabilitation, Road Transport Restructuring, Electricity Transmission
Rehabilitation, Syr Darya Control and Northern Aral Sea – Phase I, and Nura River CleanUp) with a commitment of US$454 million, one old GEF grant (Drylands Management) of
US$5 million, and four new loans which have gone to the board since FY06 (Agricultural
Post–Privatization Assistance – Phase II, Agricultural Competitiveness, North–South
Electricity Transmission, and Forest Protection and Reforestation) with a commitment of
US$189 million.
The Bank is also preparing seven new loans (Ust–Kamenogorsk Environment Remediation,
Irrigation and Drainage—Phase II, Syr Darya Control and Northern Aral Sea—Phase II,
Technology Commercialization, Customs Service Modernization, Health Sector Technology
Transfer and Institutional Reform, and Territorial Development) with an expected financing
envelope of about US$368 million.
Kazakhstan is IFC's largest client in Central Asia. IFC’s net committed projects there,
which amount to US$277 million for its own account plus US$75 million in syndicated
loans, are concentrated primarily in the oil, gas, mining and financial sectors. To date,
US$252 million have been disbursed. IFC has also been active in the promotion of small and
medium enterprises, leasing, and the provision of Technical Assistance in the areas of
corporate governance, housing, leasing, and SMEs.
The Bank is assisting the government in attracting grants from the Global Environmental
Facility, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, and, together with UNAIDS,
the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Malaria, and TB.

6

Annex III. Kazakhstan: Relations with the EBRD
(As of December 31, 2006)
1.
The EBRD is the largest investor outside the oil and gas sector in Kazakhstan.
As of December 2006, the Bank has signed 50 projects (on a net cumulative basis) worth
€2.8 billion, including EBRD financing of €1.4 billion. The EBRD’s gross cumulative
disbursements amounted to €1170.4 million. During 2006, the Bank provided direct
financing of €242.0 million to Kazakhstan’s private sector. The Bank continues to be actively
involved across a number of sectors in private and public sector projects with a concentration
in the financial sector. The Bank expects to sign new project agreements in Kazakhstan
worth about €200 million per year. Operations in Kazakhstan are focused on building earning
assets in the oil and gas sector and on development of the small and medium-sized enterprise
(SME) sector. There is also a well-established, effective relationship between the Bank and
the government for financings in the transport and general industry sectors. About 70 percent
of all investments are now in the private sector.
Bank involvement in the country is guided by the Bank’s most recent country strategy for
Kazakhstan, approved in November 2006.
Strategic priorities for 2007–2008
The Bank’s Strategic priorities comprise:
•
•
•
•
•

Engaging actively in the further reform process by working with both private and
public sectors.
Broadening the Bank’s operations and increasing its impact with a special focus on
the corporate sector, including SMEs, to support the diversification of the economy
and to promote competition.
Continuing to finance infrastructure, with a strong emphasis on the transport and
power sectors.
Staying engaged in the financial sector, with a clear focus on enhancing competition
and supporting nonbank financial services as well as capital markets.
Promoting higher transparency and governance standards, and FDI.

In its operations, the Bank will continue to use traditional product instruments to achieve its
strategic goals. However, to support the above-mentioned objectives, the Bank will
emphasise innovation and the use of more sophisticated products, alongside traditional
funding instruments, including:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Capital market transactions, including equity funds and securitisation
Energy efficiency related investments
Adequately structured public private partnerships (PPP)s
Equity and mezzanine financing
Financing micro and small enterprises in the rural and agricultural sectors
Local currency funding
Cofinancing with domestic banks
Expansion of TAM and BAS

7

2.
The Bank will continue to increase the presence and efficiency of the Bank’s
operations, improve the delivery of services, and enhance the policy dialogue by
building up the Almaty Resident Office as the regional presence for Bank expertise in
Central Asia. This will include strengthening the skills and seniority of Bank staff based in
Kazakhstan, including sector team presence and experience and possibly certain support
functions, such as economists, located in the field.
Strategic objectives for 2007–2008
The Bank’s main operational objectives comprise:
Enterprise sector—Support economic diversification and enhance competition by working
directly with corporates across various sectors such as general industry, power, agribusiness,
telecoms and property. Promote projects leading to higher energy efficiency and increase the
capitalisation of enterprises through equity investments. Increase competition in the natural
resources sector by working with smaller operators and on higher risk projects. Dedicate
resources in order to directly finance smaller projects and to continue to provide micro
financing and tailored capacity building using the Kazakhstan Small Business Programme
(KSBP) and leasing facility. Promote high standards of corporate governance, integrity and
transparency of ownership, including through FDI to Kazakhstan. Selectively support
regional cross-border expansion of reputable companies to neighbouring markets.
Infrastructure—Increase support in transport, energy and telecommunication infrastructure
development to satisfy the growing needs of the economy and promote respective sectoral
reforms. The Bank will focus on nonsovereign projects. On a selective basis, it will take a
leadership role in developing and actively engaging in appropriately structured public-private
partnerships (PPPs) that involve competitive tender processes. Work with state holding
company Samruk to find synergies between different parts of infrastructure and improve
corporate governance in respective of state owned enterprises. Support further regulatory and
tariff development that promotes investments and fair access to infrastructure. Given
Kazakhstan’s remoteness from major markets and low population density, the Bank will
continue to work closely with the private sector, government authorities and other IFIs on
sustainable solutions for infrastructure, and to promote regional cooperation.
Financial sector—To promote strategic FDI in the financial sector and to open up the capital
base of local banks to reputable financial investors through initial public offerings (IPOs) or
private placements. To continue working actively with existing shareholders of the Kazakh
banks to achieve better transparency of ownership and corporate governance. Facilitate
competition in the financial sector by providing debt and equity, particularly to medium size
banks and nonbank microfinance institutions (NBMFIs), supporting additional micro, small
and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). On debt products, in view of the developed access
to capital markets, the Bank will be particularly attentive in developing projects with specific
attributes which meet additionality concerns and contribute to transition. A special emphasis
will be on the provision of financial resources outside the capital cities, as well as improving
the efficient delivery of financing to the micro and small sectors. The Bank will support the
development of financial services such as leasing, mortgages, insurance and pensions, and
facilitate the securitisation of assets by Kazakh financial institutions. The Bank will assist the

8

Government in privatising the few remaining state-owned financial institutions concerned
with pensions and mortgages.
Policy dialogue—Support the Government in their efforts to improve the investment climate
and drive long-term economic diversification, leading to improved global competitiveness.
Cooperate with newly created state holding companies Samruk and Kazyna to achieve
corporate governance and operational improvements in state-owned enterprises. Promote
adequate behaviour and transparent practices and fight corruption to improve the business
environment. Promote adoption of the anti-money laundering (AML) legislation, especially
in light of the government initiative to create the Regional Financial Centre in Almaty
(RFCA).
Main trends in the portfolio over the past year
Enterprise Sector: The most notable progress was made in the General Industry sector: Two
new industry projects were signed: an equity investment in Steppe Cement (EBRD finance
€1.9 million), and a loan to Bericap Kazakhstan (EBRD finance €1.9 million). An additional
project in the enterprise sector was signed: a loan to Savola Kazakhstan (EBRD finance
€3.0 million). Agricultural producers received an additional support through the Warehouse
Receipts Program to Alliance Bank, totalling € 3.8 million.
Financial Sector: The Bank has strengthened its efforts to improve transparency of
ownership and integrity in Kazakhstan's banking sector. By supporting the financial sector in
the development of SME credit lines, the Team continued to support MSMEs through
financial intermediaries. The new Kazakhstan KSBP III program started with a specific focus
on the rural and agricultural sectors. Two credit lines to new partners, Kazakhstan Loan Fund
(KLF), and Alliance Bank have been committed totalling €6.9 million. An additional SME
loan through Alliance Bank was signed for financing of €7.6 million. The Bank promoted
further development of the market for residential mortgages by providing a mortgage loan to
Alliance Bank for € 18.0 million.
3.
The Trade Facilitation Program (TFP) remained an important instrument in
supporting a wide range of trade transactions of Kazakh enterprises, including longterm intra-regional imports. A new TFP line of €12.2 million was opened to Alliance
Bank. In 2006, the Bank started two new trade finance advisory services projects, funded by
the Government of the Netherlands and the EU, under which foreign consultants support
Kazakh banks in the development of their domestic and international factoring business and
marketing of all type of trade finance services. In 2006, the team committed further loans and
guarantees under the Regional Trade facilitation program in excess of €100 million.
Energy sector: In 2006, the Bank financed a € 9.1 million loan to Bautino Atash Marine and
Supply Base-Debt project. The project will respond to a wide range of off-shore oilfield
operators’ needs, such as fuel & water provision, base infrastructure, and services and crew
change facilities.

9

4.
The overall quality of the Bank's portfolio in Kazakhstan remains excellent, with
performing assets representing 100 per cent of operating assets. The current portfolio in
Kazakhstan has an average risk rating of 5.42. More than 70 per cent of all EBRD
investments are now in the private sector. The private/public ratio of the portfolio is not
expected to change much during the coming year. Although the focus of the Bank’s activities
is on the private sector, there are a few large public sector projects in the pipeline.

Annex IV. Kazakhstan: Relations with the Asian Development Bank
(As of February 2007)
Kazakhstan became a member of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in 1994. As of
February 2007, total public sector loan commitments amounted to $483 million, covering
14 loans in agriculture and natural resources, education, finance, transport and
communications, and water supply, sanitation and waste management. Kazakhstan is no
longer eligible for concessional resources from the Asian Development Fund. As of
January 17, 2007, total loan disbursements amounted to $435 million.
ADB's focal areas continue to be private sector development, environmentally sustainable
development, and regional cooperation.
Private sector operations, which commended in 2005, are the forefront of current and
future ADB operations in the country. A Private Sector Operations Agreement between
the Republic of Kazakhstan and ADB was signed in November 2004. It provided a basis for
ADB's business opportunities in the Kazakhstani private sector. In 2006, ADB granted three
private sector loans in the amount of $225 million to boost financial sector development and
SME support in Kazakhstan. These loans became ADB's first private sector financings
without a government guarantee in the country.
ADB operations for the private sector focus primarily on two sectors: (i) finance and
capital markets, and (ii) infrastructure. In the financial and capital markets sector, ADB
assists private sector intermediaries in banking, leasing, venture capital financing, merchant
banking, micro credit, small- and medium- enterprises (SME), housing finance, private
equity funds, mutual funds, insurance, securitization, credit enhancement, and credit rating.
In the infrastructure sector, ADB’s focus is on telecommunications, power and energy, water
supply and sanitation, ports, airports, toll roads, and support for subsovereign credit.
This new thrust towards private sector operations will be supported by public sector technical
assistance, investments to create an enabling environment for the private sector, and selected
public lending programs in rural water supply and water resources management aimed at
improving livelihood in rural areas and reducing urban-rural gap.
The ADB has provided Kazakhstan with TA grants in several sectors, including agriculture,
education, finance, pension reform, transportation, energy, water supply and sanitation, aid
coordination and management, public investment programming, and poverty reduction
planning and implementation. As of February 9, 2007, ADB’s TA program (since it started in
l994) reached 63 technical assistance projects for a total of $27 million.

11

Annex V. Kazakhstan: Statistical Issues
The quality and coverage of the economic statistics are generally adequate for
surveillance. Kazakhstan has made considerable progress since the 2002 data ROSC. On
March 24, 2003, Kazakhstan became the 53rd subscriber to the Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS), marking a major step forward in the development of the country’s
statistical system. Among the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States, it is the
first country to graduate from the General Data Dissemination System to the SDDS and the
second to subscribe to the SDDS. Measures have been taken to address delays in
disseminating SDDS data for different data categories, including the official reserve assets
and government finance statistics.
Building on the progress achieved since 2002, IMF missions in February and in
August 2006 assisted in developing a more analytically useful disaggregation of the
national accounts and balance of payments into oil and non-oil sector components. This
should permit a better assessment of macroeconomic developments and policy formulation.
STA also provided recommendations for improving the quarterly national accounts (QNA)
data.
Sector specific issues
In the area of national accounts, several weaknesses remain in both the quality of GDP
estimates by sector produced by the National Statistical Agency (NSA), and the quality and
timeliness of GDP estimates by expenditure. First, the quality of GDP estimates by industry
is affected by the limited coverage of small businesses in selected activities such as retail and
construction. Second, while some progress has been made in making GDP estimates by
final expenditure consistent with output-based measures, data compilation and
dissemination of quarterly GDP series data should be conducted on a discrete basis only. The
2006 Multitopic Statistics Mission on Oil Activities made recommendations in a number of
other areas, including: deflators, data sources for intermediate consumption and inventories,
adjustments for holding gains for intermediate consumption, methods for deriving constant
price estimates of changes in inventories, taxes and subsidies, and retail trade, and methods
for recording work in progress. In addition, a November–December 2006 data ROSC
reassessment mission noted acute staff shortages in the National Accounts Department.
Overall, the NSA utilizes sound statistical techniques to ensure the accuracy and reliability of
the consumer price index (CPI). However, use of the geometric mean as elementary
aggregate is recommended instead of the relative of average prices, as is the case for the
producer price index. Also, there is scope for improving the imputation method used for
some seasonal items in long time series for the CPI.
Progress has also been made in the classification of the fiscal accounts consistent with the
Fund’s Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001). However, as a result of
the reorganization of the public sector, including the redefinition of budgetary units,
difficulties have arisen with regard to the recording and reporting of expenditure arrears.
Since 1997, the authorities have reported detailed data for publication in the GFS Yearbook.
The latest data reported for publication cover consolidated general government and are

12

presented using the new template consistent with the GFSM 2001. The Ministry of Finance
also provides monthly indicators covering the general government for publication in
International Financial Statistics (IFS).
The existing framework for compiling monetary statistics generally conforms to
recommended Fund methodology, and data are compiled on a timely basis. Steps are being
taken by the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) to further improve the quality and
coverage of data. In particular, the chart of accounts for commercial banks has been
revised to enable the NBK to distinguish sectors and financial instruments in accordance with
the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. The NBK has extended institutional
coverage to compile a financial sector survey that includes the Development Bank. The
authorities have started implementing the recommendations of past money and banking
statistics missions regarding the use of residency criteria as defined in the Balance of
Payments Manual, fifth edition (BPM5), including classifying foreign branches and foreign
companies’ representatives as “resident.”
There are also shortcomings in external debt statistics. Public and publicly-guaranteed debt
excludes external debt of public enterprises and development institutions, which is instead
included in private debt.
In the area of balance of payments, the overall quality and timeliness of data are
satisfactory. Considerable progress has been made in implementing Fund technical assistance
recommendations. In particular, the coverage of trade data has been improved through a
survey to determine the volume of shuttle trade and travel expenses. The NBK has also
worked closely with relevant agencies, including STA staff, to update the ratios used for
adjusting c.i.f. imports to an f.o.b. basis, which resulted in a revision of import data from
2000 to 2004. Compilation of export and import price indices has been initiated, and
historical data are also now available. However, foreign direct investment statistics are not
fully in line with the standards set forth in BPM5, as local branch offices of foreign
companies operating in the construction sector are considered nonresident entities. This leads
to discrepancies with national accounts statistics where this activity is treated as domestic
production.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Kazakhstan
On June 27, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Kazakhstan.1
Background
Economic performance has remained impressive over the past year, although relatively high
inflation persists and vulnerabilities have increased. Output expanded by 10.6 percent in 2006,
the seventh consecutive year of growth at around 10 percent. Employment continued to
increase and real wage growth was strong. Despite buoyant export growth, the current
account was in moderate deficit, driven by a rapid increase in imports. A jump in foreign direct
investment and a surge in external borrowing by banks contributed to a large increase in the
capital account surplus, leading to an US$11 billion accumulation in official reserves. However,
banks’ external liabilities more than doubled in 2006 to 41 percent of GDP, implying greater
vulnerability related to the increase in external indebtedness, and inflation remained relatively
high.
Large foreign exchange inflows are complicating the task of monetary and prudential policies.
Despite measures to tighten liquidity, including broadening and raising reserve requirements
and increasing policy interest rates, money and credit aggregates have surged. Prudential
1 Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

regulations have also been tightened in an effort to slow bank credit and external borrowing.
Since mid-2006, limits on banks’ short-term external borrowing were imposed, criteria on
household debt service-to-income ratios have been introduced, regulations on banks’ foreign
currency exposures have been tightened, and, more recently, limits on bank’s total external
borrowing have been established. The tenge appreciated against the dollar by 4 percent in
2006 and a further 6 percent during January–April 2007.
Fiscal policy remained prudent in 2006 and helped prevent inflation from rising further. The
overall surplus rose to 7.5 percent of GDP, of which more than 90 percent was saved in the
National Fund. The surplus is expected to narrow to 4.3 percent of GDP in 2007 on account of
lower oil prices and an acceleration in public spending.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities’ prudent macroeconomic policies and sound
oil revenue management, which have contributed to Kazakhstan’s impressive economic
performance. In 2006, real GDP growth remained robust, employment continued to increase,
and social indicators improved further, while the fiscal position—supported by buoyant oil and
non-oil revenues—remained very strong. At the same time, these successes have spurred
investor interest and led to large capital inflows, with a consequent acceleration in credit
growth and rise in inflationary pressures.
Looking ahead, Directors considered that economic prospects for Kazakhstan remain bright.
They noted that, while the positive external environment would likely prevail in the near term,
policy measures to lower inflation and mitigate mounting banking sector risks are needed to
ensure a continued favorable macroeconomic outlook. Structural reforms to further enhance
diversification and improve the investment climate will help sustain strong economic
performance over the medium term.
Directors encouraged the authorities to take further steps to tighten the monetary policy
stance. They welcomed the measures to tighten liquidity implemented over the past year, but
noted that money and credit growth remains excessive. Directors recommended early action to
further increase reserve requirements, possibly with a wider differential between requirements
on external versus domestic liabilities, and to raise policy interest rates.
Directors noted that a stronger and more flexible tenge would support monetary tightening in
bringing inflation down and restraining speculative inflows. They observed that real exchange
rate appreciation would also be in line with longer-term fundamentals and suggested that
nominal appreciation, rather than higher inflation, would better facilitate the adjustment.
Directors welcomed the recent prudential measures aimed at containing risks related to the
rapid growth in bank credit and external debt—especially the capital-based limits on external
borrowing, criteria on household debt service-to-income ratios, and tighter regulations on
banks’ foreign currency exposures.

3
With bank credit and external borrowing—and the associated risks—continuing to grow
rapidly, Directors recommended that the authorities consider tightening prudential regulations
further. They recommended, in particular, increasing provisioning requirements and
implementing more stringent collateral regulations and risk weights for unsecured consumer
credits.
Directors emphasized that vigorous supervisory effort is needed to ensure banks’ compliance.
They therefore welcomed the recent legislation enhancing the Financial Supervision Agency’s
(FSA) supervisory powers, as well as the plans to increase the FSA’s resources. Directors
viewed the authorities’ progress in formulating early warning indicators and contingency plans
as valuable proactive steps to limiting risks. Directors encouraged the authorities to move
ahead with enhancing Anti-Money Laundry/Combating Financing of Terrorism legislation in
line with international standards.
Directors noted that fiscal policy has remained prudent but emphasized that the easing of the
fiscal stance in 2007 would require additional monetary tightening and exchange rate
appreciation to keep inflation from rising. Observing that the acceleration of public spending is
aimed at addressing Kazakhstan’s still substantial social and infrastructure development
needs, they underscored the benefits of enhancing spending efficiency. In this regard,
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to conduct a review of public financial
management, with assistance from the World Bank.
Directors emphasized the importance of intensified structural reforms to improve
competitiveness and underpin prospects for the non-oil sector. They noted that early WTO
accession, customs administration reform, and further progress in enhancing regional trade
would secure productivity gains. Directors welcomed the initiation of the program to privatize
state enterprises, which should facilitate enterprise restructuring and enhance competition
policy.
Directors commended the notable progress in improving external debt data, particularly its
monitoring on a remaining-maturity basis. They noted that the assessment of vulnerabilities
would be enhanced further by progress in disaggregating import data across the oil and non-oil
sectors of the economy. Directors urged expeditious completion of the project to broaden the
concept of public debt to include obligations of state enterprises and development institutions.
They also welcomed the progress made in complying with The Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative and called for early publication of the external audit report.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
