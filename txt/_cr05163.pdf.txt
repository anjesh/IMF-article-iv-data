EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Economic performance over the last three years has been impressive. High primary surpluses
have lessened concerns over debt sustainability, lowering risk premia and real interest rates. As a
result, the economy has recovered strongly from the 2000-01 crisis, growing by almost 8 percent in
2002 and 6 percent in 2003. Inflation has fallen sharply from 70 percent at end-2000 to less than 20
percent at end-2003 and is now in single digits.
Although on track to meet or exceed this year’s targets of 5 percent growth and 12 percent
inflation, the economy faces problems of excess demand and a current account deficit rising towards
4 percent of GNP. The recent increase in secondary market interest rates and the depreciation of the
exchange rate, associated with tensions in emerging markets generally, should help to contain
domestic demand growth. But if these prove insufficient, the authorities need to be ready to take
fiscal measures to arrest the deterioration of the current account. Further exchange rate adjustment
may also be needed, even though this will raise the burden of external debt and add to inflation.
For the medium term, the main challenge is to implement policies that achieve the goals of
sustained growth and low inflation. With its commanding majority in Parliament and with new
elections not needed for another three years, the government has an unprecedented opportunity to
implement the difficult structural reforms needed to achieve this.
•

Fiscal policy. The government needs to complement its strong record of fiscal consolidation
by implementing structural fiscal reforms to sustain this adjustment. This includes reform of
the social security system (which is running deficits of close to 5 percent of GNP), tax
administration reform to combat the informal economy, and tax policy reform to simplify the
tax system and broaden the base. These reforms will make it easier to maintain the 6½
percent of GNP primary surplus target.

•

Monetary policy. Inflation reduction has been a major success, but the framework of base
money targets and implicit inflation targeting is coming under strain. While adopting formal
inflation targeting (the CBT’s ultimate objective) may still be premature, the CBT could
make its operating framework more transparent.

•

Banking reform. Confidence in the banking system has improved considerably since the
crisis. Priorities now include monitoring the removal of the blanket guarantee, ensuring the
state banks do not distort the banking system, removing tax impediments to financial
intermediation, and recovering assets seized from failed banks.

•

Improving the investment climate. The authorities need to take steps to encourage foreign
direct investment (which is much lower than in other emerging market countries), to make
good on their plans for privatization, and to reform the judicial system to facilitate the
functioning of Turkey’s market economy.

•

Financing needs. Turkey faces considerable external debt repayments in the next three years.
This challenging financing outlook, together with the need to contain domestic demand and
to preserve debt sustainability, highlights the importance of continued tight fiscal policy.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The 2004 Article IV consultation takes place at an opportune time. First, the
current program is drawing to an end, and the authorities will soon decide whether they wish
to request a successor arrangement. Second, later this year the European Union will formally
assess Turkey’s compliance with the Copenhagen criteria and its eligibility to begin
accession negotiations. Finally, recent tensions in financial markets have brought out a
number of difficult short-term policy challenges that the authorities need to address—a
reminder that, despite recent progress, Turkey is still highly vulnerable to shifts in sentiment
towards emerging markets. The Article IV consultation therefore offers a well-timed
opportunity to take stock of what has been achieved under the program, to set out reform
priorities ahead (which could provide useful input for any new program), and to gauge
Turkey’s challenges in commencing EU accession negotiations.
II. FROM ECONOMIC CRISIS TO ECONOMIC RECOVERY
A. The Economic Crisis
2.
For Turkey, the 1990s was a decade of economic mismanagement. Although
economic growth averaged 4 percent, it was extremely volatile. Inflation was variable and
high, averaging close to 80 percent and peaking in 1994 at more than 100 percent. High
inflation raised nominal interest rates, and with it the public sector borrowing requirement,
which increased from 10 percent of GNP in 1991 to more than 20 percent in 1999. High
deficits and inflation uncertainty pushed up real interest rates and slowed growth, and
doubled the public debt ratio to 60 percent of GNP.
3.
The collapse of the 2000 exchange rate based disinflation program magnified
these weaknesses. Although the crawling peg had reduced inflation and interest rates
significantly, competitiveness deteriorated. With domestic demand booming and fiscal policy
failing to tighten, the current account deficit worsened. Vulnerabilities in the financial sector
increased, as poorly supervised banks bet on the success of the program by borrowing
overnight and in foreign currency, and investing in longer-term TL paper, anticipating further
reductions in interest rates. When the exchange rate came under pressure in late 2000 and
again in early 2001, interest rates increased, highlighting these weaknesses in the financial
system. When the exchange rate was finally allowed to float in February 2001, it lost more
than half of its value. This pushed inflation back up to 70 percent by the end of the year, and
increased the government’s net debt ratio to more than 90 percent of GNP (75 percent using
centered GNP). Parts of the banking system faced huge losses both because of the collapse of
the exchange rate, and the high interest rates and borrowing costs that preceded it.

-6-

B. The Economic Recovery Strategy
4.
With the devaluation of the exchange rate and the sharp rise in interest rates,
the outlook for disinflation, debt sustainability, and renewed growth appeared bleak.
Although the possibility of debt restructuring loomed, it was quickly ruled out.
5.
The reforms launched in May 2001, and extended into the current program in
early 2002, were a strong attempt to address Turkey’s underlying vulnerabilities. With
debt restructuring ruled out, the first priority was to ensure debt rollover and debt
sustainability. Notwithstanding the severe recession, this meant committing to high and
sustained primary surpluses. For 2001, the target was 5½ percent of GNP; this was increased
to 6½ percent of GNP in 2002 and beyond. The exchange rate was allowed to float, its role as
nominal anchor abandoned. Instead, to reduce inflation the central bank was freed from any
obligation to finance the deficit, and given operational independence to reach its new primary
objective of achieving and maintaining price stability. To do this, the staff advocated the
early introduction of formal inflation targeting, though this was perhaps premature given the
high inflation rate and fiscal dominance problems. However, given Turkey’s severe balance
of payments and government financing problems, these efforts at macroeconomic
stabilization would not have had the chance to succeed without substantial outside financial
assistance. This was supplied by the Fund.
6.
The program also strongly emphasized structural reform, largely to signal a
break from the failed economic policies of the past. To reduce a key source of
vulnerability and quasi-fiscal activity, the banking system was restructured and recapitalized
(first the state banks, then the private banks), at a cost of US$47 billion (more than
30 percent of GNP). A wide range of other structural reforms was also introduced, from
privatization to governance reform, in an attempt to change the way the economy functioned
and to demonstrate this to markets.
C. Macroeconomic Performance under the Program
7.
The program strategy has delivered a dramatic improvement in financial
market confidence (Figure 1). Though markets were volatile through much of 2001, the
February 2002 augmentation and relaunching of the program helped assuage the financing
concerns that had resurfaced after September 11, 2001. Despite interruptions from domestic
political tensions (early elections in 2002) and outside shocks (the Iraq War), interest rates
have declined substantially and debt maturities have lengthened, helping the government’s
debt rollover. The program’s focus on generating large primary surpluses and on reducing
inflation have been integral to this improvement. But outside factors—the availability of
substantial financial assistance: first from the Fund, later (potentially) from the United States,
and the extended period of low world interest rates—have also been important.
8.
Recovery has been rapid and powerful (Table 1). After contracting by nearly
10 percent in 2001, GDP grew by close to 8 percent in 2002 and 6 percent in 2003, well
above program projections (Figures 2 and 3). Once political stability emerged and the

authorities demonstrated their commitment to
keep fiscal policy on track, real interest rates
declined sharply in 2003, below program
projections, setting the stage for a rapid
increase in consumer credit. With consumer
and investor confidence picking up too, the
recovery has become increasingly led by
domestic demand. The strength of the
exchange rate has fuelled private consumption
and consumer goods imports, and this year’s
pension and minimum wage increases have
added to this. Despite banks’ reluctance to
lend to indebted corporates, improved
profitability and higher capacity utilization
have stimulated private investment.

Inflation too has outperformed expectations. The contribution of primary surpluses
towards achieving debt sustainability, the CBT’s adherence to the base money program
in 2002 and 2003, and the resulting improvement in financial market confidence and
stabilization of the exchange rate, have led to a dramatic decline in inflation to levels not
seen since the 1970s. Were it not for the recent exchange rate depreciation and the likely
pass-through from higher world oil prices, inflation would have been on track to fall to single
digits by end-year, below the CBT’s 12 percent target.

The strength of the recovery and the
appreciation of the real exchange rate has
pushed the current account deficit above
the original program path (Table 2).
Instead of stabilizing at around 1 percent of
GNP, by 2003 the current account deficit had
widened to close to 3 percent of GNP. Higher
capital inflows—mainly the drawdown of
residents’ foreign currency holdings—have
more than compensated, allowing the CBT to
accumulate reserves well above the
projections made in 2002, but financing has
been skewed toward short-term portfolio
inflows. The CBT has responded to these
developments by intervening to build up
reserves.

Although extreme poverty remains low, income inequality and unemployment
are serious problems. In 2001, at the peak of the crisis, less than 2 percent of the population
had per capita consumption under US$1 per day, little changed since 1994. However,

- 11 -

inequality remains high, mainly reflecting extreme differences between regions, with the
Southeast in particular much poorer than the rest of the country. The strong economic
recovery has done little to reverse the increase in unemployment during the crisis (Chapter X
of the Selected Issues paper). The official unemployment rate has risen from 6½ percent in
2000 to 10½ percent in 2003, and is especially high for educated youth, at almost 30 percent.
Although the overall rate seems to be leveling off, this reflects declines in labor force
participation—employment has actually fallen. With population growth in the 20–54 age
group of around 2 percent per annum, generating a sustained recovery that lowers the
unemployment rate will be a major challenge.
D. Remaining Vulnerabilities
12.
Turkey’s economy is still vulnerable, and at the heart of this problem lies the
magnitude of public debt, its short maturity, and currency composition (Table 3).
Although the corporate sector has used the recovery to improve its financial health, its high
leverage and unfavorable debt structure still leaves it vulnerable (Box 1). Banking sector
balance sheets have improved, although much of this has come at the government’s expense.
It has socialized many of the private sector’s risks, by taking on higher foreign currency and
floating rate debt (Chapter III of the Selected Issues paper). Although the government has
gradually lengthened maturities of new debt, average maturity remains low, so that rollover
risk and vulnerability to increases in short-term interest rates are still concerns. And despite
the shift to floating exchange rates, foreign currency risk is also a problem. Dollarization is
extensive—around half the government debt and bank deposits are foreign currency
denominated—and short-term external debt by remaining maturity exceeds gross
international reserves.

The fall of the lira and the surge in interest rates created large financial losses in 2001, which the
depreciation-induced export gains could not compensate.2 Corporations’ natural hedge (improved export
competitiveness from a weaker exchange rate) showed some effect in 2001. However, the rise in exports was
much less than would have been needed to offset the parallel collapse in the value of domestic sales. A lack of
financing—as external credit was cut and domestic banks were in distress—is likely to have limited the full
exploitation of export opportunities. Since the weak lira also implied a sharp fall in corporations’ domestic input
costs, however, corporations managed to maintain positive operating profits during the 2001 crisis. Yet, the
massive surge in financing expenses caused by a depreciated lira and rising interest rates turned these operating
profits into net losses.

Relatively high leverage ratios and the unfavorable structure of the debt continue to pose risks. Leverage
ratios of Turkish corporations remain relatively high on average, leaving them with only a limited equity buffer
against balance sheet shocks. Although it is estimated that between 10 to 20 percent of the funds recorded as
debt on corporate balance sheet are funds provided by the owners and shareholders of the relevant company, it
remains questionable to what extent such loans can provide an equity-like function in times of financial stress.
Importantly, the short maturity of the debt financing and its extensive denomination in, or indexation to, foreign
currencies implies that corporations still have considerable exposure to interest rate and foreign currency
liquidity risk. Given that this composition of corporations’ debt is to a large extent simply the reflection of the
banks’ need to create assets that balance their own foreign currency and interest rate exposures, the further
strengthening of the domestic financial system will be key to moving such risks off the corporations’ balance
sheets. This includes also a deepening of local capital markets and better access to equity financing.

13.
Recent financial market turbulence highlights these vulnerabilities. For much of
2003, the exchange rate appreciated and domestic interest rates and spreads on external
borrowing declined sharply. But in May this year, the benchmark bond rate rose sharply,
Eurobond spreads increased considerably, and the exchange rate depreciated by around
15 percent against the dollar. In part these shifts reflected changing expectations over the
future path of US interest rates, and have been shared with other emerging markets. But in
Turkey’s case the reaction has been more severe, reflecting the greater vulnerabilities in its
economy, and also concerns over the widening current account deficit. Any exchange rate
adjustment needed to boost net exports would also tend to exacerbate the debt burden.
III. SHORT-TERM MACROECONOMIC POLICY CHALLENGES
14.
The economy is on track to meet or exceed this year’s targets of 5 percent
growth and 12 percent inflation, but faces problems of excess demand and a growing
current account deficit (Figure 4). In the first few months of the year, growth of consumer
credit, retail sales and imports have all been very strong (Figure 5). Indeed, it appears that
domestic demand and growth have been running above the program targets, widening the
current account deficit. In the staff’s view, current indicators pointed to growth well in excess
of the target, the authorities thought any revision of the growth outlook for 2004 should await
the first quarter outturn. (The first quarter national accounts released since the mission
indicate that year-on-year growth in the first quarter was about 10 percent. An analysis of
these data will be presented in the supplement to the staff report).
15.
Though closely monitoring the risks to the current account, the authorities felt
that subsequent developments had mitigated these somewhat. Recent real exchange rate
depreciation would depress incomes and make imports more expensive. Higher secondary
market interest rates had been passed on by banks to their borrowers, and there were signs
that the growth in consumer credit was slowing. The government had also cautioned state
banks to curtail consumer credit growth, and had reduced tax incentives for new car
purchases. And although it had worsened the current account, the oil price increase would, if
fully passed on, reduce domestic demand by lowering real incomes.
16.
Even so, it was not clear whether these factors would suffice to contain domestic
demand and stabilize the current account. While a slowdown was likely, it would take
time to gauge whether it would be sufficient. Financial market conditions had already started
to improve again, so the effects of the earlier correction might dissipate. The staff therefore
urged the authorities to let the automatic fiscal stabilizers work and to save the recent
demand-driven over performance of tax revenues, at least until the risks to the current
account had clarified. It was also important to accept any exchange rate adjustment, even if
this might have the short-run effect of raising prices. Historically, the current account had
been a bell-weather of the need for policy correction and needed to be watched closely. The
authorities accepted much of this, agreeing to let the stabilizers operate, but wishing to
review the situation later in the year to see if some of the budget over performance could be
spent on social priorities.

IV. SUSTAINING AND ADVANCING RECENT GAINS: MEDIUM-TERM POLICY CHALLENGES
Discussions took place against a backdrop of consensus on the key medium-term challenge:
generating sustained and rapid growth with low inflation. Rapid growth would provide the
most promising avenue for achieving lasting remedies to Turkey’s social challenges,
especially unemployment. The government had been extremely successful in achieving
macroeconomic stabilization, with fiscal consolidation supporting low inflation and growth,
and this augured well for the future. The record was more mixed as regards the composition
of the adjustment and the pace of structural reforms. While rooted in social concerns,
spending initiatives inconsistent with the aims of the program and delays in the
implementation of reforms raised questions about the sustainability of fiscal consolidation
and growth. Looking ahead, the government needed to build on its record of fiscal
consolidation by demonstrating greater ownership of structural reforms. The political
conditions for doing this had rarely been better. Unlike the coalition governments of the past,
the single party government had the opportunity to introduce fundamental reforms (such as
in social security or public expenditure) where short-term (political) costs may be high, but
where long-term benefits to the country would be substantial.
A. Reassessing the Medium-Term Macroeconomic Framework
17.
Historically, Turkey has gained much from economic liberalization but paid
dearly for policy indiscipline. Since 1980, greater openness to trade and financial market
liberalization have helped boost economic growth. However, this growth has been extremely
uneven, and prone to interruption by economic and political crisis. The problem is that
liberalization has gone hand in hand with increased fiscal, monetary and financial
indiscipline that has effectively negated its beneficial effects. This has depressed economic
growth and made it more volatile.
18.
With continued liberalization and a refocusing on microeconomic reforms,
Turkey has the potential for sustained rapid growth. Although the current program’s
5 percent medium-term growth path has seemed ambitious, it is not that far above the
4 percent historical average. Indeed, in the medium term Turkey has the potential for even
higher growth. If the emergence of greater political stability can be used to contain demands
for greater spending and translated instead into less discretionary fiscal policy, and if the
recent reduction in inflation can be sustained, growth should pick up considerably (Box 2).
The analysis in Chapter I of the Selected Issues paper indicates that growth could then be as
much as 2 percentage points above its historical average of 4 percent. This stable
environment would also be conducive to TFP-led growth, contrasting with the investment-led
growth of the past, which has often run into current account constraints.
19.
Despite this potential upside, the baseline scenario assumes a more conservative
growth path (Table 4). For the medium term, growth is still assumed to be 5 percent, with
inflation staying in single digits. Domestic demand is assumed to slow, lowering the current
account deficit to more sustainable levels. Despite the reform program and passage in 2003
of the Foreign Direct Investment Law, FDI has averaged less than US$1 billion (½ percent of

Box 2. Turkey’s Growth Record and its Determinants, 1960–20001/
Turkey’s relative economic growth performance has improved since the 1980s. Although during the last
four decades real per-capita GDP expanded on average only slightly faster than in the rest of the world, this
masks pronounced differences in growth performance during the two subperiods 1960–80 and 1981–2000. In
the first two decades Turkey trailed the rest of the world but then surged ahead in the last two decades, when
growth decelerated around the globe but not in Turkey. During 1981–2000, Turkey posted per-capita growth
rates about one percentage point higher than in the rest of the world. And while Turkey did not escape the
worldwide productivity slowdown, it was much less drastic than in the rest of the world. Notably, it managed to
step up rates of capital accumulation when investment faltered elsewhere.

Turkey’s changing growth record reflects the influence of conflicting forces. Econometric analysis of a
cross-country dataset covering 92 economies helps identify the factors chiefly responsible for the difference in
growth experience in 1981–2000 and 1960–80. The main determinants turn out to be (i) trade openness,
(ii) fiscal volatility, (iii) inflation, and (iv) financial development. This specification is robust to the inclusion of
other potential explanatory variables, such as external volatility, government size, or measures of political
constraints.
Increased trade openness was the main engine of the post-1980 growth performance. Between the two
subperiods trade as a share of GDP rose from 13 to 38 percent—a much larger change than elsewhere.
According to the regression results, this added some 2.3 percentage points to growth during 1981–2000, mainly
through stimulating investment. Indeed, had trade and financial liberalization been the only policy changes,
Turkey would have posted growth rates similar to those in east-Asia.
Growing fiscal volatility and inflation, however, acted increasingly as a drag on growth. After 1980 fiscal
policy became more discretionary, as measured by unexpected, cyclically-adjusted deviations from the past
fiscal policy stance. Even though this development was not associated with larger government, it still knocked
0.5 percentage points off Turkey’s annual growth rate, mainly by discouraging investment. Rising inflation
reduced growth by another 0.7 points, mainly by lowering productivity.
Turkey’s recent advances in combating inflation augur well for the growth outlook especially if fiscal
discretion can also be scaled back. With inflation rates firmly heading toward single digits one key ingredient
for better future growth is already falling into place. While there is some evidence that fiscal discretion might be
positively correlated with deregulation, and indeed trade liberalization, a strengthening of institutions, more
reliance on rules, and adherence to pre-set targets appear to offer the best way forward.

GNP) each year, very low compared with new
member states and countries acceding to the EU.
Without such long-term flows, a current account
deficit above 3½-4 percent of GNP in Turkey is
unlikely to be sustainable, and would likely result
in an exchange rate correction (Box 3). However,
the staff stressed that achieving the desired current
account adjustment and sustained low inflation
would depend on tight fiscal policy and wage
restraint, and success in containing the growth in
domestic demand. If the authorities were unable to
implement policies that delivered such a slowdown,
a more abrupt exchange rate adjustment might
result instead, with adverse implications for
inflation and debt.

There was strong agreement that the strategy of targeting a high primary
surplus had been critical in reducing debt and stabilizing the economy. This had helped
improve policy credibility, supported the CBT’s disinflation efforts, and delivered lower
interest rates. By alleviating worries over debt sustainability, fiscal discipline had also helped
re-establish consumer and investor confidence.

Box 3: Competitiveness and the Current Account Balance
Turkish exports have performed well since the 2000 crisis, underpinned by a more competitive exchange rate, market
diversification, productivity gains, and a reduction in real wages. However, the exchange rate appreciated as the economy
recovered, imports accelerated and the current account deficit widened from a position of surplus to a projected deficit of
nearly 4 percent GNP in 2004. This has ignited concerns that Turkey’s recovery is generating excessive external financing
needs. In particular, the focus is on short-term debt financing and portfolio flows that may be curtailed by tighter
international liquidity conditions, as well as longer-term considerations of debt sustainability.

Short-term external financing has increased significantly, though not to levels seen before earlier crises. Short-term
external debt rose 40 percent in 2003, though remains some 20 percent below its peak of $28 billion in 2000. While this
undoubtedly poses a higher risk of a credit reversal and currency mismatch, the stock of trade credit is below 20 percent of
annual import value, compared to more than 40 percent before the 1994 and 2000 crises. Similarly, banks’ foreign exchange
credits are well below historical peaks and, more importantly, their on balance sheet open foreign currency positions have
been maintained in the range of zero to US$2 billion and within prudential limits. Nonetheless, short-term external debt
remains high by international standards in relation to gross official reserves, underlining the importance of continued reserve
accumulation in coming years.
Over the longer term, the path of the current account deficit will need to be consistent with a level that will stabilize a
prudent level of external debt to output. Starting from a debt stock of 60 percent of GNP, and 5 percent GNP growth,
Turkey’s debt ratio will continue to fall gradually as long as the current account deficit stays below 4 percent of GNP. But to
stabilize at more prudent debt/GNP levels of 40 percent or lower, the current account will need to fall below 3 percent of
GNP. An increase in non-debt creating inflows would allow higher deficits. Rapid productivity growth consistent with EU
convergence will also help lower the ratio of debt/GNP through the channel of real exchange rate appreciation.
What exchange rate adjustment would be needed to move Turkey to the long-run debt stabilizing current account
deficit? Using estimates of trade responsiveness to exchange rate changes, we can calculate the “equilibrium” exchange rate
that will deliver a debt stabilizing current account deficit when the Turkish economy and trade partners operate at full output
potential. While this assessment is sensitive to the target current account balance, estimates of potential output gaps and
assumed trade price and output elasticity’s it provides some indication of exchange rate divergence relative to the desired
long-run equilibrium. Staff estimates show that the equilibrium real

While fiscal consolidation had been impressive, the quality of adjustment raised
concerns. Staff analysis presented to the authorities showed that the fiscal effort since 2001
had been high and more enduring than previous episodes of adjustment in Turkey (Chapters
VI and VII of the Selected Issues paper). However, the quality of the fiscal adjustment under
the program had been mixed. Adjustment at the state enterprise level had been supported by
increasing prices, lowering costs, and explicit targets for reducing employment. However,
current spending at the central government level had risen, financed by tax increases and cuts
in capital expenditure. This raised questions about the sustainability of the fiscal adjustment,
especially as the international experience suggested that adjustments based on lasting
reductions in expenditure were more likely to be sustainable (Chapter VII of the Selected
Issues paper).
22.
Short-term policy choices had at times also aggravated the quality of the
adjustment. Unplanned spending initiatives outside the budget cycle, such as the pensions
and minimum wage increases earlier this year, had undermined the budget process and
required compensatory or corrective measures. And while corrective steps helped put the
primary surplus targets back on track, they had often come at the expense of the quality of
the fiscal adjustment. Investment, for example, had borne the brunt of budget cuts. Frequent
ad hoc policy changes (proposals for selective tax reductions, incentives and tax amnesties)
had also undermined the credibility of the budget process.
23.
The authorities thought that the achievement in 2003 of the highest primary
surplus on record had substantially enhanced policy credibility. They stressed that the
markets no longer doubted the government’s determination to deliver on fiscal consolidation.
Strong fiscal policy had also gained increasing acceptability in the population at large as it
was credited with helping to restore growth and reduce inflation. However, the authorities
emphasized that sustaining the fiscal adjustment necessitated paying sufficient attention to
social concerns. The increases in pensions and the minimum wage had been necessary to
restore them to their pre-crisis levels and maintain social consensus for reform. However,
they agreed that such decisions should and would be considered and acted upon within the
budgetary framework.
24.
There has also been progress on structural fiscal reforms. A major improvement
in fiscal management had been the approval after much delay of the Public Financial
Management and Control Law which established a clear delineation of responsibilities in the
preparation and formulation of the budget, introduced a medium-term budget framework, and
established new systems for control and auditing of government operations. Tax
administration reform had recently gained momentum; this should help with efficiency of
collection and begin to tackle the unregistered economy. Indirect taxes had also been
reformed: simplifying and reducing the number of taxes, and consolidating excises and VAT.
However, the reform of direct taxes had fallen short of the original objectives.

- 22 -

Structural challenges to sustained fiscal consolidation in the medium term
25.
Looking ahead, the authorities saw an overhaul of the taxation system to reduce
distortions and fight tax evasion as a top priority. Although Turkey’s tax rates did not
stand out as too high compared with the EU and the OECD, they were very high compared to
other emerging markets. The personal income tax system was too complicated, with multiple
rates and deductions. High social security taxes imposed a large cost on employment. The
headline corporate income tax rate in Turkey was high, particularly compared to EU
accession countries, and yet the effective yield was much lower because of generous
investment tax credits and exemptions. The authorities were also concerned that VAT
avoidance was high. Staff estimates indicated that the VAT yield was not out of line with
international experience but collections accounted for about 70 percent of the calculated
potential VAT.

26.
However, the authorities acknowledged that any tax reform needed to take
account of an expected structural decline in revenues. As interest rates come down, the
yield of intermediation taxes and the withholding tax on interest income (more than 1 percent
of GNP) will fall. Indeed, because of their distortionary nature, the government has rightly
declared its intention to phase them out. Also dividends, turnover taxes, and profits from
SEEs, which currently contribute some 1 percent of GNP to the primary surplus, will
diminish as these firms are privatized. Of course, in the long run this should be at least in part
offset by higher private sector tax receipts, but in the interim it would lower revenues.
Finally, the government’s plans for greater fiscal decentralization posed a significant

- 23 -

challenge to maintaining fiscal discipline. If not handled carefully, this could seriously
worsen public finances in the medium term.
27.
Public expenditure reform is also needed. Non-discretionary spending accounts for
some three-quarters of central government budget spending, with social security transfers and
wages making up two-thirds of primary spending. Despite an attempt at reform in 1999,
central government social security transfers had continued to grow and were now close to
5 percent of GNP, in part because the principles of the 1999 reform, such as no ad hoc
increases in benefits, had not been observed. Arguably, the program could have focused on
social security reform earlier and more forcefully, but the authorities saw this as a sensitive
area of reform which needed strong political will and consensus, which was only now being
formed. The authorities also agreed that wage outlays were high by international comparison;
however, they thought this could only be addressed gradually. In contrast, they thought that
the real decline in public investment over the last three years needed to be reversed in the
medium term.

Avenues to sustained debt reduction
28.
There was agreement on the need to elaborate a medium-term debt reduction
strategy and an agenda of reforms intended to make consolidation sustainable. Structural
reforms were needed to improve the underlying expenditure composition of the budget,
improve tax collection, bring the unregistered economy within the tax base and eventually
reduce the tax burden. These were essential to ensure that the adjustment of the last few years
could be maintained in the medium-term. A medium-term debt reduction objective and strategy
was needed to guide fiscal policy.
29.
On the structural front, a large agenda needed to be tackled. Health and pension
reform were clearly urgently needed given the widening social security deficit. There was also
agreement on the importance of pressing ahead with tax administration reform to improve
compliance and the efficiency of tax collection, with staff urging civil service reforms as an

- 24 -

avenue to lower the tax burden. To reduce tax distortions, and pre-empt pressures to create new
ones, the staff and the authorities agreed that work should begin on a major reform of tax
policy, but careful attention had to be paid to maintaining the revenue base of the budget
(technical assistance in this area has already been initiated). There was agreement that this
agenda needed to be prioritized. The staff saw social security and tax administration reforms as
priorities. Expenditure reform also needed to begin in the context of the 2005 budget, and the
legal framework for decentralization carefully developed at an early stage. While broadly
agreeing with this prioritization, the authorities also thought that tax policy reform needed to be
tackled upfront but perhaps in a staged manner.

With public indebtedness at the core of Turkey’s vulnerability, debt reduction was
seen as the necessary focal point of medium term fiscal strategy, but it needed to be
articulated with care. Given the sensitivity of debt
and fiscal variables to financial market conditions,

legislative adoption of conventional rules such as a
(in percent of GDP)
balanced budget rule, a borrowing rule, or a debt

rule did not seem feasible at this stage. Instead, to
guide fiscal policy over the next few years and

ensure debt sustainability, the staff and the
authorities saw merit in adopting a multi-year debt
40

reduction plan to build government consensus,
manage expectations, and guide policy. One option
20

discussed was targeting a specific reduction in the
debt (say 12–15 percentage points in the debt to

GNP ratio over a four-year period) with an explicit
commitment to adjust policies every year to achieve
the targeted debt reduction. With a view to

financing shocks, the medium-term aim should be to lower gross debt substantially, for
example, to the average level of the recent EU accession countries (40 percent of GNP). If debt
diverged from the target path, the primary surplus would be adjusted to achieve the targeted
reduction in debt.
31.
Staff noted that, for an unchanged pace of debt reduction, there did not seem to
be room within such a framework for easing the primary surplus target. Recent market
tensions and uncertainties over the current account deficit suggested that real interest rates and
the exchange rate are subject to a great deal of uncertainty. Therefore, any debt reduction
strategy, the staff thought, needed to build in substantial safety margins on the one instrument
that the government does control: the primary surplus. Indeed, recent hints by some
government members that the 6½ percent of GNP primary surplus target may be relaxed next
year had already troubled the markets. A lower primary surplus should only be considered once
greater credibility of fiscal policy has been established and real interest rates have been
lowered on a sustained basis.

- 25 -

32.
While not ruling out the 6½ percent target beyond 2004, the authorities thought
there may be a trade-off between the quality and the size of fiscal adjustment. To meet the
primary surplus target, government investment had declined in real terms and needed to be
restored to ensure adequate infrastructure spending, particularly in health and education.
Undertaking a major tax reform and ensuring continued decline in financial intermediation
taxes would also be difficult, unless some decline in revenues was accommodated. After
several years of fiscal consolidation there was also strong pressure from spending ministries for
higher resources in priority areas.
33.
The staff argued that a looser fiscal stance would slow debt reduction and could
have a severe cost in the form of higher real interest rates. Indeed, surprising the markets
by maintaining a stronger than expected fiscal stance was likely to be the most effective way of
lowering real interest rates. Provided that the authorities were prepared to initiate expenditure
policy reforms (FAD has provided TA to facilitate this), the staff presented a three year fiscal
adjustment scenario that indicated it was possible to cope with the expected revenue decline,
reverse the real fall in investment, and make room for a major tax policy reform within the
constraints of the existing primary surplus targets (Table 5).

Reducing inflation has been central to the economic program. This was one of the
key objectives of the original 1999 program. Lower inflation has become a gauge of the
success of monetary policy and also the fiscal and structural reforms that support it. After the
abandonment of the crawling peg, under

for reducing inflation has been base

money. In both 2002 and 2003 the CBT

met every one of its base money targets
(Tables 6 and 7). As inflation has fallen

credibility. Success in disinflation has also
reduced exchange rate pass-through, and
increased the significance of forwardlooking rather than backward-looking

inflation in price-setting behavior (Chapter inflation target.
II of the Selected Issues paper).
35.
Despite this success, monetary policy faces a number of challenges, both shortand medium-run. In the short run, recent exchange rate depreciation is likely to add to

- 26 -

inflation. So far, the pass through into prices from this adjustment has been modest and, with
seasonally adjusted inflation having fallen to single digits over the last six months, the
12 percent inflation target should still be met. Higher oil prices could also threaten the target,
though cuts in excises have so far limited the impact on domestic prices. However, the staff
warned against using administered prices to meet the inflation target, especially given
Turkey’s fiscal constraints and the need for relative prices to change as part of the adjustment
mechanism. Instead, some one-off impact on the price level might need to be accepted, but
any second-round effects onto higher wages and prices would need to be resisted.
36.
The main challenge for the medium term is to put in place a more transparent
monetary framework. With monetary targets starting to be missed, the program’s formal
nominal anchor—base money—is showing signs of strain. The overshoots are in part benign,
as they mirror the program’s success in reducing inflation and restoring confidence in the
currency. But more recently they also seem to reflect rapid growth in credit and domestic
demand. The CBT agreed that base money targeting was becoming problematic, but argued
that this was of little consequence since in practice it had adopted an implicit inflation
targeting framework instead. The CBT nonetheless still considered the adoption of formal
inflation targeting as inadvisable because of continuing concerns over fiscal dominance,
weaknesses in the financial system, uncertainties over the transmission mechanism,
upcoming changes in the CPI basket, and uncertainties associated with EU accession.
37.
The staff suggested that a strengthening of the monetary framework would help
guard against the risks that concerned the CBT. For example, a strong monetary
framework was needed regardless of EU accession process, even more so if this stalled.
Fiscal dominance was a concern, but the track record of primary surpluses and debt reduction
had arguably made this less so. The CBT’s credibility would only be boosted by being tested,
not by waiting for the perfect moment to launch inflation targeting. The staff therefore
encouraged the CBT to adopt more of the features of its ultimate objective—formal inflation
targeting—through steps to enhance the transparency of monetary policy. These could
include a greater role for the monetary policy council, and more predictable timing of interest
rate decisions.
38.
Foreign exchange intervention policy could be strengthened, with the goal being
the steady accumulation of reserves. Frequent changes to the foreign exchange purchase
auctions had confused the markets and undermined the CBT’s intervention framework. With
reserve accumulation essential both to reduce vulnerability and to prepare for external debt
repayments, the staff argued for a steadier and less reactive approach. However, the staff
conceded that the occasional discretionary foreign exchange purchases of the last year had
been extremely helpful in building reserves. The CBT explained that it had carefully gauged
market developments prior to any change in its foreign exchange purchase auctions;
however, market movements had recently became too volatile. They agreed, however, with
the need for a more steady intervention approach in the future.

D. Foundations of an Effective Banking Sector
The strategy to deal with a severe banking crisis: how has it fared?
39.
The key objective of banking reforms has been to address the long-standing
weaknesses that were brought into the open by the financial crisis of 2000–01 (Table 8).
Years of poor governance and excessive risk taking by banks, abuse by their owners, a weak
regulatory and supervisory framework, lack of market discipline, and extreme
macroeconomic volatility had left the banking system vulnerable. The financial crisis of
late 2000 and early 2001, and the economic slowdown that followed, magnified these
weaknesses. Banking sector profits and capital adequacy ratios fell sharply even before the
full effect of credit losses was recognized. State banks, which had financed large “duty
losses” (associated with politically directed lending) through short-term borrowing,
experienced massive losses when short-term rates soared. Many private banks also had
unviable balance sheets and a negative net worth.
40.
To address these weaknesses, a comprehensive reform program was introduced.
The staff reviewed with the authorities the reform strategy that essentially had two key
components:
•
Enhancing the operating environment. To contain the immediate crisis and protect
against panic driven deposit withdrawals, the authorities introduced a blanket guarantee of all
bank depositors and creditors (blanket guarantee has been removed and replaced by a limited
deposit guarantee scheme as of July 5, 2004). The independent Banking Regulation and
Supervision Agency (BRSA), established too late to prevent the crisis, would bring the
supervisory and regulatory framework closer in line with international standards. Prior to
this, banking supervision had been fragmented between the Treasury and the Central Bank,
and dominated by a semi-autonomous group of on-site bank examiners.
•
Strengthening the balance sheet of banks. State banks were recapitalized at a cost
of close to US$30 billion, and a far reaching operational restructuring program was initiated.
Their “duty losses” and overnight borrowing positions were eliminated; new management
was installed; the housing bank Emlak was shut; 800 branches of Ziraat and Halk were
closed and some 30,000 employees laid off; and a time table was developed for privatizing
the state banks. Further, the core private banking system was strengthened: unviable banks
were intervened; banks’ foreign exchange risk was reduced by the CBT’s sales of foreign
exchange and by swapping Turkish lira for foreign currency denominated government paper;
and the BRSA’s three stage audits forced banks to disclose NPLs and for their capital needs
to be assessed uniformly. Recapitalization took place mainly by injecting private funds.
Finally, to facilitate corporate debt restructuring, the bankruptcy law was overhauled and a
voluntary framework for debt restructuring—the Istanbul Approach—was introduced.

41.
The current and previous authorities, and the banking industry acknowledged
that the above strategy was successful in substantially strengthening the system.
Banking practices and the regulatory environment had gone through a sea change over the
last few years. The banking system was properly capitalized, bank profitability had been
restored and NPLs were falling. There had also been a consolidation in the banking system
with the number of banks reduced from 80 to 49. Despite intervention in some 22 private
banks, other private banks had increased their market share such that the role of state and
SDIF banks in the banking system had gradually declined since 2000.

42.
However, there was also broad agreement that while the initial pace of reform
was dramatic, sustaining it and preserving its achievements had been challenging.
Although the regulatory framework had improved markedly, program conditionality had
failed to recognize sufficiently early on deficiencies in the Banking Act and weaknesses in
the judicial system. Former bank owners had been able to challenge BRSA decisions, long
after their banks have been intervened and resolved, even in cases where the banks appear to
have been clearly insolvent. Staff and board members of the SDIF and BRSA had

- 29 -

insufficient protection against law suits for actions performed while carrying out their duty.
As a result, supervisors were unwilling or reluctant to make decisions, and asset disposition
had been slow (since staff are potentially liable if assets are sold at too low a price).
Resolution of bad assets, had been very disappointing and slow and, the staff thought, not
sufficiently transparent. Failure to split the Boards of the BRSA and SDIF upfront, and lack
of experienced staff with banking experience were also seen by the banking community as
contributing to the above problems.
43.
Many in the banking industry also pointed to a number of remaining future
challenges. Financial intermediation in Turkey was very low compared to other countries.
This was in part because of distortionary intermediation taxes, which the government was
committed to reducing but only gradually given its fiscal impact. Macroeconomic volatility
and Turkey’s high debt also crowded out private lending in favor of government bonds. State
bank assets consisted almost entirely of government securities, while the private banks also
invested heavily in government paper. It was widely believed that Turkey was still overbanked and that further consolidation was inevitable, indeed desirable (see Chapter VIII of
the Selected Issues paper). Increased foreign bank participation, which had already risen in
the last three years, might facilitate this process. Further restructuring and eventual
privatization of the state banks was another focus of discussions, with many arguing that the
initial momentum of reform had been lost.

The authorities agreed that the unfinished agenda of financial sector reform
needed to be tackled forcefully over the next few years. Although the 2000–01 financial
crisis now seemed to have been successfully resolved, this came at the cost of a huge
increase in the government debt, which had put a severe constraint on the conduct of
economic policy and continues to raise concerns regarding debt sustainability. It thus needed
to move more forcefully with a medium-term banking reform agenda. The staff and the
authorities identified four key areas where further reform or an acceleration of reform was

- 30 -

needed: state bank restructuring and privatization, the supervisory regime, asset resolution,
and reducing financial disintermediation.
45.
The mission stressed the importance of an ambitious but realistic strategy for
moving the state banks to the private sector. The staff indicated that the excess
capitalization of state banks, together with their subsidized funding base and their lack of a
clear profit motive distorted the competitive environment with private banks. The authorities
explained that while the state banks have been restructured and were now profitable, a
realistic assessment of whether and how they can be privatized is only now being made in the
context of the World Bank’s PFPSAL III loan and with the assistance of international
consulting firms. They remained committed to privatization of Halk and thought that its
integration with Pamuk, with its private sector culture, should facilitate this process.
However, they thought that Ziraat’s privatization was a more long-term objective given its
size, its reliance on government securities, and the social role it played by having branches in
rural areas. The staff emphasized that an arms length relationship between these banks and
the government was the best way of ensuring their effective restructuring in the long run.
46.
While the supervisory environment had improved, the staff noted many
shortcomings that needed to be addressed in the coming years. The ambiguous
relationship between the BRSA and the Sworn Bank auditors (which have the sole right to
conduct on-site supervision) was also a problem, preventing off-site supervisors or outside
technical expertise being brought in to examine banks. This artificial split in responsibilities
was one of the factors that in the staff’s view had contributed to the failure to detect the Imar
bank scandal. The existing split in the supervision of banks (BRSA) and nonbank financial
institutions (Treasury) remained a source of vulnerability, especially given the extensive
interlinkages between corporates and financial intermediaries in Turkey. Supervision also
needed to better enforce existing prudential requirements to ensure that banks have the
appropriate risk management systems and capital cushions to withstand recent sharp
movements in interest rates and exchange rates.
47.
The authorities were confident that many of these supervisory shortcomings
would be addressed in the new banking law currently under preparation (Chapter IX
of the Selected Issues). They also saw the new law as an opportunity to clarify the
responsibilities of the BRSA and the SDIF and provide adequate legal protection for their
staffs in order to accelerate asset recovery. In this regard, the staff also noted that setting
realistic price expectations and explaining these to the public, and transparent negotiations
with former bank owners, were equally important. The authorities also noted that judging by
recent court decisions, new legislation by itself might not be sufficient to ensure a predictable
environment for banking. The new Banking Act will try to address some of the legal
shortcomings that had led to recent court decisions against the BRSA but, ultimately, more
far-reaching judicial reform may also be needed. However, this was an extremely sensitive
and divisive issue that might best be undertaken with reforms needed to facilitate EU
accession.

- 31 -

48.
There was broad agreement that distortions in the taxation of the financial
system needed to be reduced further. Intermediation taxes fundamentally undermined
banking sector profitability, and encouraged banks to concentrate assets in government paper
instead of extending loans. The taxes may also have reinforced dollarization and encouraged
transactions to move off-shore where they can also escape regulation. The authorities
emphasized that although the cost of these distortions was now more clearly recognized,
fiscal constraints slowed their removal; nonetheless they remained committed to a phased
reduction. There was also agreement that money and foreign exchange markets needed to be
developed further in Turkey to facilitate improved risk management by banks. These markets
were extremely thin in Turkey, with the CBT the primary counterpart to most transactions.
E. Sustaining Economic Growth by Strengthening the Investment Climate
49.
The authorities have made some progress in improving Turkey’s investment
climate. Achieving macroeconomic and political stability has been foremost among these.
Together with structural reforms, the creation of independent regulatory institutions and
increased transparency had also helped. In

50.
Despite this, further reforms were needed to improve the business environment.
Foreign direct investment is low, consistent with Turkey’s poor ranking in several widelyused measures of international competitiveness. To address these concerns, the Investor
Advisory Council advocated several reforms to improve the investment climate, including
accelerated privatization, a clearer judicial framework, less red tape, more efficient customs,
and bringing standards and regulations in line with the EU. The staff noted that a key test will
be to ensure these recommendations are prioritized and acted upon. It would also be
important to stick to rule-based decision making and to deal with these defects directly,
rather than trying to compensate for them through distortionary and costly tax incentives.
51.
Progress in privatization has been disappointing. From the outset, the program has
stressed the importance of privatization as a test of the authorities’ commitment to changing
the way of doing business in Turkey. The focus of the program has been on bringing state
enterprises to the point of sale (by improving management and developing privatization
plans, often in conjunction with the World Bank) and on agreeing on realistic overall targets
for privatization receipts, rather than requiring specific enterprises to be sold by a specific
date. While the coalition government arguably failed this test, the new government’s greater
enthusiasm for privatization has not shown much success. All of the large-scale
privatizations of the last year—PETKIM (sale to the Uzan group fell through), TEKEL
tobacco unit (price rejected as too low), and TÜPRAŞ (overturned by the local
Administrative Court)—have failed.
52.
Greater emphasis needs to be placed on judicial reform. In particular, problems
have arisen with the scope of judicial review of actions of the BRSA and SDIF concerning
the banking sector and, more broadly, in the area of bankruptcy and commercial proceedings.
On several occasions, administrative courts have overturned BRSA decisions with respect to
insolvent banks relying on broad judicial review powers. These court actions make it difficult
for BRSA to fulfill its supervisory mandate. The lack of judicial predictability is now
extended to the government’s ability to sell assets, bringing its privatization program into
question. While the authorities have taken steps to address some of these problems in the
recently adopted Bankruptcy Law and in the new draft Law on Credit Institutions, the
authorities recognize the need for more fundamental judicial reform to support the
functioning of Turkey’s market economy, and they are of the view that such reform would
best be undertaken as part of EU accession.
53.
Turkey will need to continue with tariff liberalization, particularly in the area of
agriculture where barriers remain high. Key challenges will be to resist pressures to raise
tariffs closer to their binding limits, but also to avoid overuse of trade remedies such as antidumping, where the number of cases has risen rapidly (Box 4). Addressing these challenges
will help maintain trade flows and improve the investment climate. The scheduled removal of
quotas on clothing and textiles imports in 2005 (in Turkey as well as the U.S. and EU) will
represent a significant liberalization of Turkey’s import regime, and will be a challenge for
low value added clothing exports to the EU and U.S. markets (Box 5).

- 33 -

54.
The authorities are also taking steps to improve the quality and transparency of
their operations. A new fiscal ROSC is likely to take place in 2005, once the Public
Financial Management and Control Law is in effect. The authorities are also likely to request
an FSAP in 2005, to take stock of the banking reforms made under the current program.
Procedures against anti-money laundering had been reviewed twice (1994 and 1998) by
FATF without any criticism and a third review is expected in 2006. A new law is expected to
be passed before the end of the year to bring procedures in full compliance with new FATF
regulations introduced last year. Macroeconomic statistics have some shortcomings, notably
as regards coverage of the public sector, but are usually published in a timely fashion. Turkey
subscribes to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS).

The use of anti-dumping measures is on the rise, with 51 measures
in force in mid-2004, one third against China. Turkey is ranked
seventh in the WTO in terms of anti-dumping cases initiated in 2003.
The authorities explained that these measures represent cases of
material injury to domestic industry, and goods affected include
yarns and fibers and manufactures (lighters, tires and tubes, etc.).
The expanded use of anti-dumping may also be indicative of
competitive pressures from exchange rate appreciation since 2002.
Safeguard legislation was amended in May 2004 to bring it fully in
line with the WTO agreement on safeguards. Turkey also faces 19
measures against exports, mostly for iron and steel products. These
measures were later removed.

Box 5. Textiles and Clothing—Implications of Quota Removal
The elimination of remaining U.S. and EU textiles and clothing
quotas in January 2005 envisaged under the Agreement on
Textiles and Clothing poses a significant challenge to Turkish
exporters. 2003 Turkish textiles and clothing exports to EU and U.S.
markets total US$11.4 billion (4.7 percent GNP) in 2003. Significant
price or volume reductions would have macroeconomic effects as
well as dis-proportionately affecting employment owing to the laborintensive nature of clothing production. In the U.S. market, Turkey
will gain on product lines where its exports are presently quota
constrained. But in the EU, Turkey already benefits from quota
protection and will inevitably face price declines and volume
reductions in mass market segments.

may well again hold its ground against low cost

The challenge will be greater in the EU where Turkish exports are protected by quotas. Exporters will face price
declines where they compete with hitherto quota constrained competitors, e.g. China, India, and Pakistan. Just over half
Turkish exports of textiles and clothing are in quota constrained categories. Average price declines may amount to
5 percent, as experienced in the US in 2002. While price declines are likely to be much higher in the basic mass market
segment, the effect is moderated by higher value lines less affected by quota removal (some 30 percent of Turkish
clothing exports are in mass market segments). The extent of volume reductions will depend in large part on the
cushion existing profit margins provide. As margins have been squeezed with TL appreciation, volume declines could
amount to between 10 and 20 percent, or most of the mass market sector. Assuming textiles and clothing exports are
similarly affected, the potential Turkish export loss with average prices down 5 percent and 10 percent volume declines
amounts to US$810 million, and with a 20 percent volume decline some US$1,340 million. The higher end of these
estimates corresponds to estimates of export losses of US$1,316 million calculated by the American Textiles
Manufacturers Association. While this will be a significant setback in 2005 and may cut GNP growth by 0.3–
0.4 percent, the Turkish authorities believe that quota removal will accelerate the shift of production towards higher
quality fashion items, higher margin own brand items, and that Turkey will retain the geographical advantage necessary
for fast moving clothing items.
Turkey will also remove its own quotas on textile and clothing imports, which will lower prices in the domestic
market. Quota constrained imports apply to 19 countries and amount to 13 percent of total textile and clothing imports.
The authorities believe that quota removal will not have a destructive impact on the domestic market, while producer
losses will likely be offset by consumer gains from lower prices.

V. FINANCING OUTLOOK: EXTERNAL AND GOVERNMENT DEBT
55.
The authorities were examining the financing outlook in an environment that was
becoming more challenging. They were well aware that markets were increasingly focusing on
the financing outlook beyond the expiration of the program. Turkey’s medium-term external
financing requirements were challenging because of the high current account deficit and
increasing external debt payments (Tables 9 and
10). A coherent medium-term financing and

macroeconomic framework was desirable not only
20
to respond to this outlook but also to prepare for

uncertainties ahead. Rising world interest rates and

the possible reduction of flows to emerging

markets made the financing picture uncertain,
especially given Turkey’s significant reliance on

short-term external financing. While the authorities
were hopeful of a positive EU accession decision,

and in fact the markets had already priced in a
2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008
favorable outcome, this could not be taken for
granted and added to financing uncertainties.
56.
The authorities financing scenarios
pointed to a tight outlook. These scenarios were
of course highly sensitive to underlying
assumptions such as private market access, FDI,
privatization receipts, real interest rates, the
primary surplus target, and external reserves build
up.
57.
The authorities noted the role of
increased net public sector external
repayments—principally to the Fund—as a
cause of the high rollover rates in 2005–06.
These public sector debt repayments required both
higher domestic rollover rates and a drawdown of
official foreign reserves from present levels. The
authorities argued that relying on external market
borrowing to address these financing constraints
would be difficult given Turkey’s sub-investment
grade rating and tightening liquidity in global
financial markets. They also noted the possibility
of requesting an extension of payments falling due
to the Fund on an expectations basis in 2006; this
would postpone almost US$4 billion beyond the
peak repayment period.

58.
While the staff acknowledged that the financing outlook was challenging, it also
noted that the Fund’s exposure to Turkey was extremely high (accounting for some onequarter of total outstanding credit). There was a need, therefore, to plan on significant net
repayments to the Fund in the coming years now that the financial crisis was behind us.
59.
Against this background, the staff and authorities explored different avenues that
could strengthen the financing situation. The staff emphasized that the amount of market
financing that Turkey could expect would depend on the perceived quality of policies. Strong
policies could act as a catalyst for potential capital inflows and also enable Turkey to tap
international capital markets more aggressively than currently projected. Correspondingly, a
higher primary surplus would reduce the public sector borrowing requirement; and a more
aggressive privatization program might help alleviate financing constraints, though progress here
remained slow. If market conditions improved, the authorities could also over borrow
domestically, reinstate their pre-announced foreign exchange purchase auctions, and move
aggressively to extend maturities. A positive EU decision on accession negotiations could also
boost financing prospects, although this could not be counted on.
60.
Given these complexities, it was agreed that discussions on relations with the Fund
after the current program expires would need to continue. The authorities, however, stressed
that no decision had yet been taken on whether to approach the Fund for a successor program,
but expected a decision to be taken by September, in tandem with work on the 2005 budget.
61.
While Turkey’s debt sustainability outlook has improved in recent years, risks
remain (Appendix II—Debt Sustainability).
•
The standard debt sustainability analysis continues to show that sustainability is
reached in the baseline, and is robust to individual shocks, but that it could be jeopardized by a
combination of large shocks. However, external financing needs are rising on account of the
larger current account deficits and increasing external public repayments.
•
Staff also presented nonstandard debt sustainability analysis to the authorities. Under a
“sudden stop” scenario—which involves both the external and domestic sides—external capital
flows decline, and the exchange rate depreciates to bring about the required adjustment in
domestic savings. Real growth declines sharply, automatic stabilizers are allowed to operate,
while real interest rates are driven higher as Treasury reliance on the domestic market increases.
If the float is allowed to operate freely, and strict macroeconomic policies are preserved, the
reserve position is safeguarded and external debt and reserve indicators improve modestly. The
main impact would be expected to take place on the domestic financing side. Here, the debt
burden increases, and would require strong policies to ensure that the situation remains
manageable.
62.
Against this background, the authorities emphasized that the Treasury continues to
improve the structure of its debt. It has used favorable market conditions to lower the share of
riskier foreign exchange debt from almost two-thirds at end-2003 to less than half, and has also
lowered the proportion of floating rate instruments in its debt (see Chapter V of the Selected

- 38 -

Issues paper). Consistent with its internal risk analysis, Treasury intends to further reduce its
reliance on domestic foreign exchange borrowing and floating rate notes.
63.
Nevertheless, Turkey’s debt situation poses risks. For a start, Turkey’s debt burden
remains high, in a situation where there are concerns that emerging markets may have overborrowed given their vulnerabilities (see Chapter IV of the Selected Issues paper). The debt
structure also remains risky: average maturities are low, and the share of foreign exchange and
floating rate notes remains too high.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
64.
Economic performance since the last Article IV consultation has been impressive.
Growth has been sustained and rapid, while inflation has been lowered dramatically, reaching
single digits. Large primary surpluses have reduced government debt ratios and improved market
confidence. The result has been a significant reduction in real interest rates and an end to decades
of continuous exchange rate depreciation. The economy has also become much more robust to
shocks, with the Iraq conflict and the recent market turbulence having had only a limited adverse
impact on economic performance.
65.
Despite these considerable achievements, Turkey’s economy is still very vulnerable.
At the heart of this vulnerability lies the high public debt. Its short maturity and large foreign
currency component make Turkey vulnerable to interest rate and exchange rate shocks. Recent
market turbulence and concerns regarding a widening current account deficit are a reminder of
these vulnerabilities. Related to this, the quality of the fiscal adjustment and the pace of
structural reforms raises questions about the sustainability of the fiscal consolidation and growth
prospects.
66.
The most pressing concern for the short run is that domestic demand may now be
growing too rapidly. Although this year’s targets of 5 percent growth and 12 percent inflation
should be met or exceeded, the authorities need to ensure that the rising current account deficit
does not jeopardize macroeconomic stability. While these will help, it is not clear that the recent
exchange rate and interest rate adjustment, the slowdown in consumer lending, and the reduction
in tax incentives for new car purchases will slow domestic demand sufficiently.
67.
The authorities need to be ready to take additional policy measures to contain
domestic demand. With the inflation target on track and with fiscal dominance constraints,
tighter monetary policy is unlikely to be appropriate. Instead, the authorities need to rely on
fiscal and exchange rate policy. At a minimum, the authorities need to let the automatic fiscal
stabilizers work and to over perform on the primary surplus targets, at least until the risks to the
current account are clarified. Further tightening of the fiscal stance should not be ruled out if
domestic demand continues to be strong. Incomes policy can also help, and while the authorities’
efforts to restrain government sector wages have been helpful here, repeated increases in the
minimum wage have not. Finally, the authorities need to continue to allow the exchange rate to
adjust to contain the current account imbalance.

- 39 -

68.
To sustain growth over the medium-term, the authorities need to maintain their
record of fiscal consolidation. Fiscal consolidation—the move towards sustained high primary
surpluses and greater prospects of ensuring debt sustainability—has been key to the improved
economic performance of recent years, and will also be key to its continuation. The reduction in
real interest rates that resulted has boosted growth. And the lessening in concerns over fiscal
dominance has given the Central Bank greater freedom to follow a monetary policy that supports
disinflation. The authorities should resist pressures to relax the primary surplus targets as any
benefits are likely to be far outweighed by higher real interest rates, which will slow growth.
Indeed, with considerable public sector debt repayments coming due in the next few years,
continued high primary surpluses are needed to help forestall potential financing problems.
69.
Improving the quality and composition of the adjustment will be critical to
sustaining this fiscal consolidation. Though the authorities deserve credit for their fiscal
consolidation, too often they have had to introduce temporary revenue measures and cuts in
investment spending to pay for large increases in current spending—pensions and the minimum
wage. This has exacerbated short-run demand pressures and constrained the budget’s flexibility.
Looking ahead, the authorities face an even steeper hill in sustaining this consolidation. As
interest rates fall, revenues from intermediation taxes are set to decline; revenues from SEEs will
fall as these firms are privatized; and plans for decentralization pose a risk to fiscal discipline.
Although contribution rates are high, the social security system is in large deficit, and again faces
the need for reform, while reform of tax administration is also needed to combat widespread tax
evasion. To make room for increased capital and social spending in the coming years, the
authorities will face the challenge of having to reduce current non-discretionary spending and to
reform the tax system.
70.
A less discretionary environment for fiscal policy would also be helpful. Too much
attention has been given to ad hoc initiatives such as VAT cuts for selective sectors, tax holidays
for preferred investments, amnesties for tax and social security arrears, adjusting excises to
insulate the economy from changes in world oil prices, or increasing social spending beyond
what had been agreed. This tendency towards discretion and short-run remedies rewards those
that lobby for tax relief or directed spending, and undermines the long-term effectiveness and
credibility of fiscal policy. Instead, the authorities need to consider a more fundamental reform
of the tax system that reduces tax rates and simplifies the system for those that do comply.
71.
To guide fiscal policy over the next few years and ensure debt sustainability, the
authorities need to adopt a multi-year debt reduction plan. With financing conditions for
emerging market countries such as Turkey susceptible to shocks, the medium-term aim should be
to lower gross debt to pre-crisis levels, say, to the 40 percent average for EU accession countries.
If debt dynamics diverge from the target, the primary surplus path would be adjusted to achieve
the targeted reduction in debt. However, to maintain the pace of debt reduction under such a
framework, there does not seem to be room to ease the 6½ percent primary surplus target. This
should only happen once greater credibility of fiscal policy has been established and real interest
rates have fallen on a sustained basis.

- 40 -

72.
Both the CBT and the government deserve credit for reducing inflation to single
digits. The CBT’s skilful use of monetary policy has been central to this success, but so has
fiscal discipline and public sector wage restraint. To continue the disinflation process,
commitment to medium-term debt reduction through sustained primary surpluses and wage
moderation remain critical, including for minimum wages. The CBT’s independence also needs
to be preserved and its monetary framework enhanced, by adopting more of the features of its
ultimate objective—formal inflation targeting. As first steps, this could include giving the
monetary policy council more of a role in advising the Governor on interest rate decisions, and
timing these decisions to coincide with monetary policy council meetings.
73.
Foreign exchange intervention policy could also be improved. Given the need to
reduce vulnerability and to prepare for external debt repayments, the Treasury should have made
greater use of last year’s more favorable market conditions to build up reserves. On the CBT’s
side, a steadier and less reactive approach to the foreign exchange purchase auctions would have
been less confusing to markets, and might also have limited the risks of a sharp exchange rate
appreciation. Clearer mechanisms for sharing the costs of sterilizing foreign exchange purchases,
including by the Treasury building up deposits at the CBT, could make intervention policy more
effective.
74.
Confidence in the banking system is largely restored but formidable challenges
remain. Creation of an independent Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency, tightening of
supervisory practices, introduction of the blanket guarantee, recapitalization and restructuring of
the state banks, and the triple audit of the private banks have all strengthened the banking sector.
However, weaknesses in the Banking Act and fundamental deficiencies in the court system have
allowed former owners of insolvent banks to contest the loss of their banks and undermine the
effectiveness of the supervisory regime.
75.
Financial sector reform needs to be tackled forcefully. The first priority should be to
monitor removal of the blanket guarantee, in particular developments in individual banks, and to
have contingency plans ready in case weaknesses emerge. A realistic strategy for privatizing the
state banks needs to be developed and, in the interim, distortions to competition with the private
sector reduced. For the medium-term, the reform agenda needs to improve the environment for
private banking. To improve banking supervision, the Sworn Bank auditors’ exclusive right to
conduct on-site supervision should be removed, leaving the BRSA free to send off-site
supervisors or outside technical experts to examine banks. To boost profitability and to
encourage diversification of assets, a clear timetable for removing tax distortions in the financial
system needs to be established.
76.
Asset recovery and legal reforms also need to be pursued. The SDIF should announce
a clear timetable for future loan auctions, otherwise bidders will not be interested, and more
realistic asset valuations prepared and presented to the public. The recent takeover of assets
owned by former bank owners will prove difficult to resolve and the SDIF will need outside
assistance if it is not to be overwhelmed. Consideration also needs to be given to legal reforms.
This should include passage of a new Banks Act, more closely in line with EU standards, with
appropriate “fit and proper” criteria for bank owners, legal protection of BRSA and SDIF staffs

and clear delineation of responsibilities between BRSA and SDIF. But more far-reaching judicial
reform that ensures that judges who consider financial sector cases have sufficient expertise in
the area and are aware of the systemic impact of the decisions they make, may also be needed.
77.
To allow the private sector—foreign and domestic—to spearhead economic growth,
Turkey needs to further improve the investment environment. While maintaining stable
macroeconomic and financial conditions is critical here, other impediments also need to be
tackled. Implementing rules fairly, strengthening the independence of regulatory institutions, and
reforming the judicial system are all key to improving the business climate. The government
should move ahead expeditiously to put in place the steps recommended by the inaugural
Investment Advisory Council meeting in mid-March 2004. These reforms should also facilitate
privatization of state assets, where the government’s commitment is encouraging, but which has
been undermined by the legal system. To turn this commitment into reality, the government will
need to persevere in its efforts, ensure impeccable preparation to avoid legal challenges, and be
ready to accept realistic market prices.
78.
Turkey faces an historic opportunity. Macroeconomic conditions are the best they have
been in decades. The government needs to show that, unlike in the past, this period of stability
and hope is not followed by complacency and reversal. Instead, it needs to seize this unique
opportunity to reduce vulnerabilities; press ahead with fiscal, financial, and structural reforms;
and thereby put Turkey firmly on an irreversible path towards convergence with European
economies.
79.
Finally, although the Fund-supported program has contained the key elements of
success, there are also lessons for future program design. Adoption of the floating exchange
rate regime, comprehensive banking system restructuring, and maintenance of a high primary
surplus through relentless, and often difficult, fiscal adjustment have all been essential for
success. However, with the benefit of hindsight several aspects of the program might have been
better formulated or sequenced. Inflation targeting may have been promoted too early, given
concerns over fiscal dominance. Arguably, social security reform could have been included in
the program at the outset; even if it was thought at the time that the 1999 reform would be
sufficient to bring the deficit under control. Deficiencies in the judicial process and the Banking
Act were also not recognized early enough. Many of these issues will need to be addressed as the
authorities move ahead with economic reform.
80.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12month cycle. However, this could be switched to a 24-month cycle if there is a successor
arrangement.

Safeguard Assessments:
Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the Central Bank of the Republic of
Turkey (CBT) is subject to a full safeguards assessment with respect to the SBA
arrangement, which was approved on February 04, 2002 and is scheduled to expire on
December 31, 2004. A safeguards assessment was completed on April 4, 2002 and
staff’s findings and recommendations are reported in Section IV of IMF Country
Report No. 02/137. The CBT authorities have implemented all of the measures recommended
by staff.

VIII.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
For the period January 1, 2000–June 30, 2001, the lira was to have depreciated
against a basket comprising US$1 and € 0.77 along a daily path pre-announced by the
central bank. The preannouncement was for the 12-month period, and was updated
quarterly. There would not be an exchange rate band around the pre-announced path
during the first 18 months of the program. Thereafter—that is, from July 1, 2001—a
symmetrical intervention band was to have been introduced around the central parity
rate, with the total width of the band increasing gradually at a rate of 15 percentage
points per year. This exchange rate arrangement was in place until February 22, 2001,
when the government decided to float the currency.
Turkey has taken measures to implement United Nations sanctions that affect
international payments and transfers and can give rise to exchange restrictions subject
to Fund jurisdiction. In particular, Turkey has implemented financial sanctions
against persons and entities associated with the Al-Qaida network, Usama bin Laden,
and the Taliban. A list of the persons affected is published as Council of Ministers

This schedule is not the currently applicable schedule of payments to the IMF. Rather, the schedule presents all
payments to the IMF under the illustrative assumption that repayment expectations—except for SRF repayment
expectations—would be extended to their respective obligation dates by the IMF Executive Board upon request
of the debtor country (see repayment schedules and IMF lending for details). SRF repayment expectations are
shown on their current expectation dates, unless already converted to an obligation date by the IMF Executive
Board.

APPENDIX II

TURKEY: ASSESSING DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
This Appendix analyzes public sector debt and external sustainability and considers the
impact of several shocks proposed as part of the debt sustainability framework. Although
domestic and external debt sustainability can be achieved even under a range of plausible
shocks, a combination of large shocks could jeopardize this. A nonstandard test involving a
sudden stop of external capital flows would likely be manageable, as long as good policies
remain in place. Any prolonged deviation from sound policies could, however, undermine
Turkey’s public debt sustainability.
Public sector debt sustainability
1.
Under the program’s baseline projections, Turkey’s public sector debt ratio
declines substantially over the medium term (Table 12). Turkey’s public debt burden has
fallen sharply in 2002–03 from its end-2001 peak of 94 percent of GNP. Helped by strong
fiscal performance, declining real interest rates, the recovery of economic growth, and above
all, by the appreciation of the real exchange rate, Turkey’s net public sector debt stock is
estimated to have fallen to about 71 percent of GNP at end-2003. Although still high, public
debt is set to decline even further under baseline projections—to 58 percent of GNP by 2009
(modestly higher than Seventh Review projections given the recent real exchange rate
weakening).
2.
For the purposes of the debt sustainability exercise, assumptions remain broadly
unchanged from recent reviews. Specifically, it is assumed that annual economic growth
will be 5 percent over the medium term, the primary surplus will reach 6.5 percent of GNP
each year, and average real interest rates on domestic debt will remain at above 17 percent.
(Real interest rates are currently about 15 percent.) The real exchange rate path is, however,
slightly weaker, reflecting recent currency movements.
3.
The standard alternative scenario tests continue to show that Turkey’s public
debt burden is manageable under a variety of scenarios, but setting key parameters to
their historical averages gives rise to an unsustainable debt burden over the medium
term (Table 12, panel A).
•

Turkey’s public debt ratios continue to remain manageable under the
standardized fiscal and growth shocks.

•

Using macroeconomic assumptions from consensus economic forecasts results in
a decline in debt ratios. As a rough metric against which to test the staff’s
projections, the Eastern Europe Consensus Forecasts and selected market analysis
was used to simulate Turkey’s public debt path over the medium term. Although,
when the conservative DSA interest rate assumptions are imposed, these are
somewhat more pessimistic than staff’s baseline projections—with assumed primary
balances of 5½ percent over the medium term—our simulated consensus projections
still show Turkey’s debt burden declining over the medium term.

- 62 -

•

APPENDIX II

A repeat of Turkey’s historical economic performance would, however, leave the
debt path unsustainable. With real GNP growth set at the average for the past ten
years (2½ percent), a primary surplus of 3½ percent of GNP (about half of current
targets), and the real benchmark bond rate set at 24 percent (about 10 percentage
points higher than current levels), Turkey’s debt ratio increases to more than
100 percent in 2009. This scenario continues to show that a combination of poor
fiscal performance, low growth and high interest rates would produce an
unsustainable path for public debt.

4.
The standardized bound tests show that, while Turkey would be in a position to
cope with individual shocks, a combination of large shocks would undermine
sustainability (Table 12, panel B). Individual shocks relating to fiscal balances, depreciation
and contingent liabilities show manageable debt ratios over the medium term. However, the
debt burden increases to more than 95 percent under both the interest rate and growth shock
scenarios. As might be expected, the combined shock shows a clearly unsustainable debt
position, with the debt burden rising to more than 125 percent of GNP over the medium term.
External debt sustainability3
5.
The broad picture of external debt sustainability has slightly weakened since the
Seventh review under the program principally reflecting a reversal of confidence
(Figure 6). A 10 percent real depreciation relative to the program path during April–May
2004 as well as a modest increase of the projected current account deficit path has pushed up
the debt-to-GNP ratio by some 5 percentage points of GNP to 53 percent, and modestly
raised gross financing requirements.
6.
External debt remains vulnerable to extreme standardized shocks. The historic
volatility of macroeconomic indicators mean that the “standardized” bound debt
sustainability tests are particularly demanding in comparison to most countries.
Notwithstanding high historical vulnerability, the debt ratio is fairly robust over the medium
term to two-year two standard deviation shocks to the current account balance, interest rates,
and GNP growth, and to a once-off permanent shock of 30 percent nominal depreciation.
More extreme combined shocks and two standard deviation shocks to the exchange rate
would significantly test debt sustainability.
Tailored test for both external and domestic debt sustainability
7.
A “sudden stop” tailored test illustrates the effect that temporary closure of
international capital markets to Turkey might have on both external and domestic debt
3

External debt in general refers to current, noncontingent claims by non-residents on residents
usually in the form of loans, bonds, leases etc. For the purpose of this analysis it is assumed that:
(i) securities issued abroad, e.g., Eurobonds, are held by non-residents; (ii) domestically issued
securities denominated in foreign currencies are held by residents.

APPENDIX II

(Tables 12 and 13, lower panels, see footnotes for further details).4 In this scenario it is
assumed that adverse global liquidity developments result in the temporary closure of public
international bond borrowing in 2005 and a net outflow of short-term bank and private sector
financing. On the assumption that much of the high frequency trade financing would be
unimpaired, this would reduce total external financing sources by about a quarter.
8.
Such a shock would likely affect the economy through multiple channels: the
exchange rate would weaken to strengthen domestic saving and pass-through effects would
raise domestic inflation. Domestic interest rates (both nominal and real) would increase and
growth would slow significantly. On the assumption that growth falls to zero, a 15 percent
real depreciation (and higher nominal depreciation to offset higher inflation) would be
required to bring about the required current account adjustment to offset the reduction in
external financing sources. In subsequent years (2006 and 2007) growth recovers quickly,
narrowing the output gap, financing flows return to the baseline scenario and the exchange
rate depreciation is reversed.
9.
The impact of the sudden stop on external debt dynamics is modest. This reflects
both the forced reduction of external financing through the sudden stop itself, an assumed
domestic adjustment and a quick reversal of the initial real exchange rate depreciation. Such
an outcome depends crucially on both the parameters of the scenario and the authorities’
policy reaction. Notably, if short-term financing were to weaken even further, in a re-run of
the 2001 crisis when net bank financing was cut by some US$10 billion, the required
exchange rate correction would be even larger and the impact on debt sustainability
correspondingly greater. However, providing the exchange rate adjusts promptly (in contrast
to the earlier crisis) and does not overshoot, it seems reasonable to assume a much weaker
reaction from private creditors, as the external financing situation would be relatively quickly
be brought into balance.
10.
The impact on domestic debt dynamics would be stronger, but likely remain
manageable. With lower external public financing increasing Treasury’s reliance on shallow
domestic financial markets, real interest rates would be expected to come under pressure,
especially in the first year of the shock. Assuming automatic stabilizers are allowed to work,
lower growth and the resulting temporarily lower primary surpluses also add to the domestic
debt burden. The end result is that while public debt jumps to almost 80 percent of GNP by
end-2006, it stabilizes at this level. Again, the impact of the sudden stop under this scenario
depends critically on the policy response, especially on the maintenance of fiscal discipline.

4

Previous tailored tests illustrate that Turkey’s public debt burden leaves it vulnerable to shocks,
especially if policies are allowed to slip (see IMF Country Report No. 04/227, Appendix II, April 2, 2004).

g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0)
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes price and exchange rate changes
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ The implied change in other key variables under this scenario is discussed in the text.
7/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP)
remain at their levels of the last projection year. Dollar deflator is assumed to be zero.

APPENDIX III

STATISTICAL INFORMATION
1.
Macroeconomic statistics have some important shortcomings, but are usually
published in a timely fashion. Turkey is a subscriber to the Fund's Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS).
Real sector data
2.
Data on wholesale and consumer prices are published monthly, with a very short lag.
Monthly data on various production indices are published with lags of some five to six
weeks, while quarterly national accounts are published with a three-month lag (although the
second and third quarters are more timely—a 70-day lag)). The State Institute for Statistics
(SIS) publishes national accounts from the income side. Following technical assistance, an
improved consumer price index and a new producer price index—replacing the old wholesale
price index—are expected to be published in January 2005. Ongoing assistance is also
helping to improve the quality of the national accounts.
3.
There is a wide range of data on labor market developments, with the biannual
Household Labor Force Survey (HLFS) replaced with a monthly survey at the beginning of
2000. These new data are published quarterly with a three month lag. Coverage of wage
developments in the private sector has improved significantly through the use of quarterly
surveys of the manufacturing sector.
Fiscal data
4.
Budgetary data are published monthly, with a lag of some two to three weeks.
However, the coverage of the budget is incomplete, with sizable fiscal operations conducted
through extra budgetary funds, for which data are available only with long lags. Fiscal
analysis is further complicated by the omission of certain transactions from the fiscal
accounts; failure to account for sizable quasi-fiscal operations carried out by state banks and
SEEs; and technical problems associated with consolidating the cash-based accounts of
governmental entities with the accrual-based accounting of SEEs. The failure to assign a
single agency responsible for fiscal statistics also creates reporting weaknesses. It is difficult
to reconcile fiscal data with monetary and BOP data, especially in the accounting of external
debt flows and central government deposits. Under the IBRD-financed Public Financial
Management Project (PFMP), the authorities are to adopt an improved budget coding system,
a chart of accounts, and a new debt management database.
5.
Turkey reports fiscal data for publication in Government Finance Statistics Yearbook.
The latest data available are for 2001 and cover the central government budgetary sector
(including annex budget units). Data are not provided for extrabudgetary and social security
units. No monthly and quarterly data have been reported for publication in International
Financial Statistics.

- 68 -

APPENDIX III

Monetary data
6.
Data on the central bank balance sheet, and provisional data on the main monetary
aggregates and total domestic credit, are published weekly, with a one- and two-week lag,
respectively. Data on the monetary survey and deposit interest rates are published monthly,
with about a two-to-three-month lag. The CBT does not expect to meet the SDDS timeliness
requirement for the analytical accounts of the banking sector in the short term due to delays
in the preparation of year-end bank balance sheets and ongoing restructuring in the banking
system. The CBT reports monthly data to STA with about a three-to-four-month lag.
7.
STA and EUR use different measures of the monetary authorities’ net foreign assets,
reflecting in large part EUR’s treatment in the program of central bank foreign currencydenominated liabilities to resident banks as foreign liabilities of the central bank. Differences
also stem from the use of program exchange rates in EUR’s presentation, while market
exchange rates are used in IFS.
External sector
8.

In line with SDDS prescriptions Turkey disseminates

•

monthly BOP statistics with two to three months lag;

•

weekly international reserves with a one-week lag;

•

monthly data on the template on international reserves and foreign currency liquidity
(reserve template) within one month after the reference period;

•

monthly merchandise trade data with one to two months lag;

•

quarterly external debt with one quarter lag; and,

•

annual international investment position data with a six months lag.

9.

The central bank reports quarterly BOP data to STA with about four months lag.

10.
The BOP is compiled in broad conformity with the conceptual framework of the
BPM5. The CBT periodically reviews the bank’s foreign exchange records to redress, to the
extent possible, problems of coverage and misclassification. However, the banks’ foreign
exchange records need to be supplemented with estimation techniques and other sources.

•

Stand-By Arrangement. The Fund supports Turkey’s economic program for
2002-05 under an SBA approved in February 2002 and extended in April 2004.
Total access under the arrangement is SDR 12.8 billion, or 1,330 percent of quota, of
which about SDR 11.5 billion has been purchased so far (Appendix I). A further
SDR 454 million becomes available on the completion of this review.

•

Discussions. During June 3–22 the staff team met with Deputy Prime Ministers Gül,
Şener and Şahin, State Minister for Economic Affairs Babacan, Finance Minister
Unakitan, Foreign Trade Minister Tüzmen, Industry Minister Coşkun, Labor
Minister Başesgioğlu, Treasury Undersecretary Çanakci, Finance Undersecretary
Aktan, State Planning Organization Undersecretary Tiktik, Central Bank of Turkey
Governor Serdengeçti, Bank Regulation and Supervision Agency Chairman Bilgin,
Savings Deposit Insurance Fund Chairman Ertürk, other senior officials, and
representatives from the banking and business communities, and labor unions.

•

Staff. Team members comprised Reza Moghadam (head), Mark Griffiths,
Christian Keller and Donal McGettigan (EUR), Ernesto Ramirez Rigo (FAD),
Maike Luedersen (LEG), John Austin (LEG consultant), Mats Josefsson (MFD),
Chris Lane (PDR), Hugh Bredenkamp, Odd Per Brekk and Christoph Klingen
(resident representatives), and Janet Shelley (administrative assistant, EUR).
Levent Veziroglu (OED) attended most meetings.

•

Publication. The Turkish authorities have not yet decided on the publication of this
staff report. The Seventh Review staff report is expected to be published shortly but
the authorities have decided not to publish the staff report for the Sixth Review.

I. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Turkish financial markets have steadied following a brief episode of market
turbulence (Figure 1). Global market sentiment towards emerging markets worsened in early
April, with high debt countries such as Turkey most affected. Domestic developments in
Turkey added to investor concerns. These included a widening current account deficit and
mixed signals from the government over the future course of fiscal policy. Following the
market correction—the lira declined by 15 percent in a month and benchmark bond yields
rose by 7 percentage points—conditions have stabilized.
2.
Despite this turbulence, demand for Turkish assets has held up well (Figure 2,
Tables 1–4). The increase in Turkish lira deposits has continued apace, as has demand for
government paper from mutual funds and the public. Dedollarization has also persisted, with
foreign currency deposits declining in U.S. dollar terms. Foreign holdings of treasury bills—
now about US$4½ billion—have also held up.

Credit growth also remained strong, although the pace of increase has
moderated in recent weeks (Figure 2). Consumer credit has grown especially rapidly, with
consumer loans having increased threefold over the last year, albeit from a low base.
However, in recent weeks higher real interest rates have helped moderate credit growth.
4.

Macroeconomic developments have remained generally positive:

•

Economic growth appears strong. National accounts data for the first quarter
released after the mission indicate year-on-year growth of more than 10 percent,
driven by domestic demand. Recent adverse market developments have, however,
begun to dampen market sentiment, as reflected in the latest business surveys.

•

Inflation has continued to decline despite the weaker lira. Exchange rate passthrough effects have so far been muted. Monthly wholesale prices declined by

1.1 percent in June. And, with a monthly CPI decline of 0.1 percent, annual inflation
remained in single digits, its lowest level for more than 30 years.
5.
The one black spot—the large current account deficit—has thus far been
comfortably financed by capital inflows, although these are mainly short term
(Figure 3):
•

Reflecting strong domestic demand growth, the current account deficit
continued to widen. The deficit reached US$5 billion in the first quarter. While
exports remain strong, and tourism receipts have rebounded, this has been
overshadowed by a broad-based import surge, reflecting high fuel prices and rapid
domestic demand growth.

•

In contrast, the capital account has remained strong, albeit tilted towards shortterm flows. Portfolio inflows remained strong through April, banks drew down their
foreign asset holdings abroad (reflecting dedollarization), and domestic banks’ shortterm borrowing increased significantly.

•

Taken together, the overall external position ended up approximately in balance
in the first half of the year. Central Bank of Turkey (CBT) foreign exchange
purchases of US$5 billion helped to support the reserve position and ensured the
program NIR floor was comfortably met.

6.
Meanwhile, political developments have remained supportive. The government’s
resolve on Cyprus and other developments—including a revised penal code, and
broadcasting in different languages and dialects—are viewed by markets as having enhanced
Turkey’s EU prospects. Events in neighboring Iraq, however, have added to uncertainties in
recent months.
II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS

Both sides agreed to leave the existing framework broadly unchanged (¶5):1

•

The risks for the growth target of 5 percent are clearly on the upside (Box 1).
With a strong first quarter GDP outturn, positive production and demand side
indicators, and a large positive growth carryover from 2003, economic growth would
likely exceed the 5 percent growth projection. While currency weakness and higher

Box 1. Turkey’s Economic Growth Performance in 2004: Developments and Prospects
Production and demand side indicators both point to
strong growth performance so far this year. The industrial
production index—the most reliable domestic output indicator
in Turkey—increased by more than 14 percent in the first four
months over the same period last year. Capacity utilization
reached a record high in March, falling in April only because
of public sector maintenance in the petroleum sector. On the
demand side, surging car and retail sales—following large
minimum wage and pension increases, a car tax rebate and
booming consumer credit—signal continued strong domestic
consumption growth. Imports continue to grow strongly, led
by consumer goods but also reflecting strong capital goods
imports. Tax revenues, which have so far outpaced program
targets, particularly on VAT and motor vehicles taxes, lend
further support to the growth story.

Looking ahead, recent financial market turbulence may temper domestic demand. Reflecting the increase in
benchmark bond yields, consumer lending interest rates have risen, and credit growth has begun to decelerate. The impact of
higher interest rates and a weaker lira was also seen in the most recent business survey data, which show signs of declining
growth expectations.

3/ "Volume of output, excl. seasonal variations" (optimistic - pessimistic)

Annual growth is, however, well on track to meet the 5 percent target this year, even if growth slows in the second
half. The robust growth thus far combined with the positive carry-over effect from 2003 make the annual growth target of
5 percent attainable even with a slowdown in the second half of 2004. By the same token, a quick recovery in confidence
and a return to the trend of declining real interest rates would likely see annual growth rising well above the 5 percent
program target.

- 10 -

interest rates would likely curb growth in the coming months, they are unlikely to
alter the economy’s general direction. And, although consumer confidence had fallen
in recent surveys, positive responses still predominated.
•

The end-year inflation target remains achievable despite the weaker lira. Both
sides agreed that price pressures would likely increase in coming months. The output
gap has narrowed, reflecting rapid demand and credit growth, and exchange rate passthrough effects of the weaker lira remain incomplete. Bringing petroleum excise
adjustments in line with the budget would also add to price pressures. However, given
the existing cushion—the continuation of the inflation path through May would have
seen inflation end up about 3 percentage points below the end-year target—the
12 percent CPI inflation target remains achievable.

•

The current account deficit is expected to widen to some 3½–4 percent of GNP in
2004. This mainly reflects rapid demand-fuelled import growth, twinned with high oil
prices. Both sides agreed that the recent lira depreciation should, after a lag, bolster
the current account balance. Buoyant tourism receipts would also help. It was agreed,
however, that with growth likely to exceed its target and oil prices remaining high,
there was a risk that the external accounts could show a further deterioration relative
to baseline program projections over the rest of the year.
B. Fiscal Policy and Reforms

Fiscal outturns have so far exceeded program targets. But part of this overperformance is
expected to be unwound in coming months. Against the backdrop of strong domestic demand
growth, discussions focused on compensating for past policy slippages and thereby on
allowing automatic stabilizers to work fully. Progress continues to be made on structural
reforms, including on social security and tax administration.
8.
Fiscal performance has been strong. Fiscal outturns through May have exceeded
program targets (Table 6). The performance criteria for the broader consolidated general
government were exceeded by ½ percent of GNP in both March and April, with the
overperformance about evenly divided between tax revenues and expenditures. Performance
in May continued to be strong, with the primary surplus of the consolidated budget
overperforming by ¾ percent of GNP.
9.
With the overperformance likely to narrow,
both sides agreed that caution was warranted. For a
start, savings achieved through postponing spending were
likely to be unwound as the fiscal year drew to a close.
And, on the revenue side, any growth slowdown in the
second half of the year would have a negative impact. For
these reasons, both the authorities and staff agreed that
there was no room to increase budget spending ceilings.

10.
Staff noted that the fiscal record to date had been helped by strong growth,
masking fiscal slippages. The write-over of “special revenues” were well behind target.
(“Special revenues” are fees collected by off-budget institutions; these fees are used for offbudget spending by these institutions unless they are transferred to the central government.)
This reflected spending pressures arising from the across-the-board spending cuts
implemented in March to compensate for the earlier pension and wage increases. In addition,
petroleum excises had also been cut to cushion the impact of rising international oil prices.
11.
Against a backdrop of strong domestic demand growth, staff urged that past
slippages be corrected and automatic stabilizers be allowed to operate freely (¶9). While
the authorities argued for some flexibility on budget implementation, staff called for the
unimpeded functioning of automatic stabilizers given the strength of demand. This would
entail saving any revenue overperformance due to higher growth and keeping spending
within budget limits. The authorities noted that the tax incentive scheme for new car
purchases had been scaled back. And, to make up for past slippages, they decided to write
over to the budget TL 1.2 quadrillion of special revenues and to adjust petroleum pump
prices to bring excises in line with budget assumptions (structural benchmark, ¶9). Staff
noted the risk that, without flexible pump prices, there was a danger that higher oil prices
would hurt excise revenues. Looking ahead, the authorities agreed to adjust all excises to
bring them in line with budget assumptions. They also argued that, should oil prices decline,
they would not adjust pump prices, de facto achieving an increase in excises and providing a
cushion. Finally, the authorities have also implemented an energy market reform, effective
January 1, 2005 that completely liberalizes petroleum prices.
12.
Looking further ahead, the 2005 budget call, to be issued by end-June, aims at
maintaining fiscal discipline:
•

Staff argued unsuccessfully for a budget call announcement that would explicitly
include the 6.5 percent primary surplus as a goal. Such a move would have helped
reassure markets. The authorities noted that a decision on next year’s primary surplus
target had not yet been taken.

- 12 -

•

Both sides agreed, however, on the need for non-interest current spending to
decline in real terms. This would help compensate for the loss of temporary tax
measures and reduced financial intermediation taxes, and would make room for an
increase in investment.

13.
To lay the basis for sustained medium-term fiscal consolidation, further
progress is being made on the structural side (¶10):
•

With social security reform preparations now at an advanced stage, it is
expected that draft legislation will be submitted to parliament by mid-December.
The authorities explained that the planned administrative reform, aimed at combining
and unifying the three existing pension systems, would be the most critical element in
reducing the social security outlays in the long run. The main effects of this
unification would be to reduce the generosity of the civil service pensions. Both sides
agreed that parametric changes beyond current administrative reforms are also needed
to put the social security deficit on a firmly declining path. The political sensitivity of
such reforms called for continued careful preparations. With the technical work over,
a White Paper was being prepared to explain the reform proposals; this was expected
to be ready this summer. After consulting with interested parties, a final decision
would be made by the Council of Ministers on the proposal for reform in September
(new structural benchmark). Draft legislation would then be sent to parliament in
December (new performance criterion), with the aim of securing parliamentary
approval by early 2005.

•

Draft tax administration legislation has been completed in line with international
best practice but its parliamentary passage has been delayed due to a heavy
legislative agenda. The draft law, which is now expected to be submitted to
parliament in July (delayed May benchmark) and passed by end-October (new
performance criterion), will create a semi-autonomous tax administration, to be
structured along functional lines, and reporting directly to the Minister of Finance.
Local tax offices will be directly under the control of the new entity and tax policy
responsibilities will be shifted elsewhere in the Ministry of Finance. The authorities
and staff agreed that, while the transition would be difficult, the move would usher in
improved tax administration and tax compliance. As a further step, staff suggested to
consider unifying all tax auditing functions under the new entity after it had become
fully operational.

•

Further expenditure reforms are being considered for next year’s budget. The
authorities recently received technical assistance from the Fund on short-term
expenditure reforms. While the authorities are considering including some of the
recommendations in their 2005 budget, they felt that the budget call did not require
such details, and that further time was needed to build consensus in certain critical
areas. Staff urged the authorities to undertake the reforms as soon as possible,
especially those measures designed to curb the public wage bill and address the
special tax treatment of civil servants and pensioners.

- 13 -

•

Progress is being made on improving public sector governance. The civil servant
code of conduct was approved by parliament in May 2004. The commission report on
strengthening SEE governance was also completed in May. Following consideration
of the report’s recommendations, and a consultative process with interested parties,
the authorities intend to prepare draft legislation, which is expected to be sent to
parliament by end-2004.

14.
Both sides agreed that tax incentives should be avoided. While the authorities had
broached the idea of possible investment tax incentives—to attract foreign investors and level
the playing field with other countries in the region—staff argued against this, since it would
represent a move away from the direct tax reforms of April 2003 and from the general
strategy of simplifying the direct tax system, widening the tax base, and lowering overall tax
rates. Further, ad hoc policy changes would also undermine policy credibility. In the end, the
authorities decided to pursue the avenue of comprehensive, rather than piecemeal, tax policy
reform. They initiated a study covering comprehensive direct tax reform; in this context, the
authorities requested early technical assistance from the Fund.
15.
To keep wider public sector balances under control, the authorities have taken
steps to limit local government and SEE borrowing. The authorities intend to issue a
circular requiring SEEs to provide prior notification to Treasury of their borrowing plans. In
preparation for decentralization, the authorities are embarking on an important legislative
agenda to define local authority responsibilities and financing arrangements.
•

The authorities indicated that they would set strict borrowing limits for local
governments, a major improvement on current practice where there are no limits.
The debt stock of municipalities and provinces will be limited to no more than their
annual revenue, while for larger metropolitan municipalities the limit will be
1.5 times annual revenue. New domestic borrowing of all local governments will be
limited to 10 percent of annual revenue. Staff agreed that the new limits and new data
reporting requirements were indeed an improvement. However, the staff would have
preferred a uniform debt limit equivalent to annual revenue. The authorities pointed
out that the debt stock of most of the larger metropolitan municipalities already
exceeded 1.5 times annual revenue and therefore borrowing would be strictly limited.

•

Staff recommended close monitoring of the larger municipalities with an eye to
tightening the debt limits in the future if needed. The forthcoming public
administration framework law (PAF) could transfer more expenditures to the local
governments and therefore a stronger system could be needed in future to deal with
debt and arrears problems. The authorities agreed that after the PAF is approved and
in the context of new legislation setting out fiscal intergovernmental relations, the
debt limits of the large municipalities could be tightened further.

•

The staff warned against any restructuring of local government arrears that could
give the impression of an amnesty and create a negative incentive structure for local
authority fiscal control in the future. The authorities explained that all local authority

- 14 -

external debt arrears have been fiscalized already and are included in the public sector
debt statistics. They had decided to create a commission that would restructure arrears
on a case-by-case basis. Both sides agreed that arrears restructuring be guided by
ability to pay, contain adequate safeguards, and be conducted in a transparent manner.

Both sides agreed on the need for continued caution in setting base money
targets (¶11). Falling inflation and inflation expectations and strengthening real activity had
increased demand for currency and TL deposits. The mission therefore agreed to revise the
base money targets to accommodate the base money increase through May. But several
factors had made the end-year inflation target more challenging (see above). And the recent
increase in market interest rates and currency depreciation should help slow money demand
(as well as helping to slow bank credit expansion and to contain the current account deficit).
Base money targets for the rest of the year were therefore increased only in line with nominal
activity. This would require continued caution in reducing overnight rates, which in any
event were now below treasury bill rates. The staff also welcomed the central bank’s
intention to announce steps aimed at increasing the transparency of its monetary policy
operations.
17.
The floating rate regime had illustrated its effectiveness during the recent
episode of market turbulence. It was agreed that, while the CBT’s modest sales of foreign
exchange had helped stabilize markets in May, discretionary intervention would remain
strictly limited. Staff took issue with the frequent changes to foreign exchange purchase
arrangements in recent months, as this had confused financial market participants, possibly
adding to recent market volatility. The authorities argued that they needed to respond to
changing market conditions, while acknowledging that fewer changes would be desirable.
18.
The mission also argued that the buildup in international reserve should resume
as soon as market conditions permit (¶12). While the CBT has built up its reserve position
by intervening, including through auctions, Turkey’s external obligations remained large, and
the CBT should restart its purchases of foreign exchange in a predictable and transparent
manner once the balance of payments position allows. Staff also noted that Treasury should
overborrow and deposit the proceeds at the CBT once market conditions settle. This would
lower Treasury exposure to shifts in market sentiment (see below), but would have the
indirect benefit of helping the CBT in its sterilization operations.
D. Financial Sector Reform (¶14)
19.
Following a major review of the Banking Act, the authorities have prepared a
new draft Credit Institutions law. The new legislation, which is expected to be passed by
parliament by November (a new structural performance criterion), will bring the legal
framework more closely in line with EU standards. Areas that received particular attention in
the review included the scope of the legislation, “fit and proper” criteria, licensing process,
related party lending, on-site supervision, legal protection for Bank Regulation and

- 15 -

Supervision Agency (BRSA) and Savings Deposit Insurance Fund (SDIF) staffs and boards
and the delineation of responsibilities between the two institutions. These are all covered in
the draft law. The exclusive right of Sworn Bank Auditors to conduct on-site supervision will
be reviewed to permit the BRSA to engage off-site personnel and outside experts as needed.
20.
Responding to industry concerns, the original timetable for the new legislation
has been extended. Given the fundamental reforms envisaged, the banking sector
community had urged that more time be allowed for consultation. The authorities and staff
agreed on the need to proceed carefully. The authorities now plan to submit the draft law to
parliament by end-September 2004.
21.
A comprehensive strategy has finally been developed for restructuring and
privatizing state banks.
•

In a move welcomed by staff, a strategy has been formulated for the integration
of the intervened Pamuk with state-owned Halk. The combined bank is expected
to become fully operational by end-October. Integration of the two banks should lead
to operational and financial synergies, including on IT, the customer base, and branch
networks. Given these synergies, staff urged the authorities to aim at privatizing the
new bank by end-2005. The authorities would not commit to a fixed timetable to
doing this, preferring to wait until market conditions were supportive. Staff regretted
that the resolution of Pamuk had taken more than two years to bring to closure.

•

A comprehensive restructuring plan for Ziraat is being developed with the
assistance of international consultants.

•

The due diligence of Vakif has been further delayed. The authorities noted that the
terms of reference has now been drafted, and that a consulting firm would be hired
shortly. The assessment was expected to be completed by end-October.

22.

Unfortunately, the SDIF asset sales strategy continues to proceed slowly:

•

The SDIF has relaunched last December’s failed auction, with winning bids to be
selected by end-August, but its prospects remain uncertain. After the auction
announcement, SDIF made a general discount offer to all its debtors, ending midJuly. The offer includes loans in the portfolio currently being auctioned. Staff noted
that with high-quality borrowers more likely to accept the offer, the quality of the
portfolio being auctioned and the price likely to be offered may deteriorate. Staff
nevertheless stressed the importance of a successful auction, indicating that another
failure would deter potential investors.

•

Staff urged the SDIF to sell its assets through regular auctions with successive
loan portfolios being put up for sale until the sales process is complete. It was
agreed that the reassessment of SDIF asset valuations should foster a better
understanding of recovery rates and allow more realistic auction reservation prices.

- 16 -

Staff indicated that bilateral deals with individual borrowers should take place only
after seeking outside expert opinion, with the general terms of each deal being made
public.
23.
Another unwelcome development is recent court rulings on Demirbank and
Kentbank. In April the courts made a ruling that BRSA’s intervention in Demir and Kent
had been unlawful. This could have implications for future bank intervention strategy.
However, the new Credit Institutions legislation will help address existing legal
shortcomings.
24.
Looking ahead, staff stressed that the removal of the blanket guarantee on bank
liabilities, implemented on July 5, warranted careful monitoring. The BRSA indicated
that the TL 50 billion guarantee would cover almost 99 percent of bank accounts (64 percent
by value). They were also confident that the banking sector was ready and had presented a
detailed assessment to the government, and issued a press release confirming the banking
system’s ability to deal with the abolition of the guarantee. More generally, the authorities
indicated their preparedness for the move and stressed that individual bank liquidity was
being monitored closely. Staff urged the authorities to continue to pay close attention to
monitoring individual banks, and to follow up on any disparities between deposit rates
offered.
E. Other Structural Reforms
25.
Despite recent setbacks, the authorities remain committed to privatization (¶17).
A recent procurement law amendment had removed an important bottleneck, by facilitating
the hiring of consultants. Preparations for the sale of Türk Telekom are advancing, against a
backdrop of strong foreign and domestic investor interest. Public offerings are also planned
for PETKIM (petrochemicals) and Turkish Airlines by end-year, and financial consultants
have already been appointed. Several smaller companies have already been sold, including
the alcohol arm of TEKEL, with cash proceeds through June totaling US$475 million
(against an end-June indicative target of US$500 million). Staff noted the judicial system as a
major hurdle. With the privatization of TUPRAŞ in doubt, following a recent court ruling,
the US$3 billion end-year privatization proceeds target might be difficult to achieve.
26.
Responding to business concerns that follow up to the Investment Advisory
Council (IAC) was moving slowly, the authorities have taken further steps to improve
the business climate (¶15). These include the preparation of draft legislation on
streamlining investor approval procedures, and for a new Investment Promotion Agency. The
authorities committed to providing a progress report to the Prime Minister and IAC members
by October.
III. FINANCING ISSUES
27.
With comfortable rollover needs for the rest of this year, the staff urged the
authorities to build up a cushion for a more challenging environment next year.
Treasury had managed, until recently, to improve its borrowing terms with rollover rates of

- 17 -

about 90 percent. Baseline projections of rollover requirements over the rest of the year are
lower. Depending on market conditions, Treasury should use this opportunity to build its
deposits at the CBT and prepare for tighter medium-term financing requirements (see the
Article IV staff report).
28.
To help address rollover concerns, the authorities have agreed to address
remaining impediments to Treasury and CBT coordination (¶13). The authorities agreed
to identify remaining practical obstacles to Treasury deposit buildup and to prepare an action
plan, by end-September, for their removal (new structural benchmark). Staff noted that
borrowing limits, appropriations for interest payments, payment terms on government
deposits, and the taxation of CBT money market securities should all be covered in the plan.
29.
Discussions continued on relations with the Fund after the program expires
(Box 2).
•

The authorities have developed comprehensive medium-term macroeconomic
scenarios covering the balance of payments, national accounts, and the budget, along
with detailed alternative financing projections. Although financing requirements look
tight (see the Article IV staff report), the authorities have not yet decided on what
form of relationship they wish to pursue once the current program expires.

•

The authorities also expressed their intention to announce their post-program
plans by September. Staff indicated that, should the authorities decide to opt for a
successor arrangement, any request for a future program would have to be considered
under exceptional access procedures and would depend not only on Turkey’s
financing needs, but also on it large outstanding obligations to the Fund. Discussions
would continue during the Ninth Review against the backdrop of the budget
preparation process. While reasonably satisfied with the announcement timetable,
staff nevertheless urged the authorities to announce their policy plans for 2005
promptly, including on the primary surplus. The authorities were not yet in a position
to do this, however, and wanted to consider the options carefully before making an
announcement.
IV. PROGRAM MODALITIES
A. Program Monitoring

30.
Quantitative performance criteria. The attached Letter of Intent describes progress
in implementing the program supported by the Stand-By Arrangement and requests
completion of the Eighth Review.
•

The authorities request a waiver of nonobservance of the base money ceiling
performance criterion for end-April. Given the small size of the deviation, staff
supports the waiver request.

- 18 -

Box 2. Post-Program Considerations
This box lays out some key considerations should the authorities seek a successor arrangement. 1/
A successor program could be either disbursing or precautionary. By seeking a precautionary
arrangement, the authorities could benefit from continued market confidence while signaling that Fund
resources were no longer necessary. The external outlook is, however, difficult without additional
official financing. With large repayments falling due to the Fund, baseline program projections show a
loss of reserves of one-third over 2004–06. While the possibility of extending expected repurchases
falling due in 2006 helps, the baseline financing assumptions themselves are subject to downside risk.
Under either a precautionary arrangement or
a disbursing stand-by, the aim should be to
reduce Fund exposure. With the Fund so
heavily exposed to Turkey, prudential
considerations call for a reduction in Fund
exposure over the program period. Directors
have called for reduced exposure, and the
authorities themselves have also signaled
publicly that they would favor a continuation of
net repayments to the Fund. At the same time,
Turkey faces large financing needs. For the
public sector, external medium- and long-term
debt amortization is projected to reach US$26
billion in 2005–06, with more than half falling
due to the Fund even after allowing for an
extension of 2006 repurchases (see figure).

An ambitious reform program is needed, however, if Turkey is to build on its recent achievements.
Besides continuing with the program’s macroeconomic stabilization, including on the primary surplus
and inflation, critical structural reforms are required in banking (state banks, intermediation taxes, legal
reforms), fiscal (quality of adjustment, social security, streamlining of taxes, tax administration,
expenditure policy), and monetary (the move to inflation targeting and coordination between Treasury
and the CBT).
____________________________________________
1

With Turkey’s high outstanding Fund access post-program monitoring (PPM) would be needed even if Turkey
chose to graduate. Given its vulnerabilities, and high outstanding access, frequent (possibly quarterly rather than
the usual bi-annual) PPM would appear to be appropriate.

- 19 -

•

Annex B of the Letter of Intent outlines the updated program. The new
performance criteria are unchanged from the indicative targets set in the Seventh
Review, apart from the base money ceilings (see above).

31.
Structural performance criteria. The performance criteria on banking and on social
security reform legislation have now been specified. A new performance criterion is also
proposed on the parliamentary passage of tax administration reform legislation.
32.

The prior action for completion of the Eighth Review is:

•

Write over to the central government budget TL1.2 quadrillion of special revenues.
B. Data Issues

33.
The authorities are continuing their efforts to disclose in-kind foreign financed
defense spending (whose exclusion from reported fiscal data for past test dates may have
resulted in misreporting). The plan is to use estimates of this spending from reported debt
stock movements to determine, by end-July, whether a noncomplying purchase may have
taken place in the period January 2000 to June 2003.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
Despite recent market turbulence, Turkey’s macroeconomic outlook remains
positive. Political conditions have remained supportive, and, on the economic side, both the
float and strong fiscal outcomes have aided the adjustment process. With few signs of
flagging activity, economic growth looks likely to exceed this year’s 5 percent program
target. The 12 percent inflation target remains achievable, although recent currency
weakness, high oil prices, rapid credit growth, a narrowing output gap, and prospective
administered price increases make this task more demanding.
35.
The immediate macroeconomic challenge is the widening current account deficit,
which reflects rapid domestic demand growth. So far the financing of the deficit has not
been a problem, although capital flows have been mainly short-term. Recent currency and
interest rate movements, together with rebounding tourism revenues, should help narrow the
trade and services deficit over time. Other steps have also been taken to address the deficit.
State banks have reined in their lending. Lower car tax incentives and the operation of
automatic fiscal stabilizers should also help dampen import demand. The situation warrants
continued close monitoring, however, and additional corrective measures, including on the
fiscal side, may need to be taken promptly.
36.
Against this backdrop, the government needs to maintain strict fiscal discipline.
Rapid growth had masked slippages in budget implementation, but the authorities have since
taken remedial actions. Looking forward, the government needs to allow automatic fiscal
stabilizers to function unimpeded, and save any revenue overperformance. With the current
account widening, for example, the authorities’ focus on pump prices, rather than excises, is
misplaced. The failure to adjust automatically to world oil prices amounts to a de facto tax

- 20 -

cut when world oil prices are rising. The liberalization of pump prices should, therefore, be
allowed to take effect next year as planned. It is also important to avoid new tax incentives
and to keep a lid on spending. Finally, it is unfortunate that the budget call did not include an
explicit commitment to a 6½ percent primary surplus target for next year. A clear
commitment to maintaining this target would ease market concerns about financing needs
and the pace of debt reduction.
37.
The decentralization process entails many risks and needs to proceed carefully.
The government’s intention to introduce explicit debt and borrowing limits for local
authorities as well as new reporting systems is welcome. While the local authority debt and
borrowing limits appear on the whole prudent, the larger debt ceiling for the major
metropolitan municipalities could have been avoided by providing a transition period for
those whose debt exceeded the new limits. An amnesty of local government arrears should
also be avoided to ensure an appropriate incentive structure for the future. While the
authorities’ intention to deal with arrears on a case-by-case basis is welcome, the process
needs to be dealt with in a transparent manner.
38.
On the structural side, the government is to be commended for working to
improve the underpinnings of its fiscal policy. Notwithstanding some delays, its efforts to
improve tax administration and the social security system are especially welcome in this
respect.
39.
This year’s monetary goals are challenging, but achievable. Although consumer
price inflation is now in single digits, possible pass-through from the recent depreciation and
high oil prices need to be contained. Accordingly, the central bank, which deserves continued
credit for its conduct of monetary policy, should stick closely to its revised base money
targets and to a prudent interest rate path. Incomes policy, including limiting the increases in
the minimum wage and for government workers, would also need to be kept tight.
40.
The floating exchange rate had worked well as a safety valve during the recent
bout of market turbulence. While the float remains essential, Turkey’s external obligations
are large. Foreign exchange reserves buildup should therefore resume as soon as market
conditions allow, but in a predictable and transparent manner. Recent turbulence served as a
reminder of the need for continued close coordination between the central bank and the
Treasury in their operations.
41.
The banking reform agenda is challenging but critical to the success of the
program. State bank reform has been long-awaited. Another priority is to continue with the
close monitoring of individual banks following the transition to the limited deposit guarantee
in early July. It is also important to regain momentum on SDIF asset sales, including by
setting realistic price expectations. Any bilateral loan restructuring deals should be handled
professionally and transparently.
42.
The authorities need to gain momentum in privatization and improve the
business climate. With the recent setback on TUPRAŞ, the end-year privatization receipt

- 21 -

target will be difficult to achieve. But recent steps, including the procurement law
amendments and the preparation of large companies for sale, are welcome. Looking ahead,
the authorities need to ensure that sales preparations are as thorough as possible and designed
in ways that minimize the scope for court challenges. The follow-up work to the March
inaugural Investment Advisory Council needs to be accelerated.
43.
Against this background, the staff recommends the completion of the Eighth
Review and approval of the authorities' request for a waiver. Turkey has a good program
implementation record, including for the current review, and deserves the support of the
international community. The authorities have also taken some steps to address the risks to
the external outlook, the clearest near-term risk. On this basis, the staff recommends the
granting of the waiver on base money and the completion of the review.

Safeguard Assessments:
Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the Central Bank of the Republic of
Turkey (CBT) is subject to a full safeguards assessment with respect to the SBA
arrangement, which was approved on February 04, 2002 and is scheduled to expire on
December 31, 2004. A safeguards assessment was completed on April 4, 2002 and
staff’s findings and recommendations are reported in Section IV of IMF Country No. 02/137.
The CBT authorities have implemented all of the measures recommended by staff.

VIII.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
For the period January 1, 2000–June 30, 2001, the lira was to have depreciated
against a basket comprising US$1 and € 0.77 along a daily path pre-announced by the
central bank. The preannouncement was for the 12-month period, and was updated
quarterly. There would not be an exchange rate band around the pre-announced path
during the first 18 months of the program. Thereafter—that is, from July 1, 2001—a
symmetrical intervention band was to have been introduced around the central parity
rate, with the total width of the band increasing gradually at a rate of 15 percentage
points per year. This exchange rate arrangement was in place until February 22, 2001,
when the government decided to float the currency.

IX.

Article IV Consultations:
The 2002 Article IV staff report (IMF Country Report No. 02/137) was issued on April 4,
2002, and the accompanying Statistical Appendix (IMF Country Report No. 02/138) was
issued on April 8, 2002. Board discussion took place on April 15, 2002.

This schedule is not the currently applicable schedule of payments to the IMF. Rather, the schedule presents all
payments to the IMF under the illustrative assumption that repayment expectations—except for SRF repayment
expectations—would be extended to their respective obligation dates by the IMF Executive Board upon request
of the debtor country (see repayment schedules and IMF lending for details). SRF repayment expectations are
shown on their current expectation dates, unless already converted to an obligation date by the IMF Executive
Board.

APPENDIX II

TURKEY: IMF–WORLD BANK RELATIONS
Partnership in support of Turkey’s Development Strategy
1.
Turkey’s vision is of a modern and secular participatory democracy, fully integrated
into the European community, playing a critical role in the regional context, with an exportoriented, highly competitive production structure. The priorities of the government are
spelled out in the program presented to parliament in March 2003 and in the associated
Urgent Action Plan.
2.
The IMF and World Bank teams have collaborated closely in Turkey, and standard
working arrangements already broadly follow the guidelines for enhanced Bank-Fund
collaboration. This has included regular participation of Bank staff in the meetings with
government on the Fund’s program review missions, and IMF staff has been invited to Bank
review meetings and meetings with government. The IMF has taken the lead in
macroeconomic stabilization and the World Bank in social and structural areas, with close
collaboration in structural areas that have a particular impact on macroeconomic stability.
The Bank’s dialogue and conditionality has maintained consistency with the macroeconomic
framework endorsed by the IMF.
World Bank Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
3.
The objectives of the CAS, discussed by the Executive Directors on November 6,
2003, are to help Turkey reduce economic vulnerability and achieve high and stable growth,
and continue the process of addressing some long neglected social and environmental
problems. The last CAS focused heavily on crisis management. This CAS aims at reducing
the risk of reemergence of crises and helping Turkey address the many economic challenges
of preparing for EU membership. The planned assistance program for FY04–06 is structured
around four development themes: (i) sound macroeconomics and governance; (ii) equitable
human and social development; (iii) attractive business climate and knowledge; and
(iv) strong environmental management and disaster prevention.
4.
Under the program to promote sound macroeconomics and governance, the first
priority will be the final loan in the Programmatic Financial and Public Sector Adjustment
Loan (PFPSAL) series, PFPSAL III. Going forward, programmatic lending will be split
between public sector and financial sector components reflecting the more specialized nature
of the second generation of reforms. These will include fiscally sustainable reform of the
social security system, continued support for the ongoing agenda of public sector reforms,
and beginning to shift the emphasis from reforms to measurable improvements in public
service delivery. The Bank will support the Government’s activities in the legal and judicial
reform area initiated under the Urgent Action Plan through improvements in the legal
framework and in judicial reform. Finally, under this heading, the Bank will help
Government to develop a local government reform strategy with the objective of providing
better local infrastructure services (water, roads, transport, solid waste management etc.) to

- 40 -

APPENDIX II

the urban population that represents about 70 percent of the population. Analytical support
under the sound macroeconomics and governance heading include development of a
Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model to study impact of the financial sector on
growth and employment; a Country Economic Memorandum on EU accession; and a new
Public Expenditure and Institutional Review, Country Financial Accountability Assessment,
and Country Procurement Assessment Report.
5.
Bank support for equitable human and social development will focus on secondary
education, a radical reform of the health sector and assistance for social protection. Under
the previous CAS, support had begun on primary education. Work will now begin on
secondary education reform, in close coordination with EU-financed activities. Significant
reforms are planned in the health sector to streamline service provision, do away with
arbitrary differences in the provision of health care, and extend health insurance to the entire
population in a fiscally responsible manner. Health insurance is only part of a planned
reform of the entire social protection system including pensions, health insurance, social
assistance and unemployment insurance. The Bank is providing intensive support for this
process including analytical support through a Poverty Assessment, Labor Market Study, and
projections on pensions, health insurance and unemployment insurance.
6.
To help improve the business climate, the Bank will continue to support financial
sector reform with a focus on the legal and regulatory framework for banking, the
privatization of state banks, and regulatory issues related to capital markets, insurance and
other nonbank financial institutions. A knowledge economy project will help position
Turkey in the global economy. The real sector will be supported through an export finance
loan. IFC will continue to finance viable private sector export-oriented projects including
small and medium enterprises, and MIGA will offer guarantees to Turkish firms. Bank
assistance in agriculture will focus on increasing productivity by addressing issues of human
capital and through diversification in rural areas. A renewable energy project and railway
restructuring project are planned. Analytical work will be on financial sector reform, a
recently completed knowledge economy assessment, and a rural development strategy.
7.
Environmental management is a high priority since Turkey is seeking to adopt
European Union environmental standards. Bank lending support will focus on microwatershed management and a contribution to a regional effort to reduce chemical run-off into
the Black Sea. The Bank will also continue to support disaster management through a
project to mitigate seismic risks.
8.
As of June 30, 2004, the portfolio of World Bank financed projects in Turkey consists
of 16 active projects. These include 13 investment loans, one programmatic adjustment loan
(PFPSAL 3), and two grants. Total net commitments amount to about $4.3 billion. While net
IBRD commitments are lower than in the previous two fiscal years, reflecting the recent
closure of large loans, about $1.6 billion was approved in FY04, compared to $300 million in
FY03. New approvals include a $1.0 billion programmatic adjustment loan, as well as loans
in the health, energy and financial sectors.

- 41 -

APPENDIX II

9.
The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has been active in the financial sector,
manufacturing, oil and gas, infrastructure and health and education. As of May 31, 2004,
IFC’s total portfolio in Turkey was US$881 million of which $33 million is equity. With a
gross exposure of US$185 million as of April 30 2004, Turkey is an important country for
MIGA. The total amount of foreign direct investment facilitated by MIGA is estimated at
approximately US$1 billion.
IMF-World Bank collaboration
10.
Areas where the Fund leads. The Fund takes the lead in macroeconomic
stabilization including macro-fiscal policy, monetary policy, exchange rate policy and
financial stability and risk management.
11.
Areas in which the World Bank leads. The Bank has taken the lead in structural
areas where both institutions have conditionality including bankruptcy reform, corporate
sector restructuring, social security reform, regulatory and market reforms in
telecommunications and energy, agriculture reform, and privatization. The Bank is also in
the lead in areas such as health, education, infrastructure, governance and environmental
management.
12.
Areas of shared responsibility. The work on public sector management and
governance has focused on strengthening public expenditure management system while
maintaining fiscal discipline. The Fund has taken the lead in the short-term measures needed
for the fiscal adjustment such as incomes policy, urgent revenue and expenditure measures,
and budget monitoring and reporting. The Bank has taken the lead in assisting government
on the medium-term public expenditure management strategy, rationalization of the public
investment program, public procurement reform, accounting reform, and public liability
management. Public employment policy, medium-term tax strategy, anti-corruption strategy
and civil service reform are further areas of Bank involvement.
13.
The challenge facing Turkey in the financial sector has been to address the banking
crisis and putting in place an appropriate legal and regulatory framework that would
minimize the risk of future crises. The Bank has taken the lead in reform of the legal
framework and regulations for bank supervision, the institutional development of the
Banking Regulatory and Supervisory Agency (BRSA) and Saving Deposit Insurance Fund
(SDIF), and the structural reforms required to guide the restructuring and improve the
governance of the state banks, as well as work on Non-Bank Financial Institutions (NBFI).
The Fund has taken the lead in assessing the soundness of the banking system and where
there was an immediate fiscal impact such as the re-capitalization of the state banks, the
closing of insolvent banks, and the private bank recapitalization scheme. On the state banks
agenda and resolution of private banks the Fund and Bank have worked closely as a team.
The Bank intends to continue its support for financial sector reform in Turkey including the
development of the NBFI for which a major study has recently been concluded.

- 42 -

Ankara, July 15, 2004
Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C., 20431
U.S.A.
Dear Mr. de Rato,
1.
Adherence to our macroeconomic program has enabled Turkey to ride recent
market turbulence with limited adverse effects. Our floating exchange rate regime as well
as our strong fiscal position have helped us adjust promptly to a combination of tighter
international capital markets and pressures on the current account balance resulting from
strong import demand and higher oil prices. We have continued to experience broad-based
growth from the production side as well as the demand side, and we confidently expect to
meet, or exceed, our program projection of 5 percent growth this year. Consumer price
inflation has fallen to 9 percent, a new decades-long low.
2.
We are determined to end the “stop-go” economic policies of past years. The
recent pace of consumer demand growth as well as related imports, if continued, could have
posed risks for the sustainability of our growth trajectory. However, a rise in market interest
rates and slowing of credit growth should contain domestic demand while lira depreciation
will impact the current account balance. The over performance of budget revenue should help
to dampen demand pressures.
3.
In order to sustain rapid growth over the medium term we are also pressing
forward with our ambitious economic policy agenda.
•

We have met or exceeded most fiscal and monetary targets set under the
program. The primary surplus targets for March and April have been comfortably
exceeded, as has the target for net international reserves. The base money target for
April was missed by the narrowest of margins.

•

In the area of structural policies, we have moved forward decisively in most areas
although some unavoidable delays have arisen (Annex A). BRSA has assessed the
strength of the banking system prior to replacing the blanket guarantee with a more
limited deposit protection scheme. SDIF has revalued its assets and announced a new
strategy for asset sales, excess capital in state banks has been removed and key
elements of a strategy for restructuring and eventual privatization will be announced
shortly. The wholesale revision of the Banking Act, however, is delayed to ensure
adequate consultation with stake holders and will be passed on to parliament in

- 43 -

September. We have also driven forward our fiscal reforms: draft revenue
administration restructuring legislation has now been completed and will be
submitted to parliament shortly; the Commission on SEE governance has completed
its work; and, the code of conduct for civil servants was approved by parliament on
May 25. We have continued to refrain from introducing any new amnesty on public
sector receivables, meeting a continuous performance criterion.
4.
In light of this strong performance, we request the completion of the Eighth
Review under the Stand-By Arrangement. Based on our exceptional record in reducing
inflation and the resulting increase in currency demand, we request a waiver of
nonobservance for end-April 2004 base money performance criterion. Performance criteria
for the remainder of the program are set out in Annex B. We will continue to consult the
Fund about the progress being made in implementing policies supported by the Stand-By
Arrangement, and in advance of any changes to these policies.
Macroeconomic framework
5.
We remain on course to achieve our macroeconomic objectives for 2004.
Consumer price inflation has fallen to single digits, while growth in the first part of the year
has been stronger than anticipated. Although higher world oil prices and the depreciation of
the exchange rate in April and May could raise the level of consumer prices temporarily, we
are well on track to meet our target of 12 percent inflation at end-year. These same factors,
together with the recent increase in interest rates, should slow domestic demand growth in
the coming months, bringing output growth more closely in line with the 5 percent program
projection. On the external side, we expect a current account deficit of some 3½ -4 percent of
GNP with strong exports and tourism receipts in large part offsetting higher imports. In light
of strong net capital inflows early in the year our net international reserves position will be
maintained.
6.
For 2005 and beyond, our emphasis will be on maintaining disinflation and debt
reduction through sustaining our high primary surplus. This environment should permit
growth to continue at around 5 percent. We expect inflation to further slow to 8 percent by
end-2005. In order to continue reducing real interest rates we will maintain our tight fiscal
policy in 2005. Our 2005 budget call will be consistent with our medium term debt reduction
strategy.
7.
We are finalizing our medium-term program aimed at accelerating economic
convergence with the European Union. Our economic policy priorities ahead are focused
on tax reform – aimed at base broadening and rate reductions, affordable health and social
security reform, and completing restructuring of the banking sector. We will continue our
close policy dialogue with the Fund in 2005 and beyond.
Fiscal policy
8.
Fiscal policy remains on track to meet, or exceed, our 6.5 percent of GNP public
sector primary surplus target in 2004. Strong revenues as well as expenditure shortfalls

- 44-

have contributed to this performance through end-May. We intend any revenue over
performance to provide a cushion to help ensure that the 2004 budget can be fully
implemented.
9.
To ensure full implementation of the approved budget and an appropriate fiscal
stance we have:
•

Scaled back tax incentives for automobile purchase. From May, the automobile
excise deduction available for new car purchase has been cut from TL4.5 billion to
TL2.3 billion.

•

Written over to the budget TL1.2 quadrillion of special revenues cutting the scope for
extra budgetary spending appropriations as a prior action for this review. While this
amount is slightly lower than previously envisaged, our intention remains to transfer
TL2.5 quadrillion special revenues for the whole year.

•

Increased petroleum excises. In light of the exceptional increase in world oil prices in
recent months, excises were lowered temporarily to limit the pass through to domestic
prices. As oil price increases now appear not to be temporary, we have increased
petroleum excises effective June 29, only narrowly falling short of budget
assumptions (structural benchmark for the review). Adjusting excises in line with
budget assumptions remains a structural benchmark. The petroleum product market
will be liberalized on January 1, 2005 with prices determined by market forces.

•

Maintained our incomes policy consistent with our inflation objective. Public sector
wages and salaries have been increased in line with the inflation target. The Minimum
Wage Commission announced the minimum wage for the remainder of 2004, with an
increase in line with those of public workers and civil servants and with no budget
compensation for employers.

•

Submitted the draft decree to the Council of Ministers to eliminate the RUSF levy on
commercial credits later this month as a further step to reduce financial
intermediation costs.

•

Finally, significant future changes in tax policy will be aligned with the budget cycle.

10.
We are moving forward in implementing our structural reform program to
support a sustained improvement in Turkey’s fiscal performance.
•

Draft revenue administration restructuring legislation, including provisions to
make GDR a semi-autonomous agency within the Ministry of Finance, reorganization
along functional lines, and to move tax policy functions into the Ministry of Finance
has been finalized. The draft legislation will be submitted to Parliament before endJuly (structural benchmark). However, parliamentary passage (July structural

- 45 -

benchmark) has been delayed due to a heavy legislative agenda. Passage is now
expected by end-October 2004 (new structural performance criterion).
•

Our strategy for enhancing state enterprise governance (May benchmark) is
complete. The strategy entails introducing performance targets, strengthening the
accountability and efficiency of management, and allowing performance and financial
auditing by external auditors. We will complete the legislative changes in line with
the strategy by end-2004.

•

We have improved our public sector personnel system, through passage of
legislation to establish a code of conduct for civil servants and public administrators
(June benchmark).

•

The Ministry of Labor has developed a framework for analyzing social security
reforms. Over the Summer we will work on a range of reform options. We will
decide our preferred pension system reform strategy by end-September 2004 (new
structural benchmark). This strategy will include unification of the existing three
pension institutions and an objective to place the pension deficit on a firm downward
path by 2007 and to reduce it to 1 percent of GNP over the long term. In the area of
health insurance, we plan to have a phased introduction of universal health coverage
with any additional expenditures covered by compensatory measures. We will submit
this reform package to parliament in mid-December 2004 (performance criterion)
with a view to passage by January 2005 and a phased implementation during 200507.

•

In the context of preparing legislation for the decentralization of some central
government functions to municipalities and special provincial administrations
we will ensure that budgetary discipline is maintained. The legislation will limit
municipalities and special provinces debt stock to no more than annual revenue.
Metropolitan municipalities debt stock will be limited to 1.5 times annual revenue.
Debt limits will be reviewed and tightened, if necessary, in the context of
forthcoming legislation concerning intergovernmental relations. New domestic
borrowing of all local governments in excess of 10 percent of annual revenues will
require central government authorization. The legislation will also require local
governments to disseminate timely and accurate fiscal data to enable monitoring and
will be complemented by separate legislation that clarifies intergovernmental fiscal
relations. A committee is preparing a comprehensive report on the current level of
local government debt, including enterprises under local government control.

•

Arrears of local governments, including penalties and interest, will be dealt with on
a case by case basis by a newly created Commission empowered by law to restructure
claims, subject to Council of Ministers’ approval. Formal settlements will be guided
by the ability to pay, contain adequate safeguards for repayment including claw back
of central government transfers, and will be made public.

- 46 -

Monetary policy
11.
Monetary policy remains focused on achieving this year’s 12 percent inflation
target, and reducing inflation over the medium term. With inflation falling faster than
anticipated, demand for base money has again exceeded our projections, causing the endApril performance criterion on base money to be missed by a fractional amount. In light of
this increase in money demand we have raised our base money targets for the remainder of
the year (Annex B). While our policy of implicit inflation targeting has been successful, we
are making progress toward the eventual adoption of formal inflation targeting.
12.
The floating exchange rate regime remains central to our ability to adjust
promptly to changing global circumstances. At end-April we terminated foreign exchange
purchase auctions in response to a decline in foreign exchange supply occasioned by banks
closing their positions and a reversal of hitherto strong portfolio inflows. Since then we have
intervened once in a small amount to dampen excessive exchange rate volatility, and such
discretionary intervention will continue to be strictly limited. The recent exchange rate
depreciation represents a correction largely in response to tightening global capital markets
and a weakening of the current account balance. Its impact on the price level should be
contained, and monetary policy will aim to limit second-round effects on inflation.
13.
Coordination between the Treasury and the CBT in their respective policy areas
of debt management and monetary policy has been strengthened. Coordination at the
operational level, on a daily basis, is working well. To further enhance the effectiveness of
policy coordination we will prepare a joint CBT-Treasury action plan, by end-September
2004, to address remaining legal, regulatory or procedural obstacles (a new structural
benchmark).
Financial sector reform
14.
Our efforts to strengthen the financial system continue to move ahead across
several fronts. In particular, through strengthening the legal framework for banking activities,
disposing of assets of liquidated and intervened banks, and restructuring state banks for
privatization.
•

We have completed a comprehensive review of the Banking Act and prepared a
new draft Law on Credit Institutions to bring the legal framework more closely in
line with EU standards. The law will place particular emphasis on strengthening the
legal framework in the following areas: (i) “fit and proper” criteria for bank owners;
(ii) on-site inspections; (iii) lending to related parties; (iv) legal protection for BRSA
and SDIF board members and staff for actions taken in good faith during the course
of their duties; and (v) delineating the responsibilities of BRSA and SDIF
respectively and providing for their effective coordination. By end-September, 2004,
we will conduct seminars for the banking community and other stakeholders to help
contribute to the understanding of the new law's principal objectives and features. We
will submit the draft law to Parliament by end-September 2004. We expect

- 47 -

Parliament to pass the Law on Credit Institutions with the features above by endNovember 2004 (new structural performance criterion). We are committed to
maintain the operational and financial independence of the BRSA and the SDIF in the
new banking act and other relevant legislation.
•

Regulation and supervision of non-bank financial institutions will be transferred
from the Treasury to the BRSA by January 1, 2005.

•

The Imar bank inquiry is underway. The commission was appointed in late April
and is expected to present its findings to the government in a final report, to be made
public by end-August 2004 (performance criterion).

•

We have reassessed the value of SDIF asset holdings to foster a better understanding
of the recovery rates that might be expected from asset sales. To this end, for each
intervened bank the SDIF will, in mid-July, announce the value of assets taken over at
the time of intervention, accrued interest based on market rates as of end-June 2004,
estimated market values (or recovery rates), and the costs borne by SDIF for
restructuring or liquidating banks.

•

Our new strategy for SDIF asset resolution has been announced (structural
benchmark for April 2004). The main features are: (i) at end-May 2004, an offer was
made to all borrowers except bank owners and individual borrowers to repay all
outstanding debt by July 15 with a discount of 50 percent applied to principal and
discounted interest, or to pay a 20 percent down payment with a discount of 30
percent on the remaining balances paid in installments over a 24-month period; (ii) in
mid-July will re-launch the auction that was cancelled in December with bids to be
submitted by August 16 and the winning bid to be selected by end-August (new
structural benchmark); (iii) thereafter, new portfolios will be put up for sale by
auction periodically until all assets have been disposed; (iv) for assets sold
individually SDIF will always obtain a third party opinion about the price; and (v) all
asset sales will be conducted transparently ensuring a fair and equal process.

•

Our plan for the resolution of Treasury receivables from the SDIF arising from
financing the restructuring of the banking system by end-2004 is on track.

•

The blanket guarantee was lifted on July 5, 2004 and replaced with a limited deposit
protection scheme protecting savings deposits up to TL 50 billion. Before the
replacement, the BRSA undertook a thorough assessment of banking system
soundness (April structural benchmark). A brief summary of the assessment has been
published. In parallel, the CBT also assessed the effect of the abolition of the blanket
guarantee on the Turkish payments system.

•

The key elements of our new strategy for state banks will be announced shortly (a
June structural benchmark). Legislation for the integration of Pamukbank into
Halkbank is expected to be approved by Parliament shortly. All legal, managerial and

- 48 -

financial issues regarding the integration, will be completed by end-August 2004 (a
new structural benchmark). The integration is expected to be completed by endOctober 2004. Treasury will recapitalize Pamukbank and eliminate the negative net
worth before integrating Pamukbank and Halkbank. Over time, Treasury will also
replace Halkbank’s holding of non-marketable securities with securities issued on
market terms. The strategy for Ziraat bank has been developed and will be announced
by end-July. Our objective remains to privatize these banks as soon as the
restructuring is complete and when market conditions permit.
•

The due diligence for Vakifbank has been delayed. The terms of reference have
been finalized, the bank is in the process of hiring a consultant, and the due diligence
will be completed by end-September 2004 (new structural benchmark).

Private sector development
15.
As a follow up to the Investment Advisory Council (IAC) meeting in March, we
have prepared draft legislation to streamline permission and approval procedures for
investors. Moreover, we revised the draft law on establishing an Investment Promotion
Agency and reflected the views of the various stakeholders. Our work also extends to the
effective protection of intellectual property rights enforced by new legislation. We will
submit a progress report to the Prime Minister and IAC members by October 2004.
16.
Our privatization program is delivering good results and we have made progress
on some legal and procedural issues. In the first quarter, cash receipts from privatization
reached U.S.$311 million, exceeding the indicative benchmark. We have amended public
procurement legislation to simplify the hiring of advisors, and are preparing legislative
amendments to facilitate sales of minority holdings.
17.
Due to a legal ruling halting the sale of TÜPRAŞ we may fall short of our annual
privatization receipts target of U.S.$3 billion, though we are determined to maintain forward
momentum. To this end, a law enabling the sale of more than 45 percent share of Türk
Telekom to foreigners is approved and we expect to launch the tender process before the end
of the year. We are also planning public offerings for 10-15 percent shares of PETKIM
(petrochemicals) and Turkish Airlines. Privatization of the National Lottery is pending
parliamentary approval of the legal framework, and then we will proceed to a request for
proposals.
Very truly yours,

Financial market sentiment has
steadily improved. After depreciating by 15
percent against the U.S. dollar in April and
early-May, the Turkish lira has since re-gained
some ground. The benchmark bond rate has
fallen to 26 percent, after having risen to 30
percent in May, while Eurobond spreads have
again fallen to about 400 basis points.

2.
First-quarter national accounts data released in end-June confirm that output
has continued to grow strongly:
•

Real GDP increased by 10.1 percent year on year, and real GNP by 12.4 percent.
Although agricultural output again declined, strong activity in manufacturing, and in
domestic wholesale and retail trade contributed to the high overall output growth
(Table 1). Construction experienced positive growth for the second quarter in a row,
following eleven quarters of decline. In seasonally adjusted terms, GDP grew by
1.4 percent quarter on quarter (close to 6 percent annualized), similar to the last
quarter of 2003, though seasonal factors are quite volatile.

Private sector demand continues to drive growth. Private (fixed) investment
increased by more than 60 percent year on year, and private consumption by more
than 10 percent. After declining steadily in 2003, government consumption increased
by 2.4 percent. In the data, inventory accumulation continues to make a significant
contribution to growth. However, this likely reflects either an over-estimation of GDP
from the production side or an under-estimation of the expenditure components.

Contribution of Components to Growth of
Domestic Demand, Excluding Stockbuilding
(In percentage points)

Real sector indicators in the second quarter also remain strong. Industrial
production grew by 16.5 percent year on year in May, while capacity utilization
increased in June to more than 84 percent. Motor vehicle production remains strong,
rising more than 80 percent year on year in May, though the detailed June capacity

-4-

utilization figures have tentative signs that this may be slowing down. However,
output growth in lower value added sectors, such as textiles, has been weak.

The current account deficit in April
and May remained large. A surge in
import growth (mostly finished
consumption and investment goods), not
matched by growth in exports, widened
the current account deficit to US$8.8
billion in the first five months of 2004.

70
Import growth
(3-month M A, right scale)

The deficit has been financed by higher private capital inflows, albeit mostly
short-term. After an outflow of nearly US$½ billion in non-resident holdings of
equities and treasury bills in April (the first significant monthly outflow for over a
year), inflows returned in June. At the same time, domestic banks increased their
open foreign exchange position (excluding forwards) during June by about
US$1.5 billion.

4.
Although the authorities have not yet revised their official projections, the data
suggest that both output growth and the current account deficit are likely to be higher
than projected. Given positive carry-over from the last quarter of 2003, rapid growth in the
first quarter of 2004, and demand and output indicators pointing to a strong second quarter,
the 5 percent annual target for 2004 is likely to be exceeded by at least 1-2 percentage points.
At the same time, current staff estimates suggest that the external current account deficit will
also increase to at least US$11 billion, or around 4 percent of GNP (about ½ percentage point
higher than in the staff report).
5.
June inflation data are consistent with achieving the 12 percent annual target. In
June consumer prices fell by 0.1 percent month on month, wholesale prices by 1.0 percent,
both well below market expectations. Annual consumer price inflation remained at 8.9
percent, as in May, while wholesale price inflation rose slightly to 10.5 percent. While the
latest increase in petroleum prices has yet to feed through, the low June figures together with
the recent stability of the exchange rate suggest that the end-year target is likely to be met.
This is borne out by the latest CBT survey of market expectations, which projects end-year
inflation of 10.9 percent.
6.
Although the primary surplus in June was slightly below program, the
consolidated budget for the first half of 2004 continued to overperform. Although strong
domestic demand meant that direct tax and VAT revenues remained strong in June, spending
on investment and current transfers was higher than expected. Also, delays in adjusting
petroleum excises in the first half of the year have cost 0.2 percent of GNP. Despite some

-5-

slight weakening in June, the budget still seems well on track. In the first six months, the
cumulative primary surplus of the consolidated budget reached TL 13.3 quadrillion (an
overperformance of TL 1.8 quadrillion (0.4 percent of GNP)), more than 60 percent of the
annual target.

The High Planning Council approved the 2005 budget call. Main macroeconomic
parameters for preparation of the 2005 budget include: 5 percent real GNP growth, 8 percent
year-end inflation, 10.1 percent GNP deflator, and an average dollar exchange rate of TL
1.67 million. The budget call does not specify any target for the primary surplus, but it does
set ceilings on certain expenditure categories, and would imply a decline in primary spending
of 0.5 percent of GNP. Key categories such as personnel and purchase of goods and services
are assumed to rise with end-year inflation (but below average inflation). Investment
spending is projected to increase, but only modestly.
8.
Banking sector developments have been mixed. The Cukurova Group (the former
owners of Yapi Kredi and Pamuk banks) reached agreement in principle with the BRSA and
SDIF that would reduce its payments from US$6.2 billion over 15 years to US$4 billion over
less than 2 years. Yapi Kredi’s balance sheet will be further strengthened by the Group’s
purchase of US$1 billion in non-core assets. Although the full details (including the
safeguards in case of non-compliance) are not yet known, market reaction has been positive.
However, negotiations on the sale of a majority stake in Garanti bank to Banca Intesa have
failed, a set-back to foreign involvement and restructuring of the banking system. The
authorities passed legislation to allow the merger of Halk and Pamuk banks; they are
expected to announce further details of their new state bank strategy shortly.
9.
Since completion of the review discussions, the authorities have passed new EU
reform legislation. The 9th EU harmonization package was passed by Parliament on July 14.
This removes the death penalty from the penal law and eliminates the seat reserved for the
military on the higher education, radio/television, and communications boards.

10.
The prior action on write-over of TL 1.2 quadrillion of special revenues to the
budget was met by July 14, not by end-June as indicated in the Letter of Intent. The
authorities informed staff and management that while the official circular instructing the
write-over was issued by end-June, the associated transactions were only completed by
July 14.
11.

With regard to progress in other areas of structural reform:

•

The law integrating 15 extra budgetary funds into the central government budget was
passed by Parliament on July 14. This law abolishes off-budget special revenues and
expenditures and fully incorporates them into the budget so that formal write-over
would no longer be necessary.

•

To reduce further financial intermediation costs, a Cabinet decision abolishing the 3
percent Resource Utilization Support Fund (RUSF) levy on all commercial
transaction is expected to be approved this week.

•

The Imar Commission has submitted its preliminary report to the authorities and
appears on course to complete its work by end-August

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with Turkey
On July 30, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Turkey.1
Background
After the collapse of the 2000 exchange rate-based disinflation program and the floating of the
lira in February 2001, the banking system experienced heavy losses, inflation soared and the
economy contracted by nearly 10 percent. Public debt climbed to over 90 percent of GNP in
2001, partly owing to the costs of bank restructuring.
Since then, strong fiscal consolidation and disinflation efforts have laid the basis for a rapid
and powerful recovery. High primary surpluses, reaching more than 6 percent in 2003,
contributed to bringing public debt on a sustainable and declining path. The debt-to-GNP ratio
declined to 70 percent in 2003 and the market risk premium on Turkish debt fell significantly.
The adherence to a strict monetary program under the floating exchange rate regime helped
establish the Central Bank’s credibility and facilitate a dramatic decline in real interest rates as
confidence recovered. In this environment, real GDP grew by close to 8 percent in 2002 and
6 percent in 2003, and it is projected to grow by at least 5 percent in 2004. At the same time,
inflation has fallen to its lowest levels in decades, and is on track to reach its annual target of
12 percent in 2004.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities, and this PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board.

-2These favorable developments notwithstanding, the Turkish economy faces a number of risks.
Domestic demand has started to increase rapidly, and the current account deficit is widening
as a result. The high size of the government debt, its short maturity, and its currency
composition is also a major source of vulnerability.
For the medium term, the authorities’ main challenge is to implement policies that achieve the
goals of sustained growth and low inflation. With its commanding majority in Parliament and
with new elections not needed for another three years, the government has an unprecedented
opportunity to implement the difficult structural reforms needed to achieve this.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the opportunity to take stock of what had been achieved over
the last few years and to gauge Turkey’s challenges and reform priorities ahead.
Directors commended the authorities for the impressive economic performance, with
macroeconomic conditions at their best in decades. They were particularly pleased to note that
the authorities’ strategy of disinflation and rapid debt reduction is delivering striking results.
Growth has been sustained and rapid, while inflation has been lowered dramatically to single
digits. Large primary surpluses have helped reduce government debt ratios and improved
market confidence, leading to a significant reduction in real interest rates, an end to decades
of continuous exchange rate depreciation, and a markedly improved resilience to shocks.
Despite these considerable achievements, Directors noted that vulnerabilities remain. The size
of the public debt, its short maturity and large foreign currency component make Turkey
vulnerable to exchange rate and interest rate shocks. In addition, the quality of fiscal
adjustment needs to be improved and the pace of structural reform intensified, if the
achievements to date were to be sustained and be carried forward in the form of robust
medium-term growth.
With regard to short-run challenges, Directors noted that domestic demand growth is
exceptionally strong, contributing to the widening of the current account deficit, and they
commended the authorities for their efforts to dampen domestic demand. Fiscal policy had
been kept tight, with the primary surplus targets exceeded, tax incentives for certain consumer
purchases had been reduced, and state banks had reined in their lending. Despite these
efforts, Directors saw the need to continue to monitor the rising current account deficit
carefully. Against this background, Directors urged the authorities to save this year’s fiscal
overperformance, at least until the outlook for the current account stabilizes, and to stand
ready to tighten fiscal policy further if domestic demand continues to be strong.
Directors regretted the repeated increases in minimum wages, but welcomed the authorities’
strong efforts in restraining government sector wages, which would help contain domestic
demand pressures.
Looking to medium-term prospects and policies, Directors emphasized that continued fiscal
consolidation would be central to maintaining Turkey’s impressive economic performance and
strengthening medium-term growth prospects. They noted that the success in fiscal
consolidation had resulted in a reduction in real interest rates and had boosted growth, while

-3providing the Central Bank of Turkey (CBT) greater freedom to gear its monetary policy to
reducing inflation. Against this background, Directors urged the authorities to resist calls to
relax next year’s primary surplus targets, as any benefits would likely be far outweighed, even
in the short run, by higher real interest rates, which will slow growth. Continued high primary
surpluses in a predictable medium-term framework would also help the authorities meet the
considerable public debt repayments coming due and help strengthen market confidence.
Directors stressed the importance of adopting high quality measures to help sustain this fiscal
consolidation. This should include reform of the social security system, which, despite high
contribution rates, remains in large deficit, and reform of tax administration to combat
widespread tax evasion. Further large increases in current spending should also be resisted;
this will also make room for increased public investment. Looking ahead, Directors saw scope
for a more fundamental tax reform aimed at simplifying the system and broadening the tax
base. To guide fiscal policy over the next few years and to help ensure debt sustainability,
Directors encouraged the authorities to cast their plans within a multi-year debt reduction plan.
Directors commended the CBT and the government on their success in reducing inflation to
single digits. The end-2004 inflation target of 12 percent is clearly achievable. The CBT’s
skilful use of monetary policy has been central to this achievement, supported by fiscal
discipline and public sector wage restraint. Directors noted the importance of preserving the
central bank’s independence for keeping inflation low, backed by continued supportive fiscal
and incomes policies. They also encouraged the CBT to enhance its monetary framework and
increase its transparency. As first steps, this could include giving the monetary policy council
more of a role in advising the Governor on interest rate decisions, and timing these decisions
to coincide with monetary policy council meetings.
Directors noted the many achievements that had been made in financial sector reform.
Creation of an independent Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA), tightening of
supervisory practices, recapitalization and restructuring of the state banks, and the triple audit
and recapitalization of the private banks had each made the banking system much stronger.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to implementing the considerable reform
agenda that still lies ahead, including accelerating recoveries from bad assets, privatizing the
state banks, lowering distortionary taxes on financial intermediation, and legal reform,
including passage of a new Banking Act.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to stimulating growth by improving the
investment climate, which would lead to more foreign direct investment inflows and boost jobs.
Creation of more stable macroeconomic and financial conditions had already brought large
benefits here, and would need to be sustained. Looking ahead, Directors urged the authorities
to quickly put in place the steps recommended by the inaugural Investment Advisory Council
meeting in mid-March 2004. Given that unemployment remains high, despite strong growth,
Directors encouraged the authorities to press ahead with labor market reforms.
Turkey faces a historic opportunity. Directors encouraged the authorities to seize this unique
opportunity to secure sustained growth and reduce vulnerabilities; press ahead with fiscal,
financial, and structural reforms; and thereby put Turkey firmly on an irreversible path toward
convergence with European economies.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Completes Eighth Review Under Stand-By Arrangement with Turkey and
Approves US$661 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the eighth
review of Turkey’s economic performance under the Stand-By Arrangement. The decision will
enable Turkey to draw an amount equivalent to SDR 454 million (about US$661 million) from
the IMF immediately, bringing total disbursements to an amount equivalent to SDR 11.9 billion
(US$17 billion) under the arrangement.
With this decision, the Executive Board also granted Turkey’s request to waive the nonobservance of an end-April performance criterion in regard to a small deviation from the target
for base money.
Turkey's Stand-By Arrangement was approved on February 4, 2002 (see Press Release No. 02/7)
for a total amount of SDR 12.8 billion (about US$19 billion).
Following the Executive Board discussion, Rodrigo de Rato, Managing Director and Chair, said:
“Turkey’s economic performance continues to be impressive. Growth has been sustained and
rapid, and is likely to exceed this year’s 5 percent target. Inflation has been lowered dramatically
to single digits and the 12 percent end-year target is clearly achievable. The government’s record
of strict fiscal discipline, including taking remedial actions where necessary, has been
instrumental to this success. Together with the Central Bank of Turkey’s commendable conduct
of monetary policy, fiscal discipline has contributed to the success in reducing inflation and laid
the basis for strong and sustained growth.
“The immediate macroeconomic challenge is to avoid a widening current account deficit. So far
the financing of the deficit has not been a problem. Indeed, the central bank has been able to
build reserves during the first half of the year. The authorities’ recent steps to curtail consumer
lending and reduce consumer spending, together with rebounding tourism revenues, should help
stabilize the current account deficit. However, strict fiscal discipline and saving any budget
overperformance, at least until the risks to the current account have been clarified, will remain
key to maintaining the success of the authorities’ macroeconomic program.

-2-

“The authorities’ structural reform agenda is critical for supporting their fiscal effort, sustaining
strong economic growth, boosting job creation, and underpinning the success of the program.
Notwithstanding some delays, the government’s efforts to improve tax administration and the
social security system are especially important in this respect. The planned integration of Pamuk
and Halk banks is welcome, as is the authorities’ announcement of their new strategy for the
state banks, and the Savings Deposit Insurance Fund’s (SDIF) strengthened commitment to
accelerating asset sales. Adoption of new banking legislation more closely in line with EU
standards will also be a key landmark. Looking ahead, the authorities need to regain momentum
in privatization and should implement policies needed to attract foreign direct investment,
building on the March inaugural Investment Advisory Council.
“The Turkish authorities have maintained their strong record of program implementation. They
have also demonstrated their commitment to ambitious structural reforms that will help underpin
fiscal consolidation and debt sustainability. The result has been strong growth, low inflation, and
steady reductions in the government debt ratio. These strong efforts deserve the continued
support of the international community,” Mr. de Rato said.

Statement by Willy Kiekens, Executive Director for Turkey
and Levent Veziroglu, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
July 30, 2004
Overview
Turkey has achieved encouraging results with its Fund-supported program of
stabilization and reform, and with its strategy to qualify for starting accession negotiations with
the European Union. Strengthened confidence in Turkey's political stability and continued
disciplined economic policies have helped lower the cost of credit and have stimulated
investment and growth.
The economy is quite buoyant. Capacity utilization rates, indicators of industrial and
agricultural production, and strong export and tourism revenues give reason to project output
growth in the range of 6 percent to 7 percent this year. The significant decline in inflation is a
great achievement that in no small measure results from strict fiscal policies and skillful
monetary management. Annual consumer and wholesale price inflation have now reached
8.9 percent and 10.5 percent, respectively. Turkey’s performance under the Stand-By
arrangement shows that tight fiscal discipline, disinflation and strong growth can be achieved
simultaneously.
The current account deficit is growing significantly. It reached USD 8.8 billion during
the first five months of this year, even though during that period there was a record inflow of
USD 3.6 billion tourism receipts, a 51percent increase over the same period last year.
Needless to say that the authorities are closely monitoring these developments. The behavior
of the exchange rate under the floating exchange rate regime should play a corrective role.
But if needed, measures to restrain consumer demand will be taken to avoid a widening of
the current account deficit beyond an amount that Turkey can safely finance.
Fiscal Stance and Structural Fiscal Policies
The buoyant economy and strict budget execution have yielded a favorable budget
outcome so far this year. During the first 5 months, the primary surplus exceeded the target by
0.75 percent of GDP.
The authorities recognize the need to improve the quality of fiscal adjustment, lest every
new budget requires taking significant corrective measures that are politically costly and an
administrative burden. Without structural fiscal reforms, sustaining the present fiscal stance
might prove difficult. The enactment of the Public Financial Management and Control Law and
the indirect tax reform were very important steps in this direction.
The authorities have now intensified their efforts in some major areas: reform of direct
taxation, administrative reform, and social security reform. The tax administration reform is
expected to be passed by parliament by end-October. The authorities are determined to address
the causes of the informal economy. One strategy is to widen the tax base, to increase tax
compliance and lower the tax rate. This should improve the business climate and raise revenues.
The Fund staff is actively discussing these tax issues with the authorities.

-2-

The authorities are also working on a comprehensive social security reform, which has
been a major source of the deficit in fiscal accounts. This reform includes institutional
arrangements, changes in the pension system to reduce the deficit in the medium term and
reform of the health insurance scheme. This reform package will be discussed by Parliament in
January 2005.
Monetary policy
The floating exchange rate regime has struck a good balance between reducing
inflation and preserving competitiveness. It creates more room for monetary policy to pursue
its inflation objective, and makes the economy less exposed to shocks. For low inflation to
last, fiscal discipline must be preserved and incomes policy should be consistent with
productivity growth.
The revised base money targets under the program will make it possible for the
Central Bank to accommodate the increased demand for currency, due to the declining
inflation and increasing real activity. The CBT will continue implementing its interest rate
policy in such a manner as to achieve and maintain low inflation, while taking into account the
external price changes, particularly high oil prices and the pass-through from currency
depreciation.
Banking Sector Reform
Bank regulation and supervision will be further improved to ensure that private banks
are solid and able to support growth in the economy. The authorities have prepared a draft
Credit Institutions Law and are now consulting the banking community. This draft deals with,
inter alia, bank licensing procedures, the monitoring of bank ownership, limiting connected
lending, and the organization of on site inspections. It also better delineates the responsibilities
of the Banking Regulatory and Supervisory Agency (BRSA) and the Savings Deposits
Insurance Fund (SDIF). This framework law is expected to be approved by Parliament by
November 2004. It will bring the Turkish banking sector more in line with EU standards.
The government has updated the restructuring strategy for the State Banks with the help
of international consultants. Pamukbank, which has been intervened, will be integrated in the
state-owned Halkbank. These two banks complement each other well, and the newly integrated
bank will eventually be privatized. The Parliament has recently approved the legislation to allow
this operation. At the same time, a detailed restructuring plan has also been formulated for the
other state-owned bank, the Ziraat Bank.
The blanket guarantee of bank liabilities has been recently removed and a new limited
guarantee scheme introduced. There have been no panic withdrawals or sudden changes in
the composition and distribution of savings. The new guarantee scheme will cover almost 60
percent of the savings deposits by value and 90 percent of accounts under TL 50 billion
(approximately USD 33.750). People have learned from experience that savings should not
be placed where extraordinarily high interest rates are offered. The BRSA will closely

-3monitor developments in the sector and take prompt action when needed. The State Banks
have addressed the private banking community’s concerns by reducing their deposit interest
rates below market average.
Recent court rulings declaring invalid earlier BRSA decisions to intervene Kentbank
and Demirbank are unfortunate for the banking reform efforts in Turkey. However, the
authorities are studying every legal option to contain the possible negative impact of these
decisions. The new Credit Institutions Law will address the loopholes in the legal framework
and strengthen the position of the independent supervisory agency.
The Savings and Deposits Insurance Fund (SDIF) has continued to implement its
strategy for the sale of its asset portfolio. Another auction was launched earlier this week and
will be finalized by end-August. Last week, the SDIF has published its updated valuation of
its assets.
Debt Management and Sustainability
Prudent public debt management contributes to improved borrowing conditions. As
rollover rates are declining during the remainder of the year, the Treasury will increase its cash
account at the CBT as market conditions allow. This strategy will help create room for
maneuver when market conditions are tight, as witnessed during market turbulence a few
months ago. The Treasury will coordinate its debt management with the CBT.
The staff's analysis of Turkey's debt sustainability shows that the public debt to GNP
ratio will continue to decline under the program's assumptions for GNP growth, real interest and
exchange rates, and primary fiscal surpluses. We know that the set of assumptions in the staff’s
baseline scenario is conservative. And indeed, almost all key economic indicators are
progressing better than expected, notably the growth rate which is a key determinant in this
calculation.
Future Relations with the Fund
The government is determined to continue its economic transformation strategy building
on the progress made so far. The authorities are in the process of formulating a new mediumterm economic program which could secure the necessary public support. The new program is
being designed with the aim of further reducing the debt to GNP ratio and borrowing costs,
while creating a favorable environment for private sector-led sustainable growth. Social policies
will be targeted to protect the most vulnerable segments of the society.
The new economic program will also contribute to Turkey’s pre accession program for
the European Union. The authorities are eager to continue their close and successful cooperation
with the Fund and are considering what format would be the best. The authorities have
announced that their decisions will be taken by September.
The authorities are well aware of the need to reduce the Fund’s exposure to Turkey. At
the same time, continued financial support from the Fund could strengthen the robustness of
access to the financial markets and lower the cost of borrowing.

-4Transparency and Data Issues
The authorities regret that it was not possible to publish the sixth review staff report,
which they believe contains highly market sensitive information and assessments, especially
regarding the financial sector. However, the Staff Report on the seventh review has been
published and the authorities intend to agree with the publication of the Article IV
consultation and eighth review staff reports and the background papers in accordance with
the Fund’s publication rules.
