Executive Summary
Background
•

Macroeconomic performance was positive in 2007 with strong growth and low
inflation, reflecting reasonably prudent policies and high world prices for key
mineral exports. Still, the country remains poor with significant underlying
vulnerabilities, and risks to the outlook have increased.

•

Temporarily large mineral revenue inflows have intensified spending pressures and
the 2008 budget includes large expenditure increases. These could result in increased
inflationary pressures and waste in the near term, given the absence of
implementation and absorptive capacity, and the need for considerable fiscal
consolidation as mineral revenue inflows ease over the medium term.

•

The structural reform agenda to improve the investment climate has seen little
progress. The recent economic performance is an improvement relative to the recent
past, however, the growth performance gap relative to peers continues to grow.

Policy recommendations
•

The staff and authorities agree that budget expenditure should be managed carefully
to contain inflationary pressures and meet critical development needs. This would
involve shifting spending toward investment and other priority areas that will aid
economic growth, improving public financial management, and further reducing debt
as a form of saving the temporarily large mineral revenue inflows.

•

The monetary stance remains appropriate for now, with the central bank successfully
keeping inflation under control. However, the authorities reconfirmed they stand
ready to tighten if the expected looser fiscal policy stokes inflationary pressures.

•

The current exchange rate level is not out of line with fundamentals. The managed
float exchange rate policy, allowing some reserve build up while protecting
competitiveness, remains generally appropriate given the expected near-term decline
in mineral revenue inflows. However, in the staff’s view, additional flexibility would
be needed in the face of sustained pressures.

•

The government is urged to accelerate progress on structural reform, without which
the outlook for more rapid nonmineral sector growth, job creation, and poverty
alleviation is dim.

5
I. INTRODUCTION
A. Background
1.
Papua New Guinea’s economic performance has strengthened since the last
Article IV consultation. Supported by a combination of prudent fiscal and monetary policies
and high global prices for key mineral export commodities, growth has accelerated over the
past five years with increasing momentum from the nonmineral sector since the recession
ended in 2003. Inflation has remained in the low single digits, and international reserves are
at a record high.
2.
Still, the country remains poor with significant underlying vulnerabilities. There
has been little improvement in development indicators (Figure 1), and urban unemployment
is estimated at around 40 percent. The economy is exposed to commodity price shocks, and
mineral production is expected to decline over the medium to longer term (Box 1). An
unattractive investment environment, including

comparator countries over time.
3.
The political environment has stabilized. Prime Minister Somare has returned for
an unprecedented second-consecutive term following the mid-2007 parliamentary elections.
After several years of inactivity following differences of opinion with the authorities on
forestry sector governance, the World Bank has recently re-engaged with new project
lending.
B. The Current Economic Setting
4.

The near-term macroeconomic prospects are positive (Figure 2 and Table 1).

•

Buoyant growth of over 6 percent is estimated for 2007, based on robust mineral
and nonmineral growth. The pickup reflects the combination of several one-off
factors, including a strong rebound in mineral and agriculture production following

Box 2. Is Papua New Guinea’s Nonmineral Sector Competitive? (Concluded)
Papua New Guinea maintains one of the least restrictive trade regimes in the region. However,
domestic structural rigidities, including weak and costly basic utilities and poor transportation,
communication, and electric power infrastructure, low skills and literacy, high crime, and weak
governance continue to hamper competitiveness and growth, particularly of the core nonmineral
sector.

The World Bank Country Policy and Institutional Assessment rates eligible countries against 16 criteria grouped in four clusters: (a) economic
management; (b) structural policies; (c) policies for social inclusion and equity; and (d) public sector management and institutions. Scores range from 1-6,
with higher scores reflecting better performance. Other indicators range between ±2.5, with higher positive outcomes reflecting better outcomes. See
www.worldbank.org. 2/ Coverage varies depending on data availability.

Although Papua New Guinea’s ranking in the World Bank’s ease-of-doing business database
compares relatively favorably with others in the region, enforcing contracts, dealing with licenses, and
getting credit are relatively more cumbersome.

•

Annual average CPI inflation is estimated at under 2 percent in 2007.

•

Positive debt dynamics and some repayment lowered the public debt-to-GDP
ratio to about 35 percent at end-2007, down sharply from a peak of 77 percent in
2002 (Figure 3 and Table 2).

•

Large foreign exchange inflows related to buoyant mineral exports boosted
official reserves to over $2 billion at end-2007, equivalent to about 5 months of
goods and services imports, and kept the current account balance in surplus (Figure 4
and Table 3).

•

Monetary aggregates continue to grow rapidly, although at a decelerated pace
(Figure 5 and Table 4). Low inflation and real interest rates, and improved financial
intermediation have contributed to a decline in broad money velocity.

•

The kina continued to appreciate against the U.S. dollar, 7 percent over the year
to November. On a nominal and real effective basis, it depreciated by about 4 and 5
percent, respectively, over the year through September.

•

The financial sector appears sound, based on backward-looking indicators.
Reflecting the improved growth prospects and low interest rates, credit growth
continues to be strong, though decelerating (Figure 5 and Table 4). Financial sector
assets have grown to 71 percent of GDP at June 2007, from 45 percent at end-2003.

•

Reflecting the improved fiscal and external situation, Standard & Poor’s
upgraded Papua New Guinea’s credit rating to ‘B+’ on its foreign currency longterm debt and ‘BB-’ on its local currency rating (Table 6).

At the same time, policy challenges to improving and sustaining the recent
strong performance have intensified.
•

Annual average inflation is expected to trend upward toward the middle single
digits over 2008, with pass-through of rising petroleum prices, some kina
depreciation on an NEER basis, and higher demand pressure from increased budget
spending.

•

Overall fiscal surpluses will continue through 2007–08. High mineral revenue
inflows, combined with restraint of recurrent costs and implementation capacity
constraints, helped boost fiscal savings since 2002 relative to comparators. However,
the nonmineral deficit, measured on a cash basis, is now likely to further worsen as
mineral revenue eases and spending increases.

•

Progress on the structural reform agenda set out under the Medium-Term
Development Strategy (MTDS) has stalled over the past year, particularly with
respect to public sector reform.1

•

Constraints to private activity remain formidable, including unreliable services
from basic utilities, poor transportation infrastructure, high crime, low public sector
capacity to provide services, unclear licensing and regulation policies, weak human
capacity, delays in work-visas, and land tenure issues. For these reasons, foreign and
domestic investment outside of the enclave mineral sector is low.

•

As a result, competitiveness of the nonmineral sector has not improved over the
recent period, resulting in little or no increase in nonmineral export volumes
(Box 2). Agricultural exports, the largest share of nonmineral exports, were
additionally affected by bad weather in 2005–06.

No change in data quality. However, authorities are

C. Medium-Term Outlook: Prospects and Risks
6.
In the absence of a change to current policy trends, the staff and authorities
agreed that the outlook is for a return to moderate growth over the medium term, with
increased downside risks (Table 5).
•

The baseline projection expects growth to average about 3.5 percent over the
medium term, mainly reflecting the onset of production at new mines. Nonmineral
growth is expected to decelerate from current peaks to trend growth rates in the
absence of structural reform. Inflation should remain in the middle single digits.

•

This scenario assumes: (i) current fiscal policy continues to be implemented
relatively well, with higher but not excessive fiscal spending in the near term and

19
with the ability to ensure reasonable expenditure quality, (ii) monetary policy
continues to contain inflation, and (iii) limited structural reforms are undertaken.
•

Regarding external prospects, the medium-term outlook assumes that (i) mineral
exports and revenue inflows decline from their current peak, based on government
production estimates, (ii) the exchange rate continues to be managed flexibly, and
(iii) the external current account position deteriorates in line with the decline in
mineral exports and with no improvement in nonmineral exports in the absence of
reform to improve the investment climate.

•

However, significant macroeconomic and external vulnerabilities remain. In
particular, there is potential for higher unproductive fiscal spending to raise demand
pressures and spur inflation. Additional downside risks include a weaker global
economy leading to lower commodity prices, and no action or a reversal of progress
on the structural reform agenda, both of which would adversely affect growth and the
external accounts.2 Upside risks include global developments leading to sustained
higher commodity prices, further crowding-in of private activity from the increase in
public investment, and additional production from existing or new gas and mining
projects.3

•

The baseline nonmineral GDP growth rate needs to roughly double over a
sustained period to meet the objectives of reduced poverty, significant job
creation, and higher development. Given Papua New Guinea’s resources, these
higher growth rates could be realized if a fiscal-monetary policy mix is pursued that
maintains macroeconomic stability, mineral revenues are used productively, and
structural reforms are undertaken to remove rigidities constraining private activity so
that productivity and investment are raised and sustained.

7.
The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) suggests that Papua New Guinea’s public
debt burden faces a moderate risk of debt distress (Appendix I).4 External debt
sustainability is vulnerable to shocks that lower export growth below the baseline. The debt
outlook is sensitive to a number of risk factors, including an escalation in public spending,
declines in world mineral prices, and larger public sector borrowing—including by stateowned enterprises (SOEs). The authorities recognize these risks, and their debt strategy
continues to bar new net debt.
2

Mineral revenue is highly sensitive to changes in global prices: a 10 percent reduction in export prices reduces
mineral revenue by 0.5 percent of GDP annually.
3

A US$10 billion LNG project, with production expected in 2013, has completed pre-feasibility studies.

4

The DSA used the low-income country framework. The results were discussed with the World Bank.

20
II. POLICY ISSUES
8.
Against the background of temporarily high mineral revenue inflows and
increased downside risks, the discussion focused on the agreed need for a fiscal and
monetary policy mix that maintains macroeconomic stability. In particular, the
authorities were keen to ensure that the current large fiscal surpluses were managed well to
avoid inflationary pressures while still promoting growth. The monetary authorities
emphasized their continued commitment to keeping inflation under control, notwithstanding
expected additional price pressures. Given existing conditions, the staff and authorities
agreed on the continued appropriateness of the current exchange rate level and regime.
Against the background of the recent growth in the financial sector, the authorities further
maintained their commitment to continue strengthening its supervisory and regulatory
framework. The discussions also considered how structural reforms could capitalize on the
current favorable domestic and external conditions to improve prospects for sustained higher
nonmineral growth.
A. Fiscal Policy and Public Debt
9.
Elements of the recent budgets are welcome; however, aspects of the underlying
easing of the fiscal stance are a concern. The 2007 and 2008 budgets aimed to manage the
temporarily large inflows of mineral revenue through a combination of higher development
spending and debt repayment.
•

The one-off spending increases to meet priority infrastructure and social development
needs aligned with the MTDS are appropriate. In addition, the staff welcomed the
pre-payment of external debt and reduction in unfunded civil service pension
liabilities.5

•

However, staff cautioned about the potential scale of fiscal relaxation over the near
term. A large amount of additional mineral revenue set aside in 2008 and earlier
budgets is expected to be spent over 2008–12, which will result in the nonmineral
deficit rising from 4.7 percent of GDP in 2005 to 8 percent by 2009. Given absorptive
and implementation capacity constraints, the increased spending could add to
domestic demand and price pressure, and lead to waste.

•

A large amount of spending has been allocated to projects outside the MTDS, of
which the new spending directed to the provinces and districts raise particular

budgets.

21
concern, due to the lack of capacity to prioritize and deliver projects, weak financial
controls, and near absence of reporting in local governments.6
•

In addition, given the projected fall off in mineral revenue from 2008 onward, the
new expenditure pattern raises the prospect of need for considerable and sustained
fiscal consolidation over the medium term.

•

Consequently, the staff recommended containing the actual (cash) expenditure to
more sustainable and stable levels, while ensuring that windfall mineral revenue is
used for well-designed MTDS-prioritized development spending and debt reduction.

•

The authorities argued that high development needs and a legacy of under funding in
the rural areas had driven the plans to increase spending for infrastructure in the
provinces and districts. At the same time, they acknowledged the concerns raised and
emphasized the intention to introduce new procedures that would improve oversight
and strengthen subnational government capacity. As a result, the increase in spending
to these areas would likely be phased over several years.

10.
A new proposal to update the Medium-Term Fiscal Strategy (MTFS)
appropriately emphasizes a stable and sustainable nonmineral fiscal balance (Box 3).
The proposal builds on the existing strategy of overall budget balance and no new net debt
accumulation by recommending using only “normal” mineral revenue for ongoing spending
programs. Additional mineral revenue would be used for either public investment or debt
reduction. The staff encouraged the authorities to formally approve this proposal to replace
the current policy under the existing MTFS. It particularly welcomed the new emphasis on
the nonmineral balance, as well as the need to ensure that actual (cash) spending is evenly
spent over time, given absorptive and administrative capacity constraints. Staff noted,
however, that implementation would require also investment prioritization and an
improvement in financial management.
11.
The staff welcomed the recent impressive improvement in public debt levels, but
noted it could be quickly reversed. A large proportion of the debt reduction has occurred
due to positive debt dynamics (real GDP growth, the impact of the rise in mineral prices on
the GDP deflator, and kina appreciation) as opposed to discrete policy decisions.

6

The FY07–08 budgets set aside a cumulative total of about 4.5 percent of GDP for districts and provinces.

22

Box 3. A Proposed New Medium-Term Fiscal Strategy
The Treasury has proposed to the cabinet a new Medium Term Fiscal Strategy (MTFS)
covering 2008–12, that would update the expiring version for 2002–07. This new strategy
has not yet been considered or approved by the cabinet or parliament and is thus not current
policy. The proposal seeks to address some of the issues that arise from the government’s
reliance on volatile mineral revenues more directly than the current MTFS policy which
focuses on a fiscal target of overall balance.
A new fiscal target: Using backward and forward-looking indicators, the proposal identifies
a “normal component” of mining and petroleum revenue prudently expected over the long
term of 4 percent of GDP. Ongoing spending,

spending cuts or temporary deficits incurred
in case of a mineral revenue shortfall. Additional mineral revenue, i.e., that above 4 percent
of GDP, would be spent as described below.
Expenditure smoothing: The proposed MTFS suggests that spending the additional mineral
revenue should be: (i) used to benefit future generations either through investment or debt
reduction; (ii) phased over a number of years to avoid disruptive fluctuations in domestic or
import demand; and (iii) carefully designed and implemented to ensure positive net benefit
and reflect limited implementation capacity.
Public investment and debt prepayment: The proposed MTFS additionally suggests that
roughly 60 percent of additional mineral revenue be used for public investment and 40
percent for debt prepayment. Prepaying debt and other fiscal liabilities is viewed as prudent
way of creating fiscal space to address upcoming challenges, notably from the winding down
of major resource projects within the decade, the AIDS epidemic, and the costs from natural
disasters and climate change. Debt prepayment would be reduced, rather than investment,
should expected additional revenue not materialize.

23

•

Staff cautioned that proposals to increase public borrowing to fund large-scale
investment projects were a concern without a prioritized, costed, and publiclyconsulted assessment of investment needs aligned to the MTDS. In addition, staff
noted that the assessment of a moderate risk of debt distress under the DSA is based
on a continuation of the government’s “no new net debt” policy. Finally, the absence
of reforms to address continued poor management in the SOEs cast doubt on the
efficiency of additional investment in that sector.

•

The authorities agreed with the need to proceed cautiously with the contracting of
additional debt, particularly given the progress made in reducing exposure to external
debt and lengthening the maturity structure. They observed that the improvement to
date reflects the government’s strategy to reduce debt as a form of saving, to create
additional fiscal space, and to reduce fiscal risks. They also acknowledged the
potential concentration of risks associated with further equity investment in the
volatile mineral sector. Finally, the authorities highlighted their long-standing policy
under the medium-term debt strategy of contracting external debt only on
concessional terms.

12.
The resumption of public sector reform plans is urgently needed to help improve
implementation capacity, and strengthen monitoring, accountability, and transparency.
Plans to strengthen financial management and streamline public sector employment (under
the “right-sizing” initiative) appear stalled. The increased use of trust funds is also a concern,
given past experience with abuse.7 The authorities were in full agreement with the need for
reform. They pointed to government-wide plans to strengthen financial management,
including tightening expenditure controls and removing dormant trust funds, while
increasing accountability on remaining trust funds considered necessary to smooth spending
from the mineral revenue over the medium term. In addition, discussions had begun to map
the way forward for the multi-donor financial management reform program.
13.
The staff welcomed new measures to control tax concessions. The use of special
arrangements for individual projects had resulted in a growing list of ad hoc tax concessions
that could undermine the tax base. As a result, a high level committee was recently created to
review requests with respect to their economic benefits and ensure consistency with tax laws.
In addition, the government agreed to consider a review of the tax system that would, among
other things, ensure fair treatment across sectors and a fair share of mineral sector profits for
the government.

Government trust fund balances are estimated at 10.5 percent of GDP for end-2007, including 2.7 percent of
GDP for participation in a gas project.

B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
14.
The staff views the monetary stance as appropriate for now, given the Bank of
Papua New Guinea (BPNG)’s ability to contain inflation to date. To limit the
expansionary consequences of the large but temporary foreign exchange inflows, the BPNG
has sterilized inflows through open market

•

Although CPI data indicate inflation remains low, the additional fiscal stimulus, some
recent NEER depreciation, and pass through of higher oil prices, are contributing to
rising underlying inflationary pressure.8 In addition, monetary and credit aggregate
growth rates are still rapid, though no longer accelerating, and liquidity in the
banking system remains high. As a result, the expectation of a need for tightening has
increased in recent months.

•

The central bank agreed with this analysis, and reconfirmed its commitment to tighten
the monetary stance if necessary. They noted that experience and recent studies
indicate that tightening through open market operations and upward changes in the
policy rate would have a rapid impact on restraining inflation.9 Given weaknesses in
the CPI data, the BPNG was also developing alternative information sources,
including a survey of business inflation expectations to complement its own retail
price index and improve responsiveness to potential changes in macroeconomic
conditions.

16.
The staff continues to support the current exchange rate policy. The kina trades
in a thin market characterized by volatile mineral-related foreign exchange flows. Under its
managed float exchange rate regime, the BPNG has been leaning against the wind to prevent
too rapid exchange rate appreciation against the U.S. dollar.

See Selected Issues chapter “The Monetary Transmission Mechanism in Papua New Guinea.”

25
•

The rate of appreciation against the U.S. dollar has increased over the past year
reflecting rising upward pressure. Associated intervention during this period eased
relative to past years.

•

At the same time, the BPNG has been balancing concerns regarding the potential
inflationary impact of nominal depreciation on a trade-weighted basis that occurred
early in 2007, most of which has been since unwound. The staff welcomed this shift
of attention toward the nominal effective exchange rate.

•

While the authorities have also used this opportunity to build reserves, with mineral
revenue inflows currently expected to peak in 2007, foreign exchange reserves should
level off at about 5 months of imports of goods and services—which is still low
relative to peer resource-rich countries (although a record level for Papua New
Guinea).

•

Staff analysis suggests that the current level of the exchange rate is broadly in line
with macroeconomic fundamentals (Box 4)—notwithstanding the improved terms of
trade—and the expectation of no improvement in nonmineral sector competitiveness
over the medium term in the absence of progress on structural reform (Box 2).10

•

In the staff’s view, this broad approach on exchange rate policy is appropriate as the
temporary nature of current mineral revenue inflows suggests that permanent real
exchange rate appreciation is not needed. However, the exchange rate should be
allowed to move flexibly as needed should upward pressure be sustained or
downward pressure unexpectedly materialize.
C. Financial Sector

17.
The financial sector appears sound, a key positive factor given the importance of
financial intermediation for future growth (Figure 5).

Backward-looking financial sector indicators remain strong relative to other countries
that have experienced rapid credit growth. Stress tests show that the banking
system is

Box 4. An Assessment of the Exchange Rate Level
Analyses of the real exchange rate indicate that the current level of the kina exchange rate is broadly
in line with fundamentals:
The behavioral equilibrium exchange rate (BEER) approach shows the kina has been slightly
undervalued compared to its long-run equilibrium REER since the move to a floating exchange
rate regime in 1994. The deviation for 2Q–2007 remains small (about 2 percent using both
Hodrick-Prescott and Christiano-Fitzerald filtering methods to derive the EREER, Figure 1).

•

The macroeconomic balance (MB) approach suggests that only a marginal REER appreciation
(by about 0.4 percent) is needed to close the gap between the current account norm (1.8 percent
of nominal GDP), and the underlying current account balance—the projection for 2012 (-3.3
percent of nominal GDP). The norm is the equilibrium current account consistent with
fundamentals, including the saving rate, net foreign assets, fiscal balances, income and real
interest rates relative to the major trading partner, and mineral exports.

•

The purchasing power parity (PPP) indicates that the real exchange rate of the kina is 9.7 percent
lower than its “long-run level.” However, the deviation is relatively small compared to other
countries (Figure 2).

resilient to moderate shocks to the credit portfolio that may arise from falling

•

Nevertheless, continued rapid credit growth raises concern about a potential
deterioration in banks' loan portfolios, which may only manifest itself with a lag. For
that reason, the staff welcomed efforts underway to strengthen bank regulation and
supervision and to form a credit registry.

•

Notwithstanding the rapid credit growth over the past two years, financial
intermediation still remains low relative to peers, pointing to the need to overcome
the underlying structural rigidities that are constraining development, including weak
enforcement of contracts and creditor rights.

The authorities agreed with these concerns, reaffirmed their commitment to continue
enhancing sector regulation and supervision, and expressed interest in a Financial
Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) to evaluate recent growth in the financial sector
and provide recommendations for deepening and strengthening the sector further.

18.
The staff raised concerns regarding the recently revived development bank,
while welcoming the intention to operate it without political interference.
•

Given the domestic and global experience, and the development bank’s continued
reliance on budget transfers for its capital base, concerns remain about the potential
for funds being directed to political interests, a weakening of credit culture, and
renewed fiscal liabilities, which would introduce risks for the financial sector.

•

The staff further urged that the bank not engage in expensive borrowing and that
expansion into microfinance comply with due diligence and commercial criteria.

28
D. Structural Reform
19.
Structural reforms faltered over the past year. The staff and the authorities agreed
that broader reforms are necessary to lift medium-term growth by boosting productivity, and
to strengthen international competitiveness and resilience to external shocks. The authorities
noted their intention to create the necessary environment conducive for private business, as
set out in the MTDS.
•

Immediate steps are needed to address the long-standing barriers to private activity
and investment in the nonmineral sector—the source of long-term growth and job
creation. The constraints include poor and costly transportation and public
communications and power infrastructure, weak governance, high crime and weak
prosecution, weak land tenure system, and poor education resulting in high illiteracy
and low skills.

•

The government’s willingness to consider private equity participation in SOEs would
be a welcome first step toward improving management, oversight, and provision of
basic services. The staff also encouraged completion of the needed regulatory
environment, and opening of the public enterprise sectors to competition. It noted the
demonstrated benefits of recent private participation in the telecommunications, air,
and financial sectors.

•

Publication of the completed 2004–06 audited central government accounts would be
a strong signal of the commitment to public sector transparency and accountability.
Additional resources are needed to extend the coverage of external audits to
subnational governments. The staff also urges swift implementation of the planned
internal management audit committees for government ministries.

20.
Both staff and the authorities agreed that intensive efforts to improve
macroeconomic statistics are needed to address shortcomings in the quality, coverage
and timeliness of macroeconomic data. Analysis of recent economic developments is
increasingly constrained by data weaknesses and utmost priority should be given to
mobilizing the needed expertise to improve statistics. The staff encourages rapid
implementation of steps needed to trigger implementation of the multi-donor technical
assistance plan as set out in the Aide Memoire of December 2007 STA mission.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
21.
Papua New Guinea’s economic performance remains positive, reflecting a
combination of prudent policies and favorable external factors in recent years. The
current economic conditions and political stability provide an ideal opportunity to push
ahead with the reforms set out in the MTDS to lift Papua New Guinea’s long-term economic

29
growth. Given Papua New Guinea’s resources, higher growth rates—which have been
achieved by its peers—could be realized if the appropriate fiscal-monetary policy mix
maintains macroeconomic stability, mineral revenues are used productively, and structural
reforms are undertaken to remove rigidities constraining private activity.
22.
Although macroeconomic fundamentals have improved, significant underlying
vulnerabilities remain. Growth has accelerated, inflation is low, and for the near-term,
external and fiscal vulnerabilities have declined. However, development indicators have
shown little improvement, and the economy remains highly sensitive to commodity price
shocks and dependent on mineral sector developments. An unattractive investment
environment discourages activity in the nonmineral sector, which must lead economic and
employment growth in the future.
23.
The potential fiscal stimulus resulting from increased spending under recent
budgets is a concern. Given absorptive and capacity constraints, it could add to domestic
demand and price pressures. In addition, higher expenditure should be aligned with the
MTDS, and with the capacity to implement and closely monitor spending—especially the
spending allocated to local governments.
24.
Other elements of recent budgets are appropriate. These include the one-off
spending increases to meet priority infrastructure and social development needs aligned with
the MTDS, and the prepayment of public debt.
25.
Proposals for a new medium-term fiscal strategy that focuses on a stable and
sustainable underlying nonmineral deficit are welcomed. The new strategy’s approval is
encouraged as it would represent an effective extension of the recent prudent fiscal policies
followed by the government, particularly if supported by prioritization and financial
management improvements. Preserving the integrity of the nonmineral tax base, including
limiting exemptions, is also key to ensuring long-term fiscal sustainability and reducing
exposure to volatile mineral resources.
26.
Continuation of the government’s strategy to reduce debt as a form of saving is
urged, as a means to create additional fiscal space and reduce risks. Complementary
measures include avoiding the contracting of new external debt on commercial terms, and
recognizing the concentration of risks associated with further equity investment in the
volatile mineral sector. Recent improvements in public debt levels could be quickly reversed
with rapid new borrowing—including by the SOEs—and a change in debt dynamics.
27.
The resumption of public sector reform is urgently needed to help improve
implementation capacity, and strengthen financial management and transparency.
Steps should be taken to resume the right-sizing initiative, follow through with the public
expenditure reform plans supported by a multi-donor effort, expand public sector audits, and
publish central government audited accounts on a timely basis.

30
28.
The monetary stance is appropriate. The central bank has successfully managed to
keep inflation within the low single digits. However, with pressures on prices building,
including with the additional fiscal stimulus, the authorities should stand ready to tighten as
needed.
29.
The level of the exchange rate is broadly in line with macroeconomic
fundamentals. Analyses of the exchange rate indicates that the kina is now close to its
equilibrium level. The managed float exchange rate policy, which allows some reserve build
up while protecting competitiveness, remains generally appropriate given the expected nearterm decline in mineral revenue inflows. However, should sustained pressures emerge,
additional flexibility should be shown.
30.
Reforms to improve and deepen financial intermediation are rightfully high on
the authorities’ agenda, given its importance for growth. Weaknesses in the underlying
institutional environment need to be addressed, including weak enforcement of creditor
rights and contracts.
31.
Broader structural reforms are necessary to raise growth and to strengthen
export competitiveness and resilience to external shocks. The recent experience of private
competition with state monopolies has had an important impact on growth and shows the
benefits of such approaches.
32.
Although data provision is generally adequate for surveillance purposes,
significant weaknesses in the quality and timeliness of statistics hamper monitoring of
macroeconomic developments. The authorities should accelerate their efforts to strengthen
the statistical framework, in line with STA mission recommendations.
33.
The staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

1/ Includes the November 2007 Supplementary budget.
2/ Since 2005, this includes transfers to Bougainville.
3/ The 2005-08 government budgets classify earmarked funds that are transferred to government trust funds as expenditure. Under the staff's cash presentation, these
funds are reclassified on a cash accounting basis (consistent with Government Finance Statistics), and expenditure is counted as occuring
only when money is disbursed from the trust funds.
4/ In 2006 and 2007, includes budget expenditure for all loan prepayments.

APPENDIX I. PAPUA NEW GUINEA: PUBLIC AND EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY12
This supplement summarizes the debt sustainability analysis (DSA) for Papua New Guinea
using the framework for low-income countries. The baseline macroeconomic scenario
underlying this DSA is the medium-term outlook discussed in the staff report. This
supplement also assesses the impact of various exogenous shocks on the sustainability of
public sector debt and external debt under the baseline scenario.
A. Main Assumptions
•

Real GDP growth is projected to grow at about 4 percent in 2008–2012 with
moderate growth in the nonmineral sectors, including the agricultural sector, and
several mining projects coming on stream. The latter will offset a steady decline in
petroleum production.

•

Monetary policy continues to be geared toward achieving low inflation and
smoothing exchange rate volatility.

•

Fiscal policy, as measured by actual spending and the nonmineral balance, is
expected to improve gradually after 2009. Overall fiscal surpluses are expected to
decline due to falling mineral revenues and spending of preceding years’ mineral
windfall revenues (having been temporarily saved in trust funds).

•

Consistent with the medium-term debt strategy, debt levels continue to be lowered, to
a sustainable level, and financial risks reduced, e.g., by reducing the exposure to
foreign debt and lengthening the maturity of domestic bonds.

•

Prices of key commodities are in line with assumptions.

•

Structural reforms outlined under the authorities’ Medium-Term Development
Strategy, particularly those on public sector reform, are delayed or implemented at a
slow pace.

•

Real GDP growth is expected to average 2.6 percent in the long-term. This outcome
envisages a return to the long-run average growth rate. It is predicated on the gradual
implementation of structural reforms to enhance private sector activity, the
maintenance of a stable macroeconomic environment and ongoing slow

12

As Papua New Guinea is an IBRD/IDA blend country, this DSA was prepared by Fund staff only under the
IMF-WB DSA framework for Low-Income Countries. See Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the Joint
Fund-Bank Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries
(http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/2007/eng/041607.pdf).

41
improvements in public infrastructure and services that should raise help
productivity. There is also upside potential from the development of new mineral and
gas projects.
B. Total Public Sector Debt Sustainability
The public sector debt ratio declined from 62 percent of GDP at end-2004 to an
estimated 34.5 percent of GDP at end-2007 (Table 1). This improvement reflects prudent
fiscal policy, favorable mineral sector developments (in particular, strong export prices in
recent years), kina appreciation, lower interest rates, and a sustained recovery since mid2002. Of total public debt, approximately 52 percent is external debt, of which 41 percent of
loans are in U.S. dollars. The maturity structure of public domestic debt has increased
significantly since 2003, when most debt was short-term; by end-2007 around 70 percent of
the debt stock was issued with maturities of 2–10 years. Multilateral debt (AsDB and World
Bank) accounts for about three-quarters of external debt. Japan is the main bilateral creditor.
Under the authorities’ Medium-Term Debt Strategy, foreign-currency loans are considered
only if they are concessional (with a grant element of at least 35 percent), and new loans
from the World Bank and AsDB will meet this criteria.
Under the baseline, the public sector debt ratio is projected to decline to 26.9 percent of
GDP by 2012 and 10.9 percent by 2027. The projected improvement stems mainly from the
expectation of a continued prudent fiscal policy, as set out in the MTFS (see Box 3), and
favorable debt dynamics. The NPV of public debt would decline from 39.2 percent of GDP
in 2006 to 34.6 percent of GDP in 2007, and continue to decline to 26.6 percent of GDP by
2012 and to 10.3 percent of GDP by 2027. The public debt service-to-revenue ratio fell
significantly between 2004-06, to a trough of 10.8 percent in 2006, due to increasing mineral
revenues. It is expected to rise somewhat during 2007–08, as the government uses some of its
‘mineral windfall’ to pre-pay external debt, and to fall gradually over the medium term.
The paths for the public debt ratios are particularly sensitive to changes in real GDP
growth (Table 2 and Figure 1). Compared to 2007, a sustained reduction in real GDP
growth, by one standard deviation below the baseline spread over the projection period,
would raise the NPV of public debt to GDP ratio by around 11 percentage points by 2017. A
shock to real GDP growth during 2008-09, of the historical average growth rate minus one
standard deviation, would result in a sustained increase in the NPV of public debt to GDP
ratio, rising to around 90 percent by 2027. A one-time 30 percent real exchange rate
depreciation in 2007 would raise the NPV of debt to GDP ratio by about 8 percentage points
over the medium term.
Fiscal sustainability is sensitive to developments in pension fund liabilities and
borrowing to fund large-scale investment projects, by the central government and stateowned enterprises (SOEs). Unfunded civil service pension liabilities are equivalent to about
11 percent of GDP. While the government will make partial repayments in 2007–08 and

42
from 2009 it should be fully funding its share of new pension contributions the balance, will
remain sizeable. Borrowing by SOEs is also reportedly significant and growing, although
information is limited. Among a number of proposed investments, the government is
considering borrowing to finance equity in the potentially large gas sector, which would
further concentrate risks associated with the volatile mineral sector. Better disclosure of such
information would greatly enhance the assessment of debt sustainability.
C. External Debt Sustainability
Papua New Guinea’s total external debt has declined from 55 percent of GDP in 2004 to
32.4 percent in 2007 (Table 3). External debt as a percent of exports is also estimated to
have declined significantly, from a peak of 127 percent in 2002 to 37 percent in 2007. Based
on available data, private external debt was estimated at 14.7 percent of GDP at end-2007.
Private external debt is expected to decline over the long term, as large mineral projects that
accounted for a high proportion of debt reach completion.
External public debt dynamics are sustainable under the baseline scenario. By 2006 all
five debt indicators—the NPV of public external debt in percent of GDP, exports, and
revenue, and the ratio of debt service to exports and revenue—were below the policy
dependent thresholds.13 All the indicators continue to improve over the medium and long
term period, with the exception of the ratio of the NPV of public external debt to government
revenue, which temporarily increases over the medium term as mineral revenues decline
(though it remains well below the threshold).
External debt sustainability is most vulnerable to shocks from lower export growth
(Table 4). A decline in export value growth in 2008–09, by one standard deviation below its
historical average, would raise the NPV of public external debt-to-GDP by over
20 percentage points over the medium term, and only fall below the 30 percent threshold in
2021. Similarly, the export shock would raise the NPV of external debt-to-exports and
external debt-to-revenue closer to (though still under) their thresholds for the first ten years,
before falling over the long term. While a combination of shocks would also push the
external debt-to-GDP ratio to just above the threshold over the medium term, neither of the
ratios for debt service approach their thresholds.
Papua New Guinea faces a moderate risk of debt distress under the IMF-WB DSA
framework for LICs. While the baseline scenario does not indicate a breach of any of the
13

Papua New Guinea is rated a weak performer for its policies and institutions for the purposes of the IMF-WB
LIC DSA framework. Consequently, applicable thresholds for external public debt are: (i) 100 percent for NPV
of external debt-to-exports, (ii) 30 percent for NPV of external debt-to-GDP, and (iii) 200 percent for NPV of
external debt-to-fiscal revenue; and for debt service: (i) 15 percent of exports and (ii) 25 percent of revenues.

43
thresholds, the NPV of external public debt to GDP ratio exceeds the threshold under the
stress test for lower export value growth (and approaches the threshold for two other
indicators).
D. Conclusions
While Papua New Guinea has made significant progress in reducing its public debt
burden, continued prudent management of debt over the medium-to-long term will be
required to mitigate the risks to public debt sustainability. While most indicators show
that the economy’s debt is manageable, Papua New Guinea still faces a moderate risk of debt
distress. The outlook is particularly sensitive to changes in real GDP and export growth,
highlighting the vulnerability of the debt dynamics to potential shocks and the need to avoid
policy slippages. Papua New Guinea could also further guard against these vulnerabilities by
ensuring that any external borrowing is obtained on concessional terms and by carefully
managing other fiscal liabilities, e.g., from pensions, state-owned enterprises or the
development bank. These recommendations are consistent with the current medium-term
debt strategy and the proposed MTFS (see Box 3).

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and r = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that NPV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the NPV of new debt).

APPENDIX II. PAPUA NEW GUINEA: SUMMARY OF ANNEXES
Fund Relations
Papua New Guinea joined the Fund in October 1975, and has no outstanding purchases or
loans. The last stand-by arrangement expired in September 2001. Papua New Guinea has a
managed floating exchange rate arrangement; the exchange rate of the kina is determined in
the interbank market in which authorized banks participate. The 2006 Article IV consultation
was concluded by the Executive Board on March 7, 2007 (IMF Country Report, No. 07/111).
Relations with the World Bank Group
Papua New Guinea has received 36 IBRD loans and 14 IDA credits amounting to
$787 million and $152 million, respectively. At present, there are two active loans, totaling
$63 million, of which a $25 million project is scheduled to close at end-2007, and one active
grant project. The new Country Assistance Strategy (approved in December 2007) envisions
up to three IDA credits per fiscal year totaling $45 million in FY2008 and $30–32 million
per fiscal year thereafter.14 The Bank is involved in public expenditure management,
infrastructure, health and education, and HIV/AIDS. The IFC has currently committed
$1.2 million and has entered into negotiations with Digicel PNG Ltd on a $40 million line of
credit.
Relations with PFTAC
Assistance to Papua New Guinea in recent years has been limited due to the presence of
extensive assistance under the Australian Enhanced Cooperation Program (ECP). In all, there
have been 24 missions, and Papua New Guinea has sent over 50 officials to the PFTAC’s
regional seminars, workshops, and training courses since 2000. PFTAC technical assistance
includes public financial management, tax administration and policy, financial sector
regulation and supervision, and economic and financial statistics.
Relations with the Asian Development Bank
Papua New Guinea has been approved 60 loans totaling $1,027 million for 47 projects and
$51.6 million for 133 technical assistance projects. Currently, there are 12 active loans
involving 9 projects (and one special fund grant-financed project). The AsDB strategy for
Papua New Guinea (approved in July 2006) and country operations business plan for 2008–
2010 (approved in August 2007) are in line with the government’s Medium-Term
14

PNG is formally a blend IBRD-IDA country. No immediate IBRD lending to PNG is envisioned.

52
Development Strategy, focusing on public finance management, private sector development,
transport sector, health and HIV/AIDS, and public enterprise reform. Total lending of
$262 million is expected for 2008–2010. The AsDB’s non-lending assistance program
envisages annual grant-financed technical assistance of about $2 million per year for 2008–
2010.
Statistical Issues
Although data provision to the Fund is generally adequate for surveillance purposes,
inadequate coverage and timeliness of key macroeconomic data continue to hinder the
conduct of macroeconomic policy. The September 2006 STA multisector statistics mission
assessed the institutional arrangements, methodological foundations, and accuracy and
reliability of data and found serious shortcomings. A follow-up high level STA mission in
December 2007, joined by senior officials of the Australian Bureau of Statistics, discussed a
strategy to improve macroeconomic statistics.

Safeguards Assessments:

Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG)
was subject to a transitional assessment based on its Stand By Arrangement (SBY) with
the Fund, which was approved in March 2000 and expired in September 2001. The
transitional assessment was completed on May 4, 2001 and made recommendations to
alleviate identified weaknesses. Currently, the BPNG is not subject to the safeguards
policy.
VIII. Exchange Rate Arrangement:
Papua New Guinea has a managed floating exchange rate arrangement; the exchange rate
of the kina is determined in the interbank market in which authorized banks participate.
Papua New Guinea has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and
maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current
international transactions.

3

IX.

Article IV Consultation:

Papua New Guinea is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. The previous Article IV
consultation discussions were held during November 6–17, 2006. The staff report (IMF
Country Report No. 07/111) was considered by the Executive Board and the consultation
concluded on March 7, 2007.
X.

Technical Assistance from Headquarters:

FAD: A joint FAD/PFTAC mission in March 2000 assisted the authorities in preparing a
Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes Fiscal Transparency Module, published in
October 2000. A mission in December 2000 provided advice on the reconciliation of large
and volatile differences in fiscal reporting based on information provided by the Department
of Finance and Treasury and information reported by the Bank of Papua New Guinea. A
mission in February 2002 assessed progress in improving fiscal transparency.
LEG: A mission in November 1996 provided advice on the legal framework for the National
Value-Added Tax. A mission in November 2005 provided advice on the drafting of a tax
administration law. A mission in July 2006 provided a comprehensive program of assistance
in the development of the AML/CFT regime, including legislative drafting and capacity
building. A mission in August/September 2007 assisted the authorities in finalizing the terms
of the Revenue Administration Bill.
MFD/MCM: A mission in November 2001 reviewed foreign exchange management. A mission
in June 2001 assessed the monetary policy implementation framework. During 2001–03
assistance was provided through missions in bank supervision, financial sector restructuring and
improving the accounting framework and monetary operations of the central bank. A resident
advisor was assigned to the BPNG research department for 15 months through August 2003.
Technical assistance through peripatetic visits was delivered on bank regulation and supervision
(2001–February/March 2007), medium-term monetary policy formulation (October 2004 and
September 2005), reserve management (June 2006–September 2007), internal audits (2004–
August 2007), and accounting (September/October 2006–February 2007).
STA: Four missions in 1995–96 provided advice on the compilation of national accounts. A
mission reviewed monetary and financial statistics in April 2005 and a follow-up mission
took place in May 2006. Subsequently, a multisector mission visited in September 2006. A
high level STA mission to follow up on the multisector mission visited Port Moresby in
December 2007, joined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and AusAid.
XI.

Resident Representative:

A post was opened in Port Moresby in May 2000 and is currently filled by Mr. E. Faal.

4
ANNEX II: PAPUA NEW GUINEA—RELATIONS WITH THE PACIFIC FINANCIAL
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTRE1
(As of December 2007)
Assistance to Papua New Guinea (PNG) in recent years has been coordinated with the IMF
Resident Representative in Port Moresby, and with the extensive assistance provided by the
Australian Enhanced Cooperation Program (ECP). Since 2000, PFTAC has provided 24
missions to PNG, and the Government has sent over 50 officials to the Centre’s regional
seminars, workshops, and training courses in this period.
Public Financial Management
PFTAC assisted in the preparation of a ROSC, which was published in October 2000. The
PFTAC PFM Advisor has participated in occasional FAD technical assistance missions, and
an attachment of one PNG official to PFTAC was completed in April 2007. The PFTAC
PFM Advisor is expected to participate in a joint PEFA assessment, with ADB and other
donors, in mid-February 2008.
Tax Administration and Policy
The IMF Legal Department drafted a Tax Administration Act in 2005, adopted by the
Government in 2006, that: i) the re-established the Internal Revenue Commission as an
independent tax authority; and (ii) included customs administrative provisions. An IMF
Legal Department mission in September 2007 prepared the Internal Revenue Commission
Administration Bill 2007 to strengthen and consolidate all revenue administrative provisions
into one statute. It is expected that the new law will shortly be passed by the Parliament.
In 2006, the Commissioner General of the IRC requested assistance to obtain an independent
strategic assessment of the existing IT system looking five years out. A PFTAC expert has
undertaken technical assistance through a series of short missions. The first mission was
completed in July 2006, the second in October 2006, the third in January 2007, the fourth in
May 2007 and the fifth in September 2007. PFTAC is considering a further request from the
IRC to provide technical assistance to prepare the business case to Government for the
purpose of purchasing of a technology system and associated applications.

The Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) in Suva, Fiji is a regional technical assistance
institution operated by the IMF with financial support of the Asian Development Bank, Australia, Korea, Japan
and New Zealand. The Center’s aim is to build skills and institutional capacity for effective economic and
financial management that can be sustained at the national level. Member countries are: Cook Islands,
Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa,
Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.

5

Financial Sector Regulation and Supervision
There is no current PFTAC involvement in this area, as technical assistance is provided by
MCM, but the Advisor visited BPNG in September 2004 and July 2005 to identify areas
where technical assistance could be provided. In October 2005, the BPNG hosted the annual
meeting of the Association of Financial Supervisors of Pacific Countries, for which PFTAC
is the secretariat. In March 2007, PFTAC funded an attachment for two supervisors from
BPNG to assist the Cook Islands’ supervisory authority to undertake an on-site examination
of a domestic bank.
Economic and Financial Statistics
In February 2006, the Advisor briefly assessed the BOP compilation with a view to improve
its quality, and to assess progress against recommendations made by previous missions. A
multi-sector statistics mission in September 2006 assessed the statistical systems (BOP,
national accounts, prices statistics, government finance statistics and monetary statistics),
with the PFTAC Advisor assessing the national accounts and providing overall coordination.
The BOP expert provided some TA to progress improvements to the methodology and source
data.

ANNEX III: PAPUA NEW GUINEA—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of December 6, 2007)
Papua New Guinea (PNG) formally became a member of the World Bank upon gaining
independence in 1975 but had been a recipient of loans from the World Bank since 1968. To
date, the World Bank has provided PNG with 36 IBRD loans totaling US$786.6 million and
14 IDA credits totaling US$152.2 million in commitments. The World Bank portfolio in
PNG currently consists of two active loans totaling US$62.3 million in commitments:
Gazelle Restoration Project (US$25 million; the project is scheduled to close at the end of
2007) and the Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project (US$37.3 million). In addition,
the Bank is implementing a Global Environment Facility-supported Teachers’ Solar Lighting
Project (US$0.99 million).
The Bank’s relationship with the Government of PNG in recent years was not even.
Following a suspension and later cancellation of the Forestry and Conservation Project in
2003–05 due to noncompliance with some loan covenants, the World Bank prepared an
Interim Strategy Note (ISN) covering an 18-month period, in lieu of a full 4-year Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS). The ISN was approved by the Bank’s Board on April 12, 2005.
Under the ISN the Bank’s work in PNG focused primarily on priority analytical/advisory
services, capacity building and community outreach activities. In particular, the Bank, jointly
with AusAID and ADB, has participated in the programmatic Public Expenditure Review
and Rationalization process (FY04-present). The Bank also prepared Country Procurement
Assessment Report (FY04), Report on Strategic Directions for Human Development (FY06),
Community Driven Development Stocktaking and Roadmap (FY07), and
Telecommunications Sector Review (FY07). In April 2007 the Bank also approved a
US$37.3 million IDA credit to supplement funding for an earlier project for road
maintenance and rehabilitation. In 2006 the Bank, with support from domestic and foreign
donors, also organized a Youth Competition Program (Development Marketplace) which
attracted a large number of quality development proposals. A second round of the Program
was launched in November 2007. The Bank has also been involved in a number of
community outreach activities supported by its Global Development Learning Network and
Public Information Center.
Following a significant improvement in macroeconomic performance and a number of other
areas since the ISN was prepared, the Bank is now strengthening its commitment to PNG. In
close consultation with the Government the Bank has prepared a full four-year CAS. The
Strategy, expected to be approved by the Bank’s Board of Directors in mid-December, 2007,
is designed to launch a long-term partnership between the Bank and PNG aimed at
supporting sound management of economy and natural resources, and addressing immediate
service delivery needs while also building a foundation for tackling longer-term institutional
and accountability challenges.
As part of the new CAS, the World Bank is increasing concessional financial resources
available to Papua New Guinea and will assist the country to access global and regional grant
funds such as Global Environmental Facility. In particular, the CAS envisions up to three

7
IDA credits per fiscal year totaling US$45 million in FY08 and US$30–32 million per fiscal
year thereafter.2 Within this envelope, the Bank has prepared a Smallholder Agriculture
Development Project (US$27.5 million) which is expected to be approved in mid-December,
2007, together with the CAS. Another project, Mining Sector Technical Assistance, is at an
advanced state of preparation. The Bank is also expanding the staff of its Port Moresby
office. To reaffirm the Bank’s commitment to PNG, the country was also visited in
November 2007 by the Bank’s Regional Vice President for East Asia and Pacific, the most
senior Bank staff visit to PNG in recent years.
PNG’s debt outstanding to the World Bank as end-November, 2007 stood at
US$313.8 million. However, as part of its strategy to reduce the public debt level, the
Government of PNG has expressed interest in early repayment of the less concessional part
of the debt and selected for early repayment seven IBRD loans totaling around
US$56 million. The early repayment of these loans is expected to be completed in early
2008.
The Bank’s private sector arm, International Financial Corporation, has also strengthened the
level of its engagement in PNG over the past two year. IFC’s Private Enterprise Partnership
for the Pacific (PEP-Pacific) established a full-time presence in PNG in early 2006,
co-located with the World Bank. Since then IFC advisory service activity in PNG has
increased considerably, with a focus on access to finance, tourism, the business environment,
and infrastructure.
Within these programs PEP-Pacific is working to: improve the capacity of commercial banks
to provide credit; increase the availability of finance and financial services for the poor,
including investment in PNG Microfinance; assist in building financial infrastructure,
including establishment of a credit referral bureau; support a survey of PNG’s informal
economy to inform development of a national informal sector policy and ultimately
enhancing livelihood opportunities for the poor; improve the business environment by
working on a sub-set of the Doing Business indicators, in collaboration with the Foreign
Investment Advisory Service; strengthen the tourism sector; improve agribusiness
production, quality, supply chains and marketing; and explore –jointly with the Bank–
opportunities to support growth in the commercial fisheries sector.
The IFC’s current investment portfolio in PNG consists of a $1.2 million equity commitment
to PNG Microfinance Limited, of which $756 thousand has already been disbursed, giving
the IFC a 19 percent shareholding in the bank. The equity investment is supported by a
$2 million institutional capacity building program presently under procurement. The IFC has
also entered into negotiations with Digicel PNG Ltd on a $40 million line of credit to support
the roll-out of its national mobile telephony network. In addition, the IFC is tracking
investment opportunities in agribusiness, gas and mining, infrastructure, and forestry.
The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) has provided one guarantee in PNG.
The guarantee worth US$76.6 million in gross exposure covers a portion of equity

ANNEX IV: PAPUA NEW GUINEA—RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK3
(As of December 2007)
The Asian Development Bank (AsDB) has approved 60 loans to Papua New Guinea (PNG)
totaling $1,027 million for 47 projects, of which 26 loans ($558 million) have been extended
from ordinary capital resources while 35 loans ($469 million) from special funds resources.
The special fund resources were also used for one grant amounting $15 million. In addition,
$51.6 million has been provided for 133 technical assistance projects. There are currently 12
active loans involving 9 projects (and one special fund grant-financed project).
The AsDB strategy for PNG (approved in July 2006) and country operations business plan
for 2008–2010 (approved in August 2007) are in line with the PNG government’s MediumTerm Development Strategy, focusing more on key areas: (i) public financial management,
(ii) private sector development, (iii) transport sector, and (iv) health and HIV/AIDS.
Reforming public sector enterprises has remained focused. A modest lending is envisaged,
reflecting both a tighter focus of the AsDB operations in PNG and the government’s wish to
continue its successful reduction of overall public debt. In line with the government’s
commitment to developing its own results-management framework, the AsDB is supporting
and adopting the government’s performance targets and indicators.
The AsDB’s lending to PNG for 2008–2010 is expected to remain a blend from the Asian
Development Fund (ADF) and ordinary capital resources (OCR). The indicative cumulative
value for 2008–2010 is $262.2 million, comprising the $140 million OCR lending program that
includes (i) Highlands Highway Rehabilitation Project ($30.0 million), (ii) Power Sector
Project ($10 million), and (iii) PNG Gas Project ($100.0 million) and the $122.5 million ADF
lending program that includes (i) Private Sector Development and Governance ($32.5 million),
(ii) Power Sector Project ($15 million), (iii) Highlands Highway Rehabilitation ($30.0 million),
and (iv) Transport Multi-Tranche Financing Facility ($20 million).
The AsDB’s non-lending assistance program envisages annual grant-financed technical
assistance about $2 million per year for 2008–2010, totaling of $6 million. Consistent with
the Country Strategy and Planning document, non-lending assistance continues to focus on
project preparation, strengthening governance, and improving public sector management.
In 2007, a $100 million loan for Lae Port Development Project and a $15 million project for
Lae Port Livelihood and Social Improvement (Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction) were
approved. In addition, three technical assistance projects totaling $1.9 million were approved
for Highlands Highway project, power sector development plan, and support for public
expenditure review and rationalization.

ANNEX V: PAPUA NEW GUINEA—STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision for surveillance purposes is generally adequate. However, inadequate
coverage and timeliness of key macroeconomic data continues to hinder the conduct of
macroeconomic policy. The September 2006 STA multisector statistics mission assessed the
institutional arrangements, methodological foundations, and accuracy and reliability of data
and found serious shortcomings. Shortcomings in institutional arrangements, insufficient
resources, and inadequate priorities have given rise to gaps in the quality of macroeconomic
statistics. There are considerable uncertainties about the accuracy and reliability of data on
GDP, imports, exports, and price statistics, with very limited coverage of the government
finance statistics. The paucity of good source data and methodological shortcomings render
estimates of the savings-investment balance, GDP components, and trade balance highly
questionable. As a follow-up to the multisector statistics mission, a high level STA mission
joined by senior officials of the Australian Bureau of Statistics visited Port Moresby in
December 2007 to provide a strategy to substantially improve macroeconomic statistics.
The National Statistical Office (NSO) is underfunded and lacks sufficient staff with
computer training. It faces difficulties in obtaining and collating data from businesses and
other government departments although it does have the relevant legal power. As a result, the
only economic release produced on a somewhat timely basis is the Consumer Price Index
(CPI). The Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG) and the Department of Treasury produce the
most current data. The NSO, with assistance from AusAID, completed data collection for the
2000 Population Census and released preliminary results in July 2001. Papua New Guinea
participates in the Pacific Regional General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) Project and
was represented at the GDDS workshop held in Suva in November 2002. A GDDS
coordinator has been nominated and metadata are being developed prior to formal
participation in the GDDS.
In mid-2000, the NSO released a set of national accounts estimates: National Income,
Expenditure and Product, 1993–98. These estimates were compiled using the 1968 System of
National Accounts. However, the NSO has been working to implement the 1993 System of
National Accounts. In March 2004, the NSO released a preliminary set of national income,
expenditure, and production accounts estimates for 1994–2002, rebased to 1998 prices. As
these figures are still in need of substantial improvements, the 2006 multisector mission
recommended against publication of the new GDP data until the needed revisions are made.
In an attempt to fill the vacuum, the Treasury—responsible for GFS—has actually assumed
the role of estimating the NA for 2002 to the present.
The NSO currently compiles a new quarterly wholesale price index (which it does not
publish) and a CPI. Main deficiencies in the CPI include outdated weights that are based on
consumption studies conducted in the mid-1970s and weaknesses in data collection practices.
The NSO intends to use the results of the planned Household Income Expenditure Survey

11
(HIES) to rebase the CPI; however, this has been delayed for a long time. Moreover,
technical assistance is needed to computerize the collection and production of the index.
Annual government finance statistics (GFS) reported to STA suffer from insufficient
coverage and timeliness. While central government tax revenue statistics are generally
accurate and timely, nontax revenue and public expenditure data are deficient. In particular,
development budget expenditures and the utilization of grants and project loans are recorded
with long lags, and few records on the use of accrual trust accounts are available. While
interest payment records are accurate, there are timing issues regarding the recording of
interest on discount securities. No data are available for deferred pension liabilities to civil
servants, provincial and local government budgets, off-budget outlays and corresponding
liabilities, or transfers between the government and a large number of public enterprises.
These weaknesses contribute to discrepancies in domestic financing between estimates from
monetary and debt data and those derived from fiscal records. The 2006 multisector mission
encouraged the authorities to prepare a list of public sector units to permit a comprehensive
delineation of the levels of government, which should help reconcile the GFS with other
datasets. The latest data reported and published in the GFS Yearbook and IFS are for
1999-2002 and cover only budgetary central government.
Monetary data are now being produced on a regular basis and reporting to STA has
improved. Two monetary and financial statistics missions (April 2005 and May 2006)
visited Papua New Guinea which helped to (i) finalize the review of the collection,
compilation, and dissemination procedures of monetary statistics by the BPNG; (ii) develop a
work program to facilitate the full implementation of the methodology recommended in the
Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM); (iii) prepare the standardized report
forms (SRFs) for reporting monetary data of the central bank, other depository corporations
(ODCs), and monetary aggregates; and (iv) finalize the integrated monetary database that
meets the data needs of the BPNG, STA, and APD. The 2006 multisector statistics mission
ensured that the data used and disseminated by the BPNG is in line with the MFSM; assisted
the authorities in the design of a new call report form to be used by the BPNG to collect
balance sheet data from ODCs and other financial corporations (OFCs); and introduced
measures to better identify the positions with the central government. The BPNG now reports
monetary data for the central bank, ODCs, and monetary aggregates using the SRFs, which
are published in IFS and the IFS Supplement on Monetary and Financial Statistics. The
BPNG, in close cooperation with STA, will introduce the new call report form in early 2008.
This will permit the compilation of a financial corporations survey, which is very important
as the assets of the OFCs (superannuation funds, insurance companies, and other financial
intermediaries) represent about 50 percent of the total assets of the financial corporations
sector. A follow-up mission is scheduled for end-FY08 to compile the surveys for the OFCs
and financial corporations.
Annual balance of payments statistics are reported to the Fund for publication. These
data are based on the International Transactions Recording System (ITRS), which is not
tightly monitored despite the BPNG reporting requirements. There are marked differences

12
between the official data on exports and imports of goods and those reported by trading
partners. The financial accounts data are of poor quality because of major deficiencies in data
collection, especially in the areas of private external debt. In many cases, donors and lenders
disburse funds directly to contractors for the purchase of goods and services, effectively
bypassing the ITRS. Therefore, a substantial proportion of current account and capital flows
are not recorded. The 2006 multisector mission identified as a priority to strengthen current
account estimates, including through improved classification of investment earnings, trade
credits, and grant receipts as well as enhancing source data for imports and exports. This will
require identifying transactors in the ITRS and intensifying cooperation with Customs to
obtain more timely and accurate ASYCUDA data.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation
with Papua New Guinea
On February 15, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Papua New Guinea.1
Background
Supported by a combination of prudent fiscal and monetary policies and high global prices for
key mineral export commodities, Papua New Guinea’s growth has accelerated over the past
five years with increasing momentum from the nonmineral sector since the recession ended in
2003. Inflation has remained in the low single digits, and international reserves are at a record
high.
At the same time, the country has significant underlying vulnerabilities. There has been little
improvement in development indicators, and urban unemployment is estimated at around
40 percent. The economy is exposed to commodity price shocks, and mineral production is
expected to decline over the medium to longer term. An unattractive investment environment,
including weak infrastructure and governance, constrains more rapid and sustained growth of
the nonmineral sector. Although Papua New Guinea’s recent growth performance is an
improvement relative to the past, it is not expected to be sustained and falls short of that
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2

needed to reduce poverty, raise development, and close the performance gap with respect to
comparator countries over time.
Buoyant growth of over 6 percent is estimated for 2007, based on robust mineral and
nonmineral growth. The pickup reflects the combination of several one-off factors, including a
strong rebound in mineral and agriculture production following drought in 2006, and expansion
in telecommunications and mining-related construction. Strong nonmineral activity should
continue in 2008, with some easing. Annual average CPI inflation is estimated at under
2 percent in 2007. In 2008, annual average inflation is expected to trend upward toward the
middle single digits, with pass-through of rising petroleum prices, some kina depreciation on a
nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) basis, and higher demand pressure from increased
budget spending.
Large foreign exchange inflows related to buoyant mineral exports boosted official reserves to
over $2 billion at end-2007, equivalent to about 5 months of goods and services imports, and
kept the current account balance in surplus. The kina continued to appreciate against the U.S.
dollar, 7 percent over the year to November. On a nominal and real effective basis, it
depreciated by about 4 and 5 percent, respectively, over the year through September.
Overall fiscal surpluses will continue through 2007–08. High mineral revenue inflows, combined
with restraint of recurrent costs and implementation capacity constraints, helped boost fiscal
savings since 2002 relative to comparators. However, the nonmineral deficit, measured on a
cash basis, is now likely to further worsen as mineral revenue eases and spending increases.
Positive debt dynamics and some repayment lowered the public debt-to-GDP ratio to about
35 percent at end-2007, down sharply from a peak of 77 percent in 2002.
The financial sector appears sound, based on backward-looking indicators. Reflecting the
improved growth prospects and low interest rates, credit growth continues to be strong, though
decelerating.
Progress on the structural reform agenda set out under the Medium-Term Development
Strategy (MTDS) has stalled over the past year, particularly with respect to public sector reform.
Constraints to private activity remain formidable, including unreliable services from basic
utilities, poor transportation infrastructure, high crime, low public sector capacity to provide
services, unclear licensing and regulation policies, weak human capacity, delays in work-visas,
and land tenure issues. For these reasons, foreign and domestic investment outside of the
enclave mineral sector is low.
Competitiveness of the nonmineral sector has not improved over the recent period, resulting in
little or no increase in nonmineral export volumes. Agricultural exports, the largest share of
nonmineral exports, were additionally affected by bad weather in the recent period.

3

Over the medium term, the outlook is for a return to moderate growth of about 3.5 percent,
mainly reflecting the onset of production at new mines. Nonmineral growth is expected to
decelerate from current peaks to trend growth rates in the absence of structural reform. Inflation
should remain in the middle single digits.
However, macroeconomic vulnerabilities have intensified, in particular, the potential for higher
unproductive fiscal spending to raise demand pressures and spur inflation. Additional downside
risks include a weaker global economy leading to lower commodity prices, and no action or a
reversal of progress on the structural reform agenda. Upside risks include further sustained
higher commodity prices, crowding-in of private activity from the increase in public investment,
and additional production from existing or new gas and mining projects.
The baseline nonmineral GDP growth rate needs to roughly double over a sustained period to
meet the objectives of reduced poverty, significant job creation, and higher development. Given
Papua New Guinea’s resources, these higher growth rates could be realized if a fiscal-monetary
policy mix is pursued that maintains macroeconomic stability, mineral revenues are used
productively, and structural reforms are undertaken to remove rigidities constraining private
activity so that productivity and investment are raised and sustained.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Papua New Guinea’s recent strong economic performance,
which reflects a combination of prudent policies and high mineral export prices. Growth has
accelerated, inflation has remained low, and external and fiscal vulnerabilities have declined.
While welcoming these achievements, Directors noted that important challenges remain. In
particular, conditions need to be created for achieving sustained higher economic growth and
putting Papua New Guinea on a solid track to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue following an appropriate fiscal-monetary policy
mix that would maintain macroeconomic stability, to make productive use of mineral resources,
and to accelerate structural reforms in order to remove constraints on non-mineral privatesector activity.
Directors welcomed the generally prudent fiscal policies followed in recent years. They
commended the one-off spending increases that have been undertaken to meet infrastructure
and social development needs in line with the Medium Term Development Strategy, and the
prepayment of public debt. At the same time, Directors stressed that the authorities need to give
careful thought to the scale of fiscal expansion over the medium term, given absorptive and
administrative capacity constraints and the projected downturn in mineral revenue. They
welcomed the authorities’ plans to improve expenditure management capacity at the

4

subnational level, and underscored the importance of focusing expenditure on the Medium
Term Development Strategy priorities.
Directors encouraged approval of the proposed new Medium-Term Fiscal Strategy, which
appropriately focuses on maintaining a stable and sustainable non-mineral fiscal balance. They
welcomed the government’s debt strategy and the intention to contract new debt only on
concessional terms. Directors encouraged the authorities to reinvigorate public sector reforms,
particularly measures to improve transparency and accountability, notably with respect to trust
funds, publication of audited central government accounts, and public administration. They
welcomed recent initiatives to limit tax exemptions and encouraged a resumption of the rightsizing initiative.
Directors considered the current stance of monetary policy to be appropriate, given its success
in maintaining low inflation. With the risk of price pressures building from additional fiscal
stimulus, Directors welcomed the authorities’ readiness to tighten monetary policy as needed,
while noting that a tighter fiscal stance may have to contribute to keeping inflation in check.
Directors considered that the current managed floating exchange rate policy, which has allowed
some reserve build up while protecting competitiveness, is appropriate. They noted the
assessment that the level of the exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals, and agreed
that greater exchange rate flexibility will be needed should sustained pressures emerge.
Directors welcomed the indications that Papua New Guinea’s financial sector remains sound.
They looked forward to steps to further deepen financial intermediation, strengthen supervision
and regulation, and remove institutional rigidities such as weak enforcement of creditor rights
and contracts. They also encouraged the authorities to follow through on their stated intention to
request a Financial Sector Assessment Program. Regarding the recently-revived Development
Bank, Directors recommended that its lending activities be based on proper credit evaluation
without political interference.
Directors encouraged the authorities to accelerate structural reform and improve infrastructure.
This will be crucial to enhance the investment environment and the competitiveness of the nonmining sectors of the economy, and ultimately to diversify the economic base. Directors
highlighted, in particular, the need to strengthen the transportation, communication and power
infrastructure, the legal and institutional framework, labor skills and education, and governance.
They also noted the improvements in service provision and efficiency that would result from
further opening the state-owned enterprise sector to competition.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to accelerate efforts to strengthen the quality and
timeliness of macroeconomic statistics. They encouraged the authorities to take the steps
needed to trigger implementation of the multi-donor technical assistance plan.
