to support economic activity during the global crisis while maintaining
macroeconomic stability, promote financial sector soundness, ensure debt
sustainability, and advance structural reforms to maintain the pace of economic
development in Vietnam.



Consultation focus: Discussions revolved around policies to ensure
macroeconomic and financial stability, following the largely successful stimulus
during 2009, as well as structural reforms to maximize Vietnam’s growth potential
and poverty reduction.

Outreach: The mission held a seminar on the Financial Sector Assessment
Program at the State Bank of Vietnam and met with private-sector representatives,
donors, and legislators from the National Assembly.



Exchange arrangement: The de facto exchange rate regime is currently
classified as “stabilized.” Vietnam has accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement and maintains an exchange
system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions.



Economic statistics: Data are adequate for surveillance purposes, though some
shortcomings remain. Staff encouraged the authorities to improve communications
with the market by timely data publication.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Economic activity held up well during the global crisis, thanks to ambitious stimulus
measures. Real GDP growth slowed somewhat to 5.3 percent in 2009, its the slowest pace
since 2000, though Vietnam was among the better performers in developing Asia.
The 2009 stimulus resulted in elevated macroeconomic risks, which the government
began to address with policy tightening later in the year. As confidence has been restored,
calm has returned in the market. Yet, a sharp widening of spreads between the overnight
interbank rates and rates for longer maturities, especially beyond three months, suggests that
market participants are yet to be fully convinced of the government’s sound policy
commitment.
An immediate challenge is to consolidate the current stable macroeconomic conditions
through prudent policies and better communications. With macroeconomic stability
sustained, staff projects that the government can meet its growth target of 6½ percent for
2010. While the government views its growth target is within reach, and while it places high
value in maintaining macroeconomic stability, it also appears concerned that a prolonged
period of high lending rates could jeopardize industry activity. It has thus noted the need to
lower the lending rates. Staff cautioned against premature monetary loosening, however,
because staff believes it could lead to deterioration of the trade deficit and/or inflation, which
would have to be addressed by sharp tightening measures at a later date with high costs to the
economy. Staff and the authorities are in broad agreement on the pace of ongoing fiscal
adjustment from the large stimulus of 2009.
Staff also made a number of medium-term policy recommendations. Staff encouraged
operational improvement in the conduct of monetary policy. It also recommended adoption
of a more ambitious plan to lower medium-term deficit and debt level. Staff welcomed the
increased focus on strengthening financial sector regulatory/supervisory capacity, but
stressed the importance of decisively addressing weaker banks, and bringing supervisory
practices up to international standards.
The government’s reform efforts must be accompanied by increased transparency.
Timely release of key economic data is critical, as is a clear message from the government on
assessments of economic/financial conditions and policy intentions.

INTRODUCTION
1.
Vietnam has exited the ambitious and largely successful stimulus policies adopted
to counter the global crisis, but sustaining stable economic conditions remains a
challenge. Vietnam has demonstrated commendable pragmatism in its handling of a series of
domestic and external shocks in the past few years. However, adapting its style of
macroeconomic management to an increasingly private sector-oriented economy is posing a
growing challenge, and the resulting economic and/or financial instability has had an adverse
impact on investor perceptions of the economic environment in Vietnam. Maintaining
macroeconomic stability, together with steady implementation of structural reforms, are
critical for achieving its goal of becoming a modern emerging market economy by the end of
this decade. These challenges are currently being debated in the context of the preparation for
the next five-year plan (Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP)).
I. RECENT ECONOMIC AND POLICY DEVELOPMENTS
2.
Economic activity held up well during the global crisis, thanks to ambitious
stimulus measures. The 2008 global crisis hit Vietnam when it had just stabilized the
economy after a period of overheating in 2007, resulting from extraordinary capital inflows
following its accession to the WTO. Facing a decline in foreign direct investment (FDI)
commitments and expecting sluggish external demand for exports in the wake of the global
crisis, the government decisively shifted policies toward supporting growth. Monetary policy
was drastically loosened and a sizable fiscal package (5 percent of GDP) was executed
(Appendix I). As a result, real GDP grew by 5.3 percent in 2009, down from 6.3 percent in
2008 and the slowest pace since 2000, but among the better performers in developing Asia.
Robust growth in manufacturing, supported by resilient external demand for Vietnam’s
exports, also helped underpin growth in 2009 (Table 1).
3.
The economic stimulus, however, resulted in elevated macroeconomic risks. Credit
growth accelerated to 40 percent (y/y) toward end-2009 (up from 25 percent in 2008),
resulting in a deterioration of the trade deficit.1 Expecting a severe loss in international
reserves, and consequently dong devaluations, domestic residents dramatically shifted from
dong assets into U.S. dollar assets and/or gold, which accounts for unusually large errors and
omissions (about 13 percent of GDP). As a result, a substantial balance of payments deficit
(8¾ percent of GDP) was recorded, despite the current account deficit (excluding gold
exports and imports) remaining stable relative to 2008 with resilient inflows of remittances
and FDI disbursements, and an increase in ODA disbursements. As depreciation expectations
1

Trade balance registered a surplus of about 13 percent of GDP in 2009 Q1 owing to large one-off gold
re-exports (of about US$2½ billion) and a collapse in imports. As the stimulus measures gathered strength,
however, trade balance quickly reversed to deficit, which rapidly widened to about 14¼ percent of GDP in 2009
Q3 and about 16½ percent of GDP in 2009 Q4.

6
mounted, the parallel market exchange rate fell to about 10 percent below the weaker end of
the official band in late 2009, and gross international reserves (GIR) declined by about
US$8 billion to US$14.1 billion by end-2009, equivalent to only about two months of
imports projected for 2010.2

The authorities have tightened the policy stance since late 2009. In November 2009,
the authorities shifted the policy priority from growth to stability, and adopted a number of
measures.3 Liquidity was squeezed in December, driving the interbank interest rates sharply
to as high as 18 percent at one point. The termination of the interest subsidy scheme for
short-term loans at end-2009 and the liberalization of lending rates in early 2010,4 led to a
slowdown in credit growth (3.6 percent year-to-date at end-March), affecting especially
activity in construction and financial services. A rebound in manufacturing, in line with the
global recovery, picked up the slack only partially. As a result, real GDP growth slowed from
7 percent (y/y) in 2009 Q4 to 5.8 percent in 2010 Q1.
5.
The government began to balance growth and stability since late March 2010, as it
became confident in the improvement in economic and financial conditions. During
2010 Q1, investment in capacity expansion, especially in the export sector, was said to be
held back by high borrowing costs, which invited many complaints from the industry
2

Including SDRs allocated in 2009 Q3, amounting to SDR276.1 million (about US$410 million).

3

In November 2009, the government announced a rise in the policy interest rate by 100 basis points, devaluation
of the official central exchange rate by 5½ percent, and phasing out of the interest subsidy scheme for short-term
loans by end-2009. In February 2010, the government announced a further devaluation of 3.4 percent, a cap on
enterprises’ dollar deposit rate at 1 percent, and removed the lending rate cap on medium- and long-term
commercial loans. The lending rate cap on short-term commercial loans was removed in April 2010.
4

Vietnam’s Civil Code stipulates that financial institutions cannot charge lending rates exceeding 1.5 times the
base (prime) rate. During much of 2009, therefore, the maximum lending rate was capped at 10.5 percent
(7 times 1.5). The SBV finally allowed loan rates to be negotiated between the lender and the borrower, without
an amendment of the civil code. As a result, in some cases, loan rates are said to have risen from a subsidized
6 percent to a negotiated 16–18 percent, before declining to 14–15 percent.

directed to the government. Also to secure the growth target of 6½ percent, the government
began to strongly encourage banks to lower commercial lending and deposit rates, and started
to bring downward pressure to bear on short-term interest rates through its open market
operations (OMOs), reducing them to around 7 percent (for one week) since mid-April. The
effect on lending and deposit rates seems to have been more mixed,5 but credit did grow
somewhat faster after March: year-to-date growth was 7½ percent at end-May.

Staff has found that large private banks (joint stock banks (JSBs)) either charge fees and other extras on top of
the advertized loan rate, or ration the credit to selected borrowers. Similarly, competition for deposits following
effective liberalization of deposit rates has also kept deposit rates high. Some banks are said to continue offering
bonuses to depositors.
6

There are reportedly investors who borrow in U.S. dollars (at around 5 percent interest rate) to benefit from a
high dong deposit rate at around 10 percent), a sign of confidence that the dong’s devaluation prospect is
limited in the short term.

The rebalancing of policy priority
combined with more positive economic news
calmed the market, and confidence in the dong
has risen. Against the backdrop of subdued
inflation and contained trade deficit, both the
interbank and the parallel market rates appreciated
back within the band since mid-April,6 allowing the
SBV to gradually replenish GIR from the low level
at end-March (US$11¾ billion) to US$12.9 billion
by end-May 2010. Nondeliverable forward rates
have also been on an appreciation trend.

Vietnam’s relatively good performance has been marred by large swings in
economic and financial conditions. In the past few years, policies were tightened and
loosened in succession, giving an impression of “stop and go” policy style. Delays in
rersponse to changing circumstances, a weak monetary transmission mechanism, use of
moral suasion, and uncertainty about policy stance including fiscal management have made it
necessary for the government to apply strong measures to ensure policy effectiveness. The
consequent large swings seem to have made overseas investors more cautious about investing
in Vietnam. Movement of sovereign bond spread since the beginning of the year is in line
with the regional trend, but its level is higher than in other emerging Asian economies.
Foreign investors left the stock market after its collapse in 2008, from which the index has
recovered only partially. The successful issuance of an international bond worth US$1 billion
on January 25 was both a sign of investor confidence (the bond was oversubscribed) and
misgivings (the yield was higher than a similar bond issued by the Philippines, at a
comparable credit rating, shortly before). Also, Vietnam has not benefitted from the
resurgence of international capital inflows experienced elsewhere in the region.

II. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
8.
Market stability has been restored, but appears fragile, compounded by confusion
over the government’s policy intentions. Market participants appear unconvinced that the

9
current calm in the foreign exchange and money markets will be sustained in the remainder
of 2010, judging from elevated spreads between overnight and three-month dong interbank
rates (at around 4 percentage points). Uncertainties about the outlook are compounded by
confusion about the government’s policy intentions, in particular with regard to monetary
policy. The SBV’s repeated comments on the need for lower lending rates may be taken as a
precursor of its policy action through OMOs. In addition, the fact that some key data,
including GIR, have not been published since late 2009 is raising concerns in the market
about the level of reserves and ultimately the ability of the government to cope with shocks.
The lack of clarity on the fiscal policy stance, and the resulting market financing needs, for
2010 is also adding to the uncertainty.
9.
The near-term outlook hinges critically on whether the current stability can be
maintained, with downside risks from both internal and external sources. If the existing
macroeconomic stability can be maintained through end-2010, staff projects that the
government’s objectives are largely attainable:


Real GDP growth is projected at 6½ percent—the same as the authorities’ target—
supported by robust manufacturing and construction activity, underpinned by buoyant
private investment, consumption, and non-oil exports.



Inflation is currently projected to reach 10.4 percent (y/y) for the year as a whole.
Although core inflation is edging up, headline inflation eased slightly in the last few
months. Going ahead, it depends importantly on the pace and magnitude of the
expected deceleration of commodity and food prices later in the year.



The external position is projected to slightly improve. Exports should rebound, along
with the global recovery, and the overall current account deficit is expected to narrow
to 9 percent of GDP compared with 10.7 percent (excluding gold re-exports) in 2009.
With market confidence sustained, short-term capital outflows (including errors and
omissions), are also expected to moderate significantly, allowing a modest build up of
reserves in 2010.

10. To this baseline scenario, while there is some upside potential, the greatest
downside risk lies in uncertainty about domestic policies. At the moment, a successful
exit from the stimulus is being consolidated, and it would take some time for the government
to convince market participants that the government is serious about maintaining
macroeconomic stability. Further policy loosening is not warranted, in staff’s view, to
achieve the growth target. The authorities also seem confident that the growth target will be
met. At the same time, however, they appear to believe that lending rates can be lowered
without much disruption to the current stability, so that the industry base is protected, the
credit growth target (25 percent for 2010) is met, and even higher growth may be achieved.
Hence, the government has strongly encouraged banks to lower their lending rates. Staff
argued that premature policy loosening, real or perceived, would be counter-productive, since
it could raise market participants’ expectations for a deterioration in the trade deficit and/or
inflation, which could quickly result in devaluation pressures on the dong, requiring a sharp
tightening down the road with great cost to the economy inflicted by another “stop-and-go
cycle.” Slower economic activity could then heighten vulnerabilities in the banking system
down the line. While the authorities are aware of these risks, they are still publicly stating
that lower lending rates are desirable.
11. Downside external risks also exist, including possible spillover effects from Europe
(Appendix II), lower-than-expected recoveries in major trading partners (e.g., the United States,
Japan, ASEAN-4, and newly industrialized economies), a slowdown in China, and higher-thanexpected commodity and food prices. With prudent macroeconomic management, these risks are
more or less manageable, given Vietnam’s robust domestic demand.
12. The medium-term outlook is favorable. Provided that the government is committed to
implementing sound macroeconomic policies and sustaining the momentum of reforms in its
next SEDP (2011–15), Vietnam remains an attractive destination for foreign investors. In this
scenario, real GDP growth is expected to rise to 7½ percent by 2015 (Table 4), supported by
buoyant exports and domestic private investment and consumption. Inflation should ease
further in 2011 and gradually fall to 5 percent (y/y) by 2015, provided that commodity and
food prices remain stable, the credit growth is contained, and the exchange rate stability is
maintained. The current account deficit is projected to narrow to about 4½ percent of GDP by
2015, as export growth and private remittances are likely to rebound. Capital inflows are also
expected to pick up as investor confidence recovers. With the improved balance of payment
environment, GIR is projected to rebuild and the reserve coverage ratio improve. The debt
sustainability analysis (DSA), under the baseline scenario of sustained macroeconomic
stability, indicates that external debt levels would be manageable, provided that external
borrowing remains prudent.

13. Commitment to macroeconomic stability should be unequivocally communicated
to the market. Staff believes that the immediate priority for the government is to safeguardthe
ongoing macroeconomic stability, reached

inflation is on a downward trajectory,
sentiment toward the dong is firmly established, and external reserves are rebuilt to more
comfortable level.
14. The interest rate structure should be gradually normalized to resolve maturity
mismatch problems. There exists a sizable difference between OMO rates and interbank rates
(around 7 percent for up to one week) and deposit rates (around 11–12 percent), which distorts
and destabilizes the interest rate structure. This situation has led some banks to increasingly
rely on OMOs and money market for funding, deteriorating the maturity mismatch between
banks’ assets and liabilities.7 To resolve this, staff encouraged the SBV to gradually move
toward a normalized interest rate structure,8 where OMO interest rates would complement but
not substitute deposits as sources of funds, having factored in liquidity and maturity structure.9
Repurchase agreement (repo) at longer maturities (three months to one year) can also be an
option to temporarily resolve maturity mismatch problems.

7

Banks are not allowed to fund more than 20 percent of their loans from the money market by a regulation.

8

The timing of normalization process depends on changes to the factors that have contributed to rising
deposit rates. It is also conditional on how fast the banking sector can adapt to the recent interest rate
liberalization and be able to find the market equilibrium. Addressing an excessive competition problem through
regulation/supervision would also be important to prepare the ground for normalization.
9

Open market operations rates are normally higher than deposit rates at the short end of the maturity structure.

15. Despite recent stabilization, risks to the exchange rate remain. The dong
has depreciated by 9 percent since December 2008 but due to relatively high inflation, it has
depreciated by only 2.1 percent in real effective terms. It has appreciated in real terms since
the beginning of 2010, and its size

inflows may be limited because much of
capital inflows are in the form of FDI, the greater risk is a shift of residents’ assets, as
witnessed in late 2009. Over the medium term, staff recommended that the exchange rate
regime be made more flexible, with a move from the current focus on bilateral
dong/U.S. dollar exchange rate to a system based on a basket including currencies of regional
trading partners.
Box 1: Exchange Rate Assessment
The dong is broadly in line with medium-term fundamentals based on three
approaches of CGER exchange rate assessment exercise. Estimates of overvaluation of
the dong range between -2.9 and 2.4 percent. Under the baseline scenario that the
government is committed to implementing sound macroeconomic policies, current account
deficit and external liabilities (as captured by negative NFA) are projected to decline.
Improvement in external balances has led to estimates of slight undervaluation of 2.9 and
0.9 percent in the cases of external sustainability and equilibrium exchange rate
approaches, respectively. Given that the projected current account deficit over the medium
term of around 5 percent—slightly above the norm of around 4 percent—the macro-balance
approach suggests a small overvaluation of 2.4 percent.

16. The SBV agrees in principle with staff’s recommendations. The SBV reiterated its
commitment to macroeconomic stability, especially low inflation. The SBV also
acknowledged that aiming for a higher credit growth could risk deterioration in the trade
deficit. Yet, because it is tasked with balancing stability and growth, it wants to maintain a
degree of flexibility in the conduct monetary policy. As for the structure of interest rates, the
SBV agrees that it should be “normalized” at an appropriate time, though it wondered if such
a move would be supported by the general public. While understanding the importance of
increasing flexibility, the SBV focuses on the stability under the current exchange rate

13
regime for the moment. Staff welcomes the new SBV Law, approved in late June, which
removed growth promotion from the list of monetary policy objectives and strengthened
operational authority of the SBV, though the details have yet to be clarified.
Fiscal policy
17. Overall fiscal balance in 2009 deteriorated by about 8 percentage points of GDP.
According to the official estimates, the 2009 overall fiscal deficit10 widened to about
9 percent of GDP, from about 1 percent of GDP in 2008. The large deterioration reflected
two major factors: a 2½ percentage points of GDP decline in oil revenues, linked to the
moderation in world oil prices from 2008 peak levels; and a spending surge of more than
5 percentage points of GDP related largely to the stimulus package. Although official foreign
financing (3½ percent of GDP) was more than double the level envisaged in the 2009 plan,
much of the deficit was financed domestically, split evenly between deposit draw-downs and
nonmarket loans from the social security fund, the SBV, and state-owned commercial banks
(SOCBs), as domestic bond issuance was constrained due to a low interest rate ceiling.
Public and publicly-guaranteed debt increased by 5 percentage points of GDP to 49 percent
of GDP.

18. With most stimulus measures having expired at end-2009 and a favorable growth
outlook ahead, staff projects a narrowing of the fiscal deficit by around 3 percentage

The mission has adopted the new IMF definition of the overall balance that excludes net lending by the
Vietnam Development Bank (VDB), estimated at 1.2 percent of GDP during 2001–08 and 1.5 percent of GDP
during 2009–10. The change in definition brings fiscal reporting closer in line with GFSM 2001 principles. The
mission will track the VDB balance sheet for potential losses that might represent a contingent liability. In the
meantime, bonds issued by the VDB will continue to be recorded as part of publicly-guaranteed domestic debt.

GDP, compared to the 2009 level, to 23 percent of GDP,12 while oil revenues are expected to
remain flat. On the expenditure side, staff projects a small increase in current outlays, while
total investment spending would decline by 3 percentage points of GDP. It is expected that
the overall deficit for 2010 would narrow to a financeable level of about 6 percent of GDP.13
Staff views the implied structural consolidation of about 3 percentage points of GDP (yearon-year) as striking the right balance between the need to exit from crisis-support policies
and protecting the growth recovery and social safety nets.
19. Considerable uncertainty over the fiscal outlook for 2010 exists. Two factors
appear to be contributing to this uncertainty (Appendix III). First, the government’s official
definition of budgetary aggregates excludes off-budget expenditures, onlending, and the
subnational fiscal surplus but includes principal repayments, thus precluding a clear
assessment of the actual fiscal stance. Second, in the absence of official recognition of the
expected revenue overperformance, or of government intentions to save it, it is difficult to
form an informed view on the size of the 2010 deficit and associated financing needs.
20.
Over the medium term, Vietnam needs to implement fiscal consolidation with a
view to lowering the public debt-to-GDP ratio. A cross-country comparison (Figure 1) of
2009 fiscal indicators suggests that Vietnam’s deficit level is quite elevated (due, in large
measure, to the stimulus-related surge in investment spending). Public and publiclyguaranteed debt, at 50 percent of GDP (based on staff’s definition), also appears relatively
high, especially when considering Vietnam’s large state-owned enterprise (SOE) sector,
prospective graduation from concessional financing, and vulnerability to refinancing and
exchange rate risks. Staff thus supports the authorities’ current strategy of setting the ceiling
on public and publicly-guaranteed debt at 50 percent of GDP (based on the authorities’
definition,14 the current debt level is 44 percent of GDP). Staff proposed that, over time, the
ceiling be revised down toward the 40 percent of GDP level, a more prudent threshold for
emerging economies in general, and considering Vietnam’s afore-mentioned contingent
risks, in particular. Although the DSA places Vietnam at a low risk of debt distress, it also
shows that the debt-to-GDP ratio could rise rapidly above 60 percent, if there is an adverse
exchange rate shock or if deficits are not reined in. There are also growing concerns about
the quality of public investment in Vietnam, indicating that any medium-term fiscal
adjustment strategy would likely involve a rationalization of investment spending.

12

The authorities have traditionally adopted unrealistically conservative revenue projections. The revenue
projection by staff is 3 percentage points of GDP above the 2010 budget plan by the government.

13

Staff project foreign financing to reach about 3½ percent of GDP, 2 percentage points of GDP above the 2010
budget plan. This implies net domestic financing need of 2½ percent of GDP, which appears manageable, given the
recent uptick in domestic bond issuance.

14

The authorities’ definition uses the official exchange rate to convert foreign currency debt, and excludes
certain banking sector claims and implicitly-guaranteed VDB debt.

21. The authorities broadly concurred with staff’s assessment of the fiscal outlook. The
Ministry of Finance (MOF) recognized that the 2010 revenues would likely turn out to be
significantly larger than the level envisaged in the approved budget plan, and indicated the
intention to save much of the revenue overperformance, provided no legitimate spending needs
arose. The MOF also emphasized the need to distinguish what the government must continue to
provide and what can be left to the market, which would help streamline the government’s fiscal

16
responsibilities. On the issue of communication with markets, the MOF noted plans to introduce
a new budget law (see below) that would, inter alia, bring national fiscal definitions closer to
international standards. Staff stressed the more urgent need to release the government’s
near-term spending and borrowing plans, to help reassure markets that fiscal policy is working
in tandem with monetary policy to ensure macroeconomic stability. Staff also reiterated the
need to further streamline expenditure, especially on large infrastructure projects, and to use
revenue overperformance as far as possible for deficit reduction.
22. Staff welcomed the authorities’ intentions to reduce the deficit in the context of
the 2011–15 SEDP. The authorities agreed that much of the consolidation would have to
come from the expenditure side, especially investment spending, while preserving outlays for
key public infrastructure projects and social spending to protect the poor. Revenues would
remain under pressure due to the anticipated decline in oil revenues (as existing oilfields
mature) and the loss in trade taxes arising from import tariff reductions linked to Vietnam’s
WTO commitments and ASEAN-China FTA. Staff welcomed the authorities’ willingness to
consider public private partnership (PPP) and other methods to mobilize private sector
funding for infrastructure investment. At the same time, staff highlighted the importance of
preserving a high tax-to-GDP ratio by the introduction of new taxes (such as the
environmental tax, and land and housing tax, currently under consideration), broadening the
tax base, and introducing and better enforcement of existing taxes. Staff also recommended a
medium-term fiscal plan that could reduce the deficit to about 3½ percent of GDP by 2015,
and sustainably put debt on a downward path below 50 percent of GDP.
23. Staff welcomed the move to modernize and strengthen fiscal management. The
new State Budget Law is expected to take effect from January 1, 2013, if approved by the
National Assembly. The new law seeks to align fiscal reporting and accounting with
international standards, institute medium-term planning, introduce performance budgeting,
and reduce overlap of budgetary responsibilities between various levels of government.
Public debt management reforms, including in the context of draft decrees to accompany the
Public Debt Law of 2009, are also underway, aimed at, inter alia, introducing prudent limits
on the ratios of external debt and public debt to GDP (both at 50 percent) as an anchor for
fiscal management, as discussed above, and reforming the microstructure of T-bill/bond
issuance to allow more market-based determination of Treasury yields, which is crucial to
enable the authorities to rollover bond redemptions during 2010–12 especially in view of the
recent shortening of the maturity structure of public securities.15

15

Because the government has been reluctant to accept market-based yield on Treasury securities, there have
been large under-subscriptions and failed auctions in the past 18 months,

contributed to higher profitability in
some private banks, according to a report by Fitch.

25. Reversing the deceleration in 2008, banking system assets grew rapidly in 2009.
Over a longer horizon, private sector credit has roughly doubled to over 110 percent of GDP
and has increased in real terms by over 150 percent in last five years. Of the increase, both
direct (lending to real estate and construction sector) and indirect (collateral) exposure to the
real estate sector against the backdrop of sharp increases in asset prices can pose future
challenges to the banking system.16
26. The banking sector will likely experience downward pressure on profitability in
2010. Narrowing interest margin, higher provisioning costs, the moderation of credit growth,
and the closure of gold trading could constrain profitability at some banks this year. At
end-2009, nonperforming loans (NPL) declined to 2.0 percent (2.1 percent in 2008)
according to the official report,17 partly due to rapid credit growth; special-mention loans
(SML) declined to 6.5 percent (9.4 percent in 2008).18 However, pressure on credit quality,
including of the large loan portfolio disbursed under the interest subsidy program, may
translate into higher NPL down the road.

16

Although the SBV reports that direct real estate related lending remains slightly above 10 percent,
80–90 percent of collateral in the banking system is held in the form of land and real estate. Loan to value
ratio ranges from 50–70 percent.

17

According to a report by Moody’s, the NPL ratios in the banking system under International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) could be up to three times those under Vietnamese Accounting System.

18

Loan classification under Vietnamese Accounting Standards focuses primarily on past-due status and is less
strict than IFRS. In contrast, IFRS puts more emphasis on individually assessed loans on the borrower’s
financial situation.

added that some of the smaller JSBs have
faced some liquidity pressure and are being closely monitored for any early signs of stress.
28. Staff emphasized further strengthening of the regulatory and supervisory
framework to safeguard banking sector soundness. Various financial soundness
indicators, including leverage ratios, concentration, and liquidity risks, need to be developed
and closely monitored. Going forward, the results from the recent risk-based pilot project to
assess borrowers’ repayment capacity conducted by the Banking Supervision Agency could
help guide the strengthening of banking supervision. Bringing the classification and
provisioning to international best practice will also enhance the resilience of the sector. The
authorities concurred and pointed out that they are upgrading the classification and
provisioning rules and prudential ratios, and moving from compliance-based toward
risk-based supervision. Furthermore, the need for greater supervisory vigilance toward the
rapidly growing nonbank financial institutions was acknowledged.
29. The SBV acknowledged the importance of increasing capitalization in the banking
system. They expressed strong commitment to raising the minimum capital requirement (MCR)
to VND 3 trillion by end-2010.19 The affected small banks will have to report to the banking
supervision agency their capitalization plans by June 30 and their merger and acquisition plans
by September 30. The authorities need to carefully evaluate the planned level and pace of
increases in MCR (to VND 10 trillion by 2015, high by international standard), so that there is
some room for small and efficient banks to operate. The SBV agreed on the importance of
transparent communication with the market regarding small banks’ progress with their

19

Currently over 20 credit institutions have less than VND 3 trillion of capital, but none has less than
VND 1 trillion. The authorities noted their plans to increase the minimum capital requirement to VND 5 trillion
by 2012 and to VND 10 trillion by 2015 in order to achieve capital cushion and consolidation in the banking
system. Besides upgrading minimum capital requirement, the authorities have announced plans to increase their
minimum capital adequacy ratio from 8 percent to 9 percent by October 2010.

19
capitalization plans. They also noted that measures have been taken to ensure that
undercapitalized banks do not engage in aggressive lending practices.20
30. Staff welcomed the SBV’s interest in requesting the joint IMF-World Bank
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) and shared general information on the
process. Staff welcomed the new Law on Credit Institution, which would help improve the
SBV’s banking supervision.
C. Structural Reform Priorities
Efficiency of the economy
31. The authorities want to raise efficiency of its public investment projects. The
government believes that efficiency of its public investment projects is lower than other
regional economies (when they were at a similar development stage). Indeed, because a
broad framework does not exist to ensure the coherence of public investment plans and the
quality of individual projects, public infrastructure projects, including donor-funded projects,
often experienced delays.21 Moreover, without sufficiently developed monitoring
mechanisms, some public investments went to “unproductive” sectors, such as the real
estate sector.
32. The efficiency of foreign invested enterprises (FIEs) is constrained by insufficient
infrastructure and the shortage of skilled labor, and also there are limited technology
spillovers from FIEs to domestic private sector. The FIE sector has been using up
Vietnam’s supplies of skilled labor. If skilled labor supplies are not replenished fast enough,
the output growth from FDI will slow.22 Moreover, relatively low levels of labor skills limit
FDI within low value-added industries and make technology transfer via labor movement
difficult. As a result, the technology spillovers from FIEs to domestic firms are limited.23
33. The authorities are well aware of, and concerned about these problems. In the
2011–15 SEDP currently under preparation, inefficiencies of public investment and lack of
competitiveness of domestic private enterprises are considered as key limitations of the
20

They include regular monitoring of lending by undercapitalized banks and limiting lending funded by
interbank borrowing.

22

For example, the mission heard complaints from a number of manufacturers, both domestic and foreign, that
they could not fully benefit from the recovery in external demand, as they cannot hire enough workers even at a
higher wage, and hence have to be cautious in accepting new orders.

Growth,” the Central Institute for Economic Management, 2006.

20
economy. General objectives and solutions are to be specified in the plan. Staff welcomed the
initiatives and stressed that improving the efficiency of public investment is essential in
maintaining capital expenditures on key infrastructure projects while achieving fiscal
consolidation at the same time.
Trade strategy
34. Value-added in Vietnam’s major export industries, including processing trade, is
relatively low.24 The low value-added is associated with low labor cost, which has been a
key comparative advantage of Vietnam, and was essential in attracting export-oriented FDI
in the past. However, as wage cost increases,25 foreign investors seriously begin to consider
whether it is wise to establish their production base for export in Vietnam, given the need to
import many intermediate goods owing to the lack of supporting industries. If such high
inflation and real appreciations observed in the past few years continue in the medium term,
Vietnam’s competitiveness in exports would be impaired. As concerns over Vietnam’s
competitiveness rise, more foreign investors are interested in the potential of Vietnam’s
domestic consumer market, which has been buoyant in the last few years. However, to attract
foreign investment aiming at domestic market, it is important to maintain a stable dong
exchange rate, and more generally, a stable macroeconomic environment, which would
provide predictability and boost investor confidence.
35. More measures are needed in the transition to higher value-added export
industries in the longer term. These measures include developing human capacity,
improving infrastructure and business environment, and promoting supporting industries.
The authorities shared these views, and have been working to specify the high value-added
industries to be targeted, together with strategies in improving infrastructure, education, and
business environment in the context of the 2011–15 SEDP.
State-owned enterprises
36. Following a successful equitization and consolidation program, SOE reform must
now focus on potential risks posed by the large state-owned economic groups. The last
decade has seen a significant decline in the share of the state-owned sector, in terms of both
assets and profits (see figure below). Attention is now focusing increasingly on the larger
24

It was reported, anecdotally, that about two-thirds of inputs and intermediate goods for noncommodity
exports are imported.

25

A salary survey conducted by the Navigos Group, a recruitment solutions provider in Vietnam, suggested that
the average gross salary increased about 16½ percent during the period from April 2008 to March 2009, against
the inflation rate of about 9 percent over the same period. The survey collected data from 163 companies across
Vietnam, spanning more than 15 industries and covering 75 job categories. Among the companies surveyed,
47 percent are completely foreign-owned, and only 11.7 percent are local companies.

21
state-owned economic groups (conglomerates specializing in particular sectors), as their
profitability and efficiency have been called into question with implications on fiscal
soundness. Some SOEs have extremely low capital ratios, such as Vinashin, necessitating
budgetary outlays for recapitalization (as in 2009), or support via onlending.26 Moreover,
many of these conglomerates have indicated their plans to undertake very large investments
over the medium-term, raising questions about the quality of the underlying projects as well
their financeability. Large domestic financing could crowd out resources for the budding
private sector, while sovereign-backed issuance abroad may threaten debt sustainability. In
addition, their role in the economy, following diversification strategies that have included
investments in financial institutions, has raised governance and competition concerns. These
concerns have been amplified by recently announced plans to increase the number of
economic groups from 7 to 30.

1/ Combined, the EGs and general corporations account for about 80 percent of total state capital
invested in SOEs (estimated at 43.7 percent of GDP at end-2007).

State-owned commercial banks
37. Staff argued for further reforms, as SOCBs still do not totally follow
market-based business principles. Although they have a declining share in the banking
system (about 45 percent of total banking assets), the SOCBs still exert a significant
influence on the financial landscape of Vietnam as the primary agents for implementing

23
certain government policies (e.g., interest rate subsidy of 200927). Therefore ensuring the
market-based operation of SOCBs (some of which underwent significant recapitalization in
early 2010) can contribute to continued financial sector development by providing a level
playing field for the private sector. In this respect, SOCB reform, including through
continued equitization28 by selling stakes to domestic and foreign strategic investors, can
contribute to a more efficient banking system through improved governance and risk
management, better quality of service, and greater product innovation. The SOCB reform
also needs to be mindful of the fiscal implications associated with any need for capital
injection by the government.
IV. OTHER ISSUES
38. Staff emphasized that an effective public communication strategy is needed,
especially when the macroeconomic balance is fragile and market sentiment could
change rapidly. Market confusion and speculations over the recent policy announcements
underscore the urgency of improving public communication strategy. The authorities should
present a regular assessment of the economic situation and policy direction to the public in a
transparent and consistent manner, in order to manage market expectations more effectively
and enhance investor confidence.
39. The authorities should improve the quality and timeliness of data, especially in
the monetary, international reserves, fiscal, SOE, and banking sectors. More timely data
on monetary survey and on international reserves are essential in analyzing monetary
development and policy stance, as well as developments on the external position. Higher
quality fiscal and SOE data would allow for better analysis of fiscal developments and the
policy stance. There is also a significant perception gap on the banking sector soundness
between the public and the authorities. The authorities shared these concerns and indicated
that efforts will be made to provide more information in a timely manner.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
40. Vietnam has managed to ride out difficult challenges in recent years, which
deserves international acknowledgment. As soon as an overheated economy in 2007,
owing to rapid capital inflows, was successfully cooled down, an external demand shock
triggered by the global crisis had to be countered in 2009 by a sizable stimulus package. As
the stimulus policy began to threaten macroeconomic stability toward end-2009, a successful

27
28

The SOCBs extended a large share—about two-thirds—of loans under the interest rate subsidy scheme.

The government still fully owns Bank for Investment and Development, Agribank, Mekong Housing Bank,
and Vietnam Bank for Social Policies. After partial equitization, the government holds 91 percent of Vietcom
Bank and 89 percent of Vietinbank, equitized in 2007 and 2008 respectively.

24
exit (monetary and fiscal tightening) was made. The fact that most fiscal measures were
introduced with a sunset clause also helped the timely exit.
41. Delicate macroeconomic stability is maintained for now. The policy tightening that
started at end 2009 has stabilized economic and financial conditions, and helped restore
market confidence, as evidenced by the stable dong exchange rates in both the interbank and
the parallel markets. Whether the current stability can be sustained through the rest of 2010
and beyond depends on whether the government can maintain and enhance market
confidence by limiting, for instance, deterioration in the trade deficit or a decline in the
U.S. dollar liquidity in the financial system. The repeated announcements by the government
about the need to lower the commercial lending rates thus appear counter-productive.
42. Maintaining a solid economic recovery will require the government to prioritize
among its multiple goals. The government has stated that in 2010 it aims at the growth
target (6.5 percent), inflation target (7 percent, now officially projected at 8 percent), credit
growth target (25 percent), and money supply growth target (20 percent), while maintaining a
stable dong exchange rate. It may be difficult to convince the market that the government can
achieve all these objectives with relatively blunt policy tools, namely OMOs and budget,
especially if there’s no apparent hierarchy of objectives. A lack of coordination between
monetary and fiscal policies, or the appearance thereof, would amplify market skepticism.
The government, therefore, needs to convince market participants that its priority rests with
macroeconomic stability. For this purpose, staff believes that maintaining the current stable
exchange rate, and taking the opportunity to rebuild GIR, should be the immediate goal for
the government. Once the government’s credential for macroeconomic stability is
established, and GIR is further built up, staff believes that the government will be able to
adopt a more flexible exchange rate regime without risking resurgent devaluation pressures.
43. Monetary policy should be prudent and its effectiveness should be further
strengthened. Further loosening, real or perceived, could disrupt the existing delicate
macroeconomic stability, and could inflict substantial damage to the growth prospect, not just
for 2010, but even for the medium term. To enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy, the
operational improvement in OMOs, and the gradual normalization of the interest rate,
structure should also progress. The early indications are that the new SBV Law, approved in
late June, strengthened operational authority of the SBV, though the details have yet to
be clarified.
44. Exchange rate regime should be reformed over the medium term. In the medium
term, a move from the current regime that focuses on the bilateral dong/U.S. dollar exchange
rate to a system that is based on a basket of currencies including those of regional trading
partners may be appropriate. In the process, a wide use of the U.S. dollar in the economy
(partial dollarization) could be wound down. In addition, further exchange rate flexibility is
encouraged once necessary infrastructure, particularly in terms of hedging instruments, is
readily available for the private sector to manage foreign exchange rate risks effectively.

25
45. There is room for further reduction in the budget deficit in the medium term. In
2010, total investment spending is expected to decline by 3 percentage points of GDP from
the 2009 level to about 11 percent of GDP. Staff believes that there is room for further
reduction in investment spending, for example, by project prioritizing, increased cost
efficiency, and the use of PPP and other innovative financing methods. This would enable the
government to reduce both the budget deficit and the public and publicly-guaranteed debt
levels over the medium term.
46. Strengthening the financial sector requires further reform. While welcoming the
ongoing efforts to strengthen supervisory capacity, more could, and should be done. An
FSAP is expected to help the authorities establish a reform agenda and a concrete timeline.
One of the fundamental problems facing Vietnam is over-banking: while the introduction of
the minimum capital requirement at end-2010 could promote consolidation of smaller banks,
further streamlining should be pursued in the medium term. The equitization (privatization)
of SOCBs should also be advanced.
47. As the economy is driven more by market principles, the government is required
to change its style of policy conduct. For instance, moral suasion could create distortions
that need to be addressed later at a higher cost. Reforms of SOEs and SOCBs would not only
provide a level playing field, but also raise the efficiency of the economy. Most importantly,
transparency in government intentions, based on higher quality data published timely, should
be further advanced to provide market players predictability.
48. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

APPENDIX I. VIETNAM: STIMULUS MEASURES IN 2009
Monetary policy
The base (prime) rate was cut by a total of 700 basis points (bps) between October 2008 and
February 2009, and kept at 7 percent until November 2009.
The SBV injected liquidity through OMOs as well as lowering reserve requirement on dong
deposits from 11 percent in October 2008 to 3 percent in March 2009.
Fiscal policy
The fiscal stimulus package was announced piecemeal since December 2008, and finalized in
May 2009. It focused on four main objectives (projected cost at the time is shown
in parentheses):1








Supporting small and medium enterprises (SMEs):
-

corporate income tax reduction/deferral (0.8 percent of GDP)

-

the interest rate subsidy scheme (1.0 percent of GDP)

Stimulate private consumption:
-

halving VAT rates on selected items (0.5 percent of GDP)

-

personal income tax reductions/deferrals (0.4 percent of GDP)

Accelerate public investment:
-

frontloading implementation of rural multi-year projects for rural irrigation,
infrastructure, and student and teacher housing (2.2 percent of GDP)

-

announcing additional off-budget projects in transportation, education, and health
(1.2 percent of GDP)2

Strengthening the social safety net:
-

boosting financial aid for low-income earners, students, and loss-making enterprises;
and introducing food support payments to local governments (0.4 percent of GDP).

1

Other measures whose cost was not explicitly quantified included: (i) provision of credit guarantees to SMEs
by the Vietnam Development Bank; (ii) acceleration of VAT refund procedures for exporters; (iii) speeding up
of customs clearance processes; and (iv) reduction in import tariffs on goods used for the production of export
items (offset by higher tariffs on some items competing with domestically produced goods).
2

Excludes the 2 percentage points of GDP carryover in investment capital disbursements from 2008.

APPENDIX II. VIETNAM: SPILL-OVER RISKS FROM EUROPE
Recent disruptive moves in the Euro area have raised concerns over the near-term prospects
of emerging market economies and low-income countries around the globe. While Vietnam’s
direct financial linkages to the most vulnerable euro area economies, namely, Greece,
Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain (GIIPS) are limited, contagion effects from a Europe-wide
credit event could materialize through such channels as external trade, bank funding,
portfolio and bond investment, and FDI. This appendix discusses possible spillover risks to
Vietnam through each of these channels, and finds that, overall, potential spillover risks are
limited.

Europe is traditionally one of the most important export destinations for Vietnam.
Although Vietnam’s direct exports to GIIPS are small (about 3 to 5 percent of total non-oil
exports), its exports to the European Union (EU) is about 20 to 25 percent of total non-oil
exports. Vietnam’s main export products to the EU are textile and garments (relatively low
end), and food items, which account for about 40 percent and 25 percent of total exports to
Europe, respectively.
Recent data suggest little negative impact on Vietnam’s exports to the EU. Vietnam’s
exports to the EU remained resilient during the global crisis, and have been picking up
strongly since September 2009. Despite of euro depreciation and its negative impact on
demand from Europe, there is little sign of a substantial slowdown in exports to the EU. A
key reason for this resilience is that (low-end) textile and garments and food items are
primary goods, demand for which tends to be less cyclical and less dependent on
financial conditions.1
1

Other major Asian exporters of lower-end textile and garments experienced similar resilience in exports
during the global crisis. See “How Have Low-Income Countries in Asia Fared Amid the Global Crisis?” Bi and
Chensavasdijai, Asia and Pacific Economic Outlook Chapter 1 Box 1.1, October 2009.

Financial channel
Spillover risks through financial channels may affect bank funding, portfolio, and bond
investment and FDI inflows to Vietnam. However, the overall impact is expected to be
limited, because the absolute size of exposure to financing inflows from Europe is
relatively small.


Bank funding. Based on BIS data on consolidated banking statistics, 51 percent of
Vietnam’s total liabilities to foreign banks were to European banks, about average in
the region as of December 2009. However, the size of total liabilities itself is only
around 14 percent of GDP, which is on the lower end for the region. The share of
domestic lending market served by foreign banks is at 14 percent (Moody’s,
August 2009). Strategic investment by European banks in Vietnamese banks also
remained very limited (less than 1 percent of banking sector assets). Hence, the possible
deleveraging may have rather limited impact on the credit market in Vietnam on the
banking sector.



Portfolio and bond investment. In 2008, around 41 percent of total portfolio investment
was from European countries according to Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey
Data. The participation of foreign investors in the equity market was sizable, at around
18–25 percent of total volume. After the bust of the stock market bubble at the end of
2008, however, most of the foreign portfolio investments flew out of the country, and
since then have remained very small, reflecting continued concerns over
macroeconomic risks. Similarly, foreign bond investments were significant during
2007, but have largely disappeared since late 2008. The small size of foreign portfolio
and bond investments, coupled with restrictions on foreign holdings of domestic listed
companies’ shares, helps limit the funding risks.



FDI. FDI commitments from the EU have been very buoyant so far this year.2 In the
first five months of this year, FDI commitments from EU amounted to about
US$2.4 billion, four times of the commitments from the EU in 2009 as a whole. Also,
FDI commitments from the EU was only about 3 percent of total FDI commitments in
2009, but so far this year, they accounted for about 30 percent of total FDI
commitments. Actual FDI disbursements, however, can be very different from
commitments. Historical data suggest that the former is generally one-third of the latter.
Even assuming no disbursement is made for European FDI, it would only mean a
reduction of FDI inflows by about US$0.8 billion, less than 10 percent of the financial
account surplus projected for 2010.

2

Data on FDI commitment by source country are very limited, starting from mid-2008 only. Data on FDI
disbursement by source country are not available.

35
APPENDIX III. VIETNAM: THE FISCAL PROJECTIONS REGIME, DEFICIT DEFINITIONS, AND
OPACITY OF FISCAL POLICY
The assessment of Vietnam’s fiscal stance is complicated by the interplay of two distinct
features of the budget system:


The national definition of fiscal aggregates (and hence the deficit) differs substantially from
international definitions more suited for cross country comparison (see Appendix Table 1).
The national definition, which is enshrined in the public finance act: (a) relies on a “central”
government concept and excludes the local government surplus; (b) categorizes
debt-reducing item, principal repayments, as expense; (c) treats any authorized but unpaid
spending commitments as part of total expenditure for the year; and (d) excludes significant
debt-creating items, such as off-budget items like ODA onlending from expenditures. As
can be seen, the two deficit measures differed substantially in 2006 and 2009, and not just in
direction, but also in magnitude: in 2006, the overall balance was -5 percent of GDP under
the national definition (D) – perfectly in line with the budget projection; but -0.1 percent of
GDP according the IMF definition. The converse pattern emerges in 2009 due, mainly, to
the large off-budget items not included in the national definition.



The deviation of fiscal out-turns published in the final accounts (released 18 months after
year-end) from the budget plans are alarmingly large (see Appendix Figure 1). During
2004–09, the average difference in revenues was 5 percentage points of GDP, of which
about half showed up in higher spending and half was saved. Moreover, the first estimate
(annual projection based on nine-month data which forms the basis for the following year’s
budget plan) also appear systematically biased vis-à-vis the final accounts, with revenues
being under-estimated by about 4 percentage points of GDP, on average. The bias for the
second estimate (released in April of the following year) is comparatively smaller but still
nontrivial, at about 2 percentage points of GDP. Conservative revenue projections are often
encouraged as prudent practice for budget preparation, and sometimes also help constrain
expenditure. However, the magnitudes involved here are simply too large and undermine the
realism of the budget plan and subsequent estimates.

The confluence of the above two factors lends an opacity to the fiscal stance that is not
easily surmountable. The ultimate cost of this is borne by the government: a systematic
understatement of revenues can undermine the credibility of fiscal policy plans and create
unnecessary uncertainty about the government’s ability to meet gross domestic financing
needs, even when they appear manageable, as was the case in late 2009 and is the case in
2010. The authorities have recently articulated plans to align budgetary reporting in line with
international standards (via the new public finance act), as well as to devote more resources
to strengthening fiscal forecasting. While these changes are welcome, they will take some
time to take effect. In the meantime, considerable scope remains to enhance communication
with markets on both fiscal out-turns and up-to-date and realistic projections in order to
reduce unnecessary anxiety about macroeconomic stability.

APPENDIX IV. VIETNAM: MONETARY POLICY REGIME
The SBV is a government agency with constrained autonomy to formulate and conduct
monetary policy. Under the new SBV Law, the Governor of the SBV remains a cabinet
member, and assigned to follow government policies. The objectives of monetary policy
have been simplified and focused on stabilizing the currency value and controlling inflation.1
The Government is charge with submitting an annual inflation target, based on the
recommendation of the SBV, for approval by the National Assembly. The Prime Minister
and Governor of SBV are charged with conducting monetary policy, in consultation with the
Prime Minister, and in accordance with government regulations, to achieve the monetary
policy objectives, including the inflation target approved by the National Assembly.

and credit growth consistent with the
inflation target approved by the National Assembly. To achieve the quantitative target, the
SBV makes use of a range of conventional monetary instruments alongside some
administrative controls. It also employs moral suasion.
A mixture of controls on prices and quantities in the conduct of monetary policy
without readily accessible lender of last resort facilities has led to interest rate volatility.
The daily operations involve liquidity forecasting and the use of OMOs, particularly in the
form of repurchase agreements at different tenors ranging from 7 to 28 days. Currently, both
prices (OMO rates) and quantities (amount offered) are set by the SBV for all tenors. As
such, market signals on liquidity conditions and market expectations on the policy direction
cannot be fully reflected particularly when offered quantities become binding constraints.
Impaired market signals may prevent the SBV from managing liquidity effectively.
Furthermore, administrative procedures3 have made refinancing and rediscount facilities less

accessible as the true lender of last resort. As a result, immediate or unexpected short-term
liquidity shortage needs to be accommodated by repurchase and/or interbank market
transactions leading to volatile money market rates. When banks with significant liquidity
shortage, particularly at year-end and during Tet holidays, were unable to engage in
repurchase transactions due to lack of collaterals, the overnight interbank rate could shoot up,
which partly explains the volatility observed earlier in 2010. To help minimize interest rate
volatility, the SBV might also revisit earlier technical assistance recommendations to
establish standing facilities to create an interest rate corridor.

40
APPENDIX V. VIETNAM: CHANGES IN TRADE PATTERNS DURING 2000–09
Vietnam’s trade with the outside world has achieved an impressive average annual growth
above 20 percent between 2000 and 2008. Trade slowed down somewhat in 2009 due to the
global recession.
During the period, Vietnam benefited from new markets and strong demand for commodities.
The U.S. domestic market was truly opened up for exports from Vietnam by the
U.S.-Vietnam bilateral trade agreement, which came into effect in November 2001. Exports
to the United States doubled in 2002, and the U.S. market became the largest destination of
exports in early 2007. It currently accounts for about 20 percent of total Vietnamese exports.
While new markets are being developed, especially in Canada and other countries in the
Western Hemisphere and Europe, the share of exports to more traditional markets of ASEAN
and other regional countries, especially neighboring Cambodia, started to rise again recently,
raising expectations for potential future growth. China is an important market for commodity
exports from Vietnam, while it is the largest supplier of imports to Vietnam, overtaking
Japan. Thus, the bilateral trade balance with China has turned from a surplus of
US$135 million in 2000 to a deficit of about US$10 billion in recent years, accounting for
over half of Vietnam’s overall trade deficit.
Exports items such as footwear, textiles, and garments, and major commodities have driven
the growth, but there are signs that room for further growth may be limited. Concerns over
competitiveness of its labor intensive industries are increasing, owing to rising wages and
shortage of qualified workers. The ship-building industry has grown rapidly, bringing
Vietnam to the fifth largest exporter in the world, but its future growth may be hampered by
competition and by uncertain financial prospects for the dominant ship-building SOE. Oil
fields are maturing and thus difficult to maintain production levels, and new domestic fields
are harder to develop. Major agricultural products have experienced unstable production
conditions amid volatile world and domestic prices. More recently, exports of more
value-added items such as computer components, electronics, and machinery and equipment
have posted significant growth, although their share in the total exports remains relatively
modest. These new sectors could become the next driver for exports.
Imports have been driven by strong development needs (e.g., machinery and equipment, and
steel), as well as by the need to import for processing trade (e.g., intermediary goods).
Because of the latter, rising exports are usually accompanied by increasing imports. Although
Vietnam is an oil-producing country, it imports most of petroleum products for domestic use,
due to the lack of refinery capacity. In addition, imports of vehicles have increased as income
levels rise especially in the city area. Luxury goods have also begun to flow in, albeit in a
comparatively small amount in the value terms. Share of consumer goods in total imports
have slightly declined, partially replaced by unofficial cross-border trade. The China-ASEAN
free trade agreement, which took effect January 1, 2010, could somewhat facilitate more
Vietnamese exports to the world’s most populous market. However, it would be more likely

41
to intensify the current trade deficit and challenges. Under the agreement, Vietnam will have
to gradually reduce tariffs on most Chinese goods and eliminate them entirely in 2015. Major
industries, particularly those manufacturing consumer goods, should face harsher direct
competition from China in both domestic and regional markets. Therefore, identifying a new
trade strategy, including supporting high value-added industries and finding new niche
products and markets, will be an urgent task for Vietnam to achieve sustainable
medium-term growth.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
VIETNAM
Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis 20101
Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
the International Development Association
Approved by Masahiko Takeda and Dhaneshwar Ghura (IMF)
and Lili Liu and Vikram Nehru (IDA)
July 7, 2010
This document presents the joint IMF-World Bank debt sustainability analysis (DSA) for
Vietnam using the Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries (LIC).2
Vietnam remains at low risk of debt distress, although the debt indicators have deteriorated
due to the negative impact of the global crisis and the increased macroeconomic risks since
late 2008. 3 Under the baseline scenario, all external debt sustainability indicators are
projected to remain well below their applicable debt thresholds. Under the standard
sensitivity analysis, only one indicator (the present value (PV) of debt-to-GDP) breaches its
threshold marginally and very briefly. The outlook for public sector debt (including domestic
debt) is less favorable and hinges on the authorities’ ability to (a) substantially narrow the
fiscal deficit from the stimulus-induced high of 2009, and (b) consistently issue long-term
local currency debt at market-determined yields acceptable to the authorities.

This DSA was prepared jointly by the IMF and World Bank. The staffs also consulted with the Asian
Development Bank. The debt data underlying this exercise were provided by the Vietnamese authorities and
donor partners. Data beyond end-2009 are staffs projections.

Vietnam’s policies and institutions, as measured by the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional
Assessment (CPIA), averaged 3.8 over the past three years, placing it as a “strong performer.” The relevant
indicative thresholds for this category are: 50 percent for the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio, 200 percent for the PV of
debt-to-exports ratio, 300 percent for the PV of debt-to-revenue ratio, 25 percent for the debt service-to-exports
ratio, and 35 percent for the debt service-to-revenue ratio. These thresholds are applicable to public and
publicly-guaranteed external debt.

I. BACKGROUND AND BASELINE ASSUMPTIONS
1.
Vietnam’s external debt position has historically been robust, but has been
negatively affected by the global crisis and domestic macroeconomic instability since
late 2008. Most of Vietnam’s external

Large private capital outflows (as
domestic residents switched their dong-denominated assets into foreign currencydenominated assets or gold) led to severe loss in international reserves, and finally
depreciations of the exchange rate. As a result, Vietnam’s total external debt (including the
private sector) increased by 7 percentage points to 40¾ percent of GDP by end-2009,5 and
the PPG external debt increased by 4 percentage points to 30½ percent of GDP by end-2009.
2.
Domestic public debt6 has historically been manageable, although risks have
increased with recent macroeconomic instability. Public sector debt in this analysis refers
to debt of the general government and debt guaranteed by the central government. Debts of the
state-owned enterprises (SOEs) not guaranteed by the government are excluded from public
sector debt (except Vietnam Development Bank (VDB), whose nonsecuritized domestic debts
are also included in the public sector debt) due to data limitations. Vietnam’s domestic public
debt has remained at around 17–18 percent of GDP over the past three years. Domestic
financing needs have traditionally been met comfortably through borrowing at low or negative
4

Information on Vietnam’s creditors can be found in the Ministry of Finance’s External Debt Bulletin at
www.mof.gov.vn.

In this analysis, all external debt and debt service ratios are calculated using the interbank exchange rate,
which is the “effective” exchange rate. The authorities calculate external debt ratios using the official exchange
rate, according to which the total external debt (including private sector) is about 39½ percent of GDP by
end-2009.

real interest rates from captive banks and other quasi-government entities. However, with
financing needs rising sharply due to economic expansion and the recent stimulus, these
sources have been pressured, while issuance of marketable securities remains constrained by
the authorities’ unwillingness to pay the market clearing interest rate.
3.
The assessment of Vietnam’s debt situation has not changed significantly since the
last DSA, despite a higher level of debt than projected previously. The PPG external debt
increased for about 4 percentage points of GDP from 2008 to 2009 in nominal terms, and the

explains the remaining 2 percentage points. Domestic financing of the government deficit is
estimated to have soared above 5 percent of GDP in 2009, in line with the fiscal stimulus.
About half of this financing was obtained via drawdown of government deposits; the rest
came in the form of nonmarket loans from Vietnam Social Security Fund, State Capital
Investment Corporation (SCIC), and the banking system.7

Includes a claim of 0.6 percent of GDP in respect of State Bank of Vietnam’s payment of the interest

4
4.
The main baseline assumptions underlying the DSA are summarized in Box 1.
A critical assumption is that Vietnam will continue to pursue sound macroeconomic and
financial policies and press ahead with structural reforms to maintain macroeconomic
stability, support growth, and reduce poverty. Based on these assumptions, GDP growth is
expected to accelerate to 6½ percent in 2010 and to 7½ percent in 2015, underpinned by
buoyant private investment, consumption, and non-oil exports. As exports and remittances
rebound and imports are contained by prudent monetary policy and fiscal consolidation, the
noninterest current account deficit is projected to gradually decline from about 7 percent of
GDP in 2009 to 3½ percent in 2015, further down to 2¼ percent in 2020, and finally reverse
into a small surplus by 2030. As investors’ confidence restores, FDI and portfolio inflows are
expected to recover, official development assistance (ODA) is projected to pick up in the
near term, in line with donors’ commitment in the last Consultative Group (CG) meeting.
Reserve coverage is expected to improve from about 2 months by end-2009 to about
3 months by 2015 and to about 3½ months by end-2030.8 The primary fiscal deficit is
projected to decline from 7½ percent of GDP in 2009 to 2½ of GDP in 2010–15, as non-oil
revenues recover, stimulus-related surge in investment spending unwinds, and other
investment expenditures consolidate, consistent with the earlier government announcements
in the context of the five-year financial plan accompanying the 2011–15 Social Economic
Development Plan (SEDP). In the longer term, the primary fiscal deficit is expected to
continue declining gradually and reach about 1 percent of GDP at the end of the
projection horizon.
II. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS9
5.
PPG external debt is likely to remain manageable, despite the deterioration of
the debt indicators relative to the last DSA. The PV of PPG external debt stock by end2009 reached about 27 percent of GDP. Although the ratio is higher than projected in the last
DSA, it remains much lower than the threshold of 50 percent of GDP. Other PPG external
debt and debt service indicators also remain well below the applicable debt thresholds,
suggesting that Vietnam’s current PPG external debt position is likely to be manageable.

8

Increases in GIR are reflected as positive “residuals” in the DSA summary tables. In outer years, as
import-to-GDP ratio increases, an improvement in reserve coverage relative to prospective imports leads to a
gradual increase in “residuals” (in percent of GDP).
9

This analysis focuses on PPG external debt, which accounts for more than 80 percent of total external debt.
Private external debt is largely associated with foreign-invested projects, and hence is more self-sustainable.

5

Box 1: Key Macroeconomic Assumptions for Baseline Scenario (2010–30)
Real GDP growth is projected to be 6½ percent for 2010 and to gradually increase to about 7½ percent in
2015. Real GDP growth will average at about 7 percent per year during 2010–15 (below the 10-year
historical average of 7.3 percent). It will thereafter remain at 7½ percent for a decade and then decline
slightly, as Vietnam’s level of development and demography begins to converge to those of more
advanced neighbors.
Inflation is projected to increase from 6¾ percent in 2009 to 10½ percent in 2010 as economic activities
recover and commodity and food prices rise. Inflation will then gradually decline to 5 percent in 2015 and
will remain at that level through 2020. Thereafter, a further decline is assumed reflecting productivity gains.
The current account deficit is projected to narrow from 10¾ percent of GDP in 2009 (excluding gold
re-exports) to 9 percent of GDP in 2010. It will gradually narrow to about 4½ percent in 2015 as exports and
remittances pick up in line with the global recovery. In the longer term, as the main exports shift toward
higher value-added products, current account deficit will gradually narrow and will finally reverse into a very
small surplus in 2030. As Vietnam continues high growth in the longer term, remittances (whose growth
tends to be in line with the GDP growth rate in the U.S., the largest source country of remittances to
Vietnam) as a share of GDP will decline from 6½ percent of GDP in 2009 to 4 percent in 2030.
The financial account surplus will fall from about 12 percent of GDP in 2009 to 9 percent in 2015 and
remain at that level throughout the projection horizon. The nondebt-creating part of FDI will decrease from
about 7 percent of GDP in 2009 to about 3 percent in 2030. Concessional official development assistance is
assumed to decline from US$3.6 billion in 2009 to about US$1.1 billion by 2030. Commercial borrowing, on
the other hand, is projected to increase from about 29 percent of total PPG external borrowing to about
92 percent in 2030.
The reserve coverage is likely to remain low at about 2 months of prospected imports by end-2010, but will
gradually recover to about 3 months by end-2015 and increase further to 3½ months by end-2030.
Effective interest rates on foreign borrowing will gradually increase from around 3.3 percent in 2009 to
above 4.1 percent by 2030, as the share of concessional loans in total debt gradually declines.
The overall fiscal deficit (including off-budget expenditure and onlending; but excluding VDB net lending)
will moderate from 8.9 percent of GDP in 2009 to 3.3 percent of GDP by 2015 and stabilize at about
3 percent of GDP in the long run (correspondingly, the primary deficit is projected to narrow from
7½ percent of GDP in 2009 to 1¾ percent of GDP). The adjustment will be frontloaded, in line with an
unwinding of the 2009 stimulus-related surge in investment spending, so that the deficit will narrow to below
6 percent of GDP by 2010. Of the remaining 2½ percentage point of GDP fiscal effort in 2011–15, four-fifths
will come from the expenditure side, considering Vietnam’s high expenditure ratio. Although aggregate
revenues will rise by only ½ percentage point of GDP (to 27½ percent of GDP in 2015), non-oil domestic
revenues will rise by 1½ percentage points of GDP to offset the decline in oil revenues, import tariffs and
grants. As such the implied improvement in the non-oil primary balance (share of GDP) is about 3 percent
of GDP.
Net domestic financing (NDF) is expected to decline through 2013 (to 0.3 percent of GDP), due to the
expected increase in ODA disbursements in the coming two years as donors committed in last year’s CG
meeting, coupled with the assumed fiscal adjustment. However, the financing mix will shift toward domestic
sources after that, and NDF will rise to 1.7 percent and 2.1 percent of GDP in 2015 and 2016–30,
respectively. The net domestic financing figures mask somewhat the bulge in gross issuance requirements
arising from the increase in domestic bond redemptions to 1¼ percent of GDP (annually) during 2010–12.
Contingent liabilities or exceptional financing items are not assumed.

6

Under the baseline scenario, the PV of PPG external debt and debt service are
projected to initially rise in relation to GDP, exports, and government revenue,
followed by a decline over the longer

commercial borrowing in PPG external
debt. With remittances included in the denominator of debt indicator calculations, the above
results hold as well.
7.
Stress tests indicate that the PV of PPG external debt is most sensitive to a loss of
access to nondebt-creating flows and a slowdown in exports. The most extreme stress
test—defined as the test that triggers the highest debt ratio in 2020—is a combination
shock.10 Under such a shock, the PV of PPG external debt in relation to GDP would breach
the threshold in 2012 and 2013 (at 51 percent of GDP) before trending down below the
threshold. Within the combination shock, a loss of access to nondebt-creating flows and a
slowdown in exports seem to play the most important roles. The vulnerability of the debt
dynamics vis-à-vis export proceeds can also be seen by the marginal breach of the PV of
external debt-to-GDP for two consecutive years when export performance is weaker than
expected. The results should however be downplayed as the standard assumptions11 for the
combination shock and export shock tend to be severe and are unlikely to materialize.
Similarly, other PPG external debt indicators are most sensitive to the combination shock and
the export shock, but they remain well below the applicable thresholds even under the most
extreme stress tests. Results remain the same when remittances are included in the
denominator of debt indicator calculations.

10

A combination shock assumes: (i) real GDP growth at historical average minus one-half standard deviation
in 2011–12; (ii) export value growth at historical average minus one-half standard deviation in 2011–12;
(iii) U.S. dollar GDP deflator at historical average minus one-half standard deviation in 2011–12; and (iv) net
nondebt-creating flows at historical average minus one-half standard deviation in 2011–12.

III. PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
8.
The current and medium-term public debt indicators have worsened somewhat
relative to the previous DSA. The PV of public sector debt at end-2009 is estimated at
45 percent of GDP, 5 percentage points above the previous DSA baseline projection; the
debt service-to-revenue ratio (revenues excluding grants) during 2010–15 is also about
3–4 percentage points of GDP higher than projected. The nominal debt-to-GDP ratio
(49 percent of GDP at end-2009) is similarly projected to peak at over 51.3 percent of GDP
in 2010 (rather than at 50.8 percent in 2012), before falling to 48 percent of GDP by 2015.
9.
These trends largely reflect the fiscal expansion implemented in the context of
the global economic crisis. The stimulus measures (estimated to have cost over 5 percent of
GDP in net terms), particularly the hike in investment spending, pushed the 2009 overall
deficit to almost 9 percent of GDP. Although the stimulus package did support growth
(ceteris paribus, the debt ratio fell by 2.2 percentage points of GDP due to nominal growth)
and much of it was financed domestically (including 2½ percent of GDP via nondebt
increasing deposit drawdown), the concomitant increase in foreign currency borrowing and
commitments (both concessional and commercial) through 2012, and the aggravating effect
of exchange rate depreciations in 2009 and early 2010, contributed to an increase in debt.12
10.
The standard stress tests indicate the importance of reining in public finances
over the medium term. A perpetuation of the 2009 fiscal deficit level would be
unsustainable, and would push the PV of debt to near 60 percent of GDP by 2015. A less
ambitious adjustment than assumed in the baseline may not provide a sufficient hedge
against a large exchange rate shock. As shown in one stress test, a one-time 30 percent real
depreciation in 2011 could push debt near 60 percent of GDP in one year, given that more
than 60 percent of public sector debt is denominated in foreign currency by end-2009.
Against this backdrop, the authorities’ plans to undertake spending-led, medium-term fiscal
adjustment in the context of the SEDP 2011–15, as well as impose ceilings on nominal public
and external debt at 50 percent of GDP, are steps in the right direction.13 Over time, and
consistent with the DSA results, a sufficiently prudent fiscal policy would deliver debt
12

On the concessional side, official loan disbursements will increase from about US$1.5 billion a year during
2005–08 to about US$2 billion (on average) a year in 2009–12 before moderating to about US$1.2 billion a
year during 2013–15. A significant part of this increase was motivated by the desire to help the government
fund its stimulus package for 2009–10 (as well as bridge the induced external deficits). On the commercial side,
Vietnam issued a 6.9 percent 10-year bullet repayment sovereign bond of US$1billion in January 2010 (about
1 percent of GDP). This is the country’s second sovereign bond; the first was issued in 2005 also as a 10-year
bond, but in the amount of US$750 million. In addition, the government issued about 0.5 percent of GDP in
shorter-term foreign currency denominated domestic bonds in 2009 (maturing before 2012).
13

Under the authorities’ definition, which excludes certain banking system claims and implicitly guaranteed
debt of the VDB, and converts external debt at official rather than market exchange rates, public and publiclyguaranteed debt was 44 percent of GDP at end-2009.

trajectories that are consistent with even lower nominal debt thresholds, such as 40 percent of
GDP, as is more customary for small emerging economies and considering Vietnam’s
potential contingent risks linked to its large SOE sector, low reserve buffer, and emerging
domestic debt vulnerabilities (see below).
The authorities need to factor in the additional vulnerability implied by a
shortening of domestic debt maturities. There has been an unmistakable decline in the
maturity of public sector

rates. To ensure a smooth
rollover of maturing debt obligations in the coming years and cultivate the ability to borrow
long term in local currency, a review of the current low interest rate ceiling and of the
microstructure of Treasury auctions would be important.

The authorities are strengthening public debt management. Public debt
management and reporting have traditionally been fragmented. As Vietnam gradually moves
from concessional financing to more market-based financing, and given the potential
maturity, refinancing, and currency risks over the medium term, improving debt management
capacity and reporting (especially to markets) are essential. Against this backdrop, the
authorities passed the 2009 Public Debt Management Law, and four accompanying decrees
are currently under preparation. The integration of external and domestic public debt
management reporting under the Ministry of Finance debt department is ongoing.
IV. CONCLUSION
13.
Vietnam remains at low risk of external debt distress, but debt indicators have
deteriorated due to the negative impact of the global crisis and the increased
macroeconomic risks in late 2009. Compared with the last DSA, the projected PPG external
debt ratios and projected path are less favorable, but still remain well below indicative
thresholds under the baseline scenario. Under the sensitivity analysis, one indicator (PV of

9
PPG external debt-to-GDP ratio) breaches the threshold very briefly and marginally under
two tests, while the others remain below the applicable thresholds.
14.
Public debt indicators have been adversely impacted by the global downturn and
the large stimulus package implemented in 2009. Vietnam’s end-2009 fiscal deficit and
public sector debt, at 9 and 49 percent of GDP, respectively, are more elevated than the levels
projected in the previous DSA. Given Vietnam’s prospective, albeit gradual, graduation from
concessional external financing over the medium term, and the currency and refinancing risks
highlighted above, there appears less cause for complacency than before on the fiscal front.
15.
The above debt sustainability results depend critically on the underlying
assumptions. The key assumptions include: (i) a fiscal adjustment that reduces the overall
deficit to about 3 percent of GDP in order to anchor public sector debt to below 50 percent of
GDP by 2015 and toward 40 percent of GDP thereafter; (ii) healthy export growth and
continued dynamism of the Vietnamese economy more generally; (iii) continued access to
non-debt-creating external financing, especially private remittances and FDI; and
(iv) continued access to concessional financing by multilateral and bilateral sources in the
medium term.
16.
A risk that deserves special attention is the possible impact of potential
government contingent liabilities. Given inadequate information on the true net worth of
state-owned enterprises, it is not possible to quantify the fiscal risks posed by the sector.
However, the experience of recent state-owned commercial bank recapitalizations and
support to Vinashin (a state-owned maritime company) suggests the need for added caution
when projecting the net contribution from SOEs to fiscal aggregates (both stocks and flows).

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes errors and omissions and changes in gross international reserves (GIR) for historical data and 2010. For 2011-30, residuals mainly reflect changes in GIR (i.e., a positive residual implies an accumulation
of GIR). As the reserve coverage is projected to improve from about 2 months in 2010 to about 3.5 months in 2030, and imports increase as a share of GDP, the accumulation of GIR (and hence residuals)
in percent of GDP is projected to rise gradually in outer years.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Exchange Arrangement:
Vietnam’s exchange rate system is currently classified as “stabilized.” Effective
November 26, 2009, the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) reverted to its previous policy
of a ±3 percent dollar-dong trading band around the rate quoted by the SBV with a

1

Formerly PRGF.

3
one step devaluation of about 5½ percent in the central rate. Previously the trading
band was widened to ±5% on March 24, 2009. The dong stabilized at the most
depreciated edge of the band in January 2009, which was devalued several times
since then. Therefore the exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to
“stabilized” against the U.S. dollar from “other managed” effective January 1, 2009.
In 2008, the SBV increased exchange rate flexibility substantially by widening the
dong-U.S. dollar trading band from ±0.75 to ±3 percent on three separate occasions.
Vietnam maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions, except for those
exchange restrictions imposed for security reasons of which Vietnam has notified the
IMF pursuant to Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51), 8/14/52.
VIII.

Article IV Consultations:
Vietnam is on a 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation was
held in Hanoi during December 3–18, 2008 and was concluded by the Executive
Board on February 27, 2009 (IMF Country Report No. 09/110). In addition, staff
visits took place in April and October 2009. The current Article IV consultation was
postponed as per the authorities’ request.

IX.

Technical Assistance:
Technical assistance is currently focused on balance of payment, monetary and
financial statistics, banking supervision, tax policy and administration, and
AML/CFT. A long-term resident advisor in banking supervision based in Hanoi
began assisting the SBV in December 2008 and will continue in the role until
January 2011. In June 2010, additional technical assistance was requested for
compiling balance of payments, monetary statistics, and the “green GDP” indicator.

X.

Resident Representative:
Mr. Benedict Bingham assumed the Senior Resident Representative post for Vietnam
and Lao P.D.R., based in Hanoi, on October 17, 2007.

ANNEX II. VIETNAM: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP2
A. Partnership in Vietnam’s Development Strategy
A new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) was presented to the World Bank Board in
February 2007. The CPS is fully aligned to Vietnam’s Socio-Economic Development Plan
(SEDP) 2006–10 and sets out the World Bank’s planned support between FY07 and FY11.
The objectives of the SEDP are mapped into four broad pillars that are the organizing
principles of the CPS: (i) improving the business environment; (ii) strengthening social
inclusion; (iii) strengthening environmental and natural resource management; and
(iv) improving governance.
A common theme underlining the four pillars is the need to complete the remaining
first-generation structural reforms, while moving forward on a set of ambitious
second-generation reforms. The former group relates to the transition to a market economy
and the restructuring of the state sector. The latter group focuses on the institutional
underpinnings for the operation of a more complex economy, as Vietnam becomes a
middle-income country. Through these reforms, the role of the Government will be
transformed from direct producer of goods and services to regulator and provider of the
foundations for a well-functioning, equitable, modern market economy.
Improving the business environment: Support for this theme focuses on banking reform and
overall financial sector development; improved competitiveness with fuller integration with
the world economy, including through improved quality, efficiency, and equity of the higher
education system; a more level playing field for enterprises; a better foundation for
knowledge-based growth and enhancing agricultural competitiveness; and investment in
more efficient and reliable infrastructure.
Strengthening social inclusion: Priorities for World Bank Group support are better
understanding of poverty and piloting new instruments to reach the poor; mainstreaming
gender issues across the portfolio and including people with disabilities in the development
process; increasing access to and quality of basic infrastructure services for the rural poor;
increasing access to affordable and better quality education and health care services;
including and empowering ethnic minorities in the development process; improving policies
and services to address the needs of urban poor and migrants; and reducing vulnerability to
adverse shocks, including natural disasters and climatic hazards.
Strengthening environmental and natural resource management: Rapid economic growth is
putting the environment under increasing stress. The livelihoods of poor people in Vietnam
2

Questions may be referred to Ms. Myla Taylor Williams (202-473-6997).

5
still depend overwhelmingly on natural resources. The World Bank’s activities will focus on
livelihood-supporting roles and public benefits of better management of the environment and
natural resources. In practice, this will raise a range of challenges related to regional
planning; land, forestry, water resources, and integrated river basin management; and the
introduction of modern tools for environmental protection.
Improving governance: Progress across the first three pillars will require institutions with
enhanced transparency, accountability, and stakeholder voice and participation. World Bank
support under this pillar will focus on strengthening public financial management,
simplifying administrative procedures, and modernizing the planning process through more
participatory approaches and greater accountability of public service providers for
achievement of development outcomes.
B. World Bank Group Strategy and Lending
The World Bank Group is employing a broad range of instruments, elaborated in the CPS, to
support the objectives laid out in the SEDP 2006–10 and other key strategies of the
Government. These instruments include the World Bank’s Poverty Reduction Support
Credits (PRSCs), other development policy and investment operations, and analytical and
advisory activities; the IFC’s equity, loan, and technical assistance (TA) participations and
the Mekong Private Sector Development Facility (MPDF); Multilateral Investment
Guarantee Agency (MIGA) activities; and donor partnerships and ODA coordination.
Scale of the World Bank Group program: Vietnam’s IDA allocations depend on its
performance relative to other eligible IDA recipients and on the overall IDA resource
envelope. During FY09–FY11 (the IDA 15 replenishment period), Vietnam’s IDA
commitments will likely average more than US$1 billion equivalent annually. In FY10, the
World Bank (IBRD) processed its first two IBRD operations for Vietnam, totaling
US$700 million. At more than US$2.1 billion equivalent for IDA and IBRD combined, the
FY10 program significantly surpassed that of prior years, and Vietnam is the World Bank’s
eighth largest borrower in FY10. World Bank operations in FY11 will likely continue to
exceed US$2 billion. Thereafter, World Bank lending volume will depend inter alia on the
outcome of the IDA 16 replenishment discussions. There are currently 43 active IDA credits
totaling US$5.7 billion equivalent of which US$1.8 billion has been disbursed, and one
IBRD loan in the amount of US$200 million, approved but not yet effective. The IFC and
MIGA programs are also expected to grow in the coming years.
Lending program: The ongoing second series of five Poverty Reduction Support Credits
(PRSCs 6–10) is the centerpiece of the World Bank’s policy lending program during the CPS
period. These operations support the reforms envisaged chiefly in the SEDP 2006–10, which
also serves as the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) for Vietnam. PRSC 9 (US$150 million
equivalent) is expected to be approved by the World Bank’s Board in June 2010.
The five PRSC operations in the first series mainly supported implementation of the

6
Government’s Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy. PRSC 1 was
approved by the World Bank’s Board in June 2001, in parallel with a PRGF operation by the
IMF. It focused on structural reforms in trade liberalization, the financial sector, state-owned
enterprises (SOEs), and private sector development. Subsequent PRSCs have had
significantly broader scope and supported policy actions in areas such as health, social
protection, education, and environmental protection and natural resource management. They
have also included actions to build modern governance systems in Vietnam, such as those
aimed at public financial management and public administration reform, and fighting
corruption. The number of PRSC co-financiers increased from 4 under PRSC 1 to 12 under
PRSC 7. In addition to providing resources, PRSCs serve as a donor coordination device as
well as a single, unified platform for policy dialogue between Vietnam’s partners and the
Government on a broad range of issues.
The World Bank’s operational program also includes sector development and investment
operations aligned with the four pillars of the CPS. A sector development policy lending
program supported poverty reduction, another one higher education reform, and a third one
power sector reform. Vietnam’s first IBRD operation, approved in FY10, launched a
development policy loan series supporting public investment reforms and aligned with the
governance pillar of the CPS. Well over half of sector investment commitments have
financed infrastructure projects, with the balance focused on the health and education sectors,
rural development, and public administration reform. More than 75 percent of the FY11
lending program is expected to finance infrastructure investments. Thereafter, it is expected
that infrastructure would continue to dominate the lending program, especially Vietnam’s
IBRD borrowing.
Knowledge program: The World Bank supports the Government’s efforts to strengthen
institutional capacity through its knowledge program of analytical and advisory services. The
annual Vietnam Development Reports (VDRs), written in coordination with a large number of
donors and submitted to the annual year-end Consultative Group meeting, summarize the
accumulated knowledge in a specific policy area of Vietnam’s reform agenda. Recent VDRs
have focused on tackling the challenges to attainment of SEDP objectives (2007) as well as
thematic areas such as social protection (2008), business development (2009), and modern
institutions (2010). The next VDR will focus on the management of Vietnam’s natural resources.
Other reports during this period included Infrastructure Finance, Higher Education and Skills
for Growth, Country Financial Accountability Assessment, Policy Agenda for Health Sector
Transition, Health Financing, Financial Sector Strategy, and a series on Vietnam’s
Infrastructure Challenges. Forthcoming reports include High Quality Education for All,
Infrastructure Regulatory and Policy Reform; Regional Development and Urbanization;
Science, Innovation, and Technology Review, Poverty Analysis, Social Safety Net Technical
Assistance, Gender Assessment, Prioritizing Climate Change Investments, and Support to
National Development Strategy and SEDP 2011–15. In addition, the World Bank continues

7
to provide advisory services in areas such as tax policy, social security, and public financial
management reform.
C. IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
Since the expiration of the PRGF in April 2004, the two institutions have closely
collaborated in the discussions of PRSC triggers and benchmarks in the policy areas that
used to be covered by the PRGF agreement. The IMF has provided Letters of Assessment in
support of PRSC operations. In the area of public financial management, the World Bank has
an investment credit to support the introduction of a modern Treasury and Budget
Management Information System, and coordinates technical inputs on a large multi-donor
trust fund for public financial management reform. The World Bank is also following up on
the technical assistance provided by the IMF in relation to tax reform and revenue
management. An investment credit for tax administration reform has been set up to this
effect. Joint work is also under way in support of the establishment of a modern central bank,
with the IMF providing technical assistance on monetary policy and operations, and both the
World Bank and IMF providing technical assistance on banking supervision. The World
Bank has also set up an investment credit to reorganize the State Bank of Vietnam and to
develop appropriate information management systems.
Since 2005, the World Bank and the IMF have jointly prepared an annual Debt Sustainability
Assessment. The Asian Development Bank has joined since 2009. The IMF and the
World Bank also collaborate in the development and timely dissemination of reliable
economic and financial statistics. The IMF focuses on improving balance of payments, and
national accounts, and price statistics, while the World Bank provides assistance on issues
related to the production of high-quality household and enterprise surveys.
The two institutions have coordinated closely on the recent macroeconomic turbulence faced
by Vietnam. Their joint inputs to government were instrumental in the adoption of the
stabilization package of March 2008 and its subsequent implementation. The World Bank
and the IMF have also coordinated their policy dialogue with the government in relation to
the stimulus policies adopted between late 2008 and early 2009 and, more recently, they
jointly supported the rebalancing of the government policy stance toward a greater focus on
macroeconomic stability.

ANNEX III. VIETNAM: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
The Asian Development Bank (AsDB) resumed its operations in Vietnam in October 1993.
The Country Strategy and Program (CSP) 2007–10 was endorsed in October 2006 and was
fully aligned with and designed to support implementation of the Government’s
Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP) 2006–10. The goals of the CSP were to help the
Government reduce poverty incidence to 10–11 percent of households by 2010, achieve the
Millennium Development Goals/Vietnam Development Goals and exit from low-income
country status. Recognizing Vietnam has actually achieved poverty reduction through rapid
economic growth, the CSP was also growth-oriented with focuses on: (i) Business-led,
Pro-poor Economic Growth: AsDB support aimed to help the Government develop the
foundations for increased private sector investment and employment; (ii) Social equity and
balanced development: in addition to supporting education, health, targeted poverty
reduction, and rural infrastructure, the CSP addressed communicable diseases such as avian
influenza and HIV/AIDS; gender and other equity issues were mainstreamed in AsDB
projects; (iii) Environment: the CSP supported natural resources management, emphasizing
the link between resources depletion and persistent poverty, through assistance on
biodiversity, water, and coastal resources management and livelihood improvement.
Governance has been addressed through all AsDB operations and regional cooperation has
also been strongly supported through a number of projects. As Vietnam is now preparing the
new Socio-Economic Development Strategy for 2011–20 and Socio-Economic Development
Plan 2011–15, the AsDB is also preparing a new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for
2011–15 to further supporting Vietnam’s continuing rapid growth as a new middle-income
country in line with AsDB’s Strategy 2020.
From October 1993 until April 2010, the AsDB approved 91 sovereign loans and guarantee3
totaling over US$8.5 billion, comprising US$4.6 billion from highly concessional Asian
Development Fund (ADF) and US$3.9 billion from less concessional Ordinary Capital
Resources (OCR). The contract awards achievement in 2009 was US$1,781.77 million as
compared with US$390.4 million in 2008. Disbursement in 2009 attained
US$1,093.4 million as compared with US$264.4 million in 2008. The AsDB has also
extended technical assistance grants amounting to $192 million for 237 projects. In addition
to public sector operations, the AsDB has provided US$193.5 million for seven nonsovereign
projects, as well as US$60 million in guarantees under two projects. Vietnam also receives
substantial support under the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) initiatives, involving
Cambodia, China, Lao P.D.R, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam.
Support for policy and structural reforms to improve public sector efficiency and to

10
encourage the development of the private sector is a vital component of AsDB operations in
Vietnam. So far, the AsDB has approved 15 policy-based programs (19 loans) in the
agricultural sector, the financial sector, SOE reform and corporate governance, public
administration reform, SME development, secondary education, and in support of the
multi-donor supported Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC). The AsDB’s policy
dialogue included support for increased efficiency of state-owned utilities through reforming
their rate structure and other measures to increase cost recovery and to strengthen financial
management, policy analysis, and planning. The AsDB is also the key supporter of public
administration reform particularly through civil service reform. A high-level capacity
building program is also in place under the Japan Fund for Public Policy Training (JFPPT)
funded by the Government of Japan.
Following a reorganization of the AsDB’s regional departments in May 2006, Vietnam is
covered by the Southeast Asia Department, along with Cambodia, Brunei Darussalam,
Lao P.D.R., Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines, Indonesia, and Singapore. The
resident mission has been gradually strengthened and is responsible for country economic
monitoring, programming and donor coordination functions, in addition to administration of
36 percent of the ongoing loan portfolio. The resident mission has helped the government
prepare the results-based SEDP 2006–10, through a broad, consultative process, including
preparing the results framework for monitoring SEDP outcomes, and such efforts are
continuing for the development of SEDP 2011–15. To implement the principles of the Paris
Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, the resident mission actively participates in the Partnership
Group on Aid Effectiveness with the Government and other development partners (which
was reorganized to be Aid Effectiveness Forum in 2010), taking a lead in harmonizing social
safeguard policies and procurement rules and procedures between the Government and
donors. The AsDB also actively participates in the “Six Banks Initiative,” with Agence
Française de Développement (AfD), KfW Development Bank, Korea Eximbank, Japan
International Cooperation Agency and the World Bank, to harmonize project preparation,
implementation, monitoring and evaluation practices, and improve the quality and
effectiveness of investment projects.
The AsDB and IMF staffs work closely together to support the process of economic reforms
in Vietnam. The AsDB staff interacts with IMF missions, exchange information, and
regularly consult on policy matters. The resident missions of the two institutions cooperate
closely. The AsDB has taken part in the 2008 Vietnam debt sustainability analysis for the
first time with the IMF and the World Bank.

ANNEX IV. VIETNAM: STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of June 16, 2010
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but broadly adequate for surveillance. Most affected areas are:
national accounts, government finance and external sector statistics.
National Accounts: The General Statistics Office (GSO) provides quarterly (cumulative) and annual data on GDP
by type of economic activity and annual data by expenditure (both in current and constant prices), and monthly and
annual data on external trade, industrial output, retail sales, and prices. The annual constant price GDP estimates
have 1994 as the base year and are in need of updating. While the national accounts methodologies are broadly
consistent with the SNA93, the compilation process suffers from poor data collection practices and a lack of
coordination and communication between data collection agencies.
Prices statistics: The CPI methodology is largely in line with international standards. However, there is only a
notional inclusion of owner-occupied and rental housing. Also, there is a need to adopt a geometric mean of price
relatives at the lower level of aggregation, instead of the upward biased arithmetic mean. Trade price indices are also
compiled, but not used in the national accounts.
Government finance statistics: Government operations data reflect the consolidated operations of the state budget,
which cover all four levels of government (central, provincial, district, and commune). However, they exclude data
on off-budget investment expenditure, onlending, quasi-fiscal activities of the central bank (and state-owned
enterprises (SOEs)), and extrabudgetary funds, among which are the Social Security Fund, Enterprise Restructuring
Fund, Development Assistance Fund, Export Support Fund, local development funds, and the Sinking Fund (for
repayment of on-lent funds), for which data are not compiled/disseminated on a regular basis. Compilation is on a
cash basis for final annual data, but varies for provisional data depending on their source. As a result, government
financing data, in particular domestic bank financing, cannot be reconciled as reported in the fiscal and monetary
accounts. The World Bank and the IMF have recommended improving the coverage of fiscal data and aligning
definitions with the GFSM 2001. A new budget law, expected to become effective 2013, is likely to significantly
enhance the quality of fiscal reporting.
Monetary statistics: A key shortcoming is insufficient sectorization of bank credit. The IMF’s Statistics
Department (STA) has encouraged the SBV to develop a reporting scheme for a comprehensive breakdown of
banks’ credit to the economy by borrowing sectors, subsectors, and ownership of enterprises. In addition, STA has
recommended that: (a) a list of SOEs that have been privatized and therefore should be classified as private
enterprises should be distributed to banks in order to guide their data reporting on enterprises; (b) funds for
onlending should be reclassified out of banks’ “unclassified liabilities” to “other deposits.” Further cooperation from
the authorities is needed to resolve data discrepancies involving credit data for a state-owned bank. These
discrepancies may reflect possible noncoverage and/or omission of certain loans and financial leases, offset by lower
deposits and other liabilities.
External sector statistics: Monthly and annual trade data have been compiled using customs reports, but the
coverage and accuracy of these data need to be improved. In particular, the commodity breakdown of a large share
of reported exports and imports (approximately 22 percent and 1627 percent respectively in 2006) is unknown. Data
on invisibles continue to be based largely on banking records, which provide incomplete coverage and identification
of the types of transactions. Improvements are particularly needed for data on tourism revenue and workers’
remittances. STA has recommended that the Government Statistical Office, Ministry of Planning and Investment,
and State Bank of Vietnam work jointly to improve FDI questionnaires and processes, including collecting data on
both stocks and flows. Overlapping responsibility for debt statistics has at times resulted in some deficiencies in
coverage, including the lack of monitoring certain leasing arrangements (e.g., for aircraft).

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation
with Vietnam
On July 28, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Vietnam on a lapse of time basis. Under the IMF’s lapse of time
procedures, the Executive Board completes Article IV consultations without convening formal
discussions.
Background
Facing the downturn from the global crisis, Vietnam successfully supported growth in 2009,
realizing a 5.3 percent growth, one of the better performances in developing Asia. However, the
sizable stimulus measures resulted in elevated macroeconomic risks. The trade deficit
deteriorated since the summer, and domestic residents dramatically shifted from dong assets
into U.S. dollar assets and/or gold, leading to a substantial balance of payments deficit
(8¾ percent of GDP) and significant depreciation pressures on the dong. The parallel market
exchange rate fell to about 10 percent below the weaker end of the official band in late 2009,
and by end-2009 gross international reserves (GIR) declined to about two months of imports
projected for 2010.
In November 2009, the authorities shifted the policy priority from growth to macroeconomic
stability. The dong was devalued by 5½ percent in November 2009 and by another 3½ percent
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
in February 2010. Monetary tightening through liquidity squeeze in December, the termination of
interest subsidy scheme for short-term loans at end-2009, and the liberalization of lending rates
in early 2010 led to a slowdown in credit growth, affecting especially activity in construction and
financial services. Most fiscal stimuli were also terminated at end-2009. Partly as a result, real
GDP growth slowed in 2010 Q1.
In late March 2010, the government began to balance growth and stability, marking the largely
successful exit from the substantial stimulus policies during 2009. Market confidence in the
dong has been restored, and both interbank and parallel exchange rates appreciated back
within the official band and have remained stable. Inflation is subdued, thanks largely to a
decline in rice prices, and the trade deficit has been contained. Yet, the market does not seem
fully convinced about the sustainability of the existing macroeconomic stability later in 2010,
judging by the wide spreads between the overnight interbank rates and the rates for longer
maturities especially beyond three months. Inadequate clarity on government policies,
exemplified by repeated statements by the government to favor lower commercial lending and
deposit rates, while lowering short-term interest rates through its open market operations, has
undermined market confidence. Thus, the current macroeconomic stability does not appear
robust. The immediate goal for the government is, therefore, to sustain market confidence and
take the opportunity to rebuild GIR.
The near-term outlook hinges critically on maintaining current macroeconomic stability. In staff’s
baseline scenario, with the assumption that stability is maintained, real GDP growth for 2010 is
projected to be 6½ percent, underpinned by buoyant private investment, consumption, and nonoil
exports. Current inflation projection of 10.4 percent (y/y) for the year as a whole depends
importantly on the development of commodity and food prices.2 The current account deficit is
expected to narrow to 9 percent of GDP in 2010, and short-term capital outflows (including the
errors and omissions) are expected to moderate significantly, allowing a modest build up of
reserves in 2010. This baseline scenario is most sensitive to domestic macroeconomic stability,
which could be affected by perceived occasional incoherence between the government’s policy
stance and its public statements. External downside risks, including possible spillover effects
from Europe, are expected to be manageable provided that macroeconomic management
remains prudent.
Fiscal policy is on track of consolidation in 2010. The 2009 overall fiscal deficit is estimated to
have widened to about 9 percent of GDP (from about 1 percent of GDP in 2008), mainly
reflecting declines in oil revenues and a spending surge related to the stimulus package.3 With
2

Headline inflation in July slowed to 8.2 percent (y/y). While food prices increased, the decline in
items such as construction materials and fuel contributed to the deceleration.
3

Based on IMF definition, which differs from the national definition in, for example, the treatments of
the local government surplus and off-budget investment spending.

3
most stimulus measures expiring at end-2009 and a favorable growth outlook ahead, the fiscal
deficit is projected to narrow to about 6 percent of GDP in 2010, largely owing to a decline in
total investment spending by 3 percentage points of GDP over 2009.
Bank profitability was supported by high loan growth and low loss provisioning in 2009, but in
2010 it may not reach such high levels. Average return on asset of the six largest banks,
including four state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs), increased to an annualized 1.9 percent
(1.5 percent in 2008). Noninterest income (e.g., gold trading) contributed to higher profitability in
some private banks. However, in 2010, narrowing interest margin, higher provisioning costs, the
moderation of credit growth, and the closure of gold trading could constrain profitability at some
banks. At end-2009, nonperforming loans (NPL) declined to 2.0 percent (2.1 percent in 2008)
according to the official report, partly due to rapid credit growth. However, pressure on credit
quality, including of the large loan portfolio disbursed under the interest subsidy program, may
translate into higher NPL down the road.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2010 Article IV consultation with Vietnam, Executive Directors endorsed staff’s
appraisal, as follows:
Vietnam has managed to ride out difficult challenges in recent years, which deserves
international acknowledgment. As soon as an overheated economy in 2007, owing to rapid
capital inflows, was successfully cooled down, an external demand shock triggered by the
global crisis had to be countered in 2009 by a sizable stimulus package. As the stimulus policy
began to threaten macroeconomic stability toward end-2009, a successful exit (monetary and
fiscal tightening) was made. The fact that most fiscal measures were introduced with a sunset
clause also helped the timely exit.
Macroeconomic stability is maintained for now. The policy tightening that started at end 2009
has stabilized economic and financial conditions, and helped restore market confidence, as
evidenced by the stable dong exchange rates in both the interbank and the parallel markets.
Whether the current stability can be sustained through the rest of 2010 and beyond depends on
whether the government can maintain and enhance market confidence by limiting, for instance,
deterioration in the trade deficit or a decline in the U.S. dollar liquidity in the financial system.
Thus the repeated announcements by the government about the need to lower the commercial
lending rates may be counter-productive.
Maintaining a solid economic recovery will require the government to prioritize
among its multiple goals. The government has stated that in 2010 it aims at the growth target
(6.5 percent), inflation target (7 percent, now officially projected at 8 percent), credit growth
target (25 percent), and money supply growth target (20 percent), while maintaining a stable
dong exchange rate. It may be difficult to convince the market that the government can achieve

4
all these objectives with relatively blunt policy tools, namely OMOs and budget, especially if
there’s no apparent hierarchy of objectives. A lack of coordination between monetary and fiscal
policies, or the appearance thereof, would amplify market skepticism. The government,
therefore, needs to convince market participants that its priority rests with macroeconomic
stability. For this purpose, staff believes that maintaining the current stable exchange rate, and
taking the opportunity to rebuild GIR, should be the immediate goal for the government. Once
the government’s credential for macroeconomic stability is established, and GIR is further built
up, staff believes that the government will be able to adopt a more flexible exchange rate
regime without risking resurgent devaluation pressures.
Monetary policy should be prudent and its effectiveness should be further strengthened. Further
loosening, real or perceived, could disrupt the existing macroeconomic stability, and could inflict
substantial damage to the growth prospect, not just for 2010, but even for the medium term. To
enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy, the operational improvement in OMOs, and the
gradual normalization of the interest rate, structure should also progress. The early indications
are that the new SBV Law, approved in late June, strengthened operational authority of the
SBV, though the details have yet to be clarified.
Exchange rate regime should be reformed over the medium term. In the medium term, a move
from the current regime that focuses on the bilateral dong/U.S. dollar exchange rate to a system
that is based on a basket of currencies including those of regional trading partners may be
appropriate. In the process, a wide use of the U.S. dollar in the economy (partial dollarization)
could be wound down. In addition, further exchange rate flexibility is encouraged once
necessary infrastructure, particularly in terms of hedging instruments, is readily available for the
private sector to manage foreign exchange rate risks effectively.
There is room for further reduction in the budget deficit in the medium term. In 2010, total
investment spending is expected to decline by 3 percentage points of GDP from the 2009 level
to about 11 percent of GDP. Staff believes that there is room for further reduction in investment
spending, for example, by project prioritizing, increased cost efficiency, and the use of PPP and
other innovative financing methods. This would enable the government to reduce both the
budget deficit and the public and publicly-guaranteed debt levels over the medium term.
Strengthening the financial sector requires further reform. While welcoming the ongoing efforts
to strengthen supervisory capacity, more could, and should be done. An FSAP is expected to
help the authorities establish a reform agenda and a concrete timeline. One of the fundamental
problems facing Vietnam is over-banking: while the introduction of the minimum capital
requirement at end-2010 could promote consolidation of smaller banks, further streamlining
should be pursued in the medium term. The equitization (privatization) of SOCBs should also be
advanced. As the economy is driven more by market principles, the government is required to
change its style of policy conduct. For instance, moral suasion could create distortions that need
to be addressed later at a higher cost. Reforms of SOEs and SOCBs would not only provide a

5
level playing field, but also raise the efficiency of the economy. Most importantly, transparency
in government intentions, based on higher quality data published timely, should be further
advanced to provide market players predictability.
