EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Economic environment. The economy has recovered following the stabilization of
commodity and food prices. The recovery, however, is mainly supported by public
infrastructure projects, and private sector activity remains weak. The fiscal situation has
somewhat improved, but spending pressures are building up with elections approaching.
Outlook and risks. While the gradual release of delayed infrastructure grants is expected to
stimulate the economy, structural impediments to private sector development and volatile
commodity prices could hold back the recovery. Given the lack of private sector initiatives,
the planned decrements in Compact grants and continued outward migration, medium-term
growth will likely remain weak.
Fiscal sustainability. Achieving long-term budgetary self-reliance has become more
challenging after the global crisis. Lower than anticipated returns on the government’s trust
fund imply a large projected revenue shortfall in FY2023, when the annual Compact grants
are set to expire. Closing this revenue gap would require a medium-term fiscal surplus of
about 5¾ percent of GDP.
Fiscal reforms. The tax reform bills have been submitted to the national congress; the
technical issues regarding the constitutionality of the bills appear to have been resolved, and
support for the tax reform at State level seems strong. Further strengthening of tax
administration efforts, personnel training, and public education in parallel with the legislative
process carry utmost importance.
Private sector development. Weak private sector development continues to hold back
sustainable economic growth. With a number of infrastructure projects completed, reforms to
attract foreign direct investment (FDI) could generate significant benefits. The policy
priorities would be to relax the restrictive FDI legislation, increase the supply of skilled
labor, and accelerate the implementation of pending infrastructure projects.
Financial sector. The banking sector remains liquid, but contributes little to economic
growth. Activities by the public development bank and credit unions are currently not
regulated and should be brought under the supervision of the Banking Board. Insurance
supervision has recently been separated from banking supervision, but its supervisory
capacity is inadequate and should be immediately stepped up, particularly in the area of
captive insurance.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) is a small Pacific Island country
highly dependent on external aid, mainly from the United States.1 A renewed Compact of
Free Association Agreement (“Compact”) with the United States effective since FY20042
steadily lowers transfers to the FSM through FY2023. Thereafter, the FSM is expected to
complement its domestic revenues with returns from its Compact Trust Fund (CTF) and
other savings. The amended Compact has tightened rules on reporting, auditing, and the use
of grants, which have proved difficult for the national and state governments to meet. As
a result, about $150 million (over 50 percent of GDP) in grants has not been used,
contributing to weak economic performance in recent years.
2.
The Article IV discussions focused on policies to secure a sustained recovery and
achieve long-term economic and fiscal sustainability. In addition to delays in Compact
disbursements, the surge in global commodity prices and the global financial crisis have
taken a heavy toll on the FSM economy. The economy has contracted since FY2006, and the
value of the CTF has declined significantly. The political environment for reforms remain
challenging with presidential elections scheduled for March 2011, which could delay the
passage of key tax legislation. Against this background, the discussions focused on the fiscal
and structural policies needed to secure a recovery and achieve long-term sustainability.

employment in public sector in certain
states. Inflation is estimated to have significantly slowed to 3.5 percent (y/y) in FY2010, after
reaching 7.7 percent in FY2009, due to moderating food prices and decline in fuel and
services prices.
1

The FSM (with a population of about 102,000) has four states—Chuuk, Kosrae, Pohnpei, and Yap, each with
its own executive and legislative bodies. Authority is highly decentralized, with state governments significantly
larger than the national authority.
2

The fiscal year runs from October to September (for example, FY2010 covers October 2009 to
September 2010).

5
4.
The consolidated fiscal balance has also improved, but with differences across
states. Chuuk and Kosrae have reduced public employment and salaries in line with the
annual decline in Compact grants. Fishing fees temporarily increased along with the rise in
fish catch, while tax revenues have expanded thanks to improved tax administration. As
a result, the consolidated overall balance recorded its first surplus in six years of 1.6 percent
of GDP in FY2009. However, performance varied across states, with Chuuk achieving
a modest surplus and Yap and Pohnpei continuing to draw down their savings. In Chuuk,
which is still struggling over a significant amount of debt (See Box 1), the authorities
highlighted the difficulties in containing expenditures, given the already reduced working
hours for non-Compact public employees, but nevertheless remained committed to keeping
a balanced budget.
5.
The current account deficit widened and external debt rose in FY2009. High fuel
prices and grant-financed imports related to construction activities have worsened the current
account. At the same time, external debt rose significantly in FY2009 mainly due to the
$12 million borrowing by the FSM Telecom to finance fiber-optic installation, but the level
of debt has remained relatively low at about 30 percent of GDP and is mostly on
concessional terms.
6.
The recovery will likely remain weak, and the consolidated fiscal surplus is
expected to decline in the near term. Growth in FY2010 is estimated at 0.4 percent,
supported mainly by infrastructure projects. The near-term outlook is overshadowed by
sluggish private sector growth, which has been unable to offset the scheduled annual decline
in Compact grants. Medium-term growth is estimated to increase slightly to 0.6 percent,
supported by additional infrastructure projects in the pipeline. The fiscal surplus is expected
to decline through FY2010–11 with the gains in tax revenues more than offset by the decline
in fishing fees and increase in current expenditures related to the upcoming elections. The
current account is expected to remain in deficit due to imports from ongoing infrastructure
projects.
7.
Risks are on the downside. While the release of delayed infrastructure funds is
expected to stimulate the economy, structural impediments to private sector development and
volatile commodity prices could hold back the recovery, leading to further delays in fiscal
adjustment, and elevating sustainability concerns. Long-term risks include the possible loss
of fish stock and reduction of farmland due to climate change and growing outward
migration.
8.
The authorities acknowledged the challenges facing the FSM in offsetting
Compact decrements. In this context, they are currently in the process of developing statespecific solutions through a nationwide economic symposium to look into ways of promoting
private sector and reducing import dependence by shifting to local production. To better
manage risks stemming from volatile commodity prices, they are also considering developing
an energy policy in line with best practices in other resource scarce countries.

Box 1. Micronesia: Public Finance in the State of Chuuk
Although Chuuk State has gone through significant fiscal adjustment since FY2007, it still
faces major challenges in reducing its sizeable debt. Based on the report prepared for the
Compact, the debt liabilities stood at about $28.9 million (about 37 percent of state GDP) as of
FY2009, including loans to Asian Development Bank (AsDB) and accumulated arrears for land
acquisition and vendor payments. To reduce arrears and expenditure related to the non-conforming
uses of the capacity-building sector grant, the state undertook a decisive fiscal consolidation in
FY2008–09 through a severe public workforce downsizing of about 300 people (about 13 percent
of state public employment) and by reducing working hours for non-Compact related employees
from 80 hours to 64 hours. As a result, fiscal balance has been restored since FY2008.
The authorities are expected to maintain fiscal discipline in FY2010 and FY2011. A small
fiscal surplus is expected for FY2010, partly reflecting higher tax collections due to improved tax
administration. While the authorities intend to remain current with the expenditures, they still fall
short of making contributions to the infrastructure maintenance fund. For FY2011, the authorities
envisage a balanced budget.
A debt relief task force has been established to explore ways of reducing the debt. The
accumulated debt is sizeable and its reduction will be a major challenge. Proposed measures to
reduce debt include selling of the state holdings of bank shares, earmarking a one percent increase
in the sales tax for debt servicing, and canceling the cross-claims with the utility company, but they
are not likely to be enough to reduce the debt significantly. The authorities are, therefore, looking
into other options to rollover the debt, including through bond issuance or borrowing from
commercial banks. However, staff strongly cautioned against refinancing existing debt with new
debt, pointing to the possibility of significant increase in future debt burden unless adequate fiscal
surpluses are secured.
Staff encouraged the authorities to continue building up fiscal surpluses to reduce
accumulated debt rather than simply earmarking tax revenues. In this context, the authorities
and staff agreed on the importance of verifying amounts owed in accordance with the existing laws
and accumulating fiscal surpluses by resisting the pressures to increase wage bill and limiting the
non-Compact funded expenditures. Staff cautioned in particular against plans to prematurely
increase the working hours of non-Compact financed public employees.
Improving the governance and implementation of Compact grants can further enhance their
effectiveness. The problems regarding land title issues, lack of qualified personnel, and weak
project planning have caused significant delays in the implementation of infrastructure projects.
While performance audits for Compact sectoral projects are conducted, the enforcement of the
findings has been weak. For example, the public auditor’s office identified problems regarding
procurement practices, but there is no effective implementation process in action. The effectiveness
of the grants can be enhanced by introducing mechanisms ensuring the enforcement of the
improvements identified by the auditors, detailed project planning at an early stage, and contracting
of qualified personnel at both manager and technical level. In this context, the efforts by legislature
to resolve the land title issues and the ongoing effort of better contracting practices are an
encouraging sign.

7
III. POLICIES TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE GROWTH
A. Fiscal Policy
9.
Achieving long-term fiscal sustainability has become more challenging. Staff
projections indicate that the resources in CTF and other unreserved accounts will not be able
to supplement expiring Compact-related grants in FY2023 without significantly disrupting
public services (Appendix I). Owing to the sharp drop in global equity markets, CTF
experienced a cumulative net investment loss of around 17 percent over FY2008—FY2009,
before recovering partly in FY2010. Based on conservative investment returns, limited fiscal
adjustments, and structural reforms, the income shortfall is projected to reach $16 million
(about 6 percent of FY2010 GDP) when Compact sector grants expire in FY2023, higher
than the estimates (5 percent of GDP) in the 2008 Article IV Consultation report. The
authorities agreed that even if the returns on assets recover, the CTF will likely not generate
enough revenue to maintain the same level of government operations in FY2024.
10.
Long-term sustainability could be achieved through increasing the fiscal surplus
to around 53 4 percent of GDP by

authorities to start the adjustment in FY2011, as further delay would increase the cost of
adjustment (See appendix I). While the authorities recognized the need for the early
adjustment, they noted the difficulties in starting next fiscal year due to spending pressures
related to Presidential elections and challenges in coordinating fiscal policies across the
states.

ahead. In Pohnpei, the mission supported the planned expenditure cuts, but recommended a
more targeted approach rather than across the board reductions.
Box 2. Micronesia: Challenges for Northern Pacific Islands Countries with
Compact Grants
Many northern Pacific Island countries (PICs), including FSM, Marshall Islands
(RMI), and Palau, are likely to face significant fiscal adjustment and reform
challenges under the Compact. These countries are highly dependent on foreign grants,
with a sizeable public sector. Despite a large share of foreign grants devoted to capacity
building and private sector development, implementation has been slow and large gaps
persist in attaining budgetary self-sufficiency. This box discusses the challenges for these
three countries in overcoming their heavy reliance on Compact grants.
Most foreign grants in these three countries are through the financial provisions
under the Compact agreement with the United States. For the FSM and RMI, sector
grants from the amended Compact are set to expire in FY2023, while Palau’s new
agreement with the United States lasts for 15 years until FY2024. Grants under the
agreement are about $250 million. In recent years, foreign grants accounted for about
50–60 percent of the overall revenue in these countries, with Compact-related grants
making up a large portion.
Heavy dependence on grants translates into large fiscal imbalances and sizeable
public sectors. While overall fiscal positions are roughly in balance across all three
countries, their current deficits excluding grants are significant between 15 percent and
35 percent of GDP (Figure B2.1). With domestic revenues about at the same level as
public wages across all three countries, these countries rely entirely on foreign grants to
finance other current expenditures and capital spending. The overall public sector
(including public enterprises) accounts for more than half of the economy, crowding out
private sector activity. Public sector payrolls far exceeded those in the private sector in the
FSM and RMI and wage gaps have remained since the amended Compact agreements took
effect in FY2004. In the FSM, the public sector wages increased substantially in FY2009,
particularly for the national government.
In light of their heavy reliance on grants, significant fiscal adjustment is needed in all
three countries to ensure fiscal sustainability. The required size of adjustment in staff
estimates varies across the three countries, reflecting factors such as different arrangements
under the Compact, and ranges from about 5 percent of GDP for RMI, around 5¾ percent
of GDP for FSM, to about 8 percent of GDP for Palau. However, in all three, the required
medium-term adjustment is substantial, requiring a comprehensive approach combining
expenditure cuts, revenue improvements, and structural reforms (Table B2.1). A delay in
adjustment would result in more costly and difficult adjustments in the future.

consolidation plan with clear
targets for public wages and other administrative spending. A multi-year plan would also
guard against election-related spending and secure the gains from painful expenditure cuts
over the past few years, while safeguarding critical spending on health care, education and
infrastructure. For such a plan to be credible, effective public communication is essential.
13.
Building the right incentive mechanism into the public financial management is
key. In this context, similar to those on Compact-funded expenditures, public performance
audits should be extended to cover general operations financed by local revenues. The
authorities should ensure that subsequent enforcement of the audit findings, such as weak
procurement practices, is followed through and incorporated into budget planning.
14.
Even with significant expenditure cuts, swift implementation of the planned tax
reform is still needed. Despite the wide recognition of the importance of a comprehensive
tax reform, progress has stalled. A set of tax reform bills to create a Unified Revenue
Authority (URA), and introduce net profits tax and value added tax (VAT), in place of the
current gross revenue tax and sales tax, has been submitted to Congress. These reforms
should generate additional revenue amounting about 3 percent of GDP. Although the
technical problems regarding the constitutionality of the URA and the VAT appear to be
resolved, prospects for completion of tax reform are still uncertain with political priorities
shifting towards the upcoming election and continued coordination problems among the
national and state governments. National and state legislatures are not likely to pass the bills
before the March 2011 elections, with each legislature waiting for the other to move first.
The Congressional leaders are planning to visit states in attempts to break the gridlock.
15.
Although tax administration has improved, there is still room to enhance current
operations of the state and national tax offices and expand personnel training. This, if
done in parallel with the legislative process of tax reform bills, would help facilitate a smooth
transition to the new system and avoid a fall in the tax collection. In addition, expanding
communication and the consultation process to involve community groups, including small
enterprises, would help generate more broad-based support for the legislative process. The

11
authorities agreed with the proposed approach and noted the need for technical assistance on
personnel training during the process.
16.
The mission supported the steps to reduce unfunded liabilities of the social
security system. As highlighted by the authorities, unfunded liabilities of the social security
are large at about $232 million (89 percent of GDP) as of January 2009. To address the
problem, the authorities passed a new bill in 2010, increasing social security tax rates by
2 percentage points and reducing benefits by 50 percent for retirement before the age of
65. Staff supports the move and encourages the authorities to monitor closely the projected
balance of social security funds for any deviation from the targeted path given that these
measures provide only a partial relief going forward.
B. External Stability and Exchange Rate
17.
The FSM has experienced a real appreciation since the global downturn.
Following the surge of domestic food and fuel prices in FY2008, the real effective exchange
rate has appreciated by 9 percent, posing a risk of loss of competitiveness with respect to
other Pacific Islands countries. Looking forward, the FSM could regain competitiveness as
the pressure to domestic prices subsides or reforms to improve productivity take hold. The
authorities acknowledged such risks but noted that their main export items, particularly niche
tourism, are not sensitive to the exchange rate or changes in global demand.
18.
Despite the appreciation, the risks to external stability are limited, and the use of
the U.S. dollar as currency remains appropriate given the size and the links of the
economy. While tourist arrivals and overall exports fell more than those of regional peers,
staff and authorities agreed that the Compact grants would continue to provide a stable
source of funding over the next decade and the U.S. dollar remain the appropriate currency.
19.
However, increased debt repayment on foreign loans (about 1½ percent of GDP)
and scheduled decrements of Compact grants could create some pressure and would
require careful monitoring of the external position. The authorities are considering
a foreign denominated loan from the Export-Import Bank of China amounting $20–25
million (about 7–9 percent of GDP) to upgrade a Pohnpei fishing processing plant. While the
details of the loan and its commercial viability are not yet decided, staff recommended
a careful consideration of the terms of the loan, including its currency risk, debt repayment
burden, and potential government obligation involved, in view of its possible impact on
external debt sustainability.
C. Private Sector
20.
The private sector in the FSM is stagnant and contributes little to growth. The
authorities highlighted several obstacles for vibrant private sector development including
difficulties in land tenure and registration, poor infrastructure, lack of skilled labor, a large
public and private sector wage differential, limited access to credit by start-ups, and

12
regulatory hurdles for inward FDI.4 They also emphasized difficulties stemming from high
transportation costs and energy prices.
21.
The FSM has recently completed a number of key infrastructure projects, which
could support the private sector. The extension of Pohnpei airport, to be completed in mid2011, has the potential for expanding tourism with direct flights from the region and more
broadly Asia. It also has the potential for increasing niche exports, such as fish, sakow (local
alcohol drink), and other agricultural products. The authorities noted that the relocation of
a U.S. Marine base to Guam is also likely to expand opportunities for both tourism and
agriculture. The expanded fiber-optic network, completed in 2010, is expected to improve
overseas communication.
22.
Building on these infrastructure projects, reforms to attract inward FDI could
generate significant gains. Greater FDI is especially feasible in the areas of aquaculture,
agriculture, and tourism. In order to seize this opportunity the FSM needs to overcome many
challenges:


FDI Legislation. The Foreign Investment Act in several states are restrictive, with
regards to both ownership and renting of the land, and investment approval. The Acts
should be reviewed to ensure an environment conducive to FDI, while respecting
local investors’ legitimate interests. Harmonizing FDI legislation across states could
also reduce investment uncertainty and facilitate large-scale FDI. Greater clarity on
land tenure and regulation, which varies by states, would also help. In this context,
staff welcomes the proposal to relax the Pohnpei Foreign Investment Act along these
lines.



Lack of skilled labor. The limited availability of skilled labor holds back FDI.
Improving education and vocational training while relaxing legal restrictions on
hiring of expatriates may help ease this barrier. At the same time, joint ventures
would create positive spillover effects through skill transfers.



Inadequate infrastructure. Without reliable infrastructure in power, transportation,
and communications, foreign investors face steep challenges in entering the FSM.
With about US$150 million still not utilized, greater utilization of Compact
infrastructure grants should be given priority. In this context, improving project
management and procurement of resources would accelerate the existing projects in
the pipeline.

23.
The authorities shared the staff’s view that the FSM business environment
remains very challenging. On FDI, the Pohnpei legislators noted that the Foreign
Investment Act of the state was very restrictive and were considering revision to make it
more investment friendly. The Pohnpei government also acknowledged the slow progress in
4

st

In the most recent Doing Business report by the World Bank, the FSM ranks 141 out of 183 countries in the
world, the lowest among Pacific Island countries in terms of the ease of doing business. The FSM fares
especially poorly in such areas as registering properties (183th) and protecting investors (173th).

13
mapping, surveying, and certification of land and the need to step up efforts in these areas, in
view of their critical role in supporting private activities. Some private sector representatives,
on the other hand, expressed reservations regarding foreign investment, pointing to potential
negative impacts stemming from limited use of domestic factors of production and
knowledge spillover.
D. Financial Sector
24.
The banking system remains liquid, but renders little support to the private
sector. Since the last Article IV, non-performing loans have declined to about 2¾ percent of
total loans, and banks have maintained sufficient liquidity with a loan to deposit ratio of
about 36 percent in FY2010. The risk-adjusted capital ratio stays high at over 30 percent. The
increase in deposits in FY2010 reflects a few accounts related to the ongoing infrastructure
projects. However, the majority of deposits are being held in safe financial assets rather than
being lent to the private sector. Under the secured transaction act, there has only been a small
increase in lending, mainly auto-loans.
25.
The Banking Board’s supervision capacity has improved, but would benefit
from further strengthening. The Banking Board performs on-site supervision with
technical assistance from PFTAC. However, staff turnover remains high and newly
appointed staff need additional training. Staff supported continued efforts to strengthen onsight monitoring of liquidity policies, compliance with AML laws and loan-loss provisions.
Staff also highlighted the importance of operational independence and well-defined legal
authority of the Banking Board for prudential regulatory purposes and supported the revision
of the Banking Act in this direction.
26.
The staff also recommended that the FSM Development Bank and other nondeposit taking financial institutions be supervised by the Banking Board. Over half of
the loans in the Development Bank are under substandard and doubtful categories, with
insufficient provisioning against possible losses. The Development Bank also plans to go
beyond the current focus on commercial lending and compete directly with private banks in
retail lending. The staff cautioned against under-provisioning for poor-performing loans and
potential risk exposures on consumer lending, and reiterated the importance of bringing both
credit unions and the Development Bank under appropriate regulation and supervision in line
with the international best practices.
27.
There is an urgent need to increase the capacity for insurance supervision,
especially in the area of captive insurance.5 There are currently three captive insurance
companies licensed in the FSM, and three more are expected over the coming months. These
companies are now supervised by the Insurance Board, which recently separated from the
Banking Board. The Insurance Board, however, lacks adequate staffing, data processing
5

Captive insurance company provide insurance or reinsurance for risks of the entity or entities to which it
belongs. Captive insurance activities are seen by some as a possible revenue source from licensing fees and
taxes.

14
capacity, and specialized skills to perform effective supervision. The authorities agreed with
the need to step up their supervisory capacity and would seek technical assistance from the
Fund and other agencies. They also noted the need to strengthen the national tax
administrator’s capacity to audit foreign corporations.
E. Other Issues
28.
The reliability, coverage, and timeliness of economic statistics need to be
improved to guide policies. Domestic capacity to produce economic data in all sectors
remains limited, though some progress has been made in the area of balance of payment
statistics. In particular, the authorities are encouraged to collect consolidated fiscal data
across national and state governments in a timely manner to determine fiscal policy priorities.
In addition, collecting remittance data should be given priority in light of continued outward
migration.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
29.
Growth prospects in the FSM remain weak given the sluggish private sector and
the scheduled decline in Compact grants. The FSM’s recovery relies mainly on public
infrastructure projects, with limited private sector support. While growth could be supported
in the short term through the release of delayed infrastructure grants, long-term growth would
only be achievable through sound fiscal and structural policies.
30.
The global crisis has increased the urgency of major fiscal and structural
reforms. The FSM has relied heavily on the amended Compact to advance its economic
development and sustain a large public sector. The CTF suffered large losses during the
global financial crisis, and is unlikely to generate sufficient income to supplement the expiry
of Compact grants in FY2023. Further delays in needed reforms would lead to more costly
adjustments in the future.
31.
The fiscal balance has improved, but the need for significant adjustment
remains. Securing fiscal sustainability will require swift implementation of the planned tax
reform and tight expenditure control. Consolidation should begin in FY2011 with the passage
of the proposed tax bills at both the national and state levels and further improvements in tax
administration. On the expenditure side, the priority is to contain spending, especially in the
run-up to the spring elections. A medium-term budgeting framework would also improve
expenditure control.
32.
At the same time, reforms to facilitate foreign direct investment would enhance
growth, create new employment, and generate higher revenue. The priorities should be to
further liberalize the foreign investment regime, improve project management and
procurement of resources, increase the availability of skilled labor through external
contracting as well as domestic training, and reduce the large public-private wage gap.
33.
Supervision over the financial system should be enhanced. A refocusing of the
FSM Development Bank to avoid direct competition with commercial banks would help

15
promote the development of the financial system. At the same time, supervision should be
extended to cover credit unions and the FSM Development Bank, while insurance
supervision should be strengthened, particularly in the growing area of captive insurance.
34.
The U.S. dollar remains the appropriate currency for the FSM, given the size of
the economy, its close ties to the United States, and limited administrative capacity for
independent monetary and exchange rate policies.
35.
Improving domestic capacity to compile data is necessary to strengthen
monitoring and policy analysis. Fund staff, including through PFTAC, will continue to
assist in this area.
36.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the
24-month cycle.

Figure 1. Micronesia: Regional Comparison of Recent Developments
Compared to the PICs, the FSM is one of the few countries that recorded positive
growth in FY2009, but inflation remained high. The high current account deficit reflects
Compact related spending, and the improvement in fiscal balance is noticeable among
the other Pacific Island economies.

Following the contraction in FY2008, the economy recovered in FY2009. CPI inflation
remained high for FY2009, but moderated in the second half of the year. The current
account deficit remains high, reflecting high commodity prices and construction related
imports. The fiscal balance improved despite the pick up in expenditures.

APPENDIX I: MICRONESIA—LONG-TERM FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY
This appendix assesses the FSM’s long-term fiscal sustainability, updating the estimates
in the 2008 Article IV consultation. The analysis considers implications of the expected
expiry of annual Compact grants on the fiscal sustainability of FSM. It rests on a broader
perspective than what the amended Compact agreement envisages in the sense that it looks at
the general self-reliance of the FSM government and incorporates also a case where the
Compact Trust Fund (CTF) would need to offset a possible loss of non-sector grants such as
the Supplementary Education Grants (SEG) under the amended Compact.1 Fiscal
sustainability is measured by the usable government’s asset position as of FY2023 that would
generate an investment income large enough to supplement the expiring Compact grants
without significantly disrupting public services and eroding the Trust Fund value.
The global financial turmoil has put a heavy toll on the financial performance of the
CTF. Net return on assets fell by a cumulative 17 percent over FY2008—09. As a result, the
market value of the CTF fell substantially, before recovering to about $168 million as of endFY2010.
The assessment of the long-term fiscal outlook considers two scenarios. The baseline
scenario features limited fiscal adjustment and structural reforms, while an alternative
scenario considers comprehensive fiscal reforms, including swift implementation of tax
reforms by mid-2011, structural reforms, and better utilization of Compact infrastructure
grants. The alternative scenario also considers the costs of a delay in the tax reform
implementation.
1.

Baseline scenario

The baseline scenario assumes that the recent pickup in the fiscal surplus will gradually
decline and eventually reach a small surplus of about 0.4 percent of GDP, as expenditure
adjusts to the Compact step-down. Medium-term real growth is expected to be low at
0.6 percent, reflecting sluggish investment, continued outmigration, and low productivity
growth. Net investment returns on the CTF are expected to be at 6 percent on average
thereafter, in line with an earlier GAO study.
Under the baseline, the Trust Fund would not generate sufficient investment income to
replace the annual Compact grants expiring in FY2023. By end-FY2023, the stock of
financial assets would be about $800 million (in FY2010 dollars), of which $723 million
would be in the CTF and about $77 million in other funds.2 During the drawdown phrase
beginning FY2024, investment income would only be about $48 million per year. On the
other hand, Compact sector grants in FY2024 are estimated to be $65 million, leaving a
shortfall of about 6 percent of FY2010 GDP. The shortfall would be even larger at over
1

The Compact Trust Fund in FSM was created to contribute to the long-term budgetary self-reliance of the
FSM and to provide the FSM government with an ongoing source of revenue after FY2023. The amended
Compact and their subsidiary agreements contain no commitments, either express or implied, regarding the
level of the revenue that will be generated by the Trust Funds, nor is there any commitment regarding the
degree to which the revenue will contribute to the long-term budgetary self-reliance of the FSM.

10 percent of GDP if the Supplemental Education Grants (SEG) is discontinued after
FY2023. With no firm commitment of grants beyond FY2023 and lack of vibrant private
sector activity, the government would be forced to either sharply cut expenditures or rapidly
deplete its accumulated savings.
Higher investment returns could narrow the shortfall, but are unrealistic over a long
horizon. To generate sufficient investment income to offset the expiring Compact grants, the
net investment returns would need to be as high as 7.2 percent per year until FY2023, which
would require a riskier and more aggressive investment strategy inappropriate for sound
public finance management.
2.

Alternative scenario

Fiscal sustainability can be achieved through significant fiscal adjustment and
structural reforms to promote private-sector growth. In an alternative scenario, the
government would fortify the recent fiscal
surplus by accumulating the savings (e.g.,

term fiscal sustainability would be achieved by gradually improving fiscal balance (frontloaded) by about 1.1 percent of GDP per annum for five years to reach 5.8 percent of GDP in
FY2015, and maintaining that level until FY2023. The budget would return to the path under
the baseline scenario after FY2023.
In the alternative scenario, the stock of government assets (including cumulative earnings
from these fiscal surpluses) would reach about $1.1 billion by the end of the Compact period
in FY2023, thus generating sufficient income to offset the expiring Compact grants.
Additional savings would be required to reach a higher asset level to generate additional
income if supplementing the SEG as well. The required fiscal adjustment is higher than that
in the 2008 Article IV Staff Report by about 2 percentage points of GDP (see text charts).
The difference reflects the significant decline of the CTF asset value during the financial
crisis, which more than offset the modest public savings since then.

Under the federal system in the FSM, each state would need to supplement the CTF
returns with its own fiscal savings. Staff estimates suggest that all states would need to
undertake fiscal reforms; however, the size of the required adjustment differs across states
according to their initial deficits and stock of financial assets (text table). For example, the
state government in Pohnpei would need to improve fiscal balance by about $7 million from
its position in FY2010, possibly through public payroll reduction and tax reforms.

Alternative scenario but with delays in tax reforms

Delays in implementing tax reforms would
increase the fiscal adjustments needed to
reach sustainability. If the implementation of
tax reforms delayed by one year (until mid2012), the medium term fiscal surplus needed
to achieve the sustainability (6.3 percent of
GDP) would be higher than the original
alternative scenario by about ½ percentage
points, thus requiring even more challenging
adjustments (See text chart).

ANNEX II. FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA—RELATIONS WITH THE
PACIFIC FINANCIAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTER (PFTAC)8
Since 2000, the Center’s assistance to the FSM has included 30 advisory missions, mostly in
the areas of tax policy and administration, financial sector supervision, and statistics. The FSM
has also sent a number of officials to various regional seminars and workshops organized by
PFTAC.
Tax Administration and Policy
PFTAC designed a comprehensive tax reform program to help FSM improve the
effectiveness of its tax regime and raise additional revenue. In 2005, the President approved
recommendations of the Tax Reform Task Force and established an Executive Steering
Committee to manage the reform process. The FSM authorities are currently discussing the
legislation drafts prepared by IMF Legal Department. PFTAC has provided assistance in
revenue estimation, communications and IT strategies, and continues to provide assistance on
tax administration improvements and project management.
PFTAC has also participated in customs modernization program including development and
implementation of the PC Trade computer software system and provided related TA to
facilitate trade, speed up clearances, and improve data accuracy.
Financial Sector Regulation and Supervision
In May 2006, a PFTAC advisor visited FSM to review draft insurance legislation. An aide
memoire was provided to authorities on the supervision of insurance in FSM. The mission
discussed and reviewed the proposed insurance legislation and followed up on aspects of
issues identified in an IMF technical assistance (TA) mission in March 2006. The
Commissioner was cognizant of the need to establish a legislative and supervisory
framework for insurers, domestic and foreign, which are active in FSM. Subsequently, a
peripatetic expert was assigned by the Monetary and Capital Markets Department (MCM) to
the FSM to provide assistance to the Commissioner in insurance regulation and supervision.
In addition to the peripatetic advisor on insurance regulation and supervision, the PFTAC
advisor also visited the FSM in April 2008. The PFTAC advisor provided assistance to the
Commissioner in a number of areas, including drafting proposed regulations for the
supervision of captive insurance companies, reviewing and making recommendations
regarding applications submitted by a foreign bank to expand the number of branch offices in
the FSM, and providing training in off-site bank supervision to Commissioner’s staff. In

The Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Center (PFTAC) in Suva, Fiji is a multi-donor
technical assistance institution, financed by IMF, AsDB, AusAID and NZAID, with the IMF
as Executing Agency. The Centre's aim is to build skills and institutional capacity for
sustained economic development. Member countries are: Cook Islands, Federated States of
Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa,
Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. This annex is prepared on the basis
of the input from the PFTAC staff.

4
September 2010, the PFTAC advisor provided assistance and training to Banking Board staff
in conducting an on-site bank examination. Assistance activities included providing
guidance and training the completion of examination procedures for assessing the adequacy
of branch liquidity policies, verifying the accuracy of prudential returns, assessing the
adequacy of the compliance with AML laws and policies, and credit risk practices. Guidance
was also provided to the supervision staff in the preparation of appropriate comments
documenting apparent violations of laws and regulations. The PFTAC advisor continues to
liaise closely with the authorities as needed.
Economic and Financial Statistics
A workshop on National Accounts was conducted in October 2006 by the PFTAC Statistics
Advisor and an expert. Wider macroeconomic statistics issues were also covered briefly, and
an outreach program involving education of officials in the four state governments of the
importance and uses of macroeconomic statistics was conducted.
The PFTAC Statistics Advisor undertook a TA mission to Pohnpei during October 2008 to
improve the national accounts statistics. During the mission, the advisor completed a review
of the latest current and constant price GDP estimates. A number of improvements were
proposed, including in the coverage of the informal sector and subsistence activities and use
of more appropriate price deflators and volume indicators. In addition, a number of
recommendations were made to further strengthen the national accounts methodology and
source data. The mission concluded that at this stage, producing estimates of GDP using
production and expenditure approaches as well as gross value added (GVA) by industry is
not feasible due to source data limitations. On-the-job training in compilation of GDP using
the income method was also provided as part of the review process of data sources and
compilation spreadsheets.
An expert provided by PFTAC undertook a TA mission during May 2009 to improve the
balance of payments statistics. The mission reviewed source data, methodology and
processes and made a number of recommendations for improvement. On-job training was
provided.
FSM participated in a regional national accounts training seminar conducted in Fiji in July
2009 and a regional BOP course in Fiji from November to December 2010.

ANNEX III. FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA—RELATIONS WITH
1
THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (ASDB)
The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) became a member of the AsDB in 1990, and has
received a substantial amount of assistance since that time. As at December 2009, the FSM
has received eight loans, 1 grant, and 43 TA grants.2
The AsDB has assisted the FSM by (i) supporting good governance, with a particular focus
on economic management and accountability; (ii) ensuring inclusive social development; and
(iii) promoting sustained private sector-led economic growth. The approach of the ADB has
been to focus on a few key constraints: careful analysis of the political economy;
a preparedness to closely manage and support operations; a move away from complex
federally administered and state delivered multistate and multisector projects; adoption of
home grown solutions; and simple and realistic project outcomes.
Under AsDB’s country operations business plan for 2011–13 special attention will be given
to supporting infrastructure development, especially power sector development and transport.
Support to the energy sector will reduce heavy reliance on fossil fuels, through renewable
energy in the form of hydropower, solar energy, and wind energy. Emphasis will be placed
on the need for institutional and tariff reform supported by full cost recovery at Utility and
State level.
Currently there are two active loans. The Omnibus Infrastructure Development project loans
(totaling $19m), approved in 2004, are designed to enhance public health, environmental
quality, and surface water quality through improved wastewater infrastructure and
management for Pohnpei and improved delivery of water services and expanded water
supply systems for Yap and Kosrae; and improved management and provision of power in
Chuuk.
AsDB’s non-lending program has focused on improving public sector efficiency,
effectiveness, and accountability, as well as raising public awareness through community
consultation and participation programs, particularly in Chuuk and Kosrae. Further Technical
assistance will be provided to provide for capacity building in project management and
procurement processes to support infrastructure development.

ANNEX IV: BANK-FUND COLLABORATION
37.
The Bank and the Fund country teams maintain a close working relationship and
have an ongoing dialogue on a range of macroeconomic and structural issues.
38.
The teams agreed that FSM’s main macroeconomic challenges are to reduce its
high dependency on the Compact support from the U.S., which is due to expire in
FY2023, while enhancing the prospects for private sector development. To achieve these
goals, FSM needs to undertake a decisive fiscal reform as well as to improve business
environment.
39.
Based on this shared assessment, the teams identified the following structural
reform areas as macro-critical, in view of their central role in achieving fiscal
consolidation and sustained growth:
(i) Comprehensive revenue reform. FSM collects little revenue from its income and
sales taxes, compared with other Pacific Island countries. The government’s tax reform
package, which includes the introduction of VAT and the net pr ofits tax, and
establishment of the Unified Revenue Authority (URA), is yet to pass the Congress,
behind the schedule by more than 1 year. The successful tax reform would also benefit
the private sector by improving efficiency.
(ii) Reform of the state-owned enterprises (SOEs). SOEs put a significant burden on
FSM’s budget, while possibly crowding out private firms. They pay higher wages than
in the private sector, receive subsidized government loans, and are not subject to the
gross revenue tax. The government has taken some steps, including the shutdown of
insolvent enterprises such as the National Fisheries Corporation, but more needs to be
done.
(iii) Financial sector reform. Commercial banks are reluctant to lend to local
businesses despite their ample liquidity. Part of the reason is the inherent risk of start-up
lending, the high fixed costs associated with small loans, and the difficulties in
collecting on collateral. Moreover, the FSM Development Bank continues to lend to
well-established firms rather than supporting start-ups. To improve access to credit, it is
necessary to redirect the focus of the FSM Development Bank, expand micro-credit
through credit unions and micro-credit agencies, and improve the functioning of the
secured transaction framework.
(iv) Reform of the statistical system. Limited domestic capacity to produce economic
data prevents understanding of the contribution to the economy of sectors as tourism,
fisheries and agriculture, making difficult timely policy response to any shocks to those
sectors. Strengthening the statistical capacity is macro-critical, because timely and
reliable provision of data is required to assess the economic conditions appropriately and
to make necessary policy decisions accordingly.
40.
The teams agreed to continue the close cooperation going forward. Appendix I
details the specific activities planned by the two country teams over the period September

8

2010 – August 2011 along with their expected deliveries. The Bank is currently in the
process of reclassifying FSM from an IBRD to an IDA-eligible country. This reclassification
will have implications for the Bank’s potential lending program and the relevant outcomes of
discussions with the government will be shared with the Fund team.

ANNEX V. MICRONESIA—STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of December 13, 2010, 2010
V. ASSESSMENT OF DATA ADEQUACY FOR SURVEILLANCE
General: Data have serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance. Shortcomings
are most serious in government finance and balance of payments statistics.
National Accounts: External consultants funded by the U.S. Department of Interior have
prepared the national income accounts from FY1995 to FY2009. Some shortcomings remain,
for instance, no unemployment and investment/savings indicators are available.
Price statistics: A quarterly consumer price index (CPI), rebased to 2008 and utilizing
expenditure weights derived from an earlier household survey, is published for the Federated
State of Micronesia (FSM) as a whole and each state. However, the data releases suffer from
considerable lags, which prevent an accurate and timely evaluation of domestic price
movements. For instance, the FY2010 consumer price index has not yet been finalized.
Government finance statistics: The national and the state governments and public sector
enterprises publish annual audit reports detailing their fiscal operations; consultants put these
data in a GFS format with a lag of about one year. The accuracy of the tax revenue data
compiled by the authorities need improvement as they are sometimes different from the audit
reports. Further improvements in the quality and timeliness of the fiscal data depend on greater
cooperation between the national and state governments. Micronesia does not present fiscal
data using the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) format.
Monetary statistics: The Banking Commissioner reports monthly monetary data to STA with
a two- to three-month lag. The data comprise interest rates, the accounts of the monetary
authorities, commercial banks, and the FSM Development Bank. The Commissioner has taken
the view that the banking law prevents the sharing of this information outside the Banking
Board, hampering domestic surveillance.
Balance of payments: The Office of Statistics, Budget & Economic Management, Overseas
Development Assistance and Compact Management (SBOC) publishes annual estimates of the
balance of payments and external debt statistics. The data on workers’ remittances are highly
incomplete. Delays of data release impart a high degree of uncertainty to analysis of external
sector developments. The SBOC aims to produce quarterly balance of payments statistics and
to introduce new data sources, such as surveys.

VI. DATA STANDARDS AND QUALITY
Micronesia does not participate in the IMF’s
General Data Dissemination System.

No data ROSC is available.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
Micronesia
On January 26, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). 1
Background
The FSM’s economy is highly dependent on external aid, and private activity contributes little to
growth. A renewed Compact of Free Association agreement (“Compact”) with the United States,
effective since FY2004, steadily lowers transfers to the FSM through FY2023 and has stricter
rules on the use of grants, which have proved difficult for the national and state governments to
meet, holding back growth in the FSM economy in recent years.
In addition to delays in Compact grants disbursements, the surge in global commodity prices
and the global financial crisis have taken a heavy toll on the FSM economy, with growth
remaining in the negative territory for three consecutive years from FY2006 to FY2008. The
economy stabilized in FY2009 (0.4 percent growth), mainly supported by infrastructure projects
and the rise in subsistence agriculture. Inflation is estimated to have significantly slowed to 3.5
percent in FY2010, after reaching 7.7 percent in FY2009.
The consolidated fiscal balance has also improved, but with differences across states. Some
state governments have reduced public employment and salaries in line with the annual decline
in Compact grants. Fishing fees temporarily increased along with the rise in fish catch and
general tax revenues have expanded thanks to improved tax administration. As a result, the
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

consolidated overall balance recorded its first surplus in six years of 1.6 percent of GDP in
FY2009. However, performance varied across states, with some struggling over a significant
amount of debt and others drawing down their savings.
The current account deficit widened and external debt rose in FY2009. High fuel prices and
grant-financed imports related to construction activities have worsened the current account. At
the same time, external debt rose significantly in FY2009 mainly due to the $12 million
borrowing by the FSM Telecom to finance fiber-optic installation, but the level of debt has
remained relatively low at about 30 percent of GDP and is mostly on concessional terms.
The recovery will likely remain weak. Growth in FY2010 is estimated at 0.4 percent, supported
mainly by infrastructure projects. The near-term outlook is overshadowed by sluggish private
sector growth and the scheduled annual decline in Compact grants. Medium-term growth is
estimated to increase slightly to 0.6 percent, supported by additional infrastructure projects in
the pipeline. Structural impediments to private sector development and volatile commodity
prices could hold back the recovery, and other long-term risks include the possible loss of fish
stock and reduction of farmland due to climate change and growing outward migration.
Achieving long-term economic sustainability has become more challenging after the global
crisis. Under current projections, lower than anticipated returns on the government’s trust fund
imply a large projected revenue shortfall in FY2023, when the annual Compact grants are set to
expire. Closing this revenue gap would require a substantial fiscal adjustment over the mediumterm.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that the Micronesian economy had rebounded from the impact of the
global crisis and that infrastructure grants in the pipeline are expected to support the modest
recovery. Over the medium term, however, further fiscal adjustment and bolder structural
reforms will be needed to lift growth prospects, reduce the dependence on grants, and expand
the role of the private sector.
Directors welcomed improvements in the fiscal balance. However, they stressed that a credible
consolidation strategy, including a timely implementation of tax reform, improvements in tax
administration, and tight expenditure control, especially on public sector wages, will be
necessary to ensure fiscal sustainability and prepare for the expiry of Compact-related grants.
Recognizing the difficulty in implementing these reforms, Directors encouraged the authorities
to promote dialogue and coordination at the national level and among the four states. They also
emphasized the need to protect critical social and infrastructure spending.
Directors agreed that a multi-year fiscal plan will help guard against spending pressures and
guide the authorities’ consolidation efforts. They welcomed the steps taken to reduce unfunded
liabilities of the social security system. Underscoring the need to reduce the debt, Directors
cautioned against using savings to finance current expenditures and against contracting
additional foreign loans.
Directors stressed that stepping up structural reforms will accelerate private sector development

3
and support fiscal consolidation. They encouraged the authorities to relax FDI legislation,
improve labor skills, and strengthen procurement practices to attract foreign investors.
Enhancing the capabilities of the statistical office and the quality of economic statistics,
particularly for the fiscal accounts, would also strengthen policy planning and evaluation.
Directors welcomed advances in oversight by the Banking Board and observed that granting it
operational independence and a well-defined legal authority would further strengthen the
supervisory framework. They recommended bringing the FSM Development Bank and other
non-deposit taking financial institutions under appropriate regulation and supervision.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
Reader to view this pdf file) for the 2010 Article IV Consultation with Micronesia is also available.

Statement by Christopher Legg, Executive Director for the Federates States of Micronesia and
Benjamin Pereira, Advisor to the Executive Director
January 26, 2011
Background
Our Micronesian authorities appreciate staff’s frank assessment of the developments in the economy
and the constructive exchange of views that characterized these consultations. The consultations
provided a timely stock take, prior to the March 2011 elections, of the progress made in recent years,
and the remaining challenges to preserve macroeconomic stability and ensure long-term growth.
Micronesia is a small Pacific island country that has a total population of 110, 218 (2006) living on a
land area of 700 square kilometers, and scattered across 2.9 million square kilometers of Exclusive
Economic Zone (EEZ). The federation consists of four autonomous states guaranteed by its
constitution. This autonomy presents complex and diverse challenges for the Federated States of
Micronesia.
As noted by staff, Micronesia’s recent recovery has been underpinned by the gradual implementation
of delayed infrastructure projects. Sustainable growth in the medium to long-term will hinge on
improving the implementation of Compact grants, adjusting fiscal policy over the medium-term to
the reduction in these grants, and fostering a larger role for the private sector in the economy.
Compact Fund
The authorities appreciate the continued support from the international community, in particular from
the United States through the Compact Fund. However, the mismatch in the capacities that exist in a
small island country, like Micronesia, and the administrative requirements of development partners,
is a major challenge. To overcome this challenge, our authorities are determined to work with
development partners to improve the timely utilization of the Compact Fund and further private
sector investments.
Macroeconomic Stability
Fiscal Policy
The authorities had made significant progress in restoring medium term fiscal balance, following an
average deficit of 5.9 percent of GDP over FY2004-FY2008. This was achieved through the
implementation of stringent measures across states, despite social and political risks.
Appendix 1 clearly sets out the size of the fiscal challenge involved to ensure that the current level of
public service can be maintained in 2024. With the inability of the Compact Trust Fund (CTF) to
supplement expiring Compact-related grants, the authorities acknowledge the necessity of early
containment of current expenditures and fiscal reforms in order to attain the required level of fiscal
surplus. The authorities also agree with the medium-term target, but the implications of the

2
forthcoming election, and the challenge of coordination across states, mean that the path of
adjustment will likely be slower.
Nevertheless, my authorities recognize that early containment of current expenditures, in particular
public wages, is essential to attaining the required fiscal surplus. For example, notwithstanding the
social and political costs, the Chuuk jurisdiction has pursued significant workforce downsizing and
reduced working hours for non-Compact related employees, aimed at reducing current expenditures
and restoring fiscal balance. But our authorities consider a more targeted approach, rather than
across-the-board reductions, to be desirable, given the wide diversity of the fiscal situation
confronting the individual states, and the spending pressures associated with the Presidential
elections. Such an approach will help ensure priority spending on healthcare, education, and
infrastructures are safeguarded. Legislation passed in 2010 has reduced the unfunded liabilities on the
social security system and the authorities’ continuous monitoring will ensure affordability. The
authorities also consider the collection of the consolidated fiscal data a pre-requisite for the
development of the multi-year fiscal plan.
Tax Reforms
The staff report correctly highlights the central importance comprehensive tax reform legislation to
create a Unified Revenue Authority (URA) and introduce a net profits tax and value added tax
(VAT). Passage of these bills will necessarily have to await the election and the formation of a new
government. In the meantime, the authorities will pursue the enhancement of the current operations
of the state and national tax offices and broaden personnel training, in anticipation of the broader tax
reform. This will be supported by sustained utilization of technical assistance from PFTAC and other
development partners, incorporating wherever possible the lessons from the experiences of
comparable Pacific island countries that have already undertaken such reforms. Complimenting these
efforts, and critical to the success of the reforms, will be a more targeted public awareness program
regarding the reforms. In many ways, the Article IV consultation was a watershed moment for
officials at all levels of government to understand the value and thinking behind the tax reforms bills.
Equally, with the authorities conducting state summits, followed by a national economic summit,
economic opportunities and challenges will be fully aired, providing a broader context for issues of
tax reform and fiscal sustainability. Technical assistances from the Pacific Forum Secretariat (PFS)
and other development partners such as the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) may be
requested, to ensure focused discussions.
External Stability
Despite the low level of debt to GDP and its concessional nature, the authorities are aware of the
fiscal and exchange rate risks posed by foreign denominated loans. Given this, the authorities are
committed to closely monitoring the pressures from foreign loans and the scheduled decrements of
Compact grants, on external stability.
Financial Sector
The banking system is highly liquid, with limited lending to the private sector. Nevertheless, the
authorities will ensure that the Banking Board is adequately resourced and it’s regulatory and
supervision capacity is strengthened. The ambit of the Banking Board’s powers will be expanded to

3
include the development bank and non-deposit taking financial institutions under its regulatory and
supervision functions, consistent with international best practice. Continuous use of PFTAC technical
assistance will be critical in training new staff and strengthening the Board’s capacity for on-sight
monitoring of liquidity policies, compliance with AML laws and loan-loss provisions. The newly
created Insurance Board will also benefit from technical assistance from the Fund and other agencies,
to enhance its supervisory capacity and strengthen foreign corporation auditing.
Private Sector Development
Although the private sector has been stagnant and has contributed little to growth, it is hoped that the
recent completion of key infrastructure projects such as the extension of the Pohnpei airport, the
expanded fiber-optic network, and the relocation of a US Marine base to Guam, will support private
sector development.
The authorities also see merit in reviewing restrictions imposed by Foreign Investment Acts, at both
levels of Government, regarding the ownership and renting of land to harmonize and provide greater
clarity on land tenure practices across the states, while respecting local investors’ legitimate interests.
As always in the Pacific, this is a delicate issue. The lessons learnt from the Pohnpei FDI legislation
will assist greatly in refining FDI legislation across FSM. The authorities also recognize the
importance of a sustained public consultation strategy on these matters, to ensure broad awareness
and acceptance of the need to reform.
The authorities concur with staff that limited availability of skilled labor holds back FDI. They agree
that strengthening education and vocational training is critical and note that this is a long term issue
that requires more targeted efforts. In this vein, our authorities are working closely with the Asian
Development Bank to redesign vocational and education training to ensure effectiveness. Moreover,
the authorities believe that the creation of better working conditions, and greater consistency across
states, will assist in retaining skilled labor, especially with the forthcoming job opportunities in
Guam. These developments will be discussed further at the national summit. In the short run, the
authorities believe that relaxing legal restrictions on hiring expatriates may assist, but only if the
expatriates’ roles are well-defined and targeted, appropriate counterparts are identified and follow-up
mechanisms are put in place for knowledge transfer. The authorities will solicit technical assistance
to assist in these development efforts.
Adequate Infrastructure
The strengthening of project management and the capacity to meet procurement requirements for
access to external resources remains a medium to long term goal. The authorities will utilize
technical assistance from development partners to accelerate the implementation of projects,
especially in the context of planned Compact decrements. While utilizing technical assistance, the
authorities will ensure that knowledge and skills are transferred to local counterparts, to ensure its
sustainability. These efforts will assist greatly with the needed improvements in the power,
transportation and communications sectors

4
Economic Statistics
The improvement of the reliability, coverage, and timeliness of economic statistics is critical for
policy discussion. The authorities will collect consolidated fiscal data across national and state
governments on a timely manner, with technical assistances from PFTAC and SPC. Also, with
remittances playing an important role in the Micronesia, the authorities will request the Fund,
PFTAC and other development partners for technical assistance.
The authorities continue to value the Fund’s assessment of its policies and will welcome a staff visit
later this year.
