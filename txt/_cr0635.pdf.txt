• Discussions. Discussions for the Article IV consultation and the second review under the PRGF
arrangement were held in Tegucigalpa during January 24–February 8, 2005. The mission met with
President Maduro, senior government officials, leaders of congress, and representatives of the private
sector and civil society. The team comprised L. Breuer (Head), E. Flores, R. Guimaraes, and C. Macario
(all WHD), S. Reichold (PDR) and G. Mitchell-Casselle (MFD), and was assisted by A.L. Coronel, the
resident representative. A. Cheasty (WHD) joined the mission on January 31.
• Second review under the PRGF. The authorities remain committed to the policy objectives of
boosting growth, reducing poverty, and achieving financial stability, through further fiscal consolidation,
financial sector reform, and structural reforms. Program implementation has been broadly satisfactory,
with one exception. All end-2004 PCs except one were met, and the structural agenda has moved
forward broadly in line with the program. However, an end-December PC on issuing regulations to
integrate teachers’ benefits (effective 2007) was not met due to strong opposition from teachers.
• 2005 Article IV consultation. The Article IV discussions focused on the medium- and long-term
perspectives for Honduras, including the main economic vulnerabilities, growth and competitiveness,
and governance and transparency.
• HIPC completion trigger conditions. All trigger conditions with one exception have been met. The
trigger condition related to the financial sector calls for, inter alia, substantive compliance with Basel
Core Principles (BCP); while Honduras is only expected to fully meet BCP by the end of the program,
MFD and IDA staff support a waiver on the basis of the progress being made in this area (the financial
sector reform program is on track). A companion paper describes the fulfillment of trigger conditions in
more detail.
• Last Article IV consultation. Directors called for a comprehensive adjustment program,
emphasizing the need for broad domestic ownership of a well-sequenced reform agenda aimed at fiscal
consolidation and control over the government wage bill, addressing financial sector vulnerabilities,
greater exchange rate flexibility, and improving governance.
• Fund relations. A three-year PRGF arrangement was approved on February 27, 2004 for
SDR 71.2 million (55 percent of quota). The first program review was completed on September 24,
2004.
• Article VIII obligations. Honduras has accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Section 2, 3, and
4 of the Articles of Agreement, and maintains a system that is free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions.

Executive Summary
•

The economic situation has improved significantly since the last Article IV
consultation. Growth has rebounded, led by investment and exports; inflation has
stabilized, after increasing in 2004 mostly on account of higher oil prices; and the
external position has strengthened significantly.

•

The improved performance reflects sound economic policies—supported by
the PRGF arrangement approved in February 2004—and broadly favorable
external conditions. In recent years, slow growth and weak governance
contributed to social unrest. However, at end-2003, the government succeeded in
garnering domestic consensus on a Fund-supported economic reform program.
Key program objectives include fiscal adjustment, containing the increase of the
wage bill in a lasting way, reform of the financial system, and improving
governance.

•

Program implementation has been satisfactory, although an important step
in the reform of the teachers’ salary structure is being postponed. All
quantitative PCs for end-December were met, some with ample margin. The
budget approved for 2005 is in line with the program, and the authorities are
upgrading monetary operations. Structural reforms have moved forward,
including changes to the tax and criminal codes and the creation of tax courts. The
issuance of regulations to integrate teachers’ supplementary benefits into their
salary effective from 2007 (a PC for end-December) has been rephased.

•

The overall policy strategy supported by the PRGF arrangement is being
maintained. The key fiscal policy challenge in 2005 will be to maintain control
over the wage bill and sustain the tax effort, while increasing investment and
poverty spending. Other priorities are to contain inflation and continue to
implement the revised prudential norms for the financial sector.

•

Honduras faces important challenges in the medium term. A prudent public
sector wage policy is a critical element of a sustainable medium-term budget. The
implementation of CAFTA and the opening of the telecommunications market
will help boost growth prospects, although there will also be a need for measures
to offset lower government revenue. The still weak financial sector also poses a
risk, particularly if the economy were to take a downturn, and the de facto
crawling peg is a constraint to the economy’s resilience to external shocks. These
issues are being addressed under the program, including through fiscal and
financial sector reforms and the program to strengthen monetary operations (as a
precondition to any movement toward greater flexibility in the exchange rate
regime).

After many years of disappointing growth performance, the authorities are
implementing a strategy to boost growth. In the period 1960–2000, output growth in
Honduras ranked among the lowest in the region. During the 1990s when growth recovered
in the rest of Central America, in Honduras it
only kept pace with population growth. In

A. A Brief Medium-Term Perspective

-6-

Box 1. Domestic Consensus on the Program
• Broad consultations facilitated the acceptance of the PRGF-supported program. After
discussions with civil society, the program was well received by most sectors as a means to boost
growth, obtain debt relief, and bolster the PRSP. Holding only 61 of the 128 seats in congress, the
government was able to get legislative approval for the key elements of its program by garnering
the support of two small parties.
• However, in 2004 social tensions re-emerged. The implementation of a prudent wage policy was
resisted by public sector unions, and coupled with rising oil and basic foodstuff prices, led to
broad-based demands to relax fiscal policy. Protests from teachers and health workers caused
serious disruptions, and were followed by demonstrations of public transportation and university
workers.
• The government has persevered with the core elements of the program, while responding to
the unrest with selective accommodation. It strengthened the dialogue with public sector unions,
and granted small wage concessions to teachers and nurses. The authorities also allowed duty free
imports of public transportation units (in line with the regional practice). However, the government
has refused to grant further tax concessions, kept expenditure in line with the fiscal targets, and
maintained the flexible system of domestic oil prices.
• There are risks of renewed pressures and unrest in the run-up to the elections, particularly if
oil prices remain high. Teachers are strongly opposed to making the current restrained wage
policy permanent. The government has reaffirmed its commitment to the program, and is engaging
the main political leaders, including the recently elected presidential candidates, to ensure that the
program’s core elements are protected during the campaign and to promote policy continuity under
the next administration.1/ The challenge will be to convince the body politic that continued
successful program implementation will be crucial for sustained economic recovery, continued
external support, and reaping the benefits of HIPC.
______________
1/
Primaries were held on February 20, 2005 to select candidates for the November 2005 presidential,
legislative and municipal elections. The two main presidential candidates emerging from these primaries
are Mr. Porfirio Lobo (for the ruling National Party) and Mr. Manuel Zelaya (for the opposition Liberal
Party).

3.
Honduras faces significant social and institutional challenges. It is one of the
poorest countries in Central America and social conditions remain depressed, with about
two-thirds of the population living in poverty. Policymaking has been constrained by
persistent structural problems, including short political cycles, powerful vested interests, and
social unrest. The country also faces challenges in the areas of rule of law, corruption, and
government effectiveness.

B. Recent Economic Developments
4.
Economic policies have improved since the 2003 Article IV consultation.
Implementation of the Fund’s policy advice in recent years has been hampered by the lack of
domestic consensus, opposition from vested interests and, at times, social unrest. Echoing
recommendations of earlier consultations, Directors in 2003 called for a comprehensive
adjustment program, emphasizing the need for broad domestic ownership of a wellsequenced reform agenda aimed at fiscal consolidation and control over the government
wage bill, addressing financial sector vulnerabilities, greater exchange rate flexibility, and
improving governance. As noted, the authorities in late 2003 started to implement a mediumterm program that addresses these issues, in line with Directors’ recommendations. In
particular, the fiscal position has been strengthened, the financial sector reform program is on
track, and the reform of monetary operations has been launched. However, as explained
below, further efforts are needed to garner consensus for civil service reform and a
sustainable medium-term wage policy for teachers.1
5.
Economic growth rebounded strongly in 2004. After averaging less than 3 percent
per year in 2001–03, preliminary estimates suggest that real GDP grew by 4.6 percent in
2004—significantly above projections—with a broad rebound across all sectors, including
agriculture. On the demand side, growth reflected mainly private investment and exports,
although consumption also rose (reflecting strong growth of remittances).

6.
Inflation has stabilized, after moving
higher during much of 2004 mainly because
of high oil prices. Following the decline of
inflation in 2003, prices drifted upward in 2004
owing mostly to the surge in international oil
prices (passed through to domestic petroleum
prices), and to a lesser extent the monetary
impact after sterilization of capital inflows. By
the fourth quarter of 2004, inflation stabilized at
around 9 percent (somewhat higher than the
8–8.5 percent targeted under the program).2

7.
Despite a widening of the current account deficit, the external position improved
significantly in 2004. The current account deficit rose to 5.2 percent of GDP in 2004 (from
4.2 percent of GDP in 2003) due to a higher oil bill and imports associated with large private
sector investments in the energy and telecommunications sectors, which were partially offset
by the growth of traditional and maquila exports (i.e., from the export processing zones), and
the large increase in remittances (Box 2). Higher official and private capital inflows more
than compensated for the higher current account deficit. As a result, NIR rose by just under
US$1/2 billion.
8.
The Honduran legislature has ratified CAFTA. With broad support from the main
political parties, earlier this month Honduras became the second Central American country to
ratify the free trade agreement (after El Salvador).
9.
With one important exception, program implementation under the PRGF
arrangement has been satisfactory.
•

2

All quantitative performance criteria (PC) and all but one structural PC for endDecember were met. (Tables 1 and 2 of Attachment II). The quantitative PCs
covered the deficits of the consolidated public sector and central government, the
wage bill for central government, net domestic financing, NIR, and net domestic
assets (NDA). Large margins in NIR and NDA targets reflected the much improved
external position and the central bank’s (BCH) efforts to sterilize the NIR inflows.
The budget approved for 2005 is in line with the fiscal program, and the BCH has
started to upgrade monetary operations. Other structural reforms moved forward
broadly as envisaged under the program.

Inflation reached 9.2 percent at end-2004, or about 2.3 percentage points higher than at end2003. This increase in inflation was smaller than the average increase in the rest of the region
(about 3.8 percentage points), and only slightly above the United States’ (1.8 percentage
points).

-9-

Box 2. Remittances
Remittances have become an increasingly important source of foreign exchange to Honduras. In
2004, remittances are estimated to have grown by about 30 percent, continuing the extraordinary growth
of the previous 10 years (30 percent annual average growth). Remittances are now equivalent to
15½ percent of GDP—about 3 percentage points more than in 2003—and have become the second most
important source of foreign exchange inflows, after exports of goods and significantly exceeding official
disbursements of loans and grants, as well as net maquila exports and FDI.
High growth of remittances can be observed throughout Central America, although it has been
particularly strong in Honduras. Key factors explaining this development are:
•

Immigration to the United States. Most Central American countries experienced substantial
immigration to the United States, followed by significant flows of remittances. However, in
Honduras large waves of emigration took place later than in other countries in the region (in
El Salvador and the Dominican Republic, for example, large-scale immigration began in the
1980s and remittance flows stabilized in the early to mid-1990s). In Honduras, immigration to the
United States intensified after Hurricane Mitch struck in 1998. The United States granted
temporary protected status to 105,000 Hondurans in 1998 (which has since been extended until
2006), allowing many immigrants to seek legal employment. As a result, growth of remittances
has been particularly strong since the late 1990s.

•

Lower transaction costs. Traditionally, remittances have been a high-margin business and fees
often averaged more than 20 percent of the transferred amounts. In recent years, increased
competition (including from banks) lowered transaction costs to about 10 percent. This has
created incentives to increase the amount of remittances and to make more use of official
channels (rather than the informal market), which in turn raises the share of remittances that is
officially recorded.

While overall effects on the Honduran economy are positive, the strong growth in remittances can
create difficulties for macroeconomic management. Remittances have generally been a stable source
of foreign exchange inflows with important economic benefits. However, further increases could create
real appreciation pressures and lead to crowding-out of the export sector.1/ This may be unavoidable in
the long-run, but it can create serious problems as Honduras’ exports sectors (maquila, tourism, and
agriculture) play an important role for growth and employment. Thus, fostering financial services that
could help channel more remittances into productive uses (such as by improving financial services
associated with remittances’ flows) will be an important challenge to help promote growth in the future.

•

The structural PC for end-December on integrating teachers’ benefits into their
overall salary was not met. The PC called for the issuance of regulations to integrate
teachers’ supplementary benefits to the overall wage starting in 2007, based on the
work of a commission.3 However, the commission (composed of representatives of
government and teacher unions) could not agree on a procedure due to strong
opposition from the teachers (Box 3).

•

Implementation of the poverty-reduction strategy (PRS) has been broadly
satisfactory.4 Poverty-reducing spending rose by almost 1 percent of GDP in 2004
(to 8.4 percent of GDP). PRS implementation has been enhanced with expanded
consultations and improved public expenditure management, monitoring, and
evaluation. In the period 1999–2004, the share of the population living in poverty
dropped slightly to 64 percent (from 66 percent), and the share in extreme poverty to
about 45 percent (from 49 percent).

10.
Fiscal consolidation has progressed while priority spending (investment and
poverty programs) has increased. During 2002 and 2003, the authorities implemented tax
measures to boost government revenue.5 In addition, congress approved the December 2003
salary law that made important improvements to the public wage regime (see Box 3). These
policies, together with strict control over expenditures and improvements in tax
administration,6 contributed to lowering the deficit of the combined public sector to 3 percent
of GDP in 2004 (from 5 percent of GDP in 2003). At the same time, poverty spending rose,
as noted, and public investment increased to 6.5 percent of GDP.

3

As prior action for the approval of the PRGF arrangement, in December 2003 congress
approved a salary law that established the new wage regime for the public sector but included
a transitory solution for teachers, with a permanent resolution to be adopted by June 2004
(structural benchmark). When the benchmark was missed, reflecting renewed social unrest
and strong political opposition, it was converted to a PC for December 2004.
4

The PRS is covered in greater detail in the accompanying Joint Staff Advisory Note.

5

These measures included: broadening the income tax base to cover personal income
bonuses; raising withholding rates; eliminating some deductions; introducing a tax on
corporate net assets; and eliminating some exemptions on the sales tax.
6

In September 2004, the authorities imposed strict spending limits that could only be
exceeded with presidential approval. Tax administration efforts focused on increased audits
and the closure of businesses that were delinquent in their tax obligations.

- 11 -

Box 3. Toward a Sustainable Public Wage Policy in Honduras
During the late 1990s, special wage regimes
led to the rapid increase in the wage bill.
Congress created wage regimes for teachers
and health workers (which together comprise
3/4 of the wage bill) that gave automatic pay
increases detached from the budgetary process
on account of time in service and educational
credentials.

wage policy but called for a special
1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006
commission to settle the permanent regime
for teachers starting in 2007. The main
elements of the salary law were: (i) capping the
wage bill for 2004–06; and (ii) using expected inflation to guide wage increases for public workers
(except teachers). For teachers, the law set the increase in their overall wage for 2004–06 and limited
supplementary benefits during this period to the end-2003 level. It also called for a special commission
(with teachers’ participation) to propose a procedure to integrate the supplementary benefits to the
overall wage starting in 2007. The law also stated that increases in the overall wage of teachers would
follow expected inflation starting in 2007, but only if the special commission had established the
procedures for integrating the supplementary benefits to the overall wage.
After a prolonged strike by teachers in July 2004, the authorities agreed to allocate additional
funds to teachers’ benefits. Teacher unions claimed that eligible members were not receiving their
benefits. After extended negotiations, the
Wage Bill
authorities agreed to pay the benefits to a larger
(in
percent
of GDP)
number of teachers, at the rates set in the
12
December 2003 law. The somewhat higher
wage bill with return of benefits in 2007
spending was compensated with savings in other
wages.
10

In the absence of progress by the special
commission or other compensatory policies, the
wage bill is likely to rise significantly starting in
wage bill under the program
2007. Preliminary data provided by the authorities
8
show an increase in the wage bill of 0.8 percent of
2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007
GDP in 2007, assuming that all eligible teachers
receive their supplementary benefits but no
retroactive adjustments are granted. That year, both the limits on benefits and the congressionally-set
increase in their overall wage will expire.

11.
Monetary policy was strengthened in 2004. In early 2003, a large fiscal deficit and
deteriorating confidence led to pressures on NIR. 7 In mid-2003, the BCH raised interest rates
by 200 basis points, followed in 2004 by stepped-up open market operations and increases in
reserve requirements (by 1 percentage point each in September and November) to sterilize

and selective bailouts, fears of new taxes and wage cuts, and demands for poverty alleviation.

the foreign exchange inflows and contain credit growth. The combination of monetary
tightening and fiscal consolidation (which led to the accumulation of public sector deposits in
the BCH) helped sterilize the large increase in NIR in 2004 (which amounted to about
54 percent of base money). The growth of currency issue was contained at 16½ percent in
2004, with broad money growing by 20½ percent and private sector credit by 18 percent.
12.
The exchange rate continues to follow the crawling peg system. While officially
the exchange rate is allowed to move within a crawling band,8 it has remained at the
appreciated end of the band since 1998. The rate of crawl has been about 5 percent each year
in 2003 and 2004.
13.

The 2004 FSAP found significant financial sector vulnerabilities. In particular:

•

Weak compliance with Basle Core Principles (BCP). Honduras largely complied with
three principles, materially noncomplied with 20 principles, and did not comply with
another two.9

•

Banks had still not fully provisioned loans adversely affected by exogenous shocks,
including Hurricane Mitch (1998) and the coffee crisis (1999 and 2001).

14.
Since then, the authorities have made significant progress in addressing financial
sector vulnerabilities. Consistent with the recommendations of the FSAP, a series of laws
and regulations were approved in 2004 that strengthened prudential norms (including on
capital adequacy, loan classification, and provisioning); enabled consolidated supervision
(including offshores, affiliates and subsidiaries); increased the powers of the supervisory
agency (National Bank and Insurance Commission or CNBS); broadened the circumstances
that require corrective actions by banks; and improved the bank resolution framework. The
CNBS has approved a schedule that gradually implements the new provisioning requirements
over three years.
15.
Financial sector indicators are improving. In 2004, the level of nonperforming
loans (NPLs) fell to 6.4 percent, while the ratio of provisions to NPLs rose further to
65 percent. The average reported capital adequacy ratio (CAR) has remained high and bank
profitability has improved. 10

8

Officially, the BCH sets the base exchange rate with a range of 7 percent in either direction,
which is adjusted periodically according to the anticipated inflation differential between
Honduras and its major trading partners and to changes in exchange rates of currencies of
trading partners with respect to the U.S. dollar (Appendix I).

This is discussed in more detail in the accompanying Completion Point Document.

II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
16.
The discussions covered Article IV consultation issues, the second review under
the PRGF arrangement, and fulfillment of HIPC completion point trigger conditions.
The consultation discussions focused on the medium-term issues of how best to sustain rapid
growth and maximize the benefits of CAFTA, while the program discussion centered on the
macro framework for 2005, particularly the budget outlook, medium-term teachers’ salary
issues, and financial sector reform. The mission also discussed the updated DSA and verified
fulfillment of the HIPC completion conditions, including PRSP implementation.
A. Outlook and Risk
17.
The authorities remain committed to their medium-term strategy aimed at
raising growth, reducing poverty, and maintaining macroeconomic and financial
stability. The strategy involves continuing structural reforms and prudent macroeconomic
policies. Reforms focus on strengthening the development of human capital and basic
infrastructure, improving the environment for private sector development, and using
international trade agreements to boost growth. Key sectors expected to drive growth over
the medium term include maquila, tourism, energy, and telecommunications.
18.
Assuming continued prudent policies, the medium-term outlook is favorable.
The baseline scenario envisages real GDP growth of about 4½ percent after 2006, supported
by increasing private investment (including FDI) and sustained export expansion. The fiscal
deficit is targeted to narrow to about 1½ percent of GDP over the medium term, which—
together with HIPC debt relief—would bring down the public debt/GDP ratio to about
50 percent by the end of the decade (35 percent in NPV terms).11

11

A detailed debt sustainability analysis is contained in the accompanying Completion Point
Document.

19.
Nonetheless, Honduras’ medium-term outlook faces important risks. While most
temporary shocks would not put sustainability at risk, provided that sound policies remain in
place, a failure to sustain the fiscal adjustment envisaged under the program would endanger
debt sustainability. The financial sector and the crawling peg are additional sources of risks.
•

Fiscal. The implementation of a permanent resolution to teachers’ overall salaries
before the 2007 budget is key to medium-term fiscal sustainability. Important growthenhancing reforms envisaged for 2005–06—including the implementation of CAFTA
and the opening of the international long-distance market to competition—will
require compensatory measures to address their impact on government revenues.12

•

Financial sector. By relying mainly on retained earnings for the necessary capital
increases, the authorities’ gradual strategy of improving banks’ solvency leaves the
financial sector exposed to an economic downturn that could adversely affect bank
profits.

12

CAFTA will imply a loss of import duties estimated at about 0.3 percent of GDP in the
first full year of implementation, increasing to about 1 percent of GDP in the long run. The
authorities are quantifying the potential impact on Hondutel’s revenues from the loss of its
monopoly on long-distance telephone calls. Hondutel transfers to the central administration
averaged about 1 percent of GDP in 2003–04.

- 15 -

•

Crawling peg. The crawling peg exchange rate system constrains the economy’s
resilience to external shocks.

20.
A passive scenario illustrates the vulnerabilities. Failure to achieve fiscal
sustainability (e.g., due to a reversion to the pre-program system for teachers’ salaries and
failure to compensate for revenue losses from CAFTA and the opening of the
telecommunications market) would result in slower growth, rising domestic public debt, and
a weakening external position. Slower growth would result from lower public and private
investment, reflecting lower external financing and investor confidence. The public debt
would rise due to the larger fiscal deficit and greater reliance on domestic financing, while
higher current account deficits (due to the larger fiscal deficit) and an undermined financial
account would put pressure on international reserves.

21.
The authorities’ macroeconomic framework for 2005 aims at keeping the
economy on a steady path through the traditionally difficult election period. Real GDP
is projected to exceed 4 percent for the second consecutive year, led by maquila, tourism,
construction, telecommunications, and energy sectors. The authorities expect growth to be
supported by the broadly favorable external environment, an improved business climate, and
the prospective implementation of CAFTA.13 Inflation would fall to just under 7 percent and
NIR would rise by about US$210 million. Downside risks include uncertainties in the oil
market, while on the upside growth could be somewhat higher if the stronger-than-expectedgrowth momentum in 2004 carries over to 2005.

13

At the same time, they expect growth to be somewhat slower than last year due to the near
completion of large private investments, lower expected growth in the United States, and a
return to a more moderate expansion of the agricultural sector.

B. Fiscal Policy
22.
The authorities’ fiscal strategy for 2005 aims at sustaining the consolidation
process, while further increasing investment and poverty spending. The strategy relies on
reaping the full benefits of the tax reforms of 2002 and 2003, further improvements in tax
administration, strict control over expenditures, and contingent spending cuts. Consistent
with the 2005 budget, both the public sector deficit and the central government deficit will
fall by about ½ percent of GDP, while investment and poverty spending are to increase
further, on account of higher grants and offsetting savings. The latter are in the wage bill,
current transfers, and domestically financed (i.e., non-grant financed) goods and services.

In 2005, government revenues will benefit from the recent tax reforms, with
further progress in tax administration as an additional safeguard. The authorities are

- 17 -

confident that the fiscal targets will be met without new tax measures. They are committed to
implementing decisively the revised tax code approved in December 2004, including by
enforcing its recently acquired power to determine taxpayers’ income through indirect
methods and third-party information. They also have an action plan to further improve tax
administration (Box 4).

Box 4. Actions to Improve Tax Administration

Key actions to improve tax administration in 2005 are:
•

Restructuring of the tax office (DEI). The new organizational structure will be approved by midMarch 2005.

•

Audit plan. The number of large taxpayer audits will rise by 50 percent in 2005, to 100 by endJune 2005 (structural benchmark) and 225 by year’s end.

•

Collection of arrears. By June 2005, the authorities expect to collect about 0.1 percent of GDP in
past-due taxes, using the incentives approved by congress in December 2004 (including a
temporary reduction in penalties).

•

Large taxpayer stopfilers. The rate of stopfilers is targeted to fall to 3.7 percent of large taxpayers
in June 2005 (structural benchmark), from 4.5 percent at end-2004, and further to 2 percent in
December 2005. To this end, the DEI will strengthen its computerized cross-checking of selected
databases.

•

Update of large taxpayers. The definition of large taxpayers will be revised by end-April 2005,
with external technical assistance.

•

Customs administration. A commission has been established to ensure that hiring of customs
officials is fully merit based.

24.
The authorities intend to maintain strict control over expenditures during 2005,
including the wage bill. The wage bill is expected to decline by 0.2 percent of GDP through
the strict implementation of the prudent wage policy agreed under the program. Contingent
expenditure cuts have been identified in non-poverty spending amounting to about
0.2 percent of GDP.
25.
The issuance of regulations to integrate teachers’ salaries starting in 2007 has
been delayed. With no political support for resolving this issue now, in the run-up to the
elections, the authorities stressed that insisting on it at this juncture would polarize the
country. The staff regretted the postponement of this measure and wondered whether after
reaching the HIPC completion point (when the reform momentum would be at its peak),
salary integration would be any easier politically. Staff also noted that the timing of
implementation should be more definitive. The authorities explained that the problem was
the conjunction of the HIPC completion point and the elections, and argued that the political
environment would be significantly more conducive for this measure in 2006. They
reaffirmed their commitment to resolving teachers’ wages before the current (temporary)
arrangement expires in 2007, and proposed the rephasing of this measure. Based on these

- 18 -

measures and the controls over the wage bill for the program period (2004–06), the
authorities requested a waiver for the end-December PC.
26.

Fiscal consolidation will be underpinned through reforms that include:

•

Improved fiscal management. The ministry of finance has embarked on a plan to
revise its organizational structure, improve its public expenditure system (SIAFI), and
introduce a single treasury account, with assistance from the IDB. The upgraded
SIAFI is expected to be operational by January 2006.

•

Restructuring of the public sector. The government is proceeding with the plan to
restructure the public sector. It has streamlined some decentralized agencies and
submitted to congress a law to merge and close several ministries. It has also begun a
major reform of the higher education system, with the approval of the new university
law in December 2004.

27.
The operating surplus of public enterprises is expected to improve somewhat in
2005. The improvement is mostly due to better performance of Hondutel due to buoyant
revenues from its monopoly on long-distance telephone service. As supported by the staff,
the authorities are quantifying the potential revenue loss to Hondutel after its monopoly is
removed in January 2006 and identifying measures to address it (structural benchmark).
28.
Although good progress has been made in reforming the main public pension
system (IHSS), some special public pension systems still face actuarial deficits.14 The
authorities estimate the actuarial deficit of the special public pension funds at L 6.7 billion
(about 5 percent of GDP in 2004), owing mainly to high administrative costs, low return on
investments, and in some cases high dependency ratios. The authorities have taken several
steps to strengthen these pension funds, including by issuing guidelines on eligible
investments of pension reserves, requiring the publication of their portfolios; and establishing
criminal liability for the mismanagement of pension reserves. Looking forward, the
authorities are working on a strategic plan aimed at reforming the special pension regimes.
The staff encouraged the authorities to make progress in this area, while making sure that the
reform plans are consistent with the medium-term fiscal program.

14

The special pension systems are for teachers, armed forces, public sectors workers, and
university workers. The IHSS, which is the largest system, covers workers employed in the
private sector.

- 19 -

C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
29.
The BCH’s monetary program aims to reduce inflation to about 7 percent in
2005.15 The main goal of monetary policy is to achieve price stability, by gradually reducing
inflation to a level consistent with inflation in Honduras’ main trading partners. Open market
operations will remain the main instrument of monetary control, supported by increasing
interest rates, if necessary, to achieve sufficient sterilization of capital inflows. The annual
rate of crawl will be reduced to 3 percent, consistent with the current policy of depreciating
in line with projected inflation differentials.
30.
The BCH is strengthening monetary operations. The board has approved a
timetable for modernizing the BCH’s monetary operations, and announced it to the banking
sector (Box 5). The authorities agreed with the staff on the importance of pushing ahead with
this critical reform.

Box 5. Reforming Monetary Operations
The BCH has announced a plan to reform of monetary operations, which involves the following key
elements:
•

Primary auctions. Market-based primary auctions and negotiable BCH securities will enhance
the efficiency of open market operations.

•

Short-run operational variable. The 7-day CAM interest rate will become the operational target
and repos and reverse repos used to manage systemic liquidity.

•

Interest rate corridor. The BCH will set a corridor for the overnight rate, with its deposit facility
as floor and its new Lombard facility as the ceiling.

•

Signaling of monetary policy. The BCH will use the 7-day CAM auctions to signal changes in
the policy stance.

•

Infrastructure. The BCH will improve its infrastructure, including by making securities
negotiable, adapting its organization, and improving its technical capacity.

Actions in 2005 include:

15

•

By March: organizational reform of the BCH; functioning arrangement for transferring
securities; and supporting regulations issued.

•

By June: announcement of the interest rate target and band; and introduction of daily
interventions through repo auctions.

While policies (including the budget) and projections for 2005 are based on an inflation
objective of 6.9 percent (eop), the BCH has announced an inflation range of 6.5–7.5 percent,
on account of continued uncertainty in the oil market.

- 20 -

31.
The gradual recapitalization of the BCH has begun. In line with the revised BCH
law, the ministry of finance will recapitalize the BCH through the issuance of government
securities. While this constitutes a step in the right direction, the modality chosen is not
sufficient to restore BCH's capital because government securities will not bear a market
interest rate. 16 The authorities explained that the fiscal situation did not allow for this at this
time, but committed to moving toward higher interest rates starting in 2006.
32.
The discussions on monetary strategy took place in the context of the mediumterm desirability to move toward greater exchange rate flexibility. The exchange rate
continues to be the nominal anchor. In line with Fund recommendations, the authorities are
strengthening monetary operations and the financial sector. The staff reiterated its
recommendation to eventually move toward greater exchange rate flexibility, to facilitate
adjustment to shocks and structural change.
D. Financial Sector Reform
33.
The authorities intend to continue with their ambitious banking reform
program. The key elements envisaged for 2005 are:
•

Strengthened prudential regulations. In line with the new financial sector law, the
CNBS will enforce the timetable for banks to comply with the new provisioning rule,
while at the same time complying with other prudential norms (including on capital
and loan classification—continuous structural performance criterion for 2005).

•

Related-party lending. The CNBS will continue to strictly enforce the gradual
reduction of related-party loans, to ensure that all banks comply with the limit of
30 percent of capital by end-June 2006.

•

Supervision. The CNBS will perform examinations using the strengthened
regulations; develop a framework for intensive supervision of weak institutions;
approve a contingency plan for systemic financial stress; introduce risk-based
supervision practices; and monitor the largest debtors of the financial system.

•

Bank resolution. The CNBS will complete the procedures to enable the
implementation of the new bank resolution mechanism as necessary.

•

Bankruptcy. The government will submit to congress in 2005 a law to improve
corporate reorganization, bankruptcy proceedings, creditor rights, and corporate
governance of nonfinancial business corporations.

16

For losses up to 2003, the bond will have a 50-year maturity but carry no interest payment.
For losses in 2004 and 2005, 10 percent of the bonds carry market interest rates and the rest
an annual interest rate of 2 percent.

- 21 -

34.
The authorities intend to address the risk of the growing dollarization of bank
credit. The BCH currently limits the amount of banks’ dollar credit to non-dollar earners to
15 percent of banks’ foreign currency deposits, but this limit does not apply when banks
finance domestic loans with external credits.17 The staff noted the rapid increase in dollar
lending and urged the authorities to strengthen loan classification rules to include borrowers’
unhedged dollar positions. The authorities attribute the increase in dollar loans mainly to the
dollar financing of large energy and telecommunications projects by a consortium of local
banks. Nonetheless, the CNBS will improve data collection; issue supervisory guidelines and
inspection procedures for banks’ dollar lending; and include the review of unhedged dollar
loans as part of the loan classification and provisioning process (structural benchmark).

35.
Prudent macro policies and structural reforms are needed to preserve
competitiveness. Although the REER has depreciated by more than 10 percent since its peak
in 2001, it is still significantly higher than in the early
Real exchange rate: 1992-2004

Appreciation
(projected) fundamentals. However, the extraordinary

growth of remittances and strong capital inflows have

70
recently generated pressures for real appreciation. In 2004,
such pressures were neutralized by large international
reserve accumulation and sterilization, but staff noted the
challenge to resist further appreciation pressures if capital inflows and private remittances
continue to grow as in the recent past. To limit the extent of a possible real appreciation,
fiscal discipline needs to be maintained, and prudent wage policies and structural reforms
will be critical to preserve the competitiveness of Honduras’ export industries.

36.
CAFTA plays a key role in the authorities’ strategy to maintain the
competitiveness of the economy. In particular, the maquila sector is under some threat from
the recent elimination of textile quotas under the WTO. While Honduras is generally not
considered one of the most vulnerable countries in this context, competition from countries
such as China and other East Asian economies will probably increase significantly. To
leverage the competitive advantage of close proximity to the U.S. market, the authorities plan
to implement CAFTA as soon as possible, thus expanding the current preferential access to
the U.S. market under the Caribbean Basin Initiative. The maquila sector itself is moving
toward vertical integration to increase its value added and preserve its competitiveness.

17

Banks can borrow externally up to an amount equivalent to twice their capital.

- 22 -

37.
Productivity gains are key to achieving sustainable growth. To meet this
challenge, the authorities are addressing problems in human capital formation, public
infrastructure, financial market development, and governance (see Annex).
F. Governance and Transparency
38.
The authorities emphasized the progress made in improving governance and
fighting corruption. The government’s strategy, prepared in consultation with civil society,
includes judicial and political reforms to improve transparency and accountability. Judges’
terms have been extended beyond the election cycle to strengthen their political
independence; a more open judicial process for criminal cases has been instituted; and
immunities from prosecution has been eliminated for government officials and legislators.
Political reforms have included the reduction in length of electoral campaign periods18 and
the direct election of legislators. To improve transparency, procurement practices have been
upgraded and the Comptroller’s Office has been reorganized.
39.
The authorities report progress has been made in implementing a framework for
Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT). The
criminal code was changed to include a broader definition and stiffer sanctions for financial
crimes. Enforcement teams have been strengthened through training courses. Bilateral
cooperation agreements have been signed with a number of Latin American and Caribbean
countries. The CNBS has upgraded its software to monitor banks’ compliance with AML
norms and to analyze suspicious transaction reports. Future plans include expanding AML
norms to cover other businesses such as lawyers and accountants.
40.
Fiscal transparency has been an important element of the authorities’ efforts to
enhance governance. Expenditure management has been improved in several areas,
including through the full automation of poverty reduction expenditure tracking and the
elimination of intra-year unfinanced appropriations. The authorities intend to make further
progress in this area by joining the GDDS by end-2005.
41.
Safeguards assessment. The authorities have implemented the recommendations of
the safeguard assessment, including establishing an independent audit committee and the
publication of the full financial statements (with the external auditor’s opinion and the
explanatory notes).
G. Financing Assurances Review
42.
The program is fully financed for 2005, despite lower program loans envisaged.
Program loans are expected to drop to US$31 million, from US$104 million in 2004, due to

lower disbursements from the World Bank and the IDB.19 However, previously identified
concessional financing, interim HIPC relief, and expected HIPC and beyond-HIPC relief
after the completion point provide adequate financing for the 2005 program.

Appropriate progress is being made in resolving pending official and private
debt issues.20 Honduras has signed agreements with most individual Paris Club creditors,
generally exceeding the terms agreed during the Paris Club negotiations. Good faith efforts
are ongoing to resolve disputes regarding the treatment of some bilateral Paris Club creditor
claims and to resolve the status of minor arrears to private creditors.21
H. Program Monitoring and Risks
44.
The program targets for 2005 have been updated. Revised PCs for NIR and NDA
have been set for end-June 2005, taking into account developments through end-2004, and
new PCs were set for December 2005. Enforcement of the new prudential regulations on
capital adequacy, loan classification, and provisioning will be a continuous structural PC.
19

Both institutions front-loaded their program loans, leading to higher disbursements in
2004.

20

The Fund’s lending into arrears policy is in effect because of some arrears to private
creditors.

21

Private creditor arrears amount to about US$5 million. They arose prior to the program,
when some creditors did not participate in an earlier IDA repurchase offer (due to failure to
submit adequate documentation to support their claims) and have not undermined program
implementation. No request for payment has been received since the repurchase offer.

- 24 -

New structural benchmarks for end-June 2005 are on the financial sector (issuing supervisory
and inspection guidelines on unhedged dollar loans), the reform of the BCH (operational
implementation of the interest rate corridor), and strengthening of tax administration (large
taxpayers’ stopfilers and audits). The completion of the technical work on teachers’ wages
(specification of new salary scales) is a prior action for this review (Box 6).
45.
Program risks remain high. The recent progress with reforms has been made
possible in part by the strong domestic consensus in favor of reaching HIPC completion
point. This consensus could weaken after the completion point and in the run-up to the
presidential elections. In addition, as noted, pending resolution of the medium-term teachers’
wage structure remains an important risk, and the financial sector remains fragile and
vulnerable to a shift in economic conditions. On the upside, external financing remains
conditioned on successful program implementation, which should help promote policy and
reform continuity. Moreover, the recent adoption of a prudent budget should also help lock in
continued sound fiscal policy in 2005.
I.

Statistical Issues

46.
Honduras’ participation in the GDDS system will strengthen the statistical
system, but further efforts are needed. One of the key issues is improving the consistency
of the fiscal deficit and financing data, where the authorities are working with IDB
assistance.22 Recent Fund technical assistance has focused on improving fiscal and balance of
payments data, upgrading the metadata to prepare for participation in GDSS, and on
quarterly national accounts. A real sector GDDS metadata mission is planned for the first
quarter of 2005.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
47.
Performance under the PRGF-supported program has been satisfactory. The
staff commends the authorities for their strong ownership of the program and for persevering
with implementing it under difficult domestic and international conditions. Program design
and ownership have benefited from extensive consultations carried out with a wide segment
of society. The authorities attribute the successful implementation of their program to their
unrelenting efforts to forge a broad domestic consensus on difficult policy issues, including
through a well-developed consultation process with civil society.

22

The authorities are improving the methodology used to track budget and treasury
operations, including the floating debt.

Box 6. Structural Conditionality Under the PRGF Arrangement
Structural conditionality in the first year of the PRGF arrangement (2004)
The structural conditionality reflected the anchors of the overall policy strategy: fiscal
consolidation and strengthening of the financial sector. Prior actions for approval of the PRGF
arrangement included the adoption of a 2004 budget and wage policy consistent with the program. Other
conditionality covered the following areas:
• Fiscal policy. On revenue, benchmarks (SB) included the creation of tax courts and changes to the
tax code. On expenditures, a continuous PC called for the suppression of unfinanced
appropriations; a PC for a 2005 budget in line with the program; and SBs covered the tracking of
poverty spending, regulations to integrate teachers’ overall salaries in 2007, and public
administration reform.
• Monetary operations. A structural PCs covered the launching of the reform.
• Financial sector reform. A PC was on the approval of new legislation on the financial sector; and
SBs were on the publication of BCH and banks’ financial statements, asset recovery from failing
banks, and the changes to the penal code on financial crimes.
Structural conditionality in 2005
The overall policy strategy remains unchanged. The specification of new salary scales for teachers is
a prior action for the second review. Other conditionality include:
• Fiscal policy. SBs refer to the reduction of tax stopfilers and increase in tax audits, and designing
measures to address the fiscal implications of opening of the long-distance phone market to
competition.
• Monetary operations. An SB calls for the implementation of the interest rate corridor.
• Financial sector. A continuous structural PC will be the enforcement of new prudential regulations,
and an SB calls for measures to address credit dollarization.
Structural conditionality covered by the World Bank and the IDB
Both World Bank and IDB loans are subject to a stable macroeconomic framework and implementation
of the PRSP. In addition, some World Bank loans are also contingent on passage of a civil service law,
implementation of a bank resolution framework, strengthened transparency, adequate HIPC spending
tracking, and of a satisfactory competition framework (including through passage of competition law and
general ports law). IDB lending (mainly poverty reduction and infrastructure) is linked to progress in the
competition strategy, and implementation of the anti-corruption strategy.
HIPC completion point conditions
HIPC trigger conditions include satisfactory performance under the PRGF and implementation of the
PRSP, and structural conditions on the anti-corruption strategy, financial sector, social security system,
improving public services (particularly in primary education and health) and social safety nets. These are
described in detail in the accompanying completion point document.

48.
The authorities’ program has delivered good results. The economy is growing
faster than expected, the recent increase in inflation has been contained, and the external
position has strengthened significantly. In addition, the country has begun to address the key

- 26 -

medium-term policy issues, such as getting control over the wage bill, strengthening the
financial sector, and modernizing key institutions such as the tax office, central bank and
supervisory agency.
49.
However, the economy remains vulnerable to shocks and structural weaknesses.
Key vulnerabilities that remain to be fully addressed include the threat to the fiscal
framework from the still unresolved teachers’ wage issue, a weak financial sector and the
constraints imposed by the rigid exchange rate system. While the improved macroeconomic
stability has been an important achievement, sustained rapid growth is needed to reduce
poverty. Boosting growth in a lasting way will require further investment, especially new
private investment, which will depend on sustained prudent policies, greater legal certainty,
stronger institutions, and better governance. HIPC completion will be a major milestone for
Honduras once approved by the Boards of the Fund and Bank. The challenge then will be to
protect the key elements of the program during the election period and beyond. The staff
supports the authorities’ initiatives to promote policy continuity through the upcoming
political transition. The improved economic situation should not be grounds for
complacency, but an inspiration for pressing ahead with Honduras’ medium-term growth and
poverty reduction strategy.
50.
Continued strengthening of the public finances is key to macroeconomic
stability. The staff commends the authorities for strong fiscal performance in 2004.
Nevertheless, further efforts are needed to strengthen public finances, including through a
sustained medium-term strategy to broaden the tax base, improve tax administration, and
raise the quality of public expenditures. While the implementation of CAFTA and the
opening of the international long-distance market are expected to boost growth, the potential
revenue losses will need to be addressed.
51.
The staff reiterates the need to implement a sustainable public wage policy.
While staff commends the authorities for containing the wage bill under the program—after
the unsustainable increases of the late 1990s—the staff regrets that it has not been possible so
far to implement a resolution to the teachers’ wage issue on a lasting basis. Looking forward,
the strict implementation of the 2003 salary law and the July 2004 agreement with the
teachers is essential to ensure the continued control of the wage bill in 2005 and 2006.
Beyond that, the staff underscores the importance of implementing a permanent resolution to
the teachers’ wage issue before 2007, when the key provisions limiting the growth of the
wage bill expire. The staff strongly supports the authorities’ efforts to garner a broad
domestic consensus on this critical policy issue.
52.
The staff welcomes the authorities’ efforts to improve monetary operations. The
staff supports the BCH’s plans to upgrade its securities and the auction process, strengthen
liquidity forecasting and its signals to the market, and adopt a new operational target.
Improved monetary instruments will enhance the BCH’s ability to address changes in
liquidity conditions, including from swings in capital flows.

- 27 -

53.
While the crawling peg has helped anchor inflation, it constitutes an important
source of vulnerability. A medium-term strategy to increase resilience to shocks, facilitate
adjustment to structural change, and assure adequate competitiveness should include a move
toward a more flexible exchange rate system. However, key preconditions for such a move
include strengthening the financial sector and the instruments of monetary policy—issues
being addressed under the authorities’ program.
54.
Despite the significant progress achieved in the financial sector reform program,
further strengthening of the sector is needed. The authorities have succeeded in upgrading
the legal and regulatory framework for the financial sector, and have made progress in
improving the supervisory regime. The main challenge now for the supervisory agency is to
enforce the improved prudential norms across all banks by using the enhanced tools granted
by the new laws. The staff urges strict adherence to the program to increase provisioning
levels, and encourages the supervisory agency to take the planned steps to further strengthen
loan classification practices of banks to include risks associated with borrowers’ unhedged
dollar positions.
55.
The staff welcomes the ratification of CAFTA by the Honduran legislature. In
addition to greater trade opportunities, CAFTA could also serve as an important external
anchor and catalyst for institutional change by breaking through domestic impediments to
reforms. In addition, CAFTA and the regional proximity to the U.S. market could assist
Honduras in facing the challenges derived from the expiration of the Agreement on Textile
and Clothing.
56.
Based on the satisfactory performance under the program, staff recommends
completion of the second review under the PRGF, including the waiver of one PC and
modifications of PCs. The staff supports the waiver of the PC on account of the authorities’
corrective actions, including the prior action on completing the technical work on teachers’
wages and the proposed rephasing of the implementation of the integrated wage structure.
While this issue is a difficult judgment call, the staff’s assessment is that moving forward
would allow the achievements under the program to be preserved, although this might entail
risks, as noted above.
57.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation will be held in accordance with the
provisions of the decision on consultation cycles approved on July 15, 2002.

Table 13. Status of Compliance in Meeting the HIPC Completion Point Conditions
Monitoring Institution
and Compliance
1. Maintenance of macroeconomic stability as evidenced by performance under a program supported by
a PRGF arrangement. The IMF Board approved the PRGF arrangement in February 2004 and the first review
in September 2004. The second review is presented for Board approval.
2. Successful implementation of the full PRSP for at least one year as evidenced in one comprehensive
annual report endorsed by the Boards of IDA and IMF. The full PRSP was submitted to the IMF and IDA
Boards in July 2001 and a first progress report was submitted in December 2003. The second progress report
has been submitted for Board endorsement.
3. Preparation and implementation of a participatory, comprehensive anti-corruption strategy and its
presentation to the national and international community. Key measures include
a. Elaboration and publication of a participatory comprehensive anti-corruption strategy in
consultation with civil society and the international community. Anti-corruption strategy prepared and
published by the National Anti-Corruption Council in November 2003.
b. Measures to strengthen control mechanisms such as the Offices of the Comptroller General and
of Administrative Probity. Offices of Comptroller General and of Administrative Probity were merged in
January 2003 to create TSC. TSC personnel has been restructured and a training program for TSC staff has
been prepared and is being implemented. Measures to strengthen procurement include the creation of
ONCAE, its merger with UPET and designation of its Consultative Council in 2004.
c. Increasing the automaticity and transparency of regulations that affect the private sector.
Government passed the Administrative Simplification law in 2002, reducing average time to register new
businesses.
4. Reform of the social security system, which is crucial to increase both the coverage and the quality of
health services and ensure a sound pension system. Key measures include:
a. Separation of the health and pension plans of the IHSS. The separation of plans was completed in
March 2004.
b. Strengthening of the regulatory capacity of the ministry of health, and the improvement of
coverage, efficiency and quality of health service provision. Norms for the licensing of health facilities
were approved in May 2004 and 121 health facilities were rehabilitated and licensed under the health
ministry’s new health facility certification program.
c. In pensions, the IHSS system will be made actuarially sound, its coverage expanded, and pension
benefits rationalized to improve the incomes of the neediest. Passage of Decree 80-2001 and the raising
of salary ceilings for pension contributions in 2001 have placed the social security system on a sound
financial footing over the medium to long term. HSS affiliation was increased to almost 500,000 by
December 2004, and introduction of automated identification card system for IHSS affiliates is well
underway.
5. Strengthening of the basic health services for the poor. Specific trigger is the delivery of a basic health
services package to at least 100,000 beneficiaries.) During 2004, coverage of the basic package of primary
health care services was extended to cover over 285,000 persons in poor communities.
6. Improvement in the quality of education by increasing the number of schools with community
participation (PROHECO). (The specific completion point trigger is the implementation of the program in at
least 1,350 PROHECO schools.) As of November 2004, the number of PROHECO schools had increased to
over 2000.
7. Increase in the efficiency and targeting of safety nets. (Specifically, the implementation of social
investment projects based on participatory planning methodologies in all beneficiary municipalities.) As of
October 2004, participatory planning processes have been implemented in all Honduran municipalities,
including the 87 poorest municipalities.
8. Strengthening of the financial sector by application of the Basel Core Principles (BCP). (Specifically,
improving the efficiency and soundness of the financial system by substantive application of BCP to the
banking sector, and by raising the capital adequacy ratio from 9 to 10 percent and enforcing it on all
commercial banks.) The capital adequacy ratio was raised to 10 percent at end-2000, and progress toward BCP
compliance has been achieved, especially with respect to reforming the legal framework, strengthening
supervision and implementing a program to increase the solvency of the financial system. A reform program to
gradually increase solvency and improve surveillance further, and create the conditions needed for substantive
compliance with BCP in the medium term is under implementation with IMF and IDA support.

ECONOMIC GROWTH
1.
Historically low growth in Honduras reflects primarily slow or negative
productivity gains. While the contribution from labor and capital accumulation has been
comparable to the rest of the region, recent studies
Growth Accounting: 1961-2000
have suggested that negative total factor productivity
Contribution
GDP
growth is the main culprit of slow growth rates.23
Growth

2.
Several elements have affected productivity
growth. A recent study on growth attributes the poor
performance of total factor productivity growth to the
poor education system, limited public infrastructure,
underdeveloped financial markets, and weak
governance.24 An investment climate survey also
highlighted security costs, electricity interruptions,
corruption, transportation costs, and crime.25
3.
The government’s growth strategy aims to
address these issues. The plan includes the following

services, including their ability to deal with gang
crime—a pervasive problem in Honduras and in
some countries in the region. The private sector
spends more than 3½ percent of sales on security

Safeguards Assessments Policy:
A full safeguards assessment of the central bank with respect to PRGF arrangement
was completed on February 17, 2004. It found that progress has been made in
strengthening the BCH’s safeguards framework since a transitional assessment was
conducted in 2001, but some weaknesses remain. The most important vulnerabilities
relate to non-publication of the audited financial statements and absence of a solid
mechanism to follow-up on audit recommendations as well as an independent audit
oversight mechanism. The BCH published the 2002 and 2003 financial statements
last September, and established a committee to oversight audits.

Exchange Arrangement:
Honduras’ de jure exchange arrangement is a crawling band. The exchange rate for
the lempira is determined daily in foreign exchange auctions. Banks and exchange
houses must sell to the central bank 100 percent of their daily net purchases of
foreign exchange at the exchange rate established the previous day. Buyers of
foreign exchange (banks, exchange houses, and private individuals) bid at a price
that cannot differ by more than 7 percent from the base exchange rate, in either
direction. The base exchange rate is adjusted every five auctions according to the
anticipated inflation differential between Honduras and its major trading partners
and to changes in the exchange rates of currencies of trading partners of Honduras
with respect to the U.S. dollar. The official buying exchange rate on January 31,
2005 was L 18.70 per U.S. dollar.
Honduras has accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Section 2, 3, and 4 of the
Articles of Agreement, and maintains a system that is free of restrictions on the
making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.

The last Article IV consultation with Honduras was concluded on May 5, 2003. On

APPENDIX II

HONDURAS—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(As of November 30, 2004)
Partnership in Honduras’ Development Strategy
1.
Honduras’ Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), which was completed in
October 2001 and endorsed by the Boards of the World Bank and IMF, has placed poverty
reduction squarely at the center of the government’s development agenda. The main
objective of the strategy, which analyzes the causes of poverty and encompasses investment
programs and reforms in a broad range of sectors, is to reduce poverty by 24 percentage
points over the period 2001–15. The strategy itself is structured around six pillars as follows:
(i) accelerating equitable and sustainable growth to levels consistent with the income poverty
reduction targets; (ii) reducing rural poverty; (iii) reducing urban poverty; (iv) enhancing
investment in human capital; (v) strengthening social protection for specific vulnerable
groups; and (vi) ensuring the sustainability of the strategy through governance and
institutional reforms and enhanced environmental sustainability. A PRSP Progress Report
which was finalized in December 2003, maintains the same long-term vision and targets of
the PRSP.
2.
The Fund and World Bank will continue to cooperate closely, within their respective
mandates, in assisting the government to implement its poverty reduction and economic
growth strategy and the related reform agenda. The Fund will continue to lead the policy
dialogue on macroeconomic issues (i.e., fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policy), while
the World Bank leads the policy dialogue on poverty reduction, governance, public sector
management, and sectoral structural reforms (in areas including the social sectors, land
regularization, environment, competitiveness, and judicial reform). They will collaborate
closely and jointly manage the dialogue in the areas of PRSP preparation and
implementation, HIPC, financial sector issues and civil service reform.
Bank Group Assistance Strategy
3.
The World Bank completed a new Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) in May 2003,
which is fully aligned with the six pillars of the Honduras’ Poverty Reduction Strategy. The
core goal of the CAS is to support Honduran efforts to shift to a sustainable and inclusive
higher-growth trajectory as a principal means of reducing poverty and inequality. Within this
broad objective, the main emphasis of the Bank’s lending and knowledge services to
Honduras are threefold: (i) to increase productive economic opportunities by helping to
remove structural and institutional barriers to economic growth and broad-based participation
in growth; (ii) to invest in human capital and the protection of vulnerable groups; and (iii) to
support the transparent and responsive functioning of the public sector. In terms of new
lending, the CAS program comprises 14 operations over a 4-year period (FY03–06),
amounting to about US$296 million, of which, about US$70 million would be in the form of
quick-disbursing budgetary support.

- 52 -

APPENDIX II

4.
As of November 30, 2004, the IDA active portfolio in Honduras consists of 16
projects for a total commitment of US$360 million, of which US$241 million remain to be
disbursed (Honduras was declared IDA-only in September1991). Lending for rural poverty
and human resource development includes four credits: Fifth Social Investment Fund Credit
(US$60 million), a Learning and Science Promotion Credit-PROFUTURO supplementary
credit (US$4 million), a Community Based Education Credit (US$42 million), and a Health
System Reform Credit (US$27 million). Lending for transport and infrastructure includes a
Road Reconstruction and Improvement Credit (US$67 million). Lending for natural resource
management and environment consists of an Access to Land Pilot Credit (US$8 million), a
Sustainable Costal Tourism Credit (US$5 million), and a Regional Development in the
Copan Valley Credit (US$12 million). Lending for modernization of the state consists of an
Economic and Financial Management Technical Assistance Credit (US$19 million), and a
Financial Sector Technical Assistance Credit (US$10 million). Lending for disaster
preparedness consists of an Emergency Disaster Management Credit (US$11 million).
Lending for improvement of the investment climate and private sector participation consists
of a Trade Facilitation and Productivity Enhancement Credit (US$28 million).
5.
In addition to the preceding operations, IDA’s Board of Executive Directors approved
four new credits during the first half of 2004, but have not yet been declared effective: a
Land Regularization and Administration Credit (US$25 million), a Nuestras Raices credit to
support development in indigenous and Afro-Honduran communities (US$15 million), a
Forestry and Rural Productivity Credit (US$20 million), and a PRS Technical Assistance
Credit (US$8 million). In addition, a fast-disbursing Poverty Reduction Support Credit
(US$61 million) was also approved in June 2004 and was fully disbursed on November 12,
2004.
Future assistance
6.
The base case lending scenario of the CAS comprises 12 investment operations for
US$226 million over FY03–06, and an additional US$70 million in the form of fast
disbursing budgetary support. The investment operations are aimed at strengthening
governance and transparency, investing in human capital and addressing long-standing
barriers to the inclusion of the poor in economic growth. The credits include the recently
disbursed Poverty Reduction Support Credit and a possible Financial Sector Adjustment
Credit. Under the base case scenario, which is now in effect, World Bank disbursements are
expected to average around US$80 million p.a. over the CAS period.
7.
With regard to economic and sector work, the CAS includes two types of activities.
The first set includes core diagnostic analyses, which are country-specific and address
important cross-cutting issues, including deepened understanding of poverty, growth, public
expenditures and fiduciary issues. This includes the Development Policy Review, Country
Financial Accountability Assessment and Country Procurement Assessment Report that were
completed in FY04, as well as a Poverty Assessment (scheduled for FY05) and a Public
Expenditure Review (FY06). The second group of activities, are Central America-wide or
sub-regional in scope, focusing on topics and themes relevant to several countries but

- 53 -

including sufficient country-specificity to further Honduras’ development agenda and
support the design of lending operations. This includes sector studies on the coffee shock,
rural growth, CAFTA, HIV/AIDS, decentralization and disaster mitigation.

IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
8.
Fund and Bank staff have maintained a close working relationship, especially with
respect to (i) the PRSP, its subsequent updates and joint assessments; (ii) the HIPC Initiative,
(iii) financial sector reform; and (iv) civil service reform. The World Bank and IMF Resident
Representatives routinely consult and coordinate with each other on major public policy
matters, and Bank staff have participated in the Fund’s PRGF missions.
•

Poverty Reduction Strategy paper (PRSP). The Fund and Bank have been
supporting the government in the preparation of the PRSP, completed in August
2001, and have followed closely its implementation in 2002–2003, as documented in
the first PRSP Progress Report that was completed in December 2003 (the second
PRSP-PR is scheduled to be submitted to for Bank/Fund Joint Assessment in
December 2004). The Bank and Fund collaborated in the production of Joint Staff
Assessments, which accompanied the presentation of the PRSP and PRSP Progress
Reports to their respective Boards.

•

HIPC Initiative. The Fund and Bank have been tracking the status of floating
completion point conditions established under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative. The
structural and social reforms being monitored involve measures in the areas of
governance and transparency, social security system reform, provision of basic health
services for the poor, quality of education, safety nets and financial system reform.

•

Financial Sector. The Fund and the Bank co-managed the preparation of the 2003
Honduras Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP). Based on the FSAP, the
government embarked on a comprehensive financial system reform that aims at
strengthening the regulatory framework and ongoing supervision, enhancing the
efficiency of the financial safety net, and improving mechanisms for antimoney
laundering and financing of terrorism. The Fund and the Bank continue to assist the
government on these issues through a comprehensive technical assistance program.

•

Civil Service Reform. The Fund and Bank have been supporting civil service
reforms that aim to create a better trained, efficient and professional civil service, and
to limit the unsustainable growth in the public sector wage bill observed over the last
decade.

Other relevant structural conditions
9.
Conditions to reach the HIPC completion point include strengthening of the financial
sector by compliance with the Basel Core Principles, preparation and implementation of a
participatory anti-corruption strategy, adoption of the social security reform plan approved by
the IHSS Board in May 2000, strengthening of the basic health services to the poor,
improvement in the quality of education by increasing the number of schools with
community participation, and increases in the efficiency and targeting of safety nets. The
World Bank and IDB are monitoring these reforms and providing technical assistance.

APPENDIX IV

HONDURAS—STATISTICAL ISSUES
Introduction
1.
Honduras’ data on the banking system, the public finances, trade, and external debt
broadly satisfy the minimum criteria required for surveillance and program monitoring
purposes. However, incomplete coverage of institutions and reporting lags inhibit a full and
timely assessment of financial sector developments, and a consistent and reliable method is
needed for deriving estimates of national accounts by expenditure, and private capital flows.
2.
The Honduran authorities participated in a ROSC data module (July 2003), signaling
their interest in participating in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS).
Preparations for GDDS participation are well advanced, including the drafting of metadata.
Participation would act as a spur to strengthening the country’s statistical system, and
provide a framework for channeling technical assistance resources in an optimal fashion.
Real sector
3.
The published series of national accounts are based on the conceptual framework of
the 1953 SNA. Estimates are prepared at current prices and at constant prices of 1978.
Estimates are limited to GDP by industrial origin and by final uses. The latter is incomplete,
as private consumption and change in inventories are calculated as a residual (allocated to the
two categories using an erroneous methodology). The main shortcomings of these estimates
are the lack of universal coverage and the deficient quality of the data sources. The Central
Bank of Honduras (CBH) has been implementing a program to improve the national account
estimates since 1993, and revised estimates for the period 1978–97 have been prepared,
based on almost the same data sources but following improved procedures for the calculation
at both current and constant prices. The CBH has started a four-year program for
implementing the 1993 SNA and changing the base year to 2000.
4.
An STA mission (January 1999) recommended the replacement of the old series with
the new ones, and made some recommendations for further improvements in the calculation
at constant prices by industries, as well as for the calculation of changes in inventories and
private consumption. The mission also recommended that high priority be given to the
implementation of the 1993 SNA and the change of the base year, and made detailed
recommendations to this effect. The preliminary national accounts series with 2000 as base
year have been prepared and a follow-up mission took place in January 2005 to evaluate
results and assist the authorities in developing quarterly GDP estimates. Methodological
support was provided for the quarterly GDP estimates. A real sector GDDS metadata
development mission by a short-term expert is scheduled for February 28-March 4, 2005.
5.
The CPI weights used to be 20 years old. A new household expenditure survey was
conducted during 1998-1999. As a result of this project, the authorities revised the CPI
basket and updated the weights. The price reference period of the new index is December

- 57 -

APPENDIX IV

1999. The CBH produced in parallel the old and new indices during the transition period.
The new indices became official in April 2000.
6.
The new indices reflect improved coverage and quality of the data sources. The main
improvements in coverage refer to inclusion in the survey of (i) population at all levels of
income; (ii) goods and services with a participation of over 0.02 percent of total expenditure
from a universe of 2,480 items; (iii) the concept of generic groups for similar items to be
incorporated in the calculation; (iv) the use of a geometric mean; and (v) all representative
urban areas. There are no official wage indices for minimum wages and data on employment
are limited to a single estimate per year.
Monetary accounts
7.
An STA mission (July–August 2000), reviewed the procedures used by the CBH for
compiling the detailed (sectorized) balance sheet for the CBH and other depository
corporations as well as the analytical surveys. The mission designed new forms for reporting
data to STA for publication in IFS and to WHD for operational purposes. In addition, the
mission made recommendations to improve the timeliness and quality of data reported
monthly to STA. Accordingly, the authorities reported monetary data in the revised format
for the period January 1996 to December 2001 while still compiling data according to the old
methodology. However, the CBH discontinued the new submission shortly afterwards and
has been reporting since February 2002 data in the old format despite several requests to
resume the reporting of data in the revised format.
8.
Further technical assistance in MFS was provided to Honduras in September 2001
and August 2004. The 2004 mission detected major progress in the compilation of the
accounts of the central bank, but found still serious shortcomings in the sectorization of the
institutional units in the accounts of the other depository corporations. The mission
recommended the establishment of an integrated database to report monetary statistics to the
Fund for operational and publication purposes. The mission also encouraged the authorities
to accelerate the country’s participation in the GDDS.
Balance of payments
9.
Balance of payments statistics are compiled in broad conformity with the fourth
edition of the BPM4. Considerable progress has been made, however, in preparations to
adopt the BPM5, with preliminary annual estimates already available for 1993–2003,
although not yet published. No international investment position is compiled. Departures
from the criterion of residency underlie the treatment of the maquila sector, and some
financial sector transactions in foreign currency. Net exports of the maquila industry are
recorded as net services rather than as exports and imports of goods for processing. Non
recording of profits of foreign enterprises operating in the maquila industry likely understates
the external current account deficit, while direct investment in this industry is excluded from
the financial account. Source data on direct investment, several services, and certain foreign

- 58 -

APPENDIX IV

transactions of private enterprises are relatively weak. Most annual surveys have low
response rates, and results are obtained with long delays.
10.
An STA mission visited Tegucigalpa during May 2004 to assist the CBH in preparing
a comprehensive work program to implement the recommendations on balance of payments
statistics made by the July 2003 data ROSC mission. Those included (1) completing
compilation in accordance with BPM5 and begin disseminating such data and related
metadata; (2) improve recording of foreign trade data for the maquila (goods for processing)
sector; (3) improve quarterly balance of payments statistics using quarterly sample surveys of
enterprises; (4) improve the survey design and the compilation process for direct investment
and other financial transactions of the nonfinancial private sector; and (5) train CBH staff in
methodology and BOP compilation practices.
Government finance
11.
The ministry of finance (MoF) disseminates government finance statistics (GFS)
covering only the central administration. The MoF also compiles annual GFS for the
nonfinancial public sector (NFPS) for internal use and for reporting to the Western
Hemisphere Department (WHD). The Central Bank of Honduras (CBH) does report
budgetary central government data, although with considerable delay, for publication in the
International Financial Statistics (IFS). Neither the MoF nor the CBH has reported GFS data
for the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) recently.
12.
The fiscal ROSC mission in 2002 and the data ROSC mission in 2003 both found that
fiscal data in Honduras have serious weaknesses. The GFS issues related to coverage and
sectorization can be explained to some extent by the Public Administration Law which
excludes the judicial and legislative branches from the data coverage of the central
administration. The fiscal data also present large discrepancies between the overall balance
compiled by the MoF and the financing data compiled by the CBH. Therefore, there is a need
for stronger collaboration between the MoF and the central bank to derive accurate and
timely estimates of external financing of the nonfinancial public sector. In general, these data
are not fully aligned with international standards, and there is no plan to migrate to the
Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001). The July 28-August 14, 2004
GFS mission produced a plan of action to improve fiscal data and proposed the creation of a
working group for GFS compilation to implement that plan. The mission also recommended
that the envisaged Integrated System of Financial Management be made to support the
compilation of GFS data and gradual migration to the GFSM 2001.

ATTACHMENT I

Tegucigalpa, Honduras
March 4, 2005

Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
U.S.A.
Dear Mr. de Rato:
1.
We are attaching the Supplementary Memorandum of Economic Policies (SMEP) and
Supplementary Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) that updates economic
developments and policy implementation through end-2004 under the PRGF arrangement
approved in February 2004, and sets out specific objectives and targets for 2005. Based on
the good track record and policies adopted, we request completion of the second review
under the PRGF arrangement; the modification of some performance criteria (PCs) for June
2005 (see attached Supplementary TMU) and the establishment of corresponding PCs for
end-December 2005. We also request a waiver for the nonobservance of one PC (paragraph 2
below).
2.
Honduras has substantially met the conditions for reaching the completion point
under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative and economic
performance through December 2004 has been consistent with the program. Macroeconomic
policies have been in line with the PRGF arrangement, and progress has been made on the
structural agenda. While controls over the wage bill have been effective, the structural PC on
issuing regulations to integrate teachers’ benefits to their overall salary starting in 2007 was
not met as the special wage commission created by law could not reach an agreement.
Nonetheless, we remain fully committed to a sustainable wage system for teachers as agreed
under the program.
3.
We remain committed to continue good faith negotiations with all non-Paris Club
official and private creditors to seek debt relief comparable to that granted by Paris Club
creditors under the enhanced HIPC Initiative.
4.
We are confident that the policies and measures set forth in the SMEP are adequate to
achieve the program’s objectives under the PRGF arrangement. However, we stand ready to
take further measures that may be needed for the successful implementation of the program.
To this end, we will continue consulting with the Fund on relevant economic and financial
policies, and provide the Fund with the necessary data on a timely basis for monitoring
purposes. Consistent with our intention to keep the public informed about our policies and

- 61 -

ATTACHMENT I

objectives, the government will publish the SMEP and will report on the progress of the
program periodically.
5.
We propose conducting the third and fourth reviews under the PRGF arrangement in
September 2005 and March 2006, respectively, based on the observance, respectively, of
end-June 2005 and end-December 2005 quantitative PCs and structural PCs proposed in the
attached SMEP.
6.
We assure you that the government of Honduras remains committed to the
implementation of the program, and reaching the HIPC completion point by end-March
2005.
Sincerely yours,

/s/
María Elena Mondragón de Villar
President
Central Bank of Honduras

/s/
William Chong Wong
Minister of Finance

2.
Growth. GDP is projected to grow by 4.2 percent in 2005, somewhat higher than
originally envisaged, led by maquila, tourism, construction, telecommunication, and energy
sectors.
3.
Inflation. Following high oil prices, inflation rose to 9.2 percent in 2004. The central
bank expects inflation (eop) to drop to 6.9 percent in 2005 (somewhat higher than the
original objective of 6 percent in the program) in the absence of unanticipated external
1

Paragraph and table references refer to the original Memorandum of Economic Policies.

- 63 -

ATTACHMENT II

shocks. The central bank remains committed to return inflation to the agreed medium-term
path starting in 2006.
4.
External current account. With strong family remittances and a robust maquila
performance expected for 2005, the external current account deficit is now projected at
2.5 percent of GDP (compared to 3.6 percent of GDP originally envisaged) (¶8).
5.
Net international reserves. In line with the improvement in the current account
deficit, the central bank has projected an accumulation of net international reserves of
US$210 million.
Fiscal policy
6.
Deficit targets. The 2005 deficit target for the combined public sector will remain at
2.5 percent of GDP and the central government deficit target at 3.0 percent (¶21). Povertyreduction spending will rise to 8.7 percent of GDP, in accordance with the original
commitment (¶23).
7.
Special wage regimes. The salaries law passed in December 2003 and the July 2004
wage agreement with teachers will remain in force. The government has asked for a waiver
of the performance criterion for end-December 2004 on issuing regulations to integrate
supplementary benefits into the overall salary starting in 2007, as the special wage
commission could not reach an agreement. Nonetheless, the government remains fully
committed to a sustainable wage system for teachers as agreed under the program.
8.
Other wages. The government remains committed to the wage policy agreed under
the program and will continue to strictly apply it to all new public sector wage agreements.
Since actual inflation exceeded expected inflation in 2004, a one-time adjustment (not to
exceed 0.05 percent of GDP) will be given in 2005 as a catch up for civil servants that have
not been subject to special wage regimes.
9.
The 2005 budget. Currently, the government believes it can meet the fiscal targets
for 2005 without taking any further tax measures. However, the government will implement
ambitious administrative upgrades on both the revenue and expenditure sides, including to
offset any revenue loss from the implementation of CAFTA. These include an action plan to
strengthen the tax office (DEI), upgrade SIAFI (the public expenditure system) and identify
contingent expenditure cuts in non-poverty spending (amounting to 0.15 percent of GDP).
Poverty spending would increase due to higher grants and offsetting savings in the wage bill,
current transfers, and domestically financed goods and services.
10.
Restructuring of the public sector. The government is proceeding with the plan to
restructure the public sector. The government has announced the closure of several
embassies, streamlined some decentralized agencies, and submitted to congress of a law to
merge and close several ministries. It has now begun a major reform of the higher education
system, which was initiated with the approval of the new university law in December 2004.
Financial measures in the law include the elimination of tenure-for-life salaries, the granting

- 64 -

ATTACHMENT II

of legal status to the pension fund, and re-election requirements for university officials. Also,
student participation in university decision-making has been rationalized.
11.
Tax revenue. The government will decisively implement the new tax code, including
by enforcing its recently acquired power to determine taxpayers’ income through indirect
methods and third-party information (expected to yield about 0.1 percent of GDP). The tax
code includes a provision for a new law on transfer pricing, which will be sent to congress by
end-June 2005. The government reaffirms its commitment to maintain the real rate of
specific excises. In addition, the tax office (DEI) is undertaking an ambitious action plan for
2005, which the authorities believe supports the revenue goals. The key elements of the plan,
include:
•

Restructuring of the DEI. The new organizational structure will be approved by
mid-March 2005.

•

Audit plan. The number of large taxpayer audits will rise to 100 by end-June 2005
(structural benchmark) and to 225 (cumulative) by end-December 2005, a 50 percent
increase compared to the 150 audits completed in 2004. The audit capacity will be
improved through further modernization of computer systems (especially monitoring
of large taxpayers’ database) and training of staff.

•

Collection of arrears. Taking advantage of the incentives approved by congress in
December 2004 (including a temporary reduction in penalties), the government will
launch an aggressive campaign to collect past-due taxes, which is expected to result
in collections of L 100 million.

•

Large taxpayer stopfilers. The rate of stopfiling will be reduced from 4.5 percent of
large taxpayers in December 2004 to 3.7 percent in June 2005 (structural benchmark
for end-June 2005); and 2 percent in December 2005. To accomplish this, the DEI
will (i) strengthen its computerized cross-checking, supported by (ii) an increase in
the number of electronic filers, and (iii) will effectively enforce the sanctions
introduced in the new Tax Code.

•

Large taxpayers. The DEI will revise the definition of large taxpayers by end-April
2005, with external technical assistance.

•

Customs administration. Customs procedures are being streamlined, and risk
analysis introduced. A new electronic screening system will be implemented in April
2005, permitting Honduras to improve controls on container shipments. Customs
offices in free trade zones are being systematized and audited. A commission has
been established to ensure that hiring of customs officials is fully merit-based.

12.
Strengthening fiscal management. With technical support from the IDB, the
ministry of finance has embarked on a plan to reorganize its administrative and functional
structure, improve public expenditure management through an upgrade of SIAFI (public
expenditure system) and the introduction of a single treasury account. The upgraded system

- 65 -

ATTACHMENT II

will be implemented by May 2005 to allow the 2006 budget process to be carried out, and
will be fully operational with all components by January 2006.
13.
Hondutel. Considering the envisaged opening of the long-distance telephone market
in January 2006, the government is studying the potential financial cost to Hondutel and will,
as a benchmark for end-June 2005, specify policies and an action plan to address the
potential revenue shortfall. In the past Hondutel has provided transfers to the government.
Monetary and exchange rate policy and management
14.
Targets on net international reserves and net domestic assets of the central bank.
Reflecting current balance of payments projections, NIR for 2005 will be set at US$1,833
million, and the target will be subject to the adjustor described below. At the level projected,
gross international reserves will cover 4.9 months of imports and about 350 percent of shortterm liabilities. Net domestic assets will amount to L -24,579 million by end-December 2005.
15.
Monetary policy strategy. The central bank will use open market operations as the
main instrument to contain inflation, including by increasing the interest rate if necessary to
achieve sufficient sterilization. This will be assisted by a slowing of the annual rate of crawl
to 3.0 percent, which is consistent with the current policy of depreciating in line with
projected inflation differentials between Honduras and its main trading partners.
16.
Strengthening monetary management. The central bank board has approved and
announced to the banking system a timetable for modernizing central bank’s monetary
operations. By May 2005, the central bank will start operating the new scheme. To improve
signaling to the market and manage short-term interbank liquidity, the central bank will
establish an interest rate operational target (an additional monetary instrument); conduct
weekly 7–14 day CAMS auctions with negotiable securities; carry out one day repo auctions
when needed; and adopt an interest rate corridor with an automatic liquidity window (ceiling)
and issuance of one-day certificates (floor). To manage structural liquidity, the central bank
will conduct CAMS biweekly auctions, in which it will announce amounts to be placed and
allow interest rates to reflect market conditions.
17.
Central bank recapitalization. In line with the new central bank law, the ministry of
finance and the central bank have agreed on a mechanism to recapitalize the central bank for
past and future losses (¶31). By June 2005, the ministry will issue a zero-interest bond to
cover the losses incurred between the beginning of 1997 and end-2003 in an amount of
L 3,278 million certified by the CNBS, and will also issue a bond to reimburse cash losses
for 2004. From now on, bonds will be issued by mid-year to reimburse previous-year losses.
The government is not yet in a position to pay market interest rates on the total value of these
bonds, but it will increase the proportion of the reimbursement paid at market rates every
year, in agreement with the central bank.

- 66 -

ATTACHMENT II

Financial sector reform
18.
Strengthening of the financial sector. The government will continue its ambitious
financial sector reform program. The program for 2005 includes the following actions:
•

Application of enhanced prudential regulations to all banks. The supervisory
authority (CNBS) has approved a timetable for financial institutions to comply with
the new provisioning requirement (¶36-37), while maintaining at all times a minimum
statutory capital level and a capital adequacy ratio of 10 percent and complying with
rules governing loan classification. Enforcement of these regulations according to the
new financial sector law will be a continuous structural performance criterion for
2005.

•

Related-party lending. The CNBS will continue to strictly enforce the gradual
reduction of related-party loans, to ensure that all banks comply with the reduction in
the limit to 30 percent of capital by end-June 2006 (from a level of 120 percent at
end-2002).

•

Dollarization. The government believes that the recent growth of dollar lending to
non-dollar earners does not pose a significant risk to the financial sector. Nonetheless,
the authorities will adopt measures to assess the risks at the individual bank level and,
if necessary, will adopt additional prudential norms in the future. To this effect, the
CNBS will expand its data collection of banks’ dollar lending activities, including for
unhedged positions, commencing with end-March 2005 and quarterly, thereafter. It
will also issue supervisory guidelines and inspection procedures for banks’ lending in
foreign currency by June 2005, and include the review of unhedged dollar loans as a
part of the loan classification and provisioning process. These measures will be a
structural benchmark for end-June 2005, and will permit a reassessment of the
temporary measure that limits banks’ external borrowing.

•

Supervision. The CNBS will perform examinations of all institutions using the
enhanced regulations; develop a framework for, and if necessary carry out, intensive
supervision of weak institutions; and approve a contingency plan for systemic
financial stress. In addition, the CNBS will introduce a framework for risk-based
supervision according to international best practices, and monitor the financial
situation of the largest debtors of the financial system.

19.
Bank resolution. The CNBS will complete the procedures to enable the
implementation of the new bank resolution mechanism (including the issuance of norms) and
the liquidation of financial assets of failed institutions.
•

Bankruptcy. The government will submit to congress by December 2005 a law to
improve the following legal systems: corporate reorganization and bankruptcy
proceedings, creditor rights, and corporate governance of nonfinancial business
corporations.

Other reforms
20.
Transparency. The authorities are committed to a policy of transparency (¶44). To
this end, they will publish the staff report for the Article IV consultation and second review
of the PRGF arrangement; second PRSP progress report; Enhanced HIPC Completion Point
Document; Joint Staff Advisory Note; and the updated fiscal ROSC. They will continue the
program of statistical improvements to join the GDDS, including the elaboration of quarterly
balance of payments data and a systematized reconciliation of above- and below-the-line
fiscal data. At that time the authorities will publish the ROSC for data standards. The central
bank will provide the Fund with full financial statements (including auditor’s notes) and will
publish them by end-June 2005. All commercial banks will continue to publish quarterly
financial statements.
Program modalities
21.
Conditionality. Revised performance criteria and financial benchmarks for 2005 are
shown in Table 1 and structural targets are included in Table 2. Indicative targets have been
also revised.
22.

Adjustors. The program for 2005 will include the following adjustors:

•

Given the recent strong accumulation of NIR and its current level, the NIR floor will
be adjusted downwards and the NDA ceiling would be adjusted upwards for shortfalls
in NIR accumulation up to an amount of US$100 million.

•

To ensure that uncertainties about the timing of disbursements of foreign financial
support do not jeopardize the government’s compliance with program targets, the
2005 program will include a capped adjuster of L 1,145 million on the ceiling on
domestic financing for temporary (within-year) shortfalls in foreign financing.

•

The deficit of the central government will be adjusted upwards by the amount of the
interest payment on the bonds to recapitalize the central bank; the targets of the
consolidated public sector will remain unchanged.

Supplementary Technical Memorandum of Understanding
1.
The Technical Memorandum of Understanding, attached to the Memorandum of
Economic Policies of the Government of Honduras dated February 2, 2004, remains in effect,
except for paragraph 3 that is replaced by the paragraph below.
2.
The deficit of the central government will also be measured from the financing side.
The central government includes the executive, judicial, and legislative branches of
government. It also consolidates the operations of the trust fund created by decree No. 682003 approved in April 2003 to support agricultural loans. Funds used to recapitalize the
central bank will be recorded below the line in 2005, and hence will not affect the deficit.
Interest payments on recapitalization bonds will be included in the deficit.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
March 28, 2005
The following information has become available since the staff report was issued. The
information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.
Inflation. Inflation fell slightly to 9.1 percent in February 2005 (y/y), broadly in line
with the program. Prices have stabilized in recent months, after drifting up during most of
last year.
2.
Net international reserves rose to US$1,710 million (up by US$87 million since the
start of the year), a faster increase than programmed despite higher oil prices. This reflects
buoyant exports and remittances as well as private capital inflows.
3.
Fiscal performance. In January 2005, tax revenue rose by 18 percent (y/y) reflecting
a fairly broad-based increase of tax collections and suggesting continued strong economic
activity. Public expenditures were slightly below the level envisaged for the month.
4.
Minimum wage. Negotiations between the private sector and workers concluded
with an increase in the minimum wage of 9–12 percent, depending on the size of the firm.
5.
Gasoline prices. As of mid-March, gasoline prices were up by about 15 percent since
end-2004, reflecting trends in international oil prices. As a result, public transportation tariffs
were adjusted by 12–20 percent in March. The surge in prices has led to renewed social
pressures, including demands for higher adjustments of the minimum wage. The authorities
have resisted these demands, noting the importance of avoiding second-round effects of the
oil price increase.
6.
Conditionality. The prior action for the second review has been met. The authorities
completed the specification of new salary scales for teachers that integrate the supplementary
benefits into the overall salaries, in line with the authorities’ medium-term fiscal framework.
In addition, the continuous performance criteria on the suppression of intra-year unfinanced
appropriation, contracting or guaranteeing of nonconcessional external debt of the combined
public sector, and accumulation of arrears on public sector external debt service have been
observed through the latest data available (March 15, 2005).

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
April 13, 2005

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with Honduras
On March, 28, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Honduras.1
Background
Growth in Honduras rebounded strongly in 2004, ending a period of low growth. Over the last
decade, growth had been adversely affected by natural disasters and worsening terms of trade,
exacerbated by a difficult policy environment. To break the unfavorable cycle, the authorities
embarked on a medium-term economic reform program in late 2003, aimed at re-establishing
macroeconomic and financial stability, strengthening growth, and reducing poverty.
The authorities’ program included measures to consolidate the public finances and strengthen
monetary policy and the financial sector; address poverty with a focus on education and basic
health care; and enhance growth prospects by infrastructure development, improvements in the
private investment environment, and trade liberalization. To ensure social consensus in support
of the program, it also incorporated measures to improve governance and social equity.
The economy performed robustly in 2004, reflecting sound policies and broadly favorable
external conditions. Growth rose to about 5 percent, with a rebound across all sectors, including
agriculture. On the demand side, growth reflected mainly higher investment and exports.
Inflation stabilized at around 9 percent at the end of the year, after moving higher during much
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2of 2004 mainly because of high oil prices. Despite a sharply higher oil bill, the external position
strengthened significantly on account of higher remittances, exports, and capital inflows.
Net international reserves rose by just under US$500 million. Moreover, the deficit of the overall
public sector fell to 3 percent of GDP (from about 5 percent of GDP in 2003), despite
significantly higher spending on poverty-reduction programs and investment.
Important progress was made in structural reform. The legal and regulatory framework for the
financial sector was upgraded; the tax code and penal code were amended; and legal, judicial,
and electoral reforms were introduced. Honduras ratified the DR-CAFTA in March 2005.
For 2005, growth is projected to remain buoyant, at over 4 percent of GDP. The external current
account deficit is expected to narrow significantly (reflecting the completion of last year’s large
infrastructure projects), and the net international reserves position to remain strong. The 2005
budget envisages a further improvement in the public finances, with the overall public sector
deficit declining to 2.5 percent of GDP.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Honduras’ improved economic conditions, which reflect the
implementation of sound macroeconomic policies and progress with structural reforms,
supported by strong worker remittances and foreign capital inflows. In 2004, economic growth
accelerated and inflation stabilized, after drifting up in response to oil price increases; and the
external position has strengthened significantly. The fiscal position improved markedly in 2004,
owing in particular to successful control of the wage bill—an important step towards long-term
sustainability.
Directors noted that, despite recent achievements, important vulnerabilities and challenges
remain. Specifically, they noted the need to make permanent the progress made under the
program in containing public sector wages including, in particular, a durable resolution of issues
related to teacher’s wages. Directors also encouraged the authorities to press ahead with their
efforts to strengthen the financial sector further, and stressed the need for continued
implementation of prudent fiscal and monetary policies through the upcoming election period.
They welcomed the authorities’ efforts to promote policy continuity through the political
transition.
Directors also observed that the substantially improved medium-term outlook hinged on
strengthened institutions and governance, including the modernization of tax administration and
the central bank, and judicial, electoral, and administrative reforms. It was noted that these
steps would contribute to the achievement of poverty reduction objectives and the Millennium
Development Goals.
Directors commended the authorities for keeping the fiscal program on track. Noting the
authorities’ success in controlling the wage bill in 2004, Directors observed that this policy had
permitted a much-needed increase in spending on investment and poverty programs, while at
the same time reducing the overall fiscal deficit. Looking forward, Directors stressed the

-3importance of continued adherence to the 2003 salary law and the July 2004 wage agreement,
to ensure that the growth of the wage bill remains consistent with macroeconomic stability and
the economic and social objectives embodied in the PRSP. To further strengthen the public
finances, Directors encouraged the authorities’ efforts to broaden the tax base, improve tax
administration, and raise the quality of public spending. In this regard, they noted that it would
be important to monitor the impact of trade liberalization on public finances and institute
offsetting measures, if necessary.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ action plan to improve monetary operations, including steps
to upgrade securities, improve the auction process, strengthen liquidity forecasting, and adopt a
new operational target. Directors noted that these reforms will allow the central bank to further
strengthen the framework for monetary policy implementation and thereby enhance its ability to
achieve low inflation and safeguard financial stability.
Directors observed that the crawling band exchange rate system has helped to anchor inflation.
Looking ahead, to increase the economy’s resilience to shocks and facilitate adjustment to
structural change, Directors recommended a gradual move toward greater flexibility of the
exchange rate, while noting the preconditions for such a move, including the modernization of
monetary operations.
Directors welcomed the ratification of the Central American Free Trade Agreement, noting that it
would promote competitiveness, and improve growth prospects for Honduras. At the same time,
they observed that the implementation of the anticorruption strategy would aid capital formation,
and financial market and infrastructure development.
Directors welcomed the progress achieved in strengthening the financial sector. In particular,
they noted the improvements in the regulatory framework and the supervisory regime. Directors
observed that the main challenge now is to enforce the improved prudential norms across all
banks, by using the enhanced tools provided by the new laws. Directors urged strict compliance
with the timetable to increase provisioning levels, and encouraged the authorities to further
improve banks’ loan classification practices by incorporating the risks associated with
borrowers’ unhedged dollar positions.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
March 29, 2005

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Completes the Second Program Review and Financing Assurances
Review Under Honduras’ PRGF Arrangement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has completed the second
review of Honduras' performance and the financing assurances review under an SDR 71.2
million (about US$107.5 million) Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement
approved on February 26, 2004 (see Press Release No. 04/29).
The completion of this review allows Honduras to draw a further SDR 10.17 million
(about US$15.4 million), bringing the total amount released under the arrangement to
SDR 30.5 million (about US$46.1 million). In completing the review, the Board waived the
nonobservance of one performance criterion on public sector wages, taking into account
compensatory measures and the package of monetary, fiscal, and structural measures that have
been implemented to safeguard the program objectives.
Following the discussion of the Executive Board on March 28, 2005, Mr Agustín Carstens,
Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:
“Honduras’ performance under the program supported by the Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility has been satisfactory. The solid implementation of macroeconomic policies and progress
with structural reforms had yielded favorable results. In 2004, GDP growth rose to about
5 percent, with a recovery broadly based across all sectors. Moreover, inflation has stabilized,
after drifting up in 2004 mainly on account of high oil prices, and the external sector has
strengthened significantly. These achievements were facilitated by the authorities’ efforts to
establish a broad social consensus which made it possible to address challenging policy issues.
Looking forward to 2005, growth is expected to continue at a relatively fast pace.
“The authorities remain committed to the policy objectives of boosting growth, reducing poverty,
and achieving financial stability. They intend to achieve this through further fiscal consolidation,
financial sector reform, and other structural measures aimed at improving productivity and
economic efficiency.

-2-

“The authorities’ fiscal strategy for 2005 aims at a further reduction of the public sector deficit,
while public investment and anti-poverty spending are to increase. The higher spending will be
financed by higher external grants and by compensating savings elsewhere in the budget,
including through the continued implementation of a prudent wage policy.
“Monetary policy, to be effected largely through open market operations, aims to reduce
inflation to under 7 percent in 2005. The authorities have also announced that the rate of crawl
will be reduced somewhat in 2005, consistent with maintaining a competitive exchange rate, in
line with projected inflation differentials.
“Honduras’ key challenge in the period ahead will be to protect the core elements of its program
during the election period and beyond. Key structural reforms envisaged for 2005 cover the areas
of tax administration, central bank monetary operations, and a continuation of the financial
sector reform.
“The authorities completed their second annual progress report on the Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP) through a broad-based consultation process. The report conveys the
authorities’ continuing commitment to poverty reduction, and presents a coherent framework for
guiding the implementation of the government’s poverty reduction strategy.
“However, addressing risks to the strategy will require continued fiscal consolidation;
strict implementation of the financial system reform; prioritization of programs;
and strengthening public accountability of social programs.
“The authorities have made substantial progress on the structural reform agenda embodied in the
HIPC completion point triggers, including satisfactory track record of implementation under the
PRGF arrangement and the PRSP. As a result, Honduras has in principle reached the completion
point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative, pending action next week by the World Bank’s
Executive Board. After the provision of enhanced HIPC assistance and additional bilateral
assistance, Honduras’ debt is expected to fall to sustainable levels,” Mr. Carstens stated.
The PRGF is the IMF's concessional facility for low-income countries. PRGF-supported
programs are based on country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted in a participatory
process involving civil society and development partners, and articulated in a Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper, or PRSP. This is intended to ensure that each PRGF-supported program is
consistent with a comprehensive framework for macroeconomic, structural, and social policies,
to foster growth and reduce poverty. PRGF loans carry an annual interest rate of 0.5 percent,
and are repayable over 10 years with a 5 ½-year grace period on principal payments.

The central bank has maintained a prudent monetary policy and it is pressing ahead
with the modernization of monetary operations.

•

Following the passage of key financial sector legislation, authorities are ready to
enforce new regulations and address remaining vulnerabilities.

On behalf of the Honduran authorities, we thank staff for their valuable policy advice and
constructive discussions in the preparation of this review. We acknowledge that, staff and
management close cooperation over the past year has been central in building political
consensus around key reforms in Honduras. They are also particularly thankful to the
international community, and in particular to those development partners based in
Tegucigalpa, for their invaluable collaboration to the country effort.
As this Chair indicated at the first review, in contrast to previous arrangements, the
successful implementation of the program rests on strong ownership and broad consensus in
favor of economic reform and macroeconomic stability. Of course, the road toward reform
has not been easy as some sectors are unwilling to renounce to the privileges from past
policies. However, the authorities remain true to the objectives of the program such as
broadening and strengthening the commitment to fight poverty, sharing resources more
equally among social groups, escalating the fight against corruption, strengthening the
financial system, and promoting growth through a stable macroeconomic environment. They
are again pleased to report that all quantitative performance criteria for end-December were
met with margins. On structural PCs and benchmarks for end-December, all but one PC on
teachers’ wages were also met. As a prior action to this review, the authorities have
completed all necessary technical work for the specification of new salary scales for teachers
consistent with the PRGF.
In 2005, the authorities’ will redouble their efforts to preserve fiscal discipline in the run-up
to the presidential elections. While this has proven elusive in previous political transitions,
greater citizens’ participation in relevant aspects of the poverty reduction strategy has made

-2them more aware on the importance to maintain such discipline. In addition, the authorities
are confident that the ongoing dialogue with opposition parties (as demonstrated by the broad
support in the ratification of CAFTA) and their unwavering policy to block any unbudgeted
expenditure will maintain the program on-track during this year political cycle. Preliminary
signals from both leading candidates are very encouraging on this regard.
Background
The authorities’ most recent estimates for 2004 show a GDP growth of about 5 percent
spearheaded by agriculture and manufacturing (particularly, maquila and textiles). On the
demand side, fostered by a positive international environment and increased domestic
confidence, growth performance reflected mainly buoyant exports and a sharp rise in private
investment. The merchandise trade deficit widened to US$2.1 billion (US$1.6 billion in
2003) owing in part to the shock of high oil prices and a sharp increase in imports associated
to telecommunication and energy projects. However, higher official and private capital
inflows and record high family remittances contributed to a substantial accumulation of
international reserves of US$500 million or about 5 months of imports, one of the highest
reserve coverage in the Central American region. Following the decline of inflation in recent
years, prices increased in 2004 reflecting mostly high international fuel prices that pushed up
transportation and electricity generation costs.
On the fiscal front, the authorities moved decisively to address key weaknesses affecting the
medium term sustainability. They met all fiscal targets for end-December with margins. A
combination of tax reforms and improved tax administration in 2002-03 led to a recovery in
tax revenue increasing from an average 17 percent of GDP in 2001-03 to more than
18 percent in 2004. On the expenditure side, the authorities’ strategy centered on controlling
unjustifiable increases in public sector wages and streamlining of the executive branch (i.e.,
closing over 60 percent of vacant positions and cuts in non-essential unused budget
allocations), while accommodating planned increases in pro-poor spending. As clearly shown
in Box 3 of the staff report, the controls over the wage bill have been effective following
tough negotiations with the unions in 2002. In 2003, congress approved a new wage policy
oriented to reassert executive control over wage policies and restore equity between different
groups of civil servants. Despite a prolonged strike by teachers in July 2004 that prompted a
revision of the wage agreement with teachers, the authorities were able to maintain the
downward trend in the public wage bill (as a share of GDP) as an indication of their
commitment to a sustainable wage policy. All in all, the authorities find very encouraging
that the combined distributional impact of the tax measures and spending reforms to date
under the PRGF program has been strongly progressive as indicated by ongoing PSIA.
Regarding the poverty reduction strategy, the Honduran authorities have been very candid
about the modest progress so far and their commitment to step up efforts to achieve the
MDGs. Convinced on the importance of governance on the sustainability of the strategy, the
authorities have concentrated their efforts in the promotion of greater fiscal transparency and
expenditure management. In addition, the new Organic Budgetary Law lay down the legal
framework for developing a MTEF, which as staff indicates, it should help to improve the
linkages between budgetary programming and PRSP goals. The authorities are pleased that

-3both Fund and IDA staff deemed tracking mechanisms and costing and financing of the
PRSP as broadly appropriate.
The Central Bank has pursued a prudent monetary policy, tightening the liquidity resulting
from the higher accumulation of international reserves. While policy interest rates have
remained broadly unchanged since end-2003, the central bank stepped up the placements of
short-term certificates to dampen inflationary pressures. In addition, to contain credit growth
and limit banking system vulnerabilities, the authorities introduced temporary measures such
as an investment requirement equivalent to 2 percent of total bank deposits, and reduced the
existing prudential limit on banks’ external borrowing relative to capital.
On financial sector issues, as confirmed by staff, the authorities made significant progress on
reforming the legal framework, strengthening supervision and implementing a program to
increase the solvency of the financial system. The steadfast implementation of the
government reform program—along with the stable macroeconomic framework—has
contributed to an overall strengthening and consolidation of the financial sector. The number
of banks has been reduced from 21 in 2001 to 16 in 2004. The capital adequacy ratio of the
banking system increased to 14.2 percent in 2004 (13 percent in 2003) while the NPL ratio
declined to 6.4 percent in 2004 (8.7 percent in 2003).
Macroeconomic policies and structural reforms
Looking forward, the authorities’ effort will focus on sustaining the fiscal consolidation
process while increasing investment and social spending consistent with the PRS, and
carrying on with needed reforms to make Honduras more resilient to shocks.
The authorities are aiming at a reduction in the combined public sector deficit to 2.5 percent
of GDP while increasing pro-poor spending to 8.7 percent of GDP, in line with the original
targets of the program. To achieve this, the authorities will not only enforce the new tax code
but also undertake an ambitious tax administration reform to support the revenue efforts. So
far, tax collection in January and February has exceeded government expectations while the
tax office is being restructured.
On public expenditures, the authorities will upgrade the current financial management system
(SIAFI) and introduce a single treasury account to enforce a strict control on government
outlays. Regarding public sector wages, the government remains committed to the salaries
law passed in December 2003 and the July 2004 wage agreement with teachers. In addition, a
transition team will be appointed over the next few weeks to work closely with all parties to
bring them up to speed on specific government actions and to stress on the need to avoid
fiscal pressures on the year ahead.
Regarding monetary and exchange rate policies, the authorities’ focus will be on the
modernization of monetary operations and the recapitalization of the central bank. The
authorities have identified, with assistance from MFD, a list of actions to improve the
signaling to the market and manage both short and structural liquidity. This enhanced

-4monetary framework constitutes a prior condition to greater exchange rate flexibility,
flexibility that will undoubtedly facilitate the adjustment of the economy to shocks.
The authorities will continue its ambitions financial sector reform program. Following the
comprehensive set of laws approved by Congress in September 2004, the National Banking
and Insurance Commission (CNBS) is ready to enforce the new provisioning requirements
and perform closer supervision of financial institutions. Particular attention will be given to
address systemic financial issues such as the resolution mechanism for distress financial
institutions.
The authorities remain committed to implement governance reforms, combat corruption and
improve transparency. As reported by the World Bank1, public sector financial management,
civil service reform and judiciary reform are the areas where the authorities have focused
most of their recent efforts to improve governance. While there still remain many systemic
deficiencies that affect Honduras’ overall investment climate, specific actions include the
election of Supreme Court members under new provisions, elimination of the immunity for
legislators and other public officials, simplification of administrative requirements to open up
new businesses, and the appointment of the UNDP as the procurement agent to handle aid
resources. Last week, congress approved the creation of an anti-corruption commission with
ample representation from the civil society.
Finally, on behalf of the Honduran authorities, this Chair would like to reiterate its
appreciation to management and staff for their decisive support in reaching the completion
point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative. The authorities acknowledge that the program
faces important challenges particularly as the political campaign moves on. However, the
authorities are convinced that by reaching the completion point they will be able to garner
additional public support for the pending agenda.
