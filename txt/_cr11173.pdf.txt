ITALY
Staff Report for the 2011 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2011 Article IV Consultation with Italy
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Juha Kähkönen and Tamim Bayoumi
June 20, 2011
Executive Summary
Background: A modest export-driven recovery is underway. Growth is expected to remain
constrained by long-term structural bottlenecks. Public debt grew to 119 percent of GDP by
end-2010. Fiscal consolidation is proceeding. The authorities aim at reducing the fiscal
deficit to close to zero in 2014. The recently announced recapitalizations strengthened
banks. Bank and sovereign spreads have increased on the wake of euro area debt crisis.
Structural reforms have stalled with the exception of fiscal federalism and pension reform.
Challenges: Fiscal consolidation relies on across-the-board cuts which are difficult to
sustain and do not address the roots of public expenditure inefficiency. Measures to achieve
consolidation in 2013–14 (about €20 billion per year or 2.3 percent of GDP cumulatively)
remain to be specified. Enterprises are highly indebted. Potential growth is constrained by
structural factors, including regional disparities, a heavy and distortive tax burden, public
sector inefficiencies, high business and service regulations, labor market duality, and low
education attainment.
Staff’s views: Fiscal consolidation is a prerequisite for sustainable growth. It should be
achieved by rationalizing public expenditure and reducing tax evasion. But only sustained
growth will reduce the burden of public debt. Increasing potential growth should be the
main policy goal. Comprehensive structural reforms in the areas of labor and product
markets and public administration should be promptly implemented.
Authorities’ views: The authorities agree on the need of an expenditure-based fiscal
consolidation and of reviving growth. However, they consider that North-South require
different approaches regarding structural reforms. They consider tax reform, fiscal
federalism, and reducing the bureaucratic burden key for growth.
Mission team: A. Spilimbergo (head), L. Lusinyan, H. Morsy, E. Zoli (all EUR), L. Eyraud
(FAD). A. Borges (EUR) joined the mission for the concluding meetings.

I. CONTEXT: EXISTING WEAKNESSES CONSTRAIN THE RECOVERY
A. The Global Crisis Left a Difficult Legacy
1.
Italy suffered one of the largest output
contractions in the euro area during the
global financial crisis and is experiencing one
of the slowest recoveries. The downturn started
earlier and lasted longer than in most of the euro
area (EA) countries. It was exacerbated by the
economy’s long-standing structural problems
and reliance on international trade. Per capita
GDP and productivity in 2010 were lower than
in 2000, with Italy experiencing the largest per
capita GDP contraction among OECD member
countries over a decade. The level of output in
2015 is projected to be around 10 percent lower
than the pre-crisis historical trend (1990–2004).

2.
Despite the modest discretionary fiscal stimulus, public finances weakened.
Constrained by the lack of fiscal space, the stimulus packages were modest. Still, the
deterioration in public finances during the crisis was comparable to that of the EA average.
At end-2010, Italy’s public debt stood at 119 percent of GDP. The 10-year bond yield spread
vis-à-vis Germany, increased substantially over 2008–2010, reaching levels last seen in 1997,
reflecting concerns over public sector financing needs—over €400 billion or about
one-quarter of Italy’s GDP on average in 2009–2011.

During the global financial crisis,
Italy’s banks proved resilient, but asset
quality and profitability weakened. While
banks did not suffer large losses, thanks to a
traditional business model and a sound
supervisory framework, overall bad debt
almost doubled in 2009–2010. Credit quality,
though, worsened less than during the severe
1992–1993 recession, thanks to lower interest
rates and advances in banks’ credit risk
management.

B. Weak Recovery and New Challenges
Real economy: export-led recovery
4.
A modest export-led recovery is under way. The economy grew by 1.3 percent
year-on-year in 2010, less than the EA average of 1.7 percent, and by 0.1 percent quarter-onquarter in Q1 2011, compared to an EA average of 0.8. External demand, supported by the
depreciation of the euro and the economic rebound in Germany, drove the recovery.
Domestic demand was weak. Household spending remained cautious on the back of rising

energy prices and high import growth.
5.
The labor market remains weak. Average employment declined by 0.6 percent
year-on-year in 2010 as companies continued to shed hoarded labor. Employment contracted
most sharply in the South (-1.4 percent), and in manufacturing (-4.0 percent). Firms used
more flexible arrangements such as part-time and temporary contracts. In fact, the
employment contraction was limited to full-time permanent employees, while the numbers of
self-employed, part-time, and fixed-term employees rose. Unemployment rose to 8.6 percent
in Q4 2010 from 8.3 percent in the same period in 2009. However, the unemployment rate
remains below the EA average, thanks in part to the state-funded wage supplementation
program (Cassa Integrazione Guadagni, or CIG).1 The number of hours of wage
supplementation fund benefits increased by 32 percent in 2010, declining in Q4 2010. The
youth unemployment rate remains at 28 percent. Long-term unemployment, defined as those
unemployed for a period of 12 months or more, constitutes almost half of total
unemployment.
1

The program makes up the pay of permanent employees affected by temporary lay-offs (who are not
considered unemployed), or under a forced reduction of working hours, for a maximum of two years. Italy does
not have a general unemployment benefit scheme.

6.
Inflation increased
moderately due to rising energy and
commodity prices. Consumer price
inflation rose to 1.6 percent in 2010
from 0.8 percent in 2009. The Italyeuro area positive inflation gap closed,
mainly on the back of non-core
components, while the inflation
differential on core prices remained
relatively stable. Unit labor costs in
manufacturing fell by 2.8 percent in
2010 in light of moderating hourly
compensation.
7.
The competitiveness gap
remains significant. Wages have
increased more than productivity,
resulting in a loss of competitiveness.
All price competitiveness measures
show significant deterioration. Italian
export volume shares in world markets
have been consistently declining.
Applications of the CGER
methodologies indicate a
competitiveness gap of 7 to 10 percent.

Fiscal targets achieved so far

9.
The structural balance improved
by about 1 percentage point of GDP in
2010, among the largest improvements
in the EA. The fiscal consolidation is
closer to the EA average if the one-off
measures, which reduced the deficit in
2009, are included.

8.
The authorities comfortably achieved the 2010 fiscal target. The overall fiscal
balance declined from 5.3 percent of GDP in 2009 to 4.5 percent of GDP in 2010 (Figure 4),
well below the target of 5.0 percent of GDP. The improvement reflected both good revenue
performance and contained budget outlays. The increase in indirect taxes partly offset the
decline in capital revenues. More stringent VAT refund rules introduced in 2010 reduced
refunds by over €5.5billion (0.4 percent of GDP). The phasing out of the 2009 anti-crisis
measures and cuts in capital spending and the wage bill contained outlays. Real primary
current expenditure grew at the lowest rate since mid-1990s. However, payment delays
increased. The positive budgetary trends

Italy remains vulnerable to market
turbulence. The high public debt-to-GDP ratio,
large gross financing requirements, and dismal
growth performance are Italy’s main
vulnerabilities. However, sound household balance
sheets, the absence of housing bubbles,
traditionally high private savings, low current
account deficits and relatively favorable net
foreign asset position are Italy’s main points of
strength.

Despite intensified regional market
turbulence, the budget was financed without major difficulty, thanks to prudent debt
management, high market liquidity, and a relatively favorable risk-return profile of the Italian
bonds. Lengthening debt maturity and strengthening the budget’s cash buffers reduced
further rollover/financing risk.

Resilient banking sector, but with relatively low capitalization levels
14.
Bank credit is recovering but lending rates are inching up. After a sharp fall in
2009, credit growth to the private sector started to rebound in February 2010 (Figure 5). The
12-month growth in lending to non-financial firms turned positive in September 2010, and
reached 4.6 percent last March. The 12-month growth in lending rate for households
remained solid at about 5 percent in March. According to the latest bank lending survey as
well as recent firm surveys, credit supply conditions for firms tightened slightly in Q1 2011,
and are expected to remain stable over the next three months. Credit conditions will be
adversely affected by the ongoing increase in lending rates for both firms and mortgages,
following the rise in the ECB policy rate, the euribor, and bank funding costs.
15.
Bank financing needs are large, and funding costs are increasing. Stable retail
funding (deposits and retail securities) account for over 75 percent of the total funding for the
largest five banks. However, banks currently face large refinancing requirements, with over
€65 billion and €104 billion of bonds coming to maturity for the largest five banks during the
rest of 2011 and in 2012, respectively. Nonetheless, in the first three months of the year the
largest banks refinanced about 75 percent of wholesale bonds due to mature in 2011. Funding
costs have been increasing since the second half of 2010. Deposits rates have risen by
20–80 bps since end-May 2010, and yields on banks’ securities have climbed by about
80 bps over the same period, driven by sovereign risk and the higher euribor (Figure 5).
Recently, banks have been issuing more covered bonds than before to hold down funding
costs.

Italian banks’ use of Eurosystem
lending facilities has grown. Refinancing
operations have been on average relatively low
throughout the global financial crisis, but they
increased in the summer 2010 and remain
volatile. They were slightly above €40 billion
in April 2011. As of mid-April 2011, for the
32 largest banks the eligible collateral for
Eurosystem refinancing operations was on
average about 7 percent of their assets, while
their average monthly cash outflow (assuming
no rollover of maturing obligations) was
around 3 percent of their assets.

Italian bank asset quality and profitability remain low. While non-performing
loans have increased steadily since 2008, the most recent data on the inflows of new bad debt
point to some stabilization in bad debt growth. Due to higher provisions for loan losses and
lower net interest income, profits dropped significantly in 2008–10, and large banks’ returns
are currently underperforming compared to other European peers (Figure 6).
18.
Bank capital levels are relatively low, but rising. Thanks to capital increases,
retention of profits, asset sales, and the issuance of securities subscribed by the Ministry for
the Economy and Finance (MEF), capital buffers rose in the past two years, with the average
core tier 1 ratio of the five largest banks up from 6.0 percent in 2008 to 7.4 percent in 2010.
Nevertheless, large Italian banks’ capital ratios continued to be low by international
comparison at the end of last year. Since January, five of the six largest banks have
completed or announced recapitalization plans for a total of €11.7 billion. The financial

Non-financial corporate balance sheets
are rather fragile. Financial conditions of Italian
firms are undermined by low capitalization levels,
relatively high leverage, a large share of short-term
debt, and the prevalence of variable rate loans,
which increases the risks stemming from rising
interest rates. Bankruptcies have grown steadily
since 2007. The MEF is promoting a number of
initiatives to support lending to small and medium
enterprises (SMEs), as well as their recapitalization,
in collaboration with the private sector and the
Cassa Depositi e Prestiti—a joint stock company
under public control. These include, among others,
the creation of a bank specialized in credit to firms
in Southern Italy and a private equity fund.
Household debt remains low by international
comparison, but variable rate mortgages have
grown sharply in past few years, and now account
for almost 70 percent of the total stock, creating
some potential risks in the context of increasing
interest rates.

Political context
21.
Some political commentators suggest that the center-right government has
weakened, with some high-ranking public officials indicted and tensions within the
coalition intensifying. The coalition relies on a thin parliamentary majority. However, an
important fiscal reform is under study and may be implemented before the end of the
legislature.

during the crisis. Growth is expected to
continue to be driven by exports and the resumption of investment from low crisis levels.
However, it will likely be held back by subdued domestic demand and further fiscal
consolidation. Such a modest pace of activity will not allow a significant recovery in
employment. Persistent labor market weakness, sluggish income growth, a decrease in
government transfers, and a rising cost of credit will curb household spending. A persistent
competitiveness gap hindering export growth, and slow progress in structural reforms, will
also limit growth.
23.
Italy’s permanent medium-term output losses associated with the crisis are
estimated to be around 10 percent of pre-crisis trend. Potential growth is projected to
remain below one percent, with the output gap currently estimated around 3 percent and is
projected to be closed by 2016.
24.
Inflation is expected to increase due to rising energy and commodity prices.
Consumer price inflation is forecast to increase to 2.5 percent in 2011 and 2.2 percent in
2012. Capacity utilization is rising but remains well below normal levels; and the private
consumption recovery is likely to remain anemic given the lack of a turnaround in the labor
market. As a result, domestic inflationary pressures will be modest, and core inflation will
broadly stabilize. Rising energy and commodity prices will exert some upward pressure on
headline inflation.
25.
The authorities agreed with staff on the pace of the recovery but are more
optimistic on the medium term. The authorities substantially revised downwards growth
projections in the April update of the Stability Programme. However, they are more
optimistic than staff on the contractionary effects of fiscal consolidation after 2012.

14

Risks
26.
The main downside risk comes from market turmoil in the euro area periphery.
Renewed tensions in EA periphery countries may turn capital markets against highly
indebted countries like Italy, leading to higher spreads. Declining public bond prices would
worsen the banks’ and insurance companies’ balance sheets, with a possible vicious cycle.
Even absent this, continued tight credit and uncertainty could hinder private investment,
while rising unemployment may weigh heavily on consumption. Fiscal tightening could
further depress aggregate demand.
27.
Another decade of stagnation poses also a major risk. The decline in potential
output and policy inaction may prolong economic stagnation; rising financing costs could
produce a vicious circle. Another decade of disappointing growth would make public debt
difficult to sustain.2
28.
Other uncertainties on outlook persist. The recent turmoil in Libya is expected to
have only limited impact on growth, mostly through higher energy prices. On the upside, the
global recovery and the inventory cycle could gain stronger momentum, and the vigorous
pursuit of fiscal consolidation objectives could increase confidence and investment.

III. THE POLICY AGENDA: MAINTAINING FINANCIAL STABILITY AND FISCAL
SUSTAINABILITY WHILE RAISING GROWTH THROUGH REFORMS
29.
The government’s overarching goal is to increase potential growth while
maintaining fiscal consolidation. The government has started a few reforms to address
some long-term structural bottlenecks, including low quality of education, regional
disparities, and public sector inefficiencies. Fiscal federalism, and the reforms of the
universities and the public sector will take time to implement, and their effects on growth
will take even longer to bear fruit. Staff pointed out that other reforms, especially in the
product and labor market areas, should also be implemented. While Italy’s potential
growth slowly builds on the back of reforms, the near-term policy agenda must focus on
preserving fiscal sustainability, strengthening financial stability, and implementing labor
and product market reforms.

2

On May 21st, Standard & Poor’s revised its rating outlook for Italy from stable to negative, citing the country's
poor growth prospects and political gridlock.

15
30.
International pressure is helping Italy implement needed reforms. The
implementation of the “European Semester” is strengthening fiscal planning. The Basel III
agreement is putting pressure to increase banks’ capital adequacy.
A. Fiscal Policy: Consolidation and Better Expenditure Quality Required
Fiscal outlook
31.
The Authorities target a deficit below 3 percent of GDP by 2012 and a
near-balanced budget by 2014. Measures for 2011–2012 have been identified but measures
for 2013–2014 need to be announced.


Identified adjustment in 2011–2013: The July 2010 fiscal package identified measures

measures, accounting for about ¾ of the adjustment, include a reduction in transfers to
sub-national governments, a

Stability Pact for local governments have been introduced.



Additional adjustment needed in 2013–2014: In the April 2011 Stability Programme
Update, the authorities have committed to additional 2.3 percent of GDP consolidation in
2013–14—about €20 billion each year. The plan envisages an expenditure-based
consolidation but does not outline any specific measures.

32.
The authorities’ consolidation plan is appropriate but its implementation could
be problematic. The plan rightly focuses on expenditure measures, including a further
strengthening of the pension system, and acknowledges the importance of combating tax
evasion. However, more than half of the expenditure reduction in 2011–2012 is to be
delivered by sub-national governments, which is politically difficult, while revenue increases
rely on administrative measures.

16
33.
While welcoming the authorities’
commitment to sustain consolidation
after 2012, staff expressed concerns about
the plan to achieve the targeted
adjustment. In particular, the plan lacks
specific measures, and it uses optimistic
assumptions on the growth effect of the
envisaged fiscal consolidation. Also, while
most recent evidence of strengthened fiscal
rigor is encouraging, the track record of past
fiscal plans offers little optimism. Overall,
the success of the consolidation depends on
ongoing fiscal structural reforms, including
fiscal federalism reforms and the reform of
public administration.

34.
With less optimistic revenue assumptions, the fiscal deficit would likely exceed
the target 3 percent of GDP in 2012 (Figure 7). The overall balance will reach 3 percent of
GDP only in 2015, assuming that real primary current expenditure growth averages zero in
2011–2016 (compared to over 2 over 1999–2008), and less optimistic revenues from
administrative measure. Public debt, after stabilizing at close to 120 percent of GDP in
2011–2013, will decline to about 118 percent of GDP by 2016. Public debt dynamics are
most sensitive to a shock to real GDP and the assumed fiscal adjustment effort but are less
sensitive to an interest rate shock (Figure 8; Box 1).

The authorities pointed out that Italy’s
longer-term fiscal outlook compares favorably
to that of euro area peers. The European
Commission (EC) projects Italy’s public debt to be
the lowest in the euro area by 2060, on unchanged
policy relative to 2009 (EC Sustainability Report,
2009). Staff’s baseline estimates, which assume an
average annual growth rate of about 0.9 percent in
2017–2060 and no reform, project the debt-to-GDP
ratio close to 220 percent by 2060, well below the
EA average. In addition to the assumed mediumterm fiscal effort, the relatively contained debt
dynamics reflects the impact of the enacted pension
reform.

from EC(2009 ).

36.
Achieving the SGP debt target of 60 percent of GDP poses a big challenge for
Italy (Figure 9). Given the projected large negative growth-interest rate differential, primary
surplus has to be close to its historical maximum for the debt-to-GDP ratio to reach
60 percent by 2030. This would be similar to the authorities’ policy scenario presented in the
2011 Stability Programme Update.
37.
The authorities and staff concurred that public expenditure remains very
inefficient, and the tax burden is large. Italy scores poorly in terms of the quality and
efficiency of public expenditure, while standing out among countries with highest tax burden
and lowest tax compliance (Figure 10). Overall, progress on improving public expenditure as
identified in previous reviews (such as, Libro verde sulla spesa pubblica) has been limited,
with few exceptions. Some steps on improving the budget classification, institutionalizing
spending reviews, and reorganizing public administration have been taken. The public
administration modernization reform (“Brunetta reform”) is still in an experimental phase,
and is constrained by the fiscal cuts. Fiscal consolidation is also difficult given the size of
transfers to sub-national governments, large entitlement programs, and the sizeable interest
expenditure (Figure 11). Recognizing that the tax system is unduly cumbersome and prone to
abuse, the government recently initiated a technical review of tax expenditure. A broader tax
reform has been one of the authorities’ goals but still remains under study. Staff urged the
authorities to a more forceful action to improve the efficiency of public expenditure instead
of resorting to horizontal cuts.

39.
The authorities and staff concurred that fiscal consolidation should be sustained
beyond the medium term. Without continued fiscal retrenchment after 2012, the slow
reduction in debt-to-GDP ratio will not be long-lasting, and debt would stay at over
100 percent of GDP level in the long term

The challenges of durable fiscal consolidation
40.
The authorities and staff discussed ways to achieve durable fiscal consolidation.
Public expenditure should be rationalized through periodic expenditure reviews. Pension
reform should be further accelerated. Tax expenditure should be reduced substantially.
Budgetary procedures should be strengthened further. Fiscal federalism should enhance the
fiscal discipline at all levels of government.
41.
Staff stressed the need for structural changes to underpin sustained fiscal
consolidation. To avoid indiscriminate spending cuts, structural changes should be designed
well in advance (Box 2). The budget framework reform, started with the implementation of
the 2009 Accounting and Public Finance Law, should continue and be strengthened further
through the adoption of new EU-wide fiscal governance rules (Box 3). Tax evasion should be
tackled including through the use of anti-money laundering measures, and the tax system
should be simplified, particularly by streamlining tax expenditure.

21
Box 2: Lessons from the Literature on Fiscal Consolidations1
Fiscal consolidations are contractionary. Fiscal consolidations are likely to be
particularly contractionary when policy rates are near zero, and when many countries
consolidate simultaneously—two conditions relevant to Italy’s current environment.
However, some features of fiscal consolidation may lessen the contractionary effects
and enhance potential output.
Fiscal consolidations are less contractionary when they are expenditure-based.
The contractionary effects of fiscal adjustments may be mitigated or even inverted in
specific cases. Evidence shows that expenditure-based consolidations are more likely
to be expansionary. At the same time, increasing revenue may help before governments
can selectively cut current spending.
Targeted spending cuts are preferable. Successful adjustments rely mostly on cuts in
primary current expenditures, especially government wages, transfers and subsidies.
Civil service reform (and the related question of the right balance between salaries and
number of employees) seems critical to achieving wage bill retrenchment. The
evidence that successful consolidations preserve investment is less clear-cut, probably
because of a sequencing problem: in many successful cases, countries start their
consolidation by retrenching capital spending but reverse the cuts in due course
thereafter.
Fiscal consolidation may stimulate growth through both demand and supply
channels. Fiscal stabilizations are expansionary if agents believe that the fiscal
tightening eliminates the need for a larger adjustment in the future. This effect is
stronger when the initial debt-to-GDP ratio is high and when the fiscal contraction is
large. Moreover, reducing public spending, in particular wages and unemployment
benefits may lower unit labor costs. Finally, fiscal consolidation may also eliminate
rents, helping reduce corruption and improve private sector incentives.
Intense consolidation efforts are difficult to maintain overtime. Evidence shows
that longer consolidation periods increase the probability of ending the adjustment
(“consolidation fatigue”).
The involvement of sub-central tiers of government is crucial to achieving cuts in
expenditure, particularly when it comes to the wage bill. Central governments appear
to exert a strong influence on the expenditures of sub-central tiers through their grant
allocations; control of these allocations is therefore essential to “force the hand” of
local governments to adjust spending.

Staff recommended that fiscal federalism should proceed cautiously. Reducing
further the local governments’ transfer dependency should improve the overall fiscal
performance, as supported also by robust cross-country evidence (see forthcoming Selected
Issues). The share of sub-national own spending financed with transfers declined from
70 percent in 1992 to 40 percent in 2007 (Figure 13)—one of the largest reductions among
the OECD countries. However, transfers and borrowing as a share of sub-national own
expenditure remain above the OECD average. The ongoing fiscal federalism reform aims at
closing the gap further. The government has already approved most of the decrees to
implement the reform. But its impact remains uncertain, given: the long and still unclear
transitional arrangements; many yet-to-be-quantified features; the large and persistent
regional differences; and the track record of bailouts. Local authorities should be allowed to
tax all real estate properties. Clear safeguards need to be established to guarantee deficit
neutrality (at the minimum) and avoid increases in the tax burden. The reform should also be
integrated with the envisaged fiscal consolidation.

Box 3. European Semester and Italy
The new EU fiscal policy framework introduces more stringent fiscal targets. It
retains the medium-term objective (MTO) of a close-to-balance fiscal structural position
and introduces the principle that annual expenditure growth should not exceed (prudent)
medium-term GDP growth (“prudent fiscal policy making”).
The EU fiscal governance reforms could have important implications for Italy. At a
projected 2.8 percent of GDP deficit by 2016, Italy’s structural position would still be far
from the MTO and worse than the EA average structural deficit of about 1.6 percent.
Italy would comply with the prudent fiscal policy making rule under the staff’s baseline
projections of real primary expenditure and GDP growth for 2011–16 (for example)—on
average, -0.3 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively. The new framework proposes to
adopt a numerical benchmark for the debt-to-GDP ratio declining over the previous three
years at a rate of the order of 1/20th per year of its distance from 60 percent of GDP
threshold. This rule would call for a debt reduction of 3 percent of GDP per year in Italy.
However, the rule indicates that the level of the private sector debt should be taken into
consideration.
Domestic budget procedure has been modified to incorporate the new EU fiscal
framework. This is expected to strengthen the budget reform law (Legge di contabilità e
finanza pubblica) enacted in 2010 by explicitly banning the use of windfall current
revenue to finance current expenditure and extending the application of medium-term
spending limits to all the state budget expenditure. However, some of the previously
identified shortcomings persist, including the lack of a formal scrutiny of macroeconomic
forecasts and policies by an independent national institution.

43.
Staff recommended that pension reforms should be accelerated further. The
retirement age for women working in the private sector should be raised from 60 to 65 years
as for men. The planned increase in the early retirement age could be brought forward from
2013 to 2012. The automatic retirement age adjustment to changes in life expectancy will
increase the retirement age by up to 3.5 years by 2050, but its effectiveness depends on
policies to encourage longer participation of older workers. Private pensions should be
encouraged.

B. Financial Sector: Continuing to Boost Capital Buffers
44.
Bank profitability is expected to improve gradually, but vulnerabilities will
remain. Net interest income is expected to increase moderately, due to the rebound in loan
growth and the rise in lending rates. The pace of deterioration in credit quality is likely to
slow in 2011 and especially in 2012 thanks to the recovery. However, given the accumulated
high level of non-performing loans and fragile corporate balance sheets, banks will continue
to face high loan-loss provision costs. A large and stable retail funding base and ample
collateral to access Eurosystem refinancing will help Italian banks face liquidity and funding
risks, which have intensified with the EA sovereign crisis. However, Italian banks’ funding
costs remain sensitive to market sentiment about the Italian sovereign and may undermine
profitability.
45.
The implementation of the Basel III regulations will require a substantial
increase in bank capital. In the stress tests conducted by the Committee of European
Supervisors last summer, the five largest Italian banks were found to be sufficiently
capitalized, but one of them nearly failed to meet the 6 percent tier 1 threshold. The
authorities have urged banks to shore up capital buffers. According to the Quantitative
Impact Study (QIS) carried out by the authorities, the capital shortfall if Basel III capital
definitions and requirements were applied immediately would be around €40 billion for the
entire banking system. The new capital definition will be the main driver of the changes visà-vis current rules with the largest impact deriving from the new treatment of participations

24
in insurance companies and deferred tax assets. Parliament has approved an amendment to
the treatment of tax assets, which could allow deferred tax assets to be considered part of
capital even under Basel III regulation and reduce significantly this capital shortfall. The
authorities are currently seeking the endorsement of the Basel Committee and the EU
commission on this matter. According to the QIS, the forthcoming changes on the
computation of risk-weighted assets and the introduction of leverage and liquidity ratio
requirements will have a limited impact on Italian banks.
46.
Staff recommended that banks should recapitalize further and that
recapitalization should be front-loaded. The recently announced recapitalizations go a long
way towards the goal of strengthening banks’ position. But the implementation of Basel III
regulations requires a substantial capital increase, and financial markets demand capital
reinforcements well in advance of the phase-in period. Italian banks’ capital ratios are also
low compared to peers. Therefore, the announced recapitalization plans should be swiftly
implemented. Banks that remain with a relatively low capital base should strengthen it
through earnings retention, disposal of non-strategic assets, by taking advantage of the
outstanding convertible instruments, and by raising capital from the market. Further bank
mergers could also be part of the recapitalization strategy. The objective should be to build
core tier 1 capital beyond the minimum ratios required under Basel III, in line with evolving
international best practice.
47.
Staff suggested that consideration should be given to introducing governance
reforms in the banking system. Charitable foundations (Fondazioni)—which remain
significant shareholders in a number of major banks— have proven to be stable and
committed investors. However, better governance and more transparency would be desirable
(Box 4). Improving the governance of Banche Popolari would also strengthen shareholders’
protection. Reforms could include raising limits on proxy voting, encouraging institutional
investor representation at the board, and measures to ensure access to adequate, accurate, and
timely ownership information.
48.
Further recapitalization or restructuring of enterprises may be necessary. The
actions taken by the authorities in the past two years in support of SMEs are still in place,
and the bank loan moratorium agreement has been extended. While supporting SMEs was
appropriate, these measures could result in additional loan losses in the future if they are not
accompanied by recapitalization or corporate restructuring when needed. In this context, the
private equity fund for SMEs recently set up jointly by the government and the private sector
could strengthen the capital base of viable firms. Some improvements to the existing
bankruptcy regime could also help rehabilitate distressed, but creditworthy, firms and the
speedy liquidation of non-viable enterprises. The reorganization and debt restructuring
frameworks could be ameliorated, for instance, by clarifying the scope of the judicial review
of the restructuring plans. The current eligibility criteria for bankruptcy trustees could also be
reexamined to better promote the appointment of trustees with firm management and
restructuring skills.

25
Box 4: The Role of Foundations as Shareholders in the Italian Banks
Non-profit foundations (Fondazioni) are significant shareholders in a number of
major banks. Foundations were created during the process of banks’ privatization in the
early 1990s, when state-owned banks transferred their banking operations to newly-formed
joint-stock companies, and turned themselves into non-profit foundations. In the late 1990s,
foundations were recognized as private legal entities, with full statutory and operational
autonomy, and in most cases were obliged to sell their controlling interests in banks.
Nevertheless, the foundations continue to be important shareholders in several banks. As a
whole, foundations hold stakes of more than five percent in over fifty banks, including the
largest three, and own more than 20 percent of two of the largest three banks.
The foundations have proven to be long-term stable investors, but their role and the
way they operate also raise some issues. During the global crisis, and also more recently,
the foundations have provided stability to the banking system, by remaining committed
shareholders, and by subscribing for repeated capital increases. However, local politicians
who control foundations may exert undue political interference in banks’ governance.
Furthermore, their strong influential power in several banks’ boards may deter other
potential investors.
Enhancing the regime of foundations would be desirable to improve their autonomy,
transparency, and accountability. To strengthen their autonomy, current eligibility
requirements regarding members of their governing bodies could be refined and expanded.
To boost accountability vis-à-vis their social mandate, foundations could develop and
disclose on a regular basis detailed criteria on their investment strategies and exercise of
ownership rights. The existing supervisory arrangement, whereby foundations are
supervised by the Minister of Economy and Finance, should be reconsidered, given the
risks of blurred lines between supervised entities and the supervisor.
Foundations are already mandated by law to diversify and obtain adequate returns
on their investments. Given increasing international integration and harmonization among
banking systems and their institutional structures, part of their stakes in banks should
eventually be taken up by other, more market driven investors. In fact, it would be in the
foundations’ best interest to dismiss some of their bank stake holdings, as that would allow
greater investment diversification and higher returns.

49.
The authorities agreed that the recently announced recapitalization will
strengthen banks. They agree that some further efforts to shore up capital buffers may be
needed. They also share with staff the view that more restructuring and recapitalization may
be necessary in the non-financial corporate sector. The authorities are well aware of the
corporate governance issues concerning Fondazioni and Banche Popolari, and, on the latter,
they are pushing for reforms.

26
C. Structural Reforms: Comprehensive Reforms to Address Long-Term Weaknesses
50.
The gap in GDP per capita relative to the EU average is increasing. Italian
income per capita was 97 percent of the income of the major Western European countries in
1995 and it is currently at a level similar to the 1970s. The decline started before the euro
adoption and continued during and after the global financial crisis. The decline persisted
regardless of the various policies pursued by the governments.
51.
The authorities concurred with staff that increasing growth potential is the key
policy priority. They stressed that large regional differences within Italy require very
different approaches. In the Center-North, excessive bureaucracy should be cut. SMEs should
be encouraged to grow bigger and to internationalize. The government should have only a
catalytic role to favor these processes. In the South, basic infrastructure, better education,
security, and rule of law should be ensured.
52.
Staff pointed out that there has been little progress on structural reforms, even
some slippage. Stronger momentum is needed. The government recently introduced:
measures to reduce the bureaucratic burden for starting businesses; performance-related pay
in public administration; the possibility to file class action lawsuits against public sector
inefficiencies; and competitive tendering for local public services contracts. However,
parliament is undoing some previous product market liberalization, for instance reintroducing
minimum tariffs for lawyers’ services.

structural reforms. For a discussion of the methodology and detailed components, see IMF, 2010d, “Cross-Cutting Themes in Employment Experiences During the Crisis,”

53.
The EU Services Directive was implemented with some delay. In adherence with
the EU Service Directive, the government has completed a review of existing regulations on

27
service activities at the central, regional, and local level to ensure consistency of existing
regulation on service activities at all government levels with the EU legislation. The EC is
now in the process of assessing to what extent all the required changes in specific legislation
have been implemented. “Points of single contact" for business start-ups are not available
online yet.
54.
The National Reform Program identifies some key priorities, but more needs to
be done to unleash sustained growth. In addition to the reforms already in the
implementation stage, the plan envisages some new measures mostly in the energy sector and
education. Some decree laws were recently introduced to spur economic development,
including simplifying administrative and fiscal procedures, increasing corporate tax credit for
R&D and for hiring in the South, and establishing “zero bureaucracy areas” in the South.
But further labor and product market reforms are necessary to address long-lasting structural
problems. The authorities were open to staff’s
suggestion about a “growth commission.”
55.
Further product market reforms are
necessary to remove impediments to
competition. Regulation should be more
effective, promoting a higher degree of
competition by opening up further services and
network industries, and reducing public
ownership, especially at the local level. The
conflict of interest deriving from local
authorities’ dual role as regulators and
shareholders should be resolved.

the partial liberalization in the labor market may
have undermined investment in human capital and innovation, especially in the context of
incomplete product market liberalization. Harmonizing labor contracts and legislation
between protected and unprotected workers can boost employment. The authorities agreed
that the high level of youth unemployment is a problem. They pointed out that a recently
approved legislation on apprenticeship will facilitate entry into the labor force.

57.
Staff stressed that wage setting needs to promote job creation.
Nationally-bargained wages are less binding in the North, but too high for the South. In the
private sector, more decentralized bargaining would better align wages with productivity and
boost competitiveness. Recently, the Fiat car company has managed to negotiate with Italian
trade unions more flexible contracts outside the framework of nationally-negotiated and
binding collective contracts, which could shepherd in a more decentralized wage bargaining
system. In the public sector, regional differentiation of wages should be introduced to reflect

28
the cost of living. This could also lead to private sector wage moderation in regions with high
public employment concentration.
58.
Italy’s dismal economic performance has deep-rooted causes.4 Educational
attainment and the quality of education (as measured by PISA) are among the lowest across
OECD countries. Exports, which are specialized in low value-added products, have been
losing market share to competition from emerging markets in the last decade. The tax burden
is heavy, but the quality of public services is low. Regional income disparities are very large.
Several regions are plagued by organized criminality.5 A dual labor market, where highly
protected older workers co-exist with younger temporary workers, exacerbates inequality and
contribute to the low employment outcomes. Youth and long-term unemployment rates are
among the highest in OECD countries. Employment rates, especially among women, youth,
and older workers remain significantly below the EA average, with large regional disparities.
Labor market duality is also exacerbating income and wealth inequalities (See Box 5).
High-level of business and service regulation hinders competition, especially for professional
services. Delays of civil justice procedures are among the longest across OECD countries.

See forthcoming Selected Issues.

Italy ranks 67th on the Transparency International Corruption Perception Index 2010, among the lowest in the
EU. The Council of Europe’s Group of States against Corruption in its last evaluation of Italy (2008) noted that
"...corruption in public administration is widely diffused" and recognized the "connections (that) exist between
corruption and organized crime."

worth, while the richest
10 percent have 28 percent of
total disposable income. Furthermore, social mobility is low. The government has
partly offset the growing gap between rich and poor by increasing household taxation
and spending more on social benefits for the poor.
Labor markets play a crucial role in explaining income disparities.
Unemployment, especially long-term unemployment, has a regressive impact on
income equality. A higher employment rate, especially for women and youth, is
associated with lower economic disparities. Currently, the shares of employed youth
and women are especially low in Italy relative to the OECD average, underscoring the
potential equity gains from increased utilization of these groups. Dual labor markets
worsen inequality. A low level of education attainment is associated with an uneven
income distribution.
Inequality was exacerbated during the crisis, mainly through the increase in
unemployment. The rise in unemployment during crisis is estimated to have increased
inequality by 2.6 percentage points in Italy. The recession also increased the number of
discouraged workers who dropped out of the labor force, a factor that is likely to have
further exacerbated income disparities. On the other hand, social safety nets are likely
to have cushioned the impact of unemployment on inequality. A jobless recovery or
engrained long-term unemployment could further worsen economic disparities.

30
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
59.
Despite some elements of strength, key fragilities persist. Low private
indebtedness, the resilience of the financial sector, and the ongoing fiscal consolidation are
mitigating the spillover from international financial turbulence. However, the large public
debt, disappointing growth performance, and lagging structural reforms are persistent
weaknesses. The ongoing regional market distress is affecting domestic financial markets.
The recovery is disappointing, and growth prospects are weak. The structural reform agenda
stalled. Further delay in implementing comprehensive reforms may increase financial
instability.
60.
The overarching priority should be to boost the economy’s potential growth,
while maintaining fiscal discipline and financial stability. Fiscal consolidation is not
sustainable if it is not accompanied by solid growth. But growth potential can be increased
only with a (still missing) comprehensive program of structural reforms. The government is
committed to gradual fiscal consolidation but has not yet taken decisive steps to foster
reforms.
61.
Given the high level of public debt and the current market turbulence, fiscal
discipline is a prerequisite for growth. The ongoing fiscal consolidation is a fundamental
factor of stability and should continue.
62.
The authorities’ welcome commitment to reduce the fiscal deficit to close to zero
by 2014 needs to be accompanied by action. However, the authorities’ plan appears
optimistic on the growth effect of the envisaged fiscal consolidation. Also, the authorities
have so far resorted to across-the-board cuts and have not specified measures to achieve
consolidation beyond 2012. The large size of the envisaged fiscal retrenchment requires
structural changes which must be designed well in advance. This calls for a strong political
consensus and careful planning.
63.
The fiscal adjustment should rely on expenditure rationalization and help boost
potential growth. There is considerable scope for growth-enhancing savings in the public
sector. Containing public sector wages could generate positive spillovers for the private
sector. An increase in the retirement age for women in the private sector will boost
employment participation and generate savings. The province system could be streamlined,
removing an extra layer of bureaucracy.
64.
The tax system should be simplified to support growth and to reduce tax
evasion. Recognizing that the tax system is unduly complex and subject to abuse, the
government initiated a review of the preferential tax regimes. Staff welcomes this initiative
and sees it as an important component of the fiscal consolidation plan.
65.
The fiscal federalism reform should be integrated with the fiscal consolidation.
Clear safeguards need to be established to guarantee deficit neutrality and avoid an increase
in the tax burden. Local authorities should be allowed to tax all real estate properties.

31
Federalism at variable speeds should be considered, reflecting the regional differences in
administrative capacity.
66.
The authorities’ strong call for capital increases and the banks’ prompt response
are welcome and the announced recapitalization plans should be swiftly implemented.
Financial markets demand capital reinforcements well in advance of the Basel III phase-in
period. Banks should be encouraged to keep ample capital buffer. Banks that remain with a
relatively low capital base should strengthen it through earnings retention, disposal of
non-strategic assets, by taking advantage of the outstanding convertible instruments, and by
raising capital from the market. Further bank mergers could also be part of the
recapitalization strategy.
67.
Further recapitalization or restructuring of enterprises may be necessary. The
anti-crisis measures to sustain SMEs have been appropriate, but these actions should not
prevent needed restructuring or recapitalization. The private equity fund for SMEs recently
set up will be useful to strengthen enterprise capital. In addition, improving further the
bankruptcy regime would help rehabilitate distressed, but creditworthy, firms and liquidate
non-viable ones.
68.
The National Reform Program is a step in the right direction, but Italy’s
pervasive structural problems require further efforts. Italy’s chronically weak growth
performance has deep-rooted causes, including deep regional disparities, a heavy and
distortive tax burden, public service inefficiencies, high business and service regulations,
labor market duality, low education attainment, and export specialization in low value-added
products. The reform plan envisages some new measures mostly in the energy sector and
education but substantive reforms in other areas are missing.
69.
Only a comprehensive reform package can deliver growth. Complementary labor
and service sector reforms are essential to boost job creation, investment, and growth.
Promoting decentralized wage bargaining would allow wages to be better aligned with
productivity, providing firms with stronger incentives to invest. Harmonizing labor contracts
and employment legislation between permanent and temporary employment would reduce
labor market dualism and raise employment. Whenever fiscally possible, the authorities
should reduce the tax wedge, which is among the largest in EU. Competition in product
market and services need to be strengthened by giving more power to the antitrust authority.
Combating organized crime, corruption, and related money laundering, should remain a
priority.
70.
A national commission for growth should be considered. A comprehensive
structural reform package could raise productivity and enhance growth potential.
Establishing an independent review and advisory body for reforms (“growth commission”)
could foster consensus and focus policies on priority areas, while ensuring the continuity of
the reform agenda. Ownership of reforms at all level of government is a crucial prerequisite.
71.
It is proposed that the next Article IV Consultation be held on the regular 12-month
cycle.

Note: The f igure shows combinations of primary balance (PB) and growth-interest rate dif f erential (g-r) that would
result in the same levels of debt in 2030. In paritcular, by 2030: (i) with PB and (g-r) kept at historical average
levels, the debt would reach about 80 percent of GDP; (ii) with PB and (g-r) kept at their 2010 levels, the debt
would reach about 150 percent of GDP; and (iii) with PB and (g-r) kept at their expected 2014levels as projected in
the authorities' April 2011 Stability Programme Update (SP2011), the debt would reach close to 60 percent of
GDP. Historical averages and maximums ref er to the perod of 1999-2007.

1/ Assumptions underlying the illustrative scenarios (growth rates are average rates for 2017–2060):
A: Fiscal projections as in the staff's baseline for 2010–2016 (adjustment of 1.2% of GDP in
2011–2012 and loosening of about 1.0% of GDP in 2013–2016); long-term real GDP growth of 0.85%.
B: Fiscal projections as Scenario A; long-term real GDP growth of 1.1%.
C: Sustained fiscal adjustment , including 1.3% of GDP in 2011–2012 and 0.75% of GDP in each 2013–2015;
long-term real GDP growth of 1.1%. Structural balance is kept unchanged at zero once the headline overall
balance reaches zero in 2015. The overall size of the adjustment in 2011–2014 is similar to that envisaged in the
authorities' April 2011 Stability Programme Update.

ANNEX II. ITALY: STATISTICAL INFORMATION
Data provision is adequate for surveillance. Italy’s economic database is comprehensive and
of generally high quality. Italy has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard
(SDDS) and has posted the metadata on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
(DSBB). Data are provided to the Fund in a comprehensive manner (see attached table). The
authorities regularly publish a full range of economic and financial data, as well as a calendar
of dates for the main statistical releases. Italy is also subject to the statistical requirements
and timeliness and reporting standards of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB),
and has adopted the European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA95). The shift to chain-weighted
indices for national accounts has been largely completed over the course of 2006.
A Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC)—Data Module (Country
Report No. 02/234, 10/18/02) found Italy’s macroeconomic statistics to be of generally high
quality, but also identified some shortcomings that hindered an accurate and timely analysis
of economic and financial developments: (i) no statistical agency had the responsibility to
compile and disseminate a comprehensive statement of government finances, and a persistent
difference had emerged between the SGP-monitored fiscal deficit and the PSBR net of
privatization receipts (discussed in detail in the 2004 Staff Report); (ii) source data and/or
statistical techniques could be strengthened in several areas, most importantly, by raising
response rates on the enterprise surveys used in the national accounts and producer price
index, making price collection for the consumer price index more efficient, and improving
the coverage of cross-border financial transactions; (iii) balance of payments and government
finance statistics could be closer aligned with the internationally accepted methodological
guidelines on concepts and definitions, scope, classification and sectorization, and/or
valuation; and (iv) resources were under pressure in some parts of the National Institute of
Statistics (Istat) in the face of the statistical requirements of the EU and the Euro area.
Despite some improvements in the national accounts, changes in inventories are derived as a
residual and lumped together with the statistical discrepancy thus hampering the economic
analysis.
The Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes— Fiscal Transparency Module—
Update (Country Report No. 06/64, February 2006) found that some progress has been made
vis-à-vis the 2003 ROSC update, especially toward strengthening the integrity of data.
However, according to the report a few issues remain outstanding. First, the transparency and
timeliness of budget documents should be improved; for example, key details underlying
budgetary plans have typically been available only well after the draft budget itself,
hampering a proper the assessment of fiscal plans. Second, more information on financial
transactions between the government and public enterprises should be made available—this
would also help address the discrepancies in fiscal balances discussed above. Third, the
general lack of data on the operations of larger nonstate entities where the state is a
shareholder, such as the road company, should be addressed. Finally, as public private
partnerships gain ground from the current low base, these operations and associated

5
contingent liabilities should be transparently recorded, including in budget documentation;
and project evaluation should be strengthened across all levels of government. Also on fiscal
data, in recent years progress has been made in reconciling the discrepancy between the cashbased net borrowing requirement and the accrual budget deficit, and, as a result, the
statistical discrepancy has decreased in recent years. Furthermore, on-line access to main
fiscal documents has improved recently, and consolidated cash accounts of central
government economic entities (such as the road company, Anas) are reported in the quarterly
cash reports (relazione trimestrale di cassa) of the Ministry of Economy and Finance.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
Italy
On July 11, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Italy.1
Background
Italy is experiencing a weak recovery mainly driven by exports. The economy grew by
1.3 percent year-on-year in 2010, less than the euro area average of 1.7 percent. The
trend continued in the first quarter of 2011, with growth at 0.1 quarter-on-quarter.
Domestic demand was weak. Household spending remained cautious on the back of
rising unemployment and declining real disposable income. Investment rebounded
significantly in the first half of 2010 but weakened following the termination in June of
the tax incentives for investment. Government consumption was flat. The current
account deficit worsened despite robust export growth, owing to rising energy prices and
high import growth. Inflation increased moderately to 1.6 in 2010 from 0.8 percent in
2009 due to rising energy and commodity prices. Inflation rates are now comparable to
those in the euro area, mainly because of non-core components, while the inflation
differential on core prices remained relatively stable.
The authorities comfortably achieved the 2010 fiscal target. The overall fiscal balance
declined from 5.3 percent of GDP in 2009 to 4.5 percent of GDP in 2010, well below the
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings
up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm

target of 5.0 percent of GDP. The improvement reflected both good revenue
performance and contained budget expenditure. The increase in indirect taxes partly
offset the decline in capital revenues. The introduction in 2010 of more stringent VAT
refund rules reduced reimbursements by about 0.4 percent of GDP. The phasing out of
the 2009 anti-crisis measures and cuts in capital spending and the wage bill contained
expenses. Real primary current expenditure grew at the lowest rate since mid-1990s.
The structural balance improved by about 1 percentage point of GDP in 2010, among
the largest improvements in the euro area. However, payment delays increased. The
positive budgetary trends continued in the first months of 2011. The government has
recently enacted a fiscal adjustment package identifying the measures to reach a nearbalanced budget target by 2014.
Italian banks have been adversely affected by the recession, with their asset quality
worsening over the last two years due to the economic slowdown. Earnings were
hampered by low net interest income and high loan-loss provisions but banks remained
profitable. While the deterioration in credit quality is likely to slow, loan-loss provision
costs will remain elevated, given the high level of accumulated non-performing loans.
Profitability will also be undermined by rising funding costs. A large and stable retail
funding base and ample collateral to access Eurosystem refinancing help Italian banks
to face liquidity and funding risks, which have intensified with the euro area sovereign
crisis. The ongoing recapitalizations in the amount of about €12 billion are strengthening
them.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that Italy is experiencing a modest recovery, mainly driven by
exports. While the economy has strengths, the public debt is high and growth is
expected to remain constrained because of long-standing structural bottlenecks. The
main policy goals should be to continue pursuing fiscal consolidation to reduce the large
public debt, maintain financial sector stability, and boost growth potential through
structural reforms.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to reduce the fiscal deficit to below
3 percent of GDP by 2012 and close to zero by 2014. They saw the medium-term fiscal
package recently enacted by the government as an important step towards making
these goals achievable. Directors stressed that decisive implementation of the package
is key, and a number of them felt that more frontloaded spending measures would have
a positive effect on market sentiments. They noted that the adjustment appears to rely
also on measures at the sub-national level, and that the tax reform envisioned in the
package is still to be defined.
Directors emphasized that sustainable fiscal consolidation should rely first and foremost
on expenditure rationalization based on clear priorities. In this regard, they were
encouraged by the government’s intention to undertake comprehensive public

3
expenditure reviews. They emphasized that such reviews should result in major public
expenditure contraction and improve public sector’s efficiency. Containing the public
sector wage bill within a broader public administration reform would generate positive
spillovers for the private sector. While important pension reforms have already been
implemented, Directors saw scope for further measures to boost employment and
generate savings. More generally, Directors stressed that the large fiscal retrenchment
requires structural changes in public expenditure.
Turning to the revenue side, Directors noted that the tax system should be simplified to
support growth and enhance tax compliance. They welcomed the government’s ongoing
review of preferential tax regimes. Directors noted that careful execution of fiscal
federalism should not undermine fiscal discipline.
Directors commended the authorities’ preemptive call for bank capital increases and the
banks’ prompt response. They looked forward to swift completion of the recapitalization
plan. Directors noted that bank funding costs and equity prices remain sensitive to
market sentiment about the Italian sovereign, underscoring the need for fiscal
consolidation. They also saw scope for improving governance and transparency in some
local banks.
Directors stressed the need for decisive progress on structural reforms. While the
National Reform Program identifies several key priorities, a comprehensive package of
reforms is necessary to further raise productivity and enhance growth potential. In the
product market, measures should aim at establishing a more efficient regulatory
environment, opening up further services and network industries, and reducing public
ownership. In the labor market, policies should address duality and the low participation
rate. Reducing the labor tax burden, in a fiscally prudent way, could also boost
employment. More decentralized bargaining would better align wages with productivity
and boost competitiveness and, in this regard, Directors welcomed the flexibility
introduced by the recent labor market agreement. Directors concurred that establishing
an independent review and advisory body for reforms could foster consensus and focus
policies on priority areas, while ensuring the continuity of the reform agenda.

Statement by the Staff Representative on Italy
July 11, 2011
1.
This statement provides additional information on economic developments and policy
action in Italy since the Article IV mission complementing the staff report (SM/11/127). The
additional information does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
The recovery remains weak. In the first quarter, net exports and government
consumption made a positive contribution, while private consumption and gross fixed
investment were subdued and destocking of inventories was a drag. Business surveys point to
weak industrial and services activity also in the second quarter. HICP inflation rose to
3.0 percent year-on-year in May, owing to rising commodity and energy prices. The
unemployment rate declined to 8.1 percent in May. The general government deficit was
1.8 percent of annual GDP in the first quarter of 2011, less than in the same period in 2010.
Recent cash-based developments show that improvements continued in the second quarter.
3.
The employers’ confederation and the three major trade unions signed an
important labor agreement in June. The agreement modifies the rules on the
representation and contract enforceability and fosters wage bargaining decentralization.
4.
Sovereign and bank spreads have widened considerably over the past month as
the financial turmoil in Europe increased. After peaking at over 200 basis points (bps) in
late June, government bond spreads are now at 197 bps, about 50 bps up since mid-May.
Sovereign CDS spreads have also climbed to above 200 bps. In May, S&P’s cut Italy’s
outlook, and in June, Moody’s placed Italy’s Aa2 rating on review for a possible downgrade,
citing structural macroeconomic weaknesses, uncertain growth prospects, risks over fiscal
consolidation, and higher premiums for countries with large public debt. Banks’ CDS spreads
and equity prices have also worsened significantly, underperforming relatively to other
European peers. The outlook of several banks was also cut. The recapitalization plans
announced in April–May are being implemented.
5.
The government approved a fiscal package of about €50 billion (2¾ percent of
GDP) to reach a near-balanced budget by 2014. The parliament will vote on the package
in July. The package includes an extension of the public wage freeze and hiring restrictions
to 2014, a rationalization of public expenditure based on spending review, and bringing
forward the retirement age adjustment to life expectancy. Revenue measures include higher
taxes for luxury cars and an increase in financial transaction taxes. The package contains also
measures to revive growth, including tax incentives for young entrepreneurs and proposals
for liberalization in product markets. The government has also proposed a comprehensive
deficit-neutral tax reform, with the goal of lowering the personal income tax and rationalizing
tax expenditure further.

Statement by Arrigo Sadun, Executive Director for Italy
July 11, 2011
Recent Developments
Although the Italian economy has not yet fully regained the output losses incurred during the
2008–09 recession, a moderate recovery has been underway since mid-2009. GDP grew by
1.3 percent in 2010 and it is expected to increase by 1.1 percent this year. The recovery is
mostly driven by exports, as the large manufacturing sector has benefited from strong
demand from both its traditional trading partners and dynamic emerging market countries.
Domestic demand, however, remains subdued due to stagnant disposable income and weak
consumer sentiments.
The prudent fiscal stance maintained during the economic downturn has allowed the country
to reduce the government budget deficit from 5.3 percent of GDP in 2009 to 4.5 percent last
year, well below the original target. The government is fully on track to achieving its goal of
reducing the deficit to below 3 percent by next year. Recently, the government enacted a
comprehensive package of specific measures, amounting to almost 3 percent of GDP, aiming
to reinforce their commitment to bring the budget close to being balanced by 2014, as
indicated in the Stability Programme (SP) and the National Reform Programme (NRP),
already approved by the European institutions.
The worsening of the debt crisis in some EU sovereigns has put pressure on the Italian
sovereign bonds; however, the increases in the spreads with German bonds have been
relatively contained thanks to the high level of domestic savings and the low indebtedness of
the private sector, as well as to the country’s limited exposure to peripheral euro area
countries. Despite these elements of strength, some rating agencies have put Italian sovereign
debt on negative outlook out of concern that the low rate of growth could hamper the
financing of the large public debt.
Fiscal Policy
The fiscal strategy adopted during the crisis minimized the burden for public finances while
supporting employment and income through the automatic stabilizers. This policy was
successful in limiting its impact on public finances as recognized by the EU Council, which
in its June 20 statement recognized that: “Given the very high government debt ratio, Italy
kept an appropriately prudent fiscal stance during the crisis, refraining from undertaking a
large fiscal stimulus, and thus keeping the government deficit below the euro area average
in 2009-2010.”
On July 6, the cabinet enacted a medium-term fiscal plan detailing the measures necessary to
balance the budget by 2014. The plan is largely based on the recommendations by IMF staff
as well as those by the commissions of independent experts established by the Minister of
Finance. The plan includes a rationalization of public expenditures (based on a
comprehensive spending review), a reduction of tax evasion, a simplification of tax
expenditures, an enhancement of the previous pension reforms, renewed efforts on fiscal

2
federalism, and the reform of the inefficient tax system. Furthermore, reducing the tax wedge
(through a reduction of the two lowest income tax rates and a contemporaneous increase of
the VAT rate) is an integral part of the proposed tax reform. This fiscal package will fully
close the gap between targets and projections underscored in the staff report.
The Growth Strategy
The low potential growth of the Italian economy has long been recognized as one of its
fundamental weaknesses. Thus, the staff analysis on structural reforms and growth is quite
welcome by the authorities, who share much of the staff conclusions and recommendations.
In the face of growing expectations by the public opinion for quick and decisive fixes, it is
important to underscore that there is no silver bullet to deliver faster growth. Instead, a
successful growth strategy should be based on a wide range of specific measures, each one
producing only incremental benefits but collectively aligning the growth potential of the
Italian economy with those of other European countries.
The Italian authorities agree that further efforts should be made to eliminate the key
bottlenecks limiting the growth potential of the Italian economy, including low R&D
expenditures and innovations, the sharp regional divide, labor market segmentation, and
excessive product market regulation; other priorities are raising the efficiency of the public
administration, including the judicial system, and improving education levels. Accordingly,
the authorities are committed to prioritizing the reforms needed to remove the structural
bottlenecks that hamper growth. Such commitment has already been spelled out in the NRP,
which identified 85 structural measures, half of which were recently implemented and the
remaining ones are already in the legislative pipeline.
Increasing competition in the service market is considered crucial for improving productivity
and hence competitiveness. Accordingly, several measures have already been implemented to
increase the effectiveness of Public Administration, to increase competition for professional
services, and to streamline bureaucratic procedures in order to facilitate start-ups and
investments, including from abroad. Moreover, the recent introduction of the mandatory
mediation in civil and commercial disputes, aimed at reducing the length of contract
enforcement procedures, is considered a first step in reforming civil justice. In addition, the
modernization of bankruptcy law will also improve the business environment. The
implementation of these reforms is expected to result in a permanent increase of GDP
amounting to 0.4 percentage points per year from 2014.
1. Labor Market and Wage-Bargaining Reforms
Low labor participation, particularly among women, the youth, and older workers, is a key
factor accounting for the lower growth rates of the Italian economy. Accordingly, the Italian
authorities have already identified a number of measures, mostly in line with IMF
recommendations, to address these issues, including a recently approved legislation on
apprenticeship to facilitate the entry of young workers into the labor force.
Given the sharp disparities in productivity levels at both the regional and firm levels, it is
necessary to improve the flexibility of the labor market. The government is trying to achieve

3
this objective not through the automatic definition of regionally-differentiated wages as
suggested by staff, but rather through greater decentralization of the wage-bargaining
process. In this respect, on June 28th, the three main trade unions (CGIL, CISL, and UIL) and
the employer’s federation (Confindustria) signed a potentially far-reaching agreement on
wage negotiations that could substantially enhance the flexibility of the labor market. Under
certain circumstances, the agreement allows negotiations at the firm level to modify national
contracts, limit the use of sectarian strikes.
2. Further Enhancements to the Pension System
Building on previous reforms, the government has introduced additional measures that
should further strengthen the long-term sustainability of the pension system. The
postponement of the effective retirement by 12 months for salaried workers and by 18
months for self-employed will reduce pension expenditures over the period 2011-2060.
Preliminary estimates suggest that these measures will decrease the long-term debt dynamics
by 0.5 percentage point of GDP.
Starting from 2015, the statutory retirement age will increase according to changes in life
expectancy at 65 years old (measured over the preceding five-year period). From a technical
point of view, the first implementation of such a mechanism in 2015 will determine an
increase in the statutory retirement age. More substantial increases are foreseen in the next
decades along with the progress of population ageing.
3. Fiscal Federalism Well Underway
The institutional process aimed at gradually implementing fiscal federalism in Italy is well on
track, with primary legislation already approved and secondary legislation (implementing
decrees) on schedule. Recently-approved measures provide further tools for the strengthening
of local governments’ financial autonomy, and for enhancing the role of these entities in
fighting tax evasion (for example by envisaging the participation of municipalities in tax
auditing activities, as well as by allowing these entities retain one third of the amount of
taxes and penalties levied).
In order to enhance the financial autonomy of local entities and to improve management of
public goods and services at the local level, several measures have already been taken,
including the transfer of some state properties to regional and local municipalities. These are
expected to increase the efficiency of their spending with a particular emphasis on reducing
personnel costs.
The Financial Sector
Sound business models and prudent risk management practices, supported by effective
supervision, account for the broad resilience of the Italian financial system during the crisis.
This notwithstanding, the 2008-09 recession has taken its toll on asset quality and
profitability of Italian banks.

4
Non-performing loans of Italian banking groups, after rising substantially during the
economic downturn (to 9.1 percent of total loans), have increased only moderately in 2010 to
9.9 percent.
At the same time, Italian banks have supported the corporate sector: in the twelve months
leading up to April 2011, loans grew by 4.4 percent, the highest value among the main
countries of the euro area.
In the face of rising interest rates in the money market, Italian banks increased their use of
the Eurosystem’s refinancing, from euro 29 billion in 2009 to euro 52 billion in 2010.
Despite the increase in absolute terms, Italian banks’ use of the Eurosystem refinancing is
lower than that of other euro area banking systems, and well below the Italian banks’ share of
the euro area banking system as a whole. In the first half of 2011, total borrowing from the
Eurosystem decreased to an average of close to euro 40 billion.
Since 2010, the Bank of Italy has asked banks to strengthen their capital levels. The average
core tier 1 ratio of the five largest banks increased from 6.0 percent at end-2008 to 7.4
percent at end-2010. Since January 2011, five among the largest banks have completed or
announced recapitalization plans for a total of euro 11.7 billion (as opposed to euro 4 billion
for 2010 as a whole). Bank capitalization is also benefiting from retained earnings.
