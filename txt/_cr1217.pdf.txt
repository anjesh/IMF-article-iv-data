THE GAMBIA
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
December 22, 2011

KEY ISSUES
Context: The Gambian economy has performed well in recent years, despite a difficult
global environment. But large fiscal deficits have led to a sharp increase in domestic
debt. Tax revenues (relative to GDP) have fallen steadily since 2007, and there have
been episodes of severe overspending. In 2011, however, fiscal discipline has improved.
Discussions focused on the following issues:
Risks to macroeconomic stability: The high cost and rollover needs of domestic debt
is a risk to macroeconomic stability. Large fiscal deficits can also complicate monetary
policy (fiscal dominance) and often crowd out credit to the private sector.
Fiscal adjustment: A gradual fiscal adjustment over the medium term would curb
domestic borrowing and reduce interest costs. Tax reform could bolster government
revenues, while improving the business environment and international competitiveness.
New budget procedures would increase value-for-money of government spending.
Price stability and exchange rate flexibility: Eliminating fiscal dominance allows
monetary policy to focus better on price stability. Maintaining a flexible exchange rate
and a healthy stock of international reserves helps to guard against external shocks.
Financial sector stability: The banking system is well capitalized and liquid, but
supervision must remain vigilant to address possible weaknesses in individual banks.
Poverty reduction: The authorities’ forthcoming Programme for Accelerated Growth
and Employment (PAGE) seeks to boost growth and reduce poverty. But financing the
PAGE will be a challenge.
Debt sustainability: The Gambia continues to face a heavy debt burden. Based on
external debt indicators, there is still a high risk of debt distress.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

THE GAMBIA

BACKGROUND: ACHIEVING ROBUST GROWTH IN A
DIFFICULT GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT
1.
The Gambian economy achieved
robust growth with low-to-moderate
inflation in recent years, despite the global
economic crisis (Figure 1). Real GDP growth
averaged around 6½ percent a year during
2008–10, driven mainly by agriculture. Tourism
and remittances, however, were hit hard by the
global crisis. Meanwhile, inflation ranged
between 2½ and 7 percent (year-on-year), as
the Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG)
generally maintained a restrained monetary
stance. At times, this required extensive
mopping up of liquidity generated by central
bank financing of fiscal deficits.
2.
The government’s fiscal deficit
widened substantially during this period,
resulting in a sharp increase in domestic
debt (Figure 2). The deterioration of the fiscal
balance was caused by a steady decline in
government revenues and episodes of large
spending overruns. After peaking at nearly
17½ percent of GDP in 2007, revenues fell to
just under 15 percent of GDP in 2010, as
collections from all major taxes were eroded
away. At the same time, expenditures
(excluding donor financed projects) rose from
about 14½ percent of GDP to 18 percent of
GDP. Extra-budgetary expenditures, including
realized contingent liabilities, were major
factors behind the surge in government
spending, particularly in 2009 and 2010. The

ensuing large fiscal deficits, were mostly
financed with domestic borrowing.1
3.
Despite having received extensive
debt relief, The Gambia continued to face a
heavy debt burden, especially because of
rising domestic debt. As of end-2010,
domestic debt had risen to almost 30 percent
of GDP. Correspondingly, interest on domestic
debt has consumed an increasing share of
government revenues (18 percent of
government revenues in 2011). Moreover,
most domestic debt consists of short-term
Treasury bills, which poses substantial rollover
risks. Despite a large reduction in its external
debt under the Highly Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) Initiative and Multilateral
Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) in December 2007,
external debt indicators suggest that The
Gambia is still at high risk of debt distress.2
4.
The banking sector expanded at a
rapid pace in recent years. Between 2007 and
2010, the number of banks doubled (to 14),3
helping to fuel a deepening of financial
intermediation. During this period, credit to
the private sector and public enterprises
relative to GDP grew by about 4½ percentage
points, to nearly 17½ percent of GDP.
___________________________________________________

Because of a large slippage on the fiscal performance
criterion for end-December 2010, the recent
arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility expired
(on March 31, 2011) without completion of the final
review.

capacity, while intense competition among a
high number of banks in a relatively small
market contributed to increased risks to the
banking system.

Progress on reducing poverty has
been mixed. Various social indicators have
shown strong improvement (Table 9), notably
in education (primary school enrolment and
completion and youth literacy rates) and
health (immunization and child and maternal
mortality rates), but a large share of the
population still lives in poverty (58 percent in
2008). 4 The government’s recent initiative to
provide greater support to agriculture is
expected to have contributed to some
progress in reducing the incidence of poverty,
by boosting incomes for the rural poor. In
addition, the authorities are finalizing a new
poverty reduction strategy, the Programme for
Accelerated Growth and Employment (PAGE),
which places further emphasis on agriculture,
as well as investment in infrastructure.

Results from the 2010 household survey are
expected to be available soon. As a sign of
progress, in the areas of education and health, The
Gambia scores “green lights” in all 5 indicators for
“Investing in People” monitored by the Millennium
Challenge Corporation (update forthcoming).

The Gambia has received relatively
modest support from development partners
(Figure 3). Although a pickup is expected in
2011, donor grants averaged only about
2½ percent of GDP a year during 2007-10.
Some potential donors have expressed
concern over human rights and freedom of the
press. Most recently, President Jammeh was
re-elected by a wide margin to a fourth 5-year
term. Parliamentary elections are scheduled for
March 31, 2012.
7.
Progress on implementation of
recommendations from the 2010 Article IV
consultation has been mixed (Box 1).

THE GAMBIA

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 1. Implementing Recommendations from the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Implementation of the 2010 Article IV recommendations for fiscal consolidation, tax and public financial
management (PFM) reforms was mixed. The authorities introduced a fuel pricing formula that would
preserve excise taxes, but implementation has been irregular. Large extra-budgetary spending during the
final quarter of 2010 resulted in a higher-than-targeted deficit. In 2011, however, fiscal discipline has
improved. Good progress was achieved toward the introduction of the VAT, notably the VAT policy paper
has been endorsed by cabinet. However, measures to improve tax compliance have not yet been effective.
Also, most “nuisance” taxes have not been eliminated, contrary to staff’s recommendations. On PFM
reforms, good progress has been achieved to strengthen the system for monitoring and reporting on
budget execution. Also, in an initial step to improve transparency in the budget process, a budget policy
paper was prepared for 2012.
Progress was also mixed in implementing recommendations on monetary policy and the financial sector.
Until recently, the liquidity forecasting committee met only sporadically, which handicapped liquidity
management and the ability of the CBG to project and pre-announce upcoming offerings in T-bill auctions.
The reconciliation of government accounts at the CBG and the first stage of the planned increase in the
minimum capital requirement for commercial banks were completed as scheduled. Additional staff were
hired to beef up the CBG’s supervisory capacity, albeit not as many as recommended. Development of
short-term monetary instruments is behind schedule.
In line with staff’s advice, the authorities plan to seek funding alternatives for the PAGE that would
safeguard debt sustainability. These include concessional borrowing and private sector participation in
infrastructure investment. The authorities are already employing the latter option in the telecom sector with
help from the World Bank.

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN 2011: MAINTAINING
GROWTH, WHILE RESTORING FISCAL DISCIPLINE
8.
The Gambian economy has
continued to perform well in 2011, but
vulnerabilities persist. In particular, poor
weather conditions have weakened the
expected expansion in agriculture. Still, real
GDP is expected to grow by about
5½ percent—only a slight slowdown from the
previous year’s performance—partly due to
early indications of an upturn in tourism. Yearon-year inflation dipped to about 4 percent in
recent months and is expected to end the year
slightly below 5 percent.
9.
The Gambian authorities have made
significant progress restoring fiscal
discipline in 2011. By employing a strict cash
budgeting approach to limit spending to
available resources, 5government’s net
domestic borrowing (NDB) is on track to meet
the authorities’ target of just over 2½ percent
of GDP in 2011. Moreover, the government
cleared its overdraft balance with the CBG and
has refrained from new central bank financing
of the deficit. This progress toward eliminating
fiscal dominance and strengthening the
independence of the CBG has allowed
monetary policy to focus on achieving its
principal objective of maintaining low inflation.
In addition, the improved fiscal discipline has
contributed to a drop in T-bill yields in recent
months.

10.
However, the authorities have yet to
stop the steady erosion of government
revenues (relative to GDP). Government
revenues are expected to fall by another full
percentage point of GDP in 2011. Lost
revenues from fuel taxes, mainly because of
only partial implementation of the new fuel
pricing formula, accounted for much (about
three-fourths) of the revenue shortfall. By
allowing greater pass-through of international
fuel prices to the administered domestic retail
prices, the formula would have maintained fuel
excise taxes and eliminated unbudgeted
subsidies. Poor tax compliance and falling
duties on non-fuel imports also contributed to
the poor revenue effort.

The authorities have tried to maintain spending on
poverty reducing priorities, especially those that are
a precondition for donor grants.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 11

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

THE GAMBIA

ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: POSITIVE, BUT WITH RISKS
11.
Prospects for the Gambian economy
over the near and medium term are good.
Under the baseline scenario (not reflecting the
PAGE), real GDP is projected to continue to
grow at a robust pace (5½ percent a year), led
by healthy growth in agriculture, a gradual, but
sustained recovery in tourism and
construction, and returns to large ongoing
investment in telecommunications. This
outlook is predicated on a gradual fiscal
adjustment that would reduce NDB to
½ percent of GDP a year in 2014 and beyond,
as proposed by the Gambian authorities. 6 The
fiscal adjustment would help ensure the CBG’s
independence to focus on maintaining annual
inflation around its objective of 5 percent,
while also easing pressure on interest rates
and avoiding crowding out of the private
sector. The external current account deficit is
expected to narrow to about 13 percent of
GDP by 2016, financed primarily by foreign
direct investment (FDI), project grants, and
concessional loans. However, the coverage of
gross international reserves is projected to slip
to around 4 months of imports by end-2016.
12.
This scenario is subject to some
risks. First and foremost, fiscal shocks—such
as unanticipated revenue shortfalls and higherthan-budgeted spending—could threaten
macroeconomic stability. These shocks could
quickly lead to more domestic borrowing and

higher interest costs, especially given the high
roll-over requirements of outstanding debt.
Large fiscal deficits could also lead to a return
to fiscal dominance or crowding out effects
although risks of crowding out over the near
term are diminished by large capital injections
in the banking system arising from the
ongoing process to increase the minimum
capital requirement. Contingent liabilities in
particular are a leading potential source of
spending overruns. The Gambian economy is
also vulnerable to terms of trade and weatherrelated shocks.
13.
A weaker global economy poses a
near-term risk to growth, particularly for the
tourism sector, but this risk would likely be
mitigated by lower international prices for
fuels and other imported commodities. As has
been the case in recent years, policies that
focus on expanding agriculture, would also
help to cushion the impact on the Gambian
economy, especially for the rural poor.
Regarding the fiscal effects of a global
economic slowdown, the envisaged
contribution by a gradual recovery in the
tourism sector to the rebuilding of tax
revenues would likely be delayed. At the same
time, lower fuel prices would facilitate the full
restoration of fuel excise taxes, which is also an
important source of government revenues.

15.
Although there were some
differences, the authorities and staff
broadly agreed on the policy framework
going forward. In particular, noting the high
cost and roll-over risks of domestic debt, it was
agreed that curbing government’s domestic
borrowing should be the anchor for
macroeconomic policies over the medium
term.

A. Fiscal Adjustment: Near-Term Discipline and Medium-Term Reforms
16.
The authorities aim to reduce
reliance on net domestic borrowing with a
strong initial step in 2012, followed by a
further gradual decline in subsequent years.
The 2012 budget targets a reduction in NDB
by about 1 percentage point of GDP in 2012,
followed by further reductions to about
½ percent of GDP a year in 2014 and beyond.
Although the gradual adjustment may not
ease pressure on T-bill yields as quickly as the
sharper adjustment that was envisaged under
the recently expired Fund-supported program,
it would allow the authorities to minimize
potential negative effects on growth from
large sudden cuts in government spending.
The fiscal adjustment can be viewed as a twostage process: first, exercising discipline to
achieve near-term targets for NDB; and
second, a broader medium-term reform
agenda encompassing tax policy, revenue
administration, and public financial
management (PFM).

Near-Term Fiscal Discipline
Staff’s Advice
17.
To reap the benefits of a gradual
fiscal adjustment—notably an easing of
pressure on inflation and T-bill yields—as
early as possible, it is necessary to build
credibility in the authorities’ commitment
to the adjustment path. Thus, it is critical that
the near-term targets for NDB are met. For
2011, the authorities had set a ceiling for NDB
(GMD 815 million or just over 2½ percent of
GDP) that would stabilize the stock of
domestic debt at just over 29 percent of GDP.
For 2012, staff recommended a reduction in
NDB by about one percentage point of GDP,
which would initiate a downward trend in the
stock of domestic debt relative to GDP.
18.
Staff urged the authorities to
achieve the targets for NDB by continuing
to implement a strict cash budgeting
approach. In recent years, spending pressures

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 13

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

THE GAMBIA

during the final months of the year
undermined the successful execution of the
budget. Spending on contingent liabilities and
extra-budgetary items—such as bills and debt
service owed by the National Water and
Electricity Company (NAWEC), investments by
the Gambia Radio and Television Service
(GRTS) and the state-owned telephone
company (GAMTEL), and claims associated
with the failed privatization of the state-owned
cell phone company (GAMCEL)—were leading
sources of expenditure overruns. To meet the
NDB target in 2011, it is important to resist
such pressures, which typically crop up at the
end of the year. State-owned companies and
agencies must strive to balance their own
accounts, as was planned in the budget. The
lack of donor assistance to cover election
expenses, however, poses an additional strain
on budget execution. But even this must be
managed if the NDB target is to be met.
19.
On the revenue side, staff
recommended near-term measures to
reverse the drop in revenues that occurred
in 2011, including an immediate adjustment
in fuel prices, so that the full value of the
excise taxes could be collected. While this
adjustment would provide a modest, but much
needed revenue boost at the end of 2011,
adhering to the fuel price formula going
forward would have a strong impact and could
recoup much of the 1 percent of GDP of
revenues that were lost in 2011. Staff
recommended additional measures for the
2012 budget to lift projected tax revenues to
13.2 percent of GDP—the same as was
collected in 2010—including extending the
coverage of the general sales tax to electricity.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Authorities’ Views
20.
The authorities have made a
concerted effort to achieve their NDB
target for 2011. The lack of donor support for
elections added to the fiscal challenge, but
they were prepared to reallocate resources as
needed. Similarly, possible claims of
contingent liabilities and extra-budgetary
spending late in the year were expected to be
contained. Although spending on many
budgeted items has been trimmed, the
authorities reiterated that they were striving to
meet key targets for poverty reducing
expenditures, such as the 20 percent share of
total current expenditures going toward basic
and primary education.
21.
For 2012, the authorities proposed
an NDB target of 1.8 percent of GDP—a
reduction of almost one percentage point
of GDP. The authorities proposed increases for
a collection of miscellaneous taxes and fees
that would add up to about ½ percentage
point of GDP of additional revenues in 2012.
However, they were not inclined to take
stronger tax measures, mainly citing political
considerations during an election year. Though
prepared to improve the implementation of
the fuel price formula, they stopped short of
committing to an automatic application,
particularly if it implied large increases in retail
prices. Similarly, they were not prepared to
extend the sales tax to electricity tariffs,
arguing that this would negatively affect
businesses and the poor.
22.
To improve tax compliance, the
government is setting up a Commission of
Inquiry on Tax Evasion. At the same time, the
Gambia Revenue Authority (GRA) is stepping
up implementation of administrative measures
in line with recommendations by Fund

THE GAMBIA

technical assistance. Measures taken to
increase compliance among large taxpayers
appeared to have helped to significantly
increase income tax filings. However, revenue
collections have not gone up. The GRA cited a

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

lack of trained auditors as a primary reason for
the weak revenue effects. The authorities
anticipated that the new Commission of
Inquiry will raise awareness about compliance
and help boost revenues.

B. Medium-Term Fiscal Adjustment to Support Long-Term Growth
Staff’s Advice
23.
Staff advocated a slightly larger
fiscal adjustment, whereby NDB would be
reduced to near zero in 2014 and beyond,
compared with the authorities’ goal of
½ percent of GDP a year. Although the
differences in the two paths are minor in terms
of reducing interest costs and ensuring debt
sustainability, staff noted that the zero NDB
target could give a clearer signal that the focus
of the adjustment is on debt reduction
(relative to GDP). In either case, however,
credibility of the adjustment is key to
generating the fiscal savings from lower
interest rates. Staff urged the authorities to
rigorously implement the budget and
consistently meet NDB targets year after year.
The medium-term fiscal adjustment also
provides an opportunity to step up reforms of
tax policy, revenue administration, and public
financial management that would enhance the
effectiveness of government and The Gambia’s
international competitiveness.
24.
Staff advocated a comprehensive
tax reform to help rebuild government
revenues, while boosting the efficiency of
the tax system (Box 2 and Appendix 1).
Building upon the planned introduction of a
VAT in January 2013, staff recommended flat
rate personal and company income taxes with
minimal exemptions and deductions. The
proposed reform emphasizes simplicity, broad

coverage, and low tax rates. Similar reforms
have succeeded to increase tax buoyancy and
compliance and to enhance competitiveness in
a number of countries, including in Africa. Staff
envisages that sequencing of the reform would
start with planned improvements in revenue
administration and regular implementation of
a fuel pricing formula that would help preserve
excise taxes. In line with past advice, staff also
recommended the elimination of “nuisance”
taxes—low yielding taxes that do not warrant
the resources absorbed by administration and
compliance—in the run-up to introduction of
the VAT. To allow the authorities’ efforts to
focus on the introduction of the VAT as
scheduled, staff recommended that the reform
of income taxes should come after the VAT,
say in 2014. This would allow further study and
debate on the parameters and objectives of
the tax to ensure a smooth transition.
25.
Staff engaged both high-level
government officials, as well as
representatives of the business community
in the discussions on tax reform. While there
was a strong interest in the reforms, it would
be challenging to extend both VAT and
income taxes to some sensitive sectors such as
electricity and trade in basic foodstuffs. As a
next step, staff recommended an assessment
of tax expenditures in the country.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 15

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

THE GAMBIA

Box 2. Comprehensive Tax Reform in The Gambia
The Gambian authorities are facing significant challenges in the areas of revenue policy and
administration. Tax revenues relative to GDP have lagged behind regional averages and have declined in
recent years. This cannot be explained entirely by cyclical factors and the changing structure of the
economy, notably the strong expansion in agriculture, which is largely outside the tax net. Rising tax
expenditures and widespread tax evasion have eroded the tax base. Tax rates are high and the system is
widely perceived as unfair. There is widespread rent-seeking, as Gambian entrepreneurs expend scarce time,
energy, and talent on obtaining tax preferences. Moreover, compliance procedures are cumbersome for
both the GRA and the private sector. Indeed, results from the 2012 World Bank Doing Business report
suggest that difficulties with the tax system have weakened The Gambia’s international competitiveness
(Appendix 2).
These challenges could be addressed by further tax reforms aimed at broadening the tax base,
eliminating “nuisance” taxes, and simplifying direct taxes, including by lowering both the number
and levels of tax rates. If implemented well, such a reform would complement and reinforce the ongoing
push to improve revenue administration and compliance. Simpler and lower taxes are easier to enforce and
to comply with. Simpler and lower direct taxes would encourage the acceptance of the VAT.
There has been widespread experience with similar tax reforms around the world, including
throughout Eastern and Central Europe. Evidence indicates (see Appendix 1) that such reform packages
can enhance revenue. These reforms also tend to make tax systems more equitable, especially if the preexisting system was applied unevenly.
A significant broadening of the tax base ought to be part and parcel of the reform. A first step would
be for the authorities to complete a comprehensive survey and estimates of tax expenditures. Annual
assessment of tax expenditures would help highlight the costs of various tax incentives and therefore make
it more difficult to justify special tax privileges.

26.
Staff urged the authorities to make
further progress with the ongoing
introduction of the VAT. The policy paper for
the VAT has been endorsed by cabinet, 7 but a
number of legislative and administrative steps
need to be taken before it can be successfully
implemented. Widespread taxpayer education
is also necessary.

________________________________

The VAT Policy Paper identifies a uniform tax rate
of 15 percent and an appropriately high threshold
(GMD 1 million). Electricity is exempted.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

27.
Strengthening revenue
administration is essential for a successful
tax reform. The mission urged the Gambia
Revenue Authority (GRA) to make rapid
progress on its reform agenda, particularly for
the Large Taxpayer Unit, which has received
extensive support from Fund technical
assistance. Simplicity aspects of the proposed
tax reform, together with lower tax rates
should facilitate revenue administration.
28.
Given the resource constraints under
current policies, expenditures would need
to be restrained over the medium term,
growing roughly in line with GDP. Within

THE GAMBIA

this envelope, the government intends to
increase the share of total spending directed
toward agriculture. At the same time, spending
is expected to shift from current to capital
expenditures. Fiscal savings on interest
payments and a modest reduction in subsidies,
would allow a commensurate increase in
physical investment, such as irrigation projects.
The wage bill is projected to remain steady
relative to GDP. If additional resources are
generated through greater revenue
mobilization or increased donor support, staff
envisages that these could be directed toward
PAGE priorities.
29.
Further progress on PFM reforms is
essential for getting greater value-formoney on government expenditures. Key
areas of PFM reform include (i) strengthening
the budget process, expenditure framework
(MTEF) and program-notably preparation of a
budget policy paper and a phased-in approach
to a medium-term based budgeting; and
(ii) enhancing internal and external audit
functions. With support from the World Bank,
the integrated financial management
information system (IFMIS) has been rolled out
to all government offices and the interface
with the CBG has been established. The IFMIS
is expected to significantly improve monitoring
and reporting of government expenditures.
The recent submission of the audited

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

government accounts for 2007—the first year
to use inputs from IFMIS—to the National
Assembly was an important step forward for
transparency and governance and should pave
the way for accelerated preparation and
submission of audited accounts for
subsequent years.
Authorities’ Views
30.
The authorities welcomed proposals
to modernize the tax system. They renewed
their commitment to introduce the VAT and
promised to step up preparations. In particular,
they will immediately prepare a VAT bill (with
Fund technical assistance) and expedite its
submission to the National Assembly.
Nevertheless, taking note of delays in the
preparations for the VAT thus far, the
authorities cautioned that the introduction of
the VAT could be delayed by a year to January
2014. On revenue administration, the
authorities considered the planned Committee
of Enquiry on Tax Evasion as a key element of
their strategy to boost tax compliance. To
better assess the appropriateness and
feasibility of a comprehensive tax reform, the
authorities expressed that further study is
needed, including an assessment of tax
expenditures under the current system. They
were particularly cautious that a major reform
might overwhelm administrative capacity and
jeopardize revenue collections.

C. Monetary Policy and Financial Sector Stability
31.
Price stability remains the focus of
monetary policy, with the CBG typically
aiming to keep inflation close to 5 percent
(y-o-y). To control inflation pressures, the CBG
targets broad money, mainly by observing
(end period) quarterly targets for reserve
money. For 2012, the CBG has targeted reserve
and broad money growth rates of 11.3 percent

and 13.2 percent, respectively, which would
allow ample growth of credit to the private
sector. The CBG’s discount rate serves as a
policy rate to signal the monetary policy
stance, but interest rates so far have weak
transmission power. In light of the recent dip
in inflation, the authorities lowered the
discount rate by one percentage point, to

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 17

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

THE GAMBIA

14 percent, at the October meeting of the
Monetary Policy Committee.
Staff’s Advice
32.
Staff emphasized that the progress
in recent months toward eliminating fiscal
dominance and strengthening the
independence of the CBG provides an
opportunity to improve the conduct of
monetary policy. Instead of reacting to mop
up unanticipated liquidity injections by central
bank financed government spending, the CBG
is now better placed to implement a more
consistent monetary policy with more
predictable use of policy instruments, notably
sales of T-bills. Staff recommends that the
CBG, in coordination with the Ministry of
Finance and Economic Affairs (MoFEA),
continue to improve its projections of T-bill
auctions for the month ahead, with a view
toward publicly announcing details of planned
offerings in early 2012. This would likely
enhance competition in the T-bill auction,
which could help to lower yields, while also
enabling banks to better plan their investment
portfolio decisions.
33.
Staff encouraged the CBG to build
its capacity to target average reserve
money (on a monthly basis), which has a far
more stable relationship with broader
money aggregates than end-period reserve
money. The challenge will be to manage
liquidity on a daily basis in a manner
consistent with longer-range targets for
average reserve money, while maintaining
sufficient flexibility to ensure orderly behavior
in the interbank money market. This would
require development of daily liquidity
management tools (such as repos and reverse
repos), as well as further study of liquidity
demand and supply patterns for forecasting

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

purposes. Further study is also needed to
determine an effective policy interest rate. The
current policy rate—the rediscount rate—
tends to be punitive and has little direct
influence on market interest rates.
34.
CBG should continue to strengthen
financial stability. Banks are generally well
capitalized and liquid,8 although system-wide
averages can mask potential problems in
individual banks. With 13 banks competing for
a small customer base, competition is fierce
resulting in narrow profit margins. Moreover,
the Social Security and Housing Finance
Corporation (SSHFC) continues to be the major
depositor in the banking system and uses its
dominant position to drive up interest rates on
deposits. Fund technical assistance is helping
the CBG expand its toolkit for banking
supervision with stress-testing capability. Staff
encouraged the CBG to conduct more
frequent on- and off-site supervision based on
financial indicators for Prompt Corrective
Action (PCA). Also, given its role as a source of
funding to the banking system, the SSHFC
should be monitored more closely (Box 3 and
Appendix 4).
35.
Staff urged the CBG to ensure that
the credit reference bureau fully serves its
function as a reliable and timely source of
credit information. High quality information
would allow creditors to better guard against
exposure to nonperforming loans. It would
also allow borrowers with a good credit rating
to obtain loans at lower interest rates. This
would help address the high cost of financing,
which is a major concern for businesses.
________________________________
8
The minimum capital requirement will increase by
GMD 50 million, (to GMD 200 million) on December 31,
2012. This will likely increase capital adequacy and
liquidity even further in early 2013.

THE GAMBIA

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 3. The Gambia: Financial Sector Assessment*
The Gambian banking system underwent significant changes in recent years. From 2005 to 2010, the
number of banks increased from 5 to 14 (one dropped out in early 2011), credit to GDP expanded from
10 percent of GDP in 2005 to 17.4 percent of GDP in 2010, and credit growth averaged 23 percent a year
over the same period.
The Gambian banking system is well capitalized and liquid. The average risk adjusted capital ratio was
25.6 percent as of June 2011. However, across the 13 banks the capital adequacy ratio (CAR) ranges from
16.9 to 155.6 percent.** The ratio of liquid assets to short-term liabilities is 60 percent, with a large share of
short-term government paper and a few large depositors.
Asset quality has deteriorated over the years, but provisioning has not kept up. Nonperforming loans
(NPLs) have increased from 5 percent of total loans and advances in 2005 to 14.5 percent at end 2010.
However, recently NPL fell by 2 percentage points as of June 2011. Full provisioning (100 percent) is required
only for loans that are past due for more than 360 days and restructured loans attract only a 5 percent
provision.
Profitability weakened, turning negative in 2009, but began to recover in 2010. From 2007 to 2009,
return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE) dropped from 4.5 percent to -1.6 percent and from
36.4 percent to -24.9 percent, respectively. Both rations turned around from 2010, reaching 1.2 and
5.8 respectively by June 2011, owing to banks efforts to improve their portfolios.
Stress testing suggests that the banking system can withstand large shocks. Stress testing conducted in
March 2011 revealed that credit risk is the most important source of risk to the banking system. Banks can
withstand severe liquidity shocks arising from deposit withdrawals. The exchange rate and interest rate risks
are negligible.
The supervisory framework is robust, but can be further strengthened. It is based on the monitoring of
Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) indicators that are collected quarterly. As the largest depositor in the
banking system, the SSHFC’s investment decisions have effects on monetary policy through interest rates
and on the banking system and therefore should be monitored closely.
_____________________
* This assessment is based on a diagnostic of the banking system and stress testing exercises performed by Fund
technical assistance. The Fund is also providing training to build the CBG’s own capacity for stress testing.
** The particularly high (risk-weighted) CAR reflects a high share of investment in government T-bills.

Authorities’ Views
36.
The monetary authorities reiterated
that their main objective is price stability.
They agreed with the recommended steps and
noted that further technical assistance may be
needed to implement them. They are also keen

to announce T-bill offerings in advance, but
noted that better information sharing with
MoFEA is necessary.
37.
The authorities concurred with
staff’s analysis and recommendations on
financial sector stability. However, they

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 19

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

THE GAMBIA

officials from banks’ headquarters abroad and
preparing a full report, was only feasible on an

annual basis.

D. Exchange Rate Policy
38.
Results from staff’s assessment
suggest that the exchange rate is broadly
aligned with economic fundamentals; albeit
with results pointing to a small
overvaluation (of 6½-10 percent)
(Appendix 3). Indeed, in 2011 the Gambian
dalasi has depreciated modestly, partly
reflecting the greater exchange rate flexibility
in the current year, compared with 2010, when
there was a brief period of interventions by the
CBG.
Staff’s Advice
39.
The mission encouraged the
authorities to continue to follow a highly
flexible exchange rate policy, using foreign
exchange market interventions only to
maintain orderly market conditions. In
addition, it may be necessary for the CBG to
purchase foreign exchange to meet its target
for international reserves of about five months

of import cover. Given the U.S. dollar’s recent
appreciation against the euro, exchange rate
flexibility would help preserve The Gambia’s
competitiveness in the region and as a tourist
destination for Europeans. The staff noted that
historical data suggest that there were periods
where the authorities appeared to have
employed a soft peg to the U.S. dollar.
Authorities’ Views
40.
The authorities concurred with staff
on the need to maintain a flexible exchange
rate. They vigorously denied any pegging to
the U.S. dollar, pointing to the recent
depreciation of the dalasi as proof. They
explained that the interventions in 2010
addressed an acute demand for the U.S. dollar
by importers.

E. Poverty Reduction and Other Structural Reforms
41.
The PAGE seeks to reduce poverty
by boosting economic growth and
employment with a stepping up of
investment in infrastructure and
government support for agriculture,
education, and health; but financing the
PAGE is a big challenge. The focus on
agriculture is expected to enhance the
inclusiveness of growth over the near and
medium term, while education and
infrastructure investment—particularly in
telecommunications and electricity—would
help to diversify the economy down the road.
The DSA indicates that if concessional terms

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

are observed (minimum grant element of
35 percent), there is scope for up to
US$30 million a year of additional borrowing
over the next five years, while still maintaining
debt sustainability.
Staff’s Advice
42.
Staff encouraged the authorities to
build support for the PAGE among donors,
but cautioned against overly optimistic
projections for the resource envelope. Staff
cautioned against greater recourse to
domestic borrowing and noted that, by

THE GAMBIA

adhering to the fiscal adjustment, eventually
fiscal savings (of approximately ½ percent of
GDP a year by 2014) would be available for
PAGE priorities from the reduced interest costs
on domestic debt.
43.
Private sector participation in
infrastructure investment could make a
valuable contribution to PAGE objectives,
but to ensure that such participation is
productive, it is critical that an effective
institutional framework and strong
regulatory agencies are in place
beforehand. In particular, staff observed that
NAWEC’s poor financial condition is a
deterrent to private sector investment in the
electricity sector, as pointed out by World
Bank staff in a recent diagnostic analysis of the
sector. Staff encouraged that some initial steps
be taken to help improve NAWEC’s financial
position, including an automatic cost-of-fuel
adjustment in electricity tariffs, as well as steps
to strengthen the regulatory agency (PURA).
Staff further advised the authorities to work on
medium-term structural reforms needed to
establish NAWEC’s financial viability. Exploring
alternatives to the near-monopoly structure of
fuel importation might also help to reduce

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

energy costs. In addition, staff noted the
dynamic private sector led growth in the
telecom sector, where competition is fierce
and technological change rapid, and urged the
authorities to move forward with plans for a
fully transparent privatization of GAMCEL.
Such structural reforms would also help
eliminate major sources of contingent
liabilities that have impaired government
finances in recent years.
Authorities’ Views
44.
The authorities were keen to engage
development partners to help finance the
PAGE, but understood the need to be
realistic about the resource envelope. They
intend to organize a donor conference to
support the PAGE in the coming months, after
which a realistic action plan could be
budgeted for. They agreed with staff’s views
on boosting private sector participation, much
of which is already referenced to in the PAGE.
However, in the electricity sector, both NAWEC
and PURA officials emphasized that
government approval of a national energy
strategy/policy is needed.9

F. Debt Sustainability
45.
Although a DSA conducted jointly
with World Bank staff suggests that The
Gambia’s public debt is on a sustainable
path, the debt situation remains a concern.
Based on external debt indicators, The Gambia
continues to be at high risk of debt distress.
And, as discussed above, domestic debt is
costly and poses substantial rollover risks.

Staff’s Advice
46.
While the DSA suggests that there is
some scope for additional external
borrowing, staff recommended that loans

____________________________________________________
9

The authorities intend to seek guidance on an energy
strategy/policy from World Bank staff.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 21

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

THE GAMBIA

be restricted to concessional terms with a
minimum grant element of at least
35 percent. The staff urged the authorities to
articulate a medium-term debt strategy
consistent with gradually reducing NDB. Now
that T-bill yields have begun to fall, the
authorities could once again test the market
for longer-term bonds (beginning with 2- or
3-year bonds) in an effort to begin to lengthen
the maturity structure and reduce rollover
risks. As NDB declines, it is likely that interest
rates would continue to fall, which would allow

for larger offerings of longer-term instruments.
(see DSA report).
Authorities’ Views
47.
The authorities concurred with staff
on the debt sustainability analysis. Their
debt management strategy will be fully
consistent with the need to strengthen debt
sustainability. They intend to issue government
securities with maturities of 2-3 years, initially
in modest amounts to test the market.

G. Other Surveillance Items
Data Quality
48.
Quality of economic and financial
data is generally sufficient for effective
surveillance, but there is much room for
further improvement. For the national
accounts, next steps include developing
quarterly GDP statistics and GDP statistics by
expenditure category. The updating of the CPI
statistics based on the 2010 household survey
would be welcome, together with a review of
appropriate weights. BOP statistics and the
compiling and monitoring of project grants
need to be improved. The authorities would

continue to welcome Fund technical assistance
in these areas.

Outreach
49.
Staff met with a broad cross-section
of Gambian society to discuss surveillance
issues and the role of the Fund in The
Gambia. Meetings were held with members of
the National Assembly, opposition party
leaders, representatives of the business
community, labor union officials, NGOs,
university students, and the donor community.
A public presentation and discussion of the
proposed tax reform was well received.

STAFF APPRAISAL
50.
The Gambian economy has
performed well in recent years, despite a
difficult global environment. Real GDP
growth has been robust and inflation has
generally been low. Moreover, the authorities’
efforts to support agriculture appear to have
made growth more inclusive. To shed better
light on the impact on the poor, staff
encourages the authorities to complete the
2010 household survey soon. The outlook for

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

the Gambian economy is positive, although
there are a number of risks. In particular, the
high cost and rollover risks of domestic debt
could threaten macroeconomic stability.
51.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ 2012
budget, which aims at taking a strong initial
step toward reducing domestic borrowing.
To fully realize the benefits of lower
government borrowing and a sustained

THE GAMBIA

decline in the interest burden, it will be critical
that the authorities consistently meet the
targeted reduction in government borrowing,
which will build credibility in their efforts to
gradually bring net domestic borrowing down
further to ½ percent of GDP by 2014 and, if
possible, to near zero. To achieve this,
rebuilding revenues will be essential, especially
in light of growing spending needs associated
with the authorities’ new poverty reduction
strategy, the Programme for Accelerated
Growth and Employment (PAGE). In particular,
staff encourages the authorities to take strong
and immediate actions to reverse the
worrisome erosion of tax revenues since 2007,
including a further decline in the tax-to-GDP
ratio of around 1 percent of GDP in 2011. Staff
urges the authorities to immediately adjust
fuel prices and reinstate regular adjustments in
line with a fuel pricing formula that would
allow greater pass-through of changes in
world prices and help preserve revenues from
fuel taxes.
52.
Staff encourages the authorities to
build upon the ongoing efforts to introduce
a VAT by January 2013 and pursue a
comprehensive tax reform. A reform that
emphasizes simplicity, broad coverage, and
low tax rates could bolster revenues and add
buoyancy to the tax system, while also
improving the business environment and
enhancing international competitiveness.
Despite recent delays in the steps needed to
implement the VAT, staff urges the authorities
to strive toward meeting the January 2013
target date. In addition, staff recommends that
the VAT bill extend coverage of the tax to the
electricity sector.
53.
Improving tax compliance is
necessary not only to boost revenues in the
near-term, but also to provide a foundation

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

for introducing the VAT and other tax
reforms. The authorities’ decision to establish
a commission of inquiry on tax evasion could
raise awareness among the public and
hopefully lead to a buy-in on compliance
enhancing measures. At the same time, the
Gambia Revenue Authority urgently needs to
strengthen the large taxpayers unit,
particularly its auditing capabilities.
54.
Government’s expenditure restraint
in 2011 has been a welcomed improvement
from the spending overruns in recent years.
Already, there has been some pay off, as T-bill
yields are coming down. However, staff
encourages the authorities to step up the pace
of public financial management reforms,
particularly on budget procedures, execution,
and monitoring to ensure value-for-money
from government spending. In the mean time,
and especially during the run-up to
parliamentarian elections, staff encourages the
authorities to stay the course by maintaining
strict cash budgeting.
55.
With fiscal dominance abating, the
Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG) has an
opportunity to better focus monetary
policy on its primary goal of maintaining
low inflation. The CBG should endeavor to
develop a near-term liquidity management
strategy and tools that would assist it in
achieving this objective.
56.
The Gambia has appropriately
maintained a floating exchange rate
regime. An assessment by staff suggests that
the exchange rate is broadly in line with
fundamentals, although there may have been a
small overvaluation. Instances of heavy
interventions around mid-2010 have not been
repeated in 2011 as the dalasi depreciated
modestly in real effective terms. Going forward

interventions should be limited to
safeguarding orderly market conditions and to
meeting the CBG’s international reserves
target.
57.
The banking system is well
capitalized and liquid, but supervision must
remain vigilant to address possible
weaknesses in individual banks. The CBG has
a well-articulated banking supervision
framework which, nevertheless, could be
further improved. The financial indicators for
prompt corrective action are extremely useful
supervisory tools that provide detailed
information on the health of the banking
system and should be monitored frequently.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to
strengthen the supervisory apparatus through
the introduction of risk-based supervision and
stress-testing. Staff urges the authorities to
ensure that the Credit Reference Bureau
maintains a high-quality and up-to-date
database, not only to help banks contain
nonperforming loans, but also to enable
borrowers with good credit ratings to access
financing at lower interest rates. Given its
prominent role, it will be important to monitor
the impact of the Social Security and Housing
Finance Corporation’s investment policy and
portfolio structure on the financial sector.

58.
A well-specified debt management
strategy is needed to ensure debt
sustainability. Key elements of such a strategy
include limiting external financing to
concessional terms, while gradually reducing
net domestic borrowing to lower interest costs.
As yields drop, longer-term government
securities could be issued to reduce rollover
risks.
59.
Financing the PAGE will be a major
challenge. Although there is some scope for
additional external borrowing on concessional
terms, which would be consistent with debt
sustainability, the authorities would need to
seek private sector participation for some
major infrastructure investments. For this
participation to be productive, an effective
institutional framework and strong regulatory
agencies must be in place beforehand. In
particular, to address energy needs, staff
encourages the authorities to formulate a
strategy that ensures a financially viable
electric utility company under such a
regulatory framework.
60.
Staff recommends that the next
Article IV consultation for The Gambia take
place on the standard 12-month cycle.

Another part is due to a complex tax system
which has created a vicious circle, with a
multiplicity of taxes (some with relatively high

The Gambian authorities are facing
significant challenges in the areas of
revenue policy and administration. Tax
revenues relative to GDP have lagged behind
regional averages and have declined in recent
years (see Figures 1 and 2). Compliance is
poor. Cumbersome procedures are straining
the GRA and providing a disincentive to
private sector employment and investment.
The current system invites rent-seeking, as
Gambian entrepreneurs expend scarce time,
energy, and talent on obtaining tax
preferences. The current system is widely
perceived as unfair, due to tax evasion as well
as tax preferences for some and high rates for
everybody else. The country ranks 178 out of
183 countries in the world for ease of paying
taxes in the 2012 World Bank Doing Business
report (last among ECOWAS countries and
third from the bottom in AFR). Part of these
problems is due to weak institutional capacity.

These challenges could be addressed by
further tax reforms aimed at broadening
the tax base, eliminating “nuisance” taxes,
and simplifying direct taxes, including by
lowering both the number and levels of tax
rates. If implemented well, such a reform
would re-energize employment, investment,
and growth by improving economic incentives
and reducing the financial and administrative
burden on the private sector. The reform
would speed up progress toward meeting the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and
the objectives of the Programme for
Accelerated Growth and Employment (PAGE),
the country’s new poverty reduction strategy.
Second, a major tax reform would complement
and reinforce the ongoing push to improve
revenue administration and compliance.
Simpler and lower taxes are easier to enforce
and comply with. Third, such reforms could
boost tax revenues by accelerating growth, by
improving compliance, and by re-focusing the
revenue side of the budget on its core mission:
raising revenue. Table 1 presents some crosscountry evidence which indicates that similar
reform packages can enhance revenue. Out of
18 countries listed in that table, nine
experienced an increase in revenues from
personal and corporate income tax (PIT and
CIT), 11 countries collected more revenues

THE GAMBIA

from indirect taxes (VAT and excise tax), and in
12 countries the sum total of revenues from
PIT, CIT, and indirect taxes went up. Fourth, the
proposed reform would make The Gambia’s
system more equitable. Broadening the tax
base would promote both horizontal and
vertical equity. Raising the personal exemption
for PIT and improving compliance would
enhance vertical equity, especially if these are
combined with subjecting electricity
consumption to sales tax (and later the VAT)
and with raising more revenue from excise
taxes on fuel. Fifth, simpler and lower direct
taxes would encourage the acceptance of the
VAT. Table 1 suggests that similar reform
packages around the world are associated with
higher revenues from indirect taxes.
Mauritius is a recent example of an AFR
country which implemented a major tax
reform, several aspects of which are worth
emulating. There are significant differences
between the two countries: for example,
Mauritius is a middle-income country and also
an off-shore financial center. However, there
are certain similarities as well: both countries

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

are small, highly dependent on tourism, and
with newly established revenue authorities.
Furthermore, the Mauritius reform was
implemented in the context of a major fiscal
adjustment. In mid-2007, Mauritius replaced
the four rates in its personal income tax
(ranging from 10 to 30 percent) with a single
rate of 15 percent, combined with a
significantly higher personal exemption, which
removed a large fraction of small taxpayers
from the tax net. At the same time, Mauritius
also simplified its corporate income tax, which
now features a single 15 percent rate. The VAT
rate is also 15 percent. Furthermore, the
reform broadened the tax base significantly,
including by consolidating various reliefs,
allowances, deductions, and exemptions. As a
result, tax expenditures are estimated to have
fallen from 3 percent of GDP to 1.5 percent.
The country ranks 11 out of 183 countries in
the world for ease of paying taxes in the 2012
World Bank Doing Business report (which
makes Mauritius the highest-ranked AFR
country).

While correlation is not causation, the
evidence presented in Table 2 is suggestive:
revenues from PIT, CIT, VAT as well as overall
tax revenues were significantly higher in 2008–
2010 than during 2004–2006. Of course, an
identical tax reform package might yield
different results in different countries: it all
depends on the structure of the economy, on
institutional capacities and constraints, and on
the behavioral response to tax reform.

A significant broadening of the tax base
ought to be part and parcel of the reform
package. A first step would be for the
authorities to complete a comprehensive
survey and estimates of tax expenditures.
Annual assessment of tax expenditures would
help highlight the costs of various tax
incentives and therefore make it more difficult
to justify special tax privileges. Several
opportunities to broaden the tax base are easy
to spot. Various waivers of excise tax, sales tax,
and import duty could be eliminated.
Electricity consumption could become subject
to sales tax (and eventually to VAT). The fuel
pricing formula could be implemented
regularly in order to ensure stable and positive
revenues from excise taxes on fuel. The Fringe
Benefit Tax rate could be re-aligned with the
reformed personal income tax rate and applied
consistently to all allowances. Various tax

36

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

preferences extended through The Gambia
Investment and Export Promotion Act 2010
(GIEPA) and its predecessors could be allowed
to expire without renewal and the authorities
could abstain from extending new ones.
An ambitious tax reform must be preceded
by significant improvements in revenue
administration and compliance. The
authorities should follow through with their
compliance improvement strategy. It should
be a public priority and involve a lot of political
support, including at the highest levels of
government.
The timing and pace of tax reform will be
driven by institutional capacity constraints,
among other factors. Similar reform packages
have been successfully implemented in many
countries around the world (see Table 1). Some
have opted for a piecemeal approach, while a
big-bang strategy has worked very well for
others (including Mauritius). If the Gambian
authorities select the big-bang approach, a
natural launching date for the reforms would
be January 2013, concurrently with the VAT
launch. A downside here would be the strain
this would add to the country’s institutional
capacity. If the authorities choose a more
gradual reform path, the reforms could be
staggered over a period and come on the
heels of improvements in compliance, revenue
administration, and revenue collections.

Appendix 2: Competitiveness of The Gambia1
According to survey-based indicators, The
Gambia ranks poorly in the entire sample of
countries, albeit somewhat better than in
most other countries in the region. The 2011
World Bank’s Doing Business Survey ranks The
Gambia 146th globally and 5th among
ECOWAS countries in terms of overall ease of
doing business, and 3rd in cross-border
trading and enforcing contracts. The Gambia
also has relatively high overall ranking in the
2011 Global Competitiveness Index (99th)
compared to its neighbors, largely owing to its
relatively good infrastructure, flexible labor
market and well educated workforce.
Lack of progress in addressing key
institutional bottlenecks could begin to
undermine The Gambia’s relative
competitiveness in the region. The

cumulative change in Doing Business score
from 2006 to 2011 indicates that The Gambia
has lagged behind most of its ECOWAS peers
in improving its overall business environment,
underperformed only by Cape Verde and
Guinea. In order to stay competitive, The
Gambia needs to augment its effort to address
its key institutional bottlenecks, including
ensuring better investor protection and
removing impediments for paying taxes. For
example, moderate improvements in paying
taxes can potentially yield a significant gain in
The Gambia’s overall competitiveness.
Simulation result shows that by reducing the
time to prepare and pay taxes, as well as
lowering total tax rate measured as percentage
of profit, to ECOWAS averages, The Gambia’s
global ranking improves from 146 to 134 and
to 3rd among ECOWAS countries.

Appendix 3. Is the Dalasi Aligned with the Economy’s Fundamentals?1
A number of complementary approaches
were adopted to assess whether The
Gambia’s exchange rate is aligned with
fundamentals. These alternative approaches,
proposed by the IMF’s Consultative Group on
Exchange Rate Issues (CGER), include the
macroeconomic balance approach, the
external sustainability approach, and the
equilibrium real exchange rate approach. The
purchasing power parity approach was also
included in the assessment. These alternative
approaches produce somewhat different
results.
The macroeconomic balance approach
suggests that the dalasi may be overvalued
by 17 percent. The country’s underlying
current account deficit is 12 percent of GDP.
The underlying fundamental driving this result
is the large fiscal deficits in recent years.
Temporary factors, such as governmentfinanced external payments for a large
telecommunications project, also played a role.
With an estimated current account norm of
about 2 percent, roughly in line with estimates
in past assessments, a depreciation of
17 percent would be needed to restore
sustainability.
The external sustainability approach
indicates an overvaluation of 81/2 percent.
With an underlying current account balance of
121/4 percent, the Gambia’s long-run net
foreign assets (NFA) would be unsustainable at
about
-138 percent of GDP. In order to bring the NFA
to a sustainable level of -70 percent of GDP,
the exchange rate would require a
1

depreciation of 81/2 percent with a
corresponding current account deficit of
61/2 percent of GDP.
Results from the equilibrium real exchange
rate approach suggest an overvaluation of
between 3 and 6 percent. Given The
Gambia’s unique status as a very small and
very open West African country with a flexible
exchange rate, staff adopted a single-country
approach. Staff further adopted a vector error
correction model (VECM) to estimate the real
effective exchange rate (REER) because of the
presence of a cointegrating relationship
between the REER and its fundamentals. Given
the relatively small sample size (1980–2010)
and the presence of a unit root, staff also used
Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) with one lag.
While the VECM estimates indicate that the
exchange rate may be overvalued by
6 percent, the OLS estimates suggest a slightly
smaller overvaluation of about 3 percent. In
both cases, the terms of trade, the nominal
exchange rate, and government consumption
are the most significant explanatory variables.

one should be mindful of data shortcomings
and methodological uncertainties in

I.

STRUCTURE OF THE BANKING

SYSTEM AND HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
The Gambia’s financial system is dominated
by banks and has undergone big changes
over the last decade. The number of banks
increased from 4 in 2001 to 14 in 2009, with
several Nigerian banks entering the market
during 2007–2009 (one voluntarily wound
down in 2011). All but the largest bank have
majority foreign ownership. Based on their
total assets, Gambian banks can be classified
into three peer groups: (i) three large banks,
which represent around 57 percent of total
assets and loans at end-2010, (ii) three median
banks that account for around one fourth of
total assets and loans, and (iii) seven small
banks that account for 20 percent of assets
and 23 percent of loans to the industry.
Total assets grew rapidly, reaching
54 percent of GDP at end 2010. Loans to the
private sector represent only a little more than
25 percent of assets, while government
securities represent 29 percent of assets. Credit
to the private sector increased from 10 percent
of GDP in 2005 to 17.4 percent of GDP in 2010
and credit growth averaged 23 percent a year

over the same period. Total bank deposits
more than doubled during 2005-2010 to
D11.2 billion. Around 98 percent of deposits
are from local depositors and the largest
depositor in the banking system is a stateowned institution.

BANKING SYSTEM STRENGTHS

AND VULNERABILITIES
A.

System Condition

The banking system is well capitalized;
however the aggregate number masks a
wide dispersion across banks. With a CAR of
25.6 percent, the banking sector remains well
above the minimum requirement, which was
raised from 8 percent to 10 percent, as of May
2011. In response to the deteriorating
environment, the CBG raised the minimum
capital requirement from D 60 million to D
150 million with effect from end-2010, and to
D 200 million with effect from end-2012. All
13 banks complied with the new requirements
as of December 2010. While the new banks
tend to be highly capitalized, some of the
oldest and largest banks have significantly
lower CARs.

Banks have ample liquidity; however,
concentration of the largest deposits
deserves vigilance. Almost one third of banks’
assets are invested in government securities
and 17.6 percent of total assets are in the form
of highly liquid instruments: cash balances at
the CBG and with commercial banks. The
short-term liquidity ratio remains well above
the common international level of 30 percent.

42

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Although liquidity buffers remain high, banks
are vulnerable to funding liquidity shocks from
large depositors, pointing to a heavy reliance
on wholesale funding.
Although the loan portfolio of the banking
sector is small (29.8 percent of assets), its
concentration potentially poses major risks
to the banking system. The top four
borrowers account for 33 percent of the loan

THE GAMBIA

portfolio, based on June 2011 data. Moreover,
in one of the banks, the largest loan to one
borrower exceeds the maximum limit of
25 percent relative to the bank’s capital,
although a government guarantee is provided.
The largest borrowers are concentrated in
electricity, fuel, agriculture, and the
telecommunications sectors.
The loan portfolio quality has deteriorated
over time. Against the backdrop of the rapid
credit expansion and weakening of lending
standards, banks experienced a rapid
deterioration of their credit portfolio quality.
NPLs increased from 5 percent of total loans
and advances in 2005 to 14.5 percent at end
2010. Further losses may have been incurred
but have not as yet been accounted for, due to
a substantial lag between credit events and
loan loss accounting.
Provisioning requirements remain low. At
present, the regulatory prescribed loan loss
provisioning system in The Gambia is based on
days past due. For all loans up to 90 days past
due, only a 1 percent provisioning is required.
Full provisioning (100 percent) is required only
for loans that are past due for more than
360 days. Further, the current loan
classification rule allows banks to restructure
loans and charge only a 5 percent provision.
Although, following recommendations of the
July 2010 Article IV mission, NPLs now include
restructured loans, provisioning requirements
remain unchanged, and the loan classification
scheme does not include a watch or specialmention category that typically captures loans
that are delinquent up to 90 days. These rules
will result in banks’ losses being understated
and capital overstated.
Profitability has eroded and is likely to
erode further. ROA and ROE dropped from

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

2007 with the recent multiple entries of new
banks, as margins shrunk. Overhead and
staffing costs increased as a result of
competition. The power of wholesale
depositors to negotiate higher deposit interest
rates contributed to eroding profits. And
recently T-bills yields have dropped and are
likely to continue to slide, if the government
continues its fiscal adjustment efforts. If
provisioning requirements were to be
tightened, with 30-90 days past due attracting
5% provisioning, it would lead to a further
drop in profitability.
Although government T-bills are typically
held to maturity, market and related
government credit risk are high due to the
substantial concentration of banks’ assets.
Holdings of government bills vary from bank
to bank and ranges from almost 50 percent to
5 percent of total assets (from 564 percent to
1 percent of capital). This makes the banking
system poorly diversified against sovereign
risk: were the government to default or
restructure its debt, some banks would be hard
hit. Other market risks, such as related to
trading book or holdings of other securities,
are negligible.
Direct exposure to interest and exchange
rate risks remain limited. Banks tend to
match the re-pricing terms of their assets and
liabilities. The average maturity of loans in the
banking system is short (around 1 year), and
only very rarely exceeds five years. The
majority of term deposits are for three months.
Although loans are short-term, it is a common
practice among banks to adjust lending rates
when official interest rates change. The ability
to maintain a positive interest rate margin
between government t-bills and deposit
interest rates is a substantial source of income
for banks, especially for those banks that have

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 43

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

THE GAMBIA

a very small loan portfolio relative to their total
assets. A further decline in interest rates on
government t-bills and an increase in deposit
interest rates might push some banks to leave
the market. Dollarization is limited as foreign
exchange (FX) loans and deposits constitute a
relatively small (about 5 percent) share of
assets and liabilities, respectively. Banks’ net
open position is small at around 0.3 percent of
capital.
The entry of the new banks reduced
systemic, “too-big-to-fail” related risks, but
new potential risks have emerged. The share
of the largest player in the market shrank from
52 to 19 percent. Although this has decreased
problems related to potential costs from a
failure of a credit institution, the high number
of small, not very well diversified banks has
created new challenges. First, small banks do
not have sophisticated risk management
systems in place and consequently tend to
have weaker lending standards. Second, the
increased number of banks ratcheted up
supervisors’ work load. Third, the high share of
foreign ownership exposes the Gambian
banking system to potential cross-border
contagion effects. Against this background
there is anecdotal evidence that recently
banks’ lending standards have become more
stringent—for example, the maximum Loanto-Value (LTV) for new loans decreased from
100 percent to 75 percent. Also, to date, banks’
dependency on foreign capital inflows has
remained low. Gambian authorities are a party
to Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) on
cross-border cooperation in the area of
supervision of banking groups, with relevant
authorities of neighbor countries. Several
supervisory colleges were also established.

Stress Testing2

Stress testing results based on June 2011
data reveal that credit risk is the major
source of risk to the banking system. To
assess the current vulnerabilities of the
banking system, the effect of a multiple factor
shock scenario on credit risk was evaluated.
The shock assumes a decline in Gambian
exports (groundnut and cotton), as well as
lower receipts from the tourism sector. A
decline in export revenues might be brought
about by a number of factors, such as a
drought and/or a fall in groundnut and cotton
prices or, alternatively, an increase in energy
prices. A combination of all these factors
would result in a higher current account deficit
(CAD), lower government revenues, and lower
GDP growth. A technical assumption was made
that the government neither would be able to
cover the budget deficit with additional
borrowings from international institutions nor
inflate its debt. Moreover, the currency is
assumed to depreciate by 40 percent. Demand
for imports would decrease, whilst agriculture,
construction, and the trade sector would suffer
losses. NPLs and, subsequently, provisions
would increase. Credit growth would slow
down to half of its long term (2001–10) annual
average growth rate. Additional assumptions
were made regarding banks’ income, and the
capital position was adjusted for underprovisioning.3
________________________________________
2.

Data deficiencies hamper the analysis of risks in the
financial sector and data quality and timeliness should
be improved. Based on February 2011 mission’s
recommendations, the authorities are making a
concerted effort to improve the data reporting
system.
3

It was assumed that all NPLs require to be
100 percent provisioned, in line with international
practice and the mission’s recommendations.
Consequently, the initial capital base and risk
weighted assets (RWAs) were adjusted accordingly.

THE GAMBIA

The results from the multi-factor scenario
revealed that by the second quarter of
2012, two banks out of 13 will not meet the
minimum CAR (Table 3). Overall banking
sector’s CAR will decrease to 20.1 percent by
5.5 percent. One large bank and one medium
size bank will need recapitalization in Q2:2012,
however the cost for recapitalization will be
relatively small, approximately 0.45 percent of
GDP.
A credit risk stress-test’s results indicate
that once banks fully provision their NPLs,
two banks would need recapitalization,
though the amounts involved would be
negligible. The scenario assumes that a shock
to credit risk leads to a gradual increase in
provisioning levels for the current NPLs, to 100
percent eventually— in other words, due to
the weak loan classification system and low
provisioning requirements, ultimately all NPLs
will become losses.
Another credit risk stress-test’s results
indicate that once NPLs increase by 80
percent from their current level (largest
observed historical shock in 2001–10
period), and thereupon are 100 percent
provisioned, two banks (one large and one
medium) would be in need of a modest
amount of capital. The post-shock CAR is
21.4 percent for all banks, 13.9 percent for
large banks, 13.0 percent for medium banks,
and 50 percent for small banks—hence, the
shock impact was not significant.
Credit risk stress-test results show that the
high concentration of large exposures
poses the most significant risk to the
banking sector. The test results show that if
all three largest borrowers default
simultaneously, the CAR of six banks will fall
below minimum CAR, indicating two large

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

banks will become insolvent with negative
CAR. A small number of large companies with
well-connected business in the agriculture,
domestic trade, and import, energy, and
telecom industries dominate the borrower’s
market. The combined total of the largest
three exposures of each bank in the banking
system would add up, on average, to
42 percent of total industry loans. Should
some of these loans default simultaneously
from a shock or sharp drop in commodity
prices or an increase of energy prices, the
impact on the sector could be substantial.
Shock related to the restructuring of
government debt4 reveals that, with a
5 percent haircut, all the banks will meet
the minimum CAR, higher haircut will lead
to a substantial deterioration of their
capital positions. In the extreme case of a
50 percent of haircut, four banks will be
technically insolvent, having negative CAR.
Overall, credit risk stress tests broadly
confirmed the concerns raised in 2010
Article IV report and by the TA mission on
diagnostic assessment of the banking
system in 2011. Meanwhile, the results
highlighted several characteristics:
1) provisioning could be a more important
indicator than NPL ratios of credit risk.

The Gambia: Summary Results of the Stress Tests

THE GAMBIA

Especially during a period of credit expansion,
the NPL ratio could be shielded by the increase
in the credit base; 2) a high concentration of
exposures is an important source of credit risk;
3) Concerns with a number of large banks
suggest that the supervision of systemically
important banks needs to remain intense and
focused.
Stress tests indicate that the direct impact
from exchange rate risk is negligible, due to
the small size of banks’ net open positions.
While the long foreign exchange position of
most banks shields them from the direct
impact of the Gambian dalasi depreciation, it
exposes them to the risk of an appreciation of
the exchange rate. The stress test on exchange
rate risk was conducted to evaluate the direct
impact on the banking system. A 40 percent
depreciation of the Gambian dalasi would
reduce the average CAR by 0.3 percent.
Medium size banks are more exposed to
foreign exchange depreciation risks, and the
CAR would decline by 1 percentage points—
given their high capital buffers, their CAR will
remain well above the regulatory CAR
minimum level.
The effects of a change in interest rates on
the value of bank portfolios were
simulated. The interest rate risk was evaluated
using the newly collected June 2011 data on
the term structure of banks’ assets and
liabilities, as well as on weighted average
interest rates on loans and deposits. As the
cumulative maturity mismatch is relatively
small, the impact of an increase in interest
rates on portfolio valuation was not significant;
500 basis point increases in interest rate will
lower the CAR to 25.3 percent and lower the
average profitability of the banks (return on
assets) by 0.1 percent. However, it is difficult to
gauge which rates would ultimately have the

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

greatest impact on bank balance sheets as the
monetary policy transmission mechanism
appear to be weak.
Liquidity risk stress test results show that
the banking system is highly liquid and
could withstand severe shocks arising from
deposit withdrawals. However, its shock
absorption capacity is highly dependent on the
market liquidity of government securities and
on the behavior of wholesale depositors. The
stress testing on liquidity risk assessed whether
the banking sector could meet a sudden need
for a large amount of cash due to a loss of
public confidence in the banking sector that
generates a bank run. In particular, given the
high concentration of depositors, the test
shows for each bank how many days it would
withstand liquidity drain before having to
resort to accessing liquidity from outside
sources. The available liquid assets mainly
consist of cash, balances from other banks and
government securities, while deposits account
for the bulk of liquid liabilities (75 percent on
average). The stress tests on liquidity risk
indicate that all banks are capable of
withstanding a sizable liquidity shock (a
15 percent withdrawal per day of demand and
savings deposits; and a 9 percent withdrawal
per day of time deposits) for two days without
recourse to LOLR (CBG). On the third and
fourth day of a similar deposit run, two
medium size banks would become illiquid.
Liquidity risk stress testing results typically
assume a sufficiently liquid market for
government securities. In the case of a
systemic event, only the CBG would be in a
position to provide the necessary liquidity to
the market.

Safeguards assessments
Safeguards assessments of the Central Bank of
The Gambia (CBG) were completed in February
2004, February 2007, and November 2009. The
2007 assessment concluded that the CBG had
initiated steps to improve its safeguards
framework and recommended additional
measures to strengthen the CBG’s internal
controls and financial reporting practices. The
2009 update report concluded that the CBG had
made good progress in implementing safeguards
recommendations. The central bank continued to
be audited by a reputable audit firm and
implemented International Financial Reporting
Standards. The assessment stressed that key
safeguards should remain in place and
recommended that the central bank formalize a
framework for extension of credit to government
to ensure compliance with the statutory limits.
The term of the previous audit firm expired and
the Auditor General appointed a new external
auditor for a three-year term starting in 2011.
Exchange rate arrangement
Until January 20, 1986, the Gambian currency, the
dalasi, was pegged to the pound sterling at a
rate of D5 = £1. On January 20, 1986, an
interbank market for foreign exchange was
introduced, and since then the exchange rate has
been determined by market forces. Effective
February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto
exchange rate arrangement has been changed
from managed floating with no predetermined
path for the exchange rate to floating,
retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision
of the classification methodology. As of end–
September 2011, the midpoint exchange rate in
the interbank market was D30.06 per U.S. dollar.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

THE GAMBIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data have shortcomings but are broadly
adequate for surveillance. While the authorities
have made significant progress in improving the
compilation of economic and financial statistics,
substantial shortcomings remain in balance of
payments, national accounts, and external debt
statistics. Data reports to the Fund are
sometimes delayed. The country participates in
the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS),
with its metadata last updated in the second half
of 2003.
The National Assembly passed a new Statistics
Act in December 2005 and work began in June
2006 to implement the plan for transforming the
Central Statistics Department (CSD) into The
Gambia Bureau of Statistics (GBoS). GBoS is now
the single official source for important
macroeconomic series, including national
accounts, price, and international trade data.
However, data output continues to be affected
by capacity weaknesses. A mission visited Banjul
in February 2005 to prepare a data ROSC, which
was published by the Fund in November 2005.
Real sector
The main constraints to improving the national
accounts include inadequate source data due to
inadequate survey coverage, poor quality of
external sector data, and inattention to other
important sources (such as the livestock census
and the census of industrial production). The
GBoS continues to face human and financial
constraints to undertaking such surveys and to
processing the data.
STA missions on national accounts in 2007, 2008
and 2009 assisted the GBoS in implementing the
1993 System of National Accounts methodology
and in rebasing the national accounts to properly
reflect the country’s economic structure, output
levels, and relative prices. More specifically, STA
missions have helped the authorities to: (1)
process the data collected for the 2004 Economic
Census; (2) rebase the GDP series using the

results of the 2004 Economic Census; and (3)
improve the GDP estimates by the production
approach. The authorities now publish improved
real and nominal GDP series compiled by the
production approach for the period 2004–10
(with a base year of 2004). GDP series by the
expenditure approach are still in the process of
being developed. The data continue to suffer
from shortcomings and a number of
recommendations provided by TA missions have
not been implemented. The GDP numbers have
undergone a couple of large revisions in the past
18 months.
In May 2007, the country began participating in
the second phase of the GDDG Project for
Anglophone Africa on national accounts, which is
funded by the U.K. Department for International
Development (DfID). The authorities have also
been recently invited to participate in a follow-up
DfID supported program with a similar focus on
macroeconomic statistics, the Enhanced Data
Dissemination Initiative (EDDI), starting in July
2010.
The World Bank has been providing technical
assistance to the GBoS to update the consumer
price index (CPI) using the 2003 household
expenditure survey to better reflect current
consumption patterns. In early 2007, the GBoS
began to publish a new national CPI based on an
August 2004 representative expenditure basket.
Currently, the GBoS is working on rebasing the
CPI using the results of the 2010 integrated
household survey. The GBoS has also done some
preliminary work on constructing a PPI.
Government finance
The authorities release data on central
government transactions with a lag of about four
weeks for both revenues and expenditures. With
the introduction of the IFMIS in 2010, the
compilation of expenditure data by functional
category and by administration is now possible.
However, the authorities have not yet started to

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 9

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

THE GAMBIA

systematically report these data or make them
available to the public at regular intervals,
contrary to best practices. The compilation of
project grant disbursements and project grant
use has been a challenge, leading to financing
discrepancies. Monthly data on domestic
government financing are available with a delay
of about four weeks.
At a meeting with STA in October 2007, the
authorities expressed interest in technical
assistance to facilitate the migration to
GFSM2001. No data are being reported for
publication in the Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook or in the International Financial
Statistics (IFS).
Monetary data
The Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG) has
improved data reporting to the Fund, but
sometimes the reports are delayed. Following
earlier STA TA missions in April–May 2006 and
April-May 2008, another follow-up mission in
February 2010 flagged CBG’s poor progress in
implementing earlier recommendations for the
compilation of monetary and financial statistics.
This is mainly due to a delay in reforming the
source data for the central bank and for other
depository corporations (ODCs). The 2008
mission designed a bridge table for compiling
the standardized report forms (SRF) for the
central bank and a new report form for ODCs.
However, neither has been implemented.
Therefore, the 2010 mission redesigned the
bridge tables so that they could automatically
generate the SRFs for the central bank and the
ODCs from the data that the CBG has used for its
operational work. As a result, the CBG should
now be in a position to compile the SRFs and
submit the SRF-based monetary data to the Fund
for publication in the IFS. Finally, the mission
recommended that the CBG starts collecting a
wider range of interest rates, including lending
and deposit rates, by type of currency. The CBG
has started collecting such data, but has not yet
started reporting them to the Fund.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

External sector statistics
Despite some improvements, balance of
payments statistics continue to be affected by
serious shortcomings. These include delays in the
collection of trade, customs, and tourist arrival
data; outdated methods for estimating the reexport trade; poor data on capital flows; lack of a
register of firms and establishments engaged in
external transactions; poor classification of
balance of payments data; and lack of a
consistent methodology. Institutional
weaknesses have also been a major impediment
to improving statistics. Official grant and loan
disbursements and repayments are generally well
recorded, but there are some gaps in project
disbursements. Due to the various data
shortcomings, there is a large discrepancy
between the BOP data reported by the
authorities to STA and the adjusted data used by
AFR. For example, data reported by the
authorities to STA point to a small current
account surplus, while adjusted AFR data indicate
that the country is running a large current
account deficit.
The CBG produces balance of payments statistics
according to the Balance of Payments Manual, 5th
edition (BPM5). These statistics are published in
the IFS and in the 2007 IMF Balance of Payments
Statistics Yearbook (BOPSY 2007). The CBG has
been compiling quarterly balance of payments
statistics through a Fund-administered technical
assistance project funded by DfID. The most
recent data available are for the second quarter
of 2011.
With DfID assistance the CBG conducted an
enterprise survey in March 2006 to collect data
for the international investment position. In
April 2006, the CBG also initiated a series of
surveys funded by the World Bank to collect data
on selected components of the current account.
The authorities have been conducting surveys on
tourist expenditures, remittances, re-exports, and
FDI, but these exercises are time-consuming and
infrequent (once a year, at most).

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

Approved By
Roger Nord and
Jan Kees Martijn (IMF);
Marcelo Giugale and Jeffrey
Lewis (IDA).

Prepared by the Staffs of the International Monetary
Fund and the International Development Association

External debt indicators suggest that The Gambia remains at high risk of debt distress. In
particular, the ratio of the present value of external debt to exports breaches its threshold
over a protracted period, while other indicators are vulnerable to adverse shocks. Still,
based on current projections, The Gambia’s external debt is on a sustainable path.
Moreover, there is scope for moderate amounts of additional external borrowing on
concessional terms for productive investments. Domestic debt, which has grown
substantially in recent years, is costly and poses high rollover risks. Interest on domestic
debt consumes nearly one-fifth of government revenues and far exceeds the cost of
interest on external debt. The staffs recommend that the authorities restrict external
financing to grants and highly concessional loans with a grant element of at least
35 percent and reduce new domestic borrowing.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS THE GAMBIA

BACKGROUND
1.
The staffs of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International
Development Association (IDA) jointly prepare
a debt sustainability analysis (DSA) or a DSA
update annually, in collaboration with the
Gambian authorities. This DSA is based on debt
and debt service data obtained from the
authorities and reflects the macroeconomic
framework discussed during the IMF’s mission for
the 2011 Article IV consultation (October 19—
November 1, 2011).1. Similar to the previous joint
DSA prepared by staffs of the IMF and IDA,2 which
was completed in February 2010 at the time of
the sixth review of The Gambia’s arrangement
with the IMF under the Extended Credit Facility
(ECF), the DSA concludes that The Gambia is at
high risk of debt distress.
2.
The Gambia received extensive debt
relief under the enhanced Heavily Indebted
Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative and the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) after
reaching its HIPC completion point in
December 2007. Based on full delivery of HIPC
and MDRI debt relief, The Gambia’s stock of
nominal external public debt was reduced from
US$676.7 million (133.1 percent of GDP) to
US$299.4 million (41.7 percent of GDP). In present
value (PV) terms, the stock of debt at end-2007
decreased from US$439 million to US$347 million
following HIPC debt relief and to US$165 million
after MDRI debt relief. Jointly, these reduced the
external debt-to-exports ratio to about 113
percent at completion point.3 In January 2008,

Paris Club creditors agreed to cancel outstanding
claims totaling US$13 million in (end-2006) PV
terms.
3.
Despite receiving HIPC and MDRI debt
relief, The Gambia’s debt indicators have
remained elevated, reflecting a number of
factors. These factors include poor export
performance in recent years—particularly due to a
drop in tourism receipts during the global
economic crisis—and new borrowing. As of end2010, the nominal stock amounted to
US$377.0 million, with the Islamic Development
Bank being the largest single creditor with claims
of US$82.2 million (Table 5). 4 In PV terms, The
Gambia’s external debt amounted to US$267
million (or 190 percent of exports) as of end-2010.
Also, a sharp depreciation of the Gambian dalasi
in 2008 adversely affected the ratios of debt to
GDP and debt service to government revenues.
4.
Increased reliance on domestic
borrowing to finance larger-than-budgeted
government deficits added to The Gambia’s
debt burden in recent years. Although the
classification of the risk of debt distress in the DSA
only considers external debt, the domestic debt
stock stood at just over 29 percent of GDP as of
end-2010. Interest payments on domestic debt is
consuming an estimated 18 percent of
government revenues in 2011, far outweighing
the interest obligations on external debt.

A recent technical assistance (TA) mission by the World
Bank reconciled the authorities’ external debt stock data
against the African Development Bank (AfDB), IDA, and
other creditors. The reconciliation focused on the end-2010
stock of debt, but it implies that small adjustments to
historical data may be warranted.

THE GAMBIA 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

MACROFRAMEWORK ASSUMPTIONS
5.
The macroeconomic framework
incorporates a slight slowdown in economic
growth, compared with the performance in
recent years, and is based on the authorities
policy framework discussed with the IMF. In
particular, although tourism and remittances have
been hard hit between 2008 and 2010, real GDP
growth has been robust (about 6½ percent a
year), driven by strong performance in agriculture
and telecommunications. Going forward,

economic activity is projected to remain relatively
strong (real GDP growth of 5½ percent a year)
over the medium and long term, as growth in
agriculture returns to a more normal trend and
tourism and remittances gradually recover. This
outlook depends on prudent policies, including
major tax reforms based on introduction of a VAT
in January 2013 and planned investments in
agriculture and infrastructure (Box 1).

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
A. Baseline
6.
Similar to the previous DSA, one of the
key external debt indicators breaches its
threshold by a substantial margin and for a
protracted period (Text Table 1, Table 1, and
Figure 3). That is, the PV of external debt to
exports ratio is projected to be 176 percent in
2011, well above its threshold of 100, and is only
projected to fall below this mark in 2028. In
contrast, all the other external debt indicators
remain below their respective thresholds
throughout the projection period. For example,
the PV of external debt to GDP ratio is well below
its threshold in 2011 and declines gradually over
the medium and long term as economic growth
remains robust. More specifically, with real GDP
growth of 5½ percent a year over the long term,
the external debt-to-GDP ratio declines to about
18 percent at the end of the projection period
from just over 28 percent in 2011. The external
debt service ratios are below their respective
thresholds and both continue to decline gradually
over the medium and long term.
7.
The thresholds for external debt
indicators are policy dependent. Despite recent

improvements, The Gambia remains in the “weak
performer” category according to the three-year
(2008–10) average rating of the World Bank’s
Country Policy and Institutional Assessment
(CPIA). 5 As a result, the associated policydependent debt burden thresholds are at their
lowest levels and are more likely to be breached. 6
______________________________________
5
The low-income country debt sustainability framework
(LIC DSF) recognizes that better policies and institutions
allow countries to manage higher levels of debt, and thus
the threshold levels for debt indicators are policydependent. In the LIC-DSF, the quality of a country’s
policies and institutions is measured by the World Bank’s
Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index,
which consists of a set of 16 criteria grouped into four
equally weighted clusters: (i) economic management;
(ii) structural policies; (iii) policies for social inclusion and
equity; and (iv) public sector management and institutions.
Countries are classified into three categories: strong,
medium, and weak performers.
6

In 2011, The Gambia’s CPIA score improved to 3.35 for
2010, up from 3.26 for 2009 and 3.23 for 2008, lifting the 3year moving average of the CPIA above the benchmark of
3.25. Going forward, if progress on the reform agenda can
be sustained and the country’s CPIA score continues to
improve, The Gambia could be classified as a “medium
performer.” In that case, higher indicative thresholds would
apply, possibly leading to a revisiting of the debt distress
assessment.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 3

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS THE GAMBIA

Box 1: Baseline Macroeconomic Assumptions Underlying the DSA
Driven by a strong expansion in agriculture and
telecommunications, real GDP growth was about
6½ percent a year during 2008-10. However, key
sectors of the economy have been adversely
impacted by the global economic and financial
crisis—notably tourism and residential construction,
the latter of which is partly dependent on financing
by remittances from abroad. For 2011, real GDP
growth is projected to slowdown to about
5½ percent, as growth in agriculture is expected to
slowdown due to variable weather conditions across
the country. Remittance inflows have been stagnant
in 2011, reflecting slowing growth in advanced
economies, but tourism has been picking up late in
the year and growth in domestic exports has been
strong. For 2012 and beyond, the economy is
projected to continue to grow by about 5½ percent
per year, underpinned by solid growth in agriculture
(about 5 percent a year on average) and a sustained,
but moderate growth in tourism and construction,
consistent with a gradual recovery over the medium
term. Over the long term, investment in
infrastructure and education is expected to lead to
greater diversification and continued growth. Key
risks to this outlook include: (i) fiscal shocks arising
from unanticipated revenue shortfalls and spending
overruns, as well as rollover risk of T-bills; (ii) terms
of trade shocks, notably as a result of higher food
and fuel prices; (iii) further setbacks in tourism and
remittances due to more severe weaknesses in the
global economy; and (iv) weather-related risks to
agriculture output.
Inflation is projected to be about 5 percent a year,
in line with the authorities’ objectives. Year-on-year
inflation exceeded 6 percent from mid-2010 to mid2011, driven by sharp increases in food and fuel
prices, but has since dropped to about 4 percent in
recent months. Going forward, minimizing the risk of
fiscal dominance will be critical to maintaining low
inflation. The Gambian dalasi is projected to remain
stable against the U.S. dollar in real terms, with a
gradual depreciation in nominal terms reflecting the
difference in projected Gambian and U.S. inflation
rates.

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

The external current account deficit is expected to
narrow in 2011, reflecting low import growth due to
the weakening construction sector and dampened
consumer demand, as well as a sharp increase in
domestic groundnut exports. Going forward, export
receipts, including tourism, are projected to grow by
about 7 percent a year in nominal U.S. dollar terms
(roughly in line with GDP growth), while import
growth is expected to be at around 8 percent.
Remittances are projected to increase by 3 percent a
year.1 After a strong inflow in 2012, corresponding to
the scheduled increase in the minimum capital
requirement for commercial banks, FDI is projected
to settle down to about 5 percent of GDP a year.
Compared with the experience in 2010, however, the
inflow of capital from parent banks in 2012 is
expected to be lower. International reserves came
under pressure around mid-2010, mainly because of
interventions in the foreign exchange market by the
CBG, but stabilized by the year’s end. At end-2010,
gross reserves stood at US$163 million (4.8 months
of imports of goods and services).
The authorities intend to achieve a gradual fiscal
adjustment aimed at reducing net domestic
borrowing from 2½-3 percent of GDP in 2011 to
about ½ percent of GDP by 2014, and maintain this
ratio going forward. During that time, the overall
fiscal deficit is projected to narrow from about
3½ percent of GDP to 2 percent of GDP, while tax
revenues are projected to increase from 12 percent
of GDP to about 13½ percent of GDP. The revenue
growth would be supported by implementation of
tax reforms, including the introduction of a VAT in
January 2013. Donor support, including project
grants and net lending, is expected to surge to
5½ percent of GDP in 2011, mainly reflecting an IDA
grant for a major telecommunications project. The
DSA framework assumes that donor support
declines to about 4½ percent of GDP a year over the
foreseeable future.2

For illustrative purposes, when
remittances are taken into account, the debtto-exports (including remittances) ratio still
exceeds its threshold; however, the breach is
considerably smaller and lasts for a shorter
period.7 Remittances are similar to other
“measures of repayment capacity” (like exports)
because they increase the foreign exchange
earnings available to a country. Although there is
usually under-reporting of remittances inflows,
which raises concerns about the quality and the
coverage of the data, in the case of The Gambia it
is estimated that they exceed 30 percent of
exports (excluding re-exports), equivalent to over
4½ percent of GDP in 2011. As expected,
incorporating remittances in our analysis reduces
the debt-to-exports ratio by a substantial margin
even when accounting for a tightening of the

threshold by 10 percent (Figure 1).8 Nevertheless,
this ratio still breaches the threshold until about
2018 with a peak of about 135 percent in 2011.

A recent policy paper (SM/10/16) titled “A Review of
Some Aspects of the Low-Income Country Debt
Sustainability Framework” calls for a more explicit
recognition of remittances in DSAs. The paper also calls
for the adjustment of the thresholds when remittances are
included in the analysis, which can be seen in Figure 1.
However, the framework also specifies that remittances
should not be included in the assessment of the risk of
debt distress, in the event of protracted breaches of the
debt-to-exports threshold.

Including remittances has a similar effect on the
debt service to exports ratio, namely, a reduction in
the ratios over the projection horizon.

B. Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests
9.
The Gambia’s debt sustainability
outlook is susceptible to changes in the policy
framework assumed in the baseline scenario
(Table 2). Most alternative scenarios show that
external debt indicators would deteriorate
substantially under a range of shocks.

debt indicators worsen substantially with
the debt stock ratios most affected. In
particular, the debt to exports ratio
breaches its threshold throughout all
projected years with a low of about
131 percent in 2031. The debt to revenue
ratio also increases, for instance, by almost
33 percentage points in 2021, but it
remains under its threshold throughout
the projection horizon. These results
underscore the need for the authorities to
seek highly concessional financing for new
borrowing.13

Alternative Scenarios:
Under the historical scenario, which is
associated with key variables (GDP growth,
external current account balance, and nondebt creating flows) being at their
historical levels,9 all three debt burden
indicators (which reflect repayment
capacity measures) improve ever so
slightly. Compared to the baseline, the
debt to GDP ratio is lower by ½ of a
percentage point in 2021, while the debt
to exports and debt to revenue ratios are
below the baseline by approximately
1 percentage point each. Under this
scenario, debt service indicators worsen
relative to the baseline but only marginally
(Table 2b).

•

In a third scenario, customized to help
assess the scope for additional external
borrowing to help finance the authorities’
new poverty reduction strategy—the
Programme for Accelerated Growth and
Employment (PAGE)—new borrowing is
stepped up. This leads to a substantial
worsening of all debt ratios with some
impact on debt service indicators. The
stepping up scenario assumes an increase
of US$150 million in new borrowing from
multilateral creditors distributed between
2012–2016, which would finance increased
investment spending under the PAGE. The
higher level of new borrowing is then

•

In the scenario where new borrowing
occurs on less favorable terms,10 all the

•

_____________________________________________
9

Over the past 10 years, The Gambia has had slightly
lower real GDP growth (4 percent a year), persistent
current account deficits, and low foreign direct
investment. The country also receives less grant support
(as a percentage of GDP) than other HIPC countries.

10

Such less favorable terms may include higher interest
rates, a reduction in grant elements, or borrowing at
non-concessional or less concessional terms. In the
context of this DSA, however, this scenario assumes that
the interest rate on new borrowing is 2 percentage
points higher than in the baseline. Grace and maturity
periods are the same as in the baseline.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

_____________________________________________
11

To be considered concessional in IMF arrangements,
loans must have a grant element of at least 35 percent.
IDA also has a minimum grant element under the NonConcessional Borrowing Policy (NCBP) of 35 percent or
higher. The policy is complementary to other policies and
tools that the World Bank and IMF have in place to help
countries maintain debt sustainability, such as the LowIncome Country Debt Sustainability Framework (LICDSF),
the Debt Management Performance Assessment
(DeMPA) tool, and the toolkit for developing MediumTerm Debt Management Strategies (MTDS).

THE GAMBIA 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

phased out gradually up to 2021, after
which it returns to baseline levels. Under
this scenario, it is also assumed that there
is a positive growth effect (roughly
equivalent to a 20 percent return on
investment with a one-year lag) which
phases out gradually over time. Results
show the debt to exports ratio breaching
the threshold until 2030, before declining
to 97 percent in 2031. That is, although the
threshold is breached, the overall path
suggests that debt sustainability would be
maintained. The same reasoning applies to
the other debt ratios: even though this
elevated debt path results in a brief
breaching of both the debt-to-GDP and
debt-to-revenue ratios during the
additional borrowing phase (2012-2016),
the overall path shows a sustainable
downward trend for the projection period.

Bound Tests:
•

Most bound tests show significant
deterioration in debt indicators. Of the six
bound tests, four involve “shocks” to some
key variables in the second and third years
of the projection period;12 another is a
combination of these four shocks while the
sixth assumes a one-time 30 percent
depreciation in the nominal exchange rate.
The results (Table 2) are interpreted such
that the most extreme shock is the one
yielding the highest ratio in 2021.
Depending on the indicator in question,
the worst shock varies between a one-time
30 percent depreciation in the nominal
exchange rate and a one-standard
deviation downward shift from historical
export growth, with most of the debt
indicators breaching their respective
thresholds. These results highlight the
need for the authorities to adhere to a
prudent borrowing plan associated with an
approved medium-term debt management
strategy (MTDS).

PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
A. Baseline
10.
Over the medium to long term,
domestic debt is projected to fall from just
over 29 percent of GDP at the end of 2011 to
just over 24 percent of GDP in 2014, and to
continue to fall thereafter, reflecting sustained
fiscal discipline. The authorities have expressed
their intention to achieve a gradual fiscal
adjustment over the medium term in order to
curb new domestic borrowing. The goal is to
reduce new domestic borrowing to half of a
percentage point of GDP in 2014 and beyond.
The authorities are also pursuing a comprehensive
tax reform anchored around the introduction of a
VAT in January 2013. The tax reform is projected

to be moderately revenue enhancing which would
improve the debt-to-revenue ratio. In addition, as
anticipated for the medium term, fiscal discipline
should help lower domestic interest rates and
provide fiscal space to increase basic primary
expenditures.13
11.
Under the baseline scenario, the PV of
total public debt is projected to decline from

about 57 percent of GDP in 2011 to just over
45 percent in 2016 and to about 22 percent in
2031 (Table 3 and Figure 3). The largest factor
contributing to this decline in the PV of public
debt in the near term is the projected fall in new

domestic borrowing. As a ratio of domestic
revenues and grants, the PV of public debt is
projected to fall from about 309 percent in 2011
to 115 percent by the end of the projection
period.

B. Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests
12.
Under alternative scenarios and stress
tests, the public debt ratios deteriorate
significantly. In particular, public debt and debt
service ratios are mostly sensitive to lower GDP
growth over the long run, persistent primary fiscal
deficits, and one-time depreciation of the nominal
exchange rate (Table 4 and Figure 4). Of the three
alternative scenarios, public debt ratios are mostly
affected by a persistent fiscal deficit, suggesting
that a status quo in fiscal policy results in a
damaging debt path. The most extreme stress test
is a temporary deceleration in real GDP growth.

Alternative Scenarios:
•

•

Under a scenario where the primary
balance is kept constant for the projection
period (at a deficit of about 1½ percent of
GDP), the PV of debt to GDP ratio would
decrease from 57 percent in 2011 to only
33 percent in 2031, as compared to a
decline under the baseline to 22 percent in
2031. Similarly, the PV of debt to revenue
will only decrease from 309 percent in
2011 to 177 percent in 2031 as against a
decline under the baseline to 115 percent
in 2031.
The present values of all public debt
indicators decline over time under the
scenario with reduced real GDP growth,
while the primary balance at historical
averages14 shows a similar downward
_____________________________________________
14
At historical averages, real GDP growth is 4 percent
while the primary deficit is 0.2 percent of GDP.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

trend as in the baseline; this decline is not
as pronounced as under the baseline
scenario, however. The PV of debt to GDP
ratio declines from 57 percent in 2011 to
40 percent in 2031 (as compared to
22 percent in the baseline), while the PV of
debt to revenue ratio declines from
309 percent to 204 percent between the
same years (as against 115 percent in the
baseline).

Bound Tests:
•

The most extreme bound test consists of
real GDP growth being at one standard
deviation less than its historical average.
Under this circumstance, the PV of debt to
GDP ratio would worsen to 39 percent in
2031 as compared to 22 percent under the
baseline scenario while the PV of debt to
revenue ratio would worsen to 202 percent
as against 115 percent under the baseline.

•

A combination of shocks (to growth and
the primary balance) and a one-time 30
percent depreciation also results in a
moderate worsening of debt ratios
compared to the baseline. Under the
former, the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio would
rise to 33 percent in 2031 while under the
latter it would rise to 27 percent when
compared with the baseline figure of
22 percent.

THE GAMBIA 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

THE AUTHORITIES VIEW
13.
The authorities broadly agreed with
the overall assessment and indicated that they
were in the process of updating their debt
management strategy. The authorities noted
that in their own debt sustainability exercise, they

have greater room for additional borrowing in
their stepping-up scenario to help finance the
PAGE. This is a result of more optimistic
assumptions on the growth impact of investment
on long-term real GDP and exports.

DEBT DISTRESS CLASSIFICATION15 AND
CONCLUSIONS
14.
In the view of the IMF and IDA staffs,
The Gambia remains at high risk of debt
distress based on external debt indicators and
the results of the stress tests.16 This
assessment reflects the significant and protracted
breach of the policy-dependent indicative
threshold by the PV of debt to exports ratio, as
well as the vulnerability of other debt indicators to
alternative scenarios. In particular, the debt
indicators could deteriorate significantly either if
new borrowing were contracted on less favorable
terms, or if the exchange rate depreciates
significantly. While an assessment of domestic
debt does not affect a country’s classification of
debt distress, The Gambia’s large domestic debt
stock (just over 29 percent of GDP as of end2010) and high debt service payments on
domestic debt (18 percent of government
revenues in 2011) provide further evidence that
the country’s overall debt vulnerabilities are high.
Moreover, there is considerable risk that without a
_____________________________________________
15
This classification plays an important role in determining
the mix of grants and loans under IDA assistance and in
IMF program design. Countries assessed to be at high risk
of debt distress or in debt distress receive 100 percent
grant financing from IDA, while countries at moderate risk
receive an equal mix of grants and credits on standard IDA
terms, and countries at low risk continue to receive 100
percent credit financing on standard IDA terms. All grants
are subject to a 20 percent volume discount.
16

Based on IMF and World Bank policy, a country is
considered to be at high risk of debt distress when the
baseline scenario indicates a protracted breach by one or
more debt indicators, and exacerbated by stress tests, but
the country does not currently face payment difficulties.

lasting fiscal adjustment, a further accumulation of
costly domestic debt would be likely.
15.
A number of policy recommendations
emanate from this assessment and attendant
risks. The staffs urge the authorities to develop a
medium-term debt management strategy that
aims for a combination of grants and
concessional borrowing for external financing and
a borrowing policy consistent with debt
sustainability. To address the high cost of
domestic debt, the strategy would need to curb
new domestic borrowing. Under such a strategy,
as pressure on yields subsides, the authorities
could also seek to refinance maturing T-bills with
longer-term treasury bonds to extend the
maturity profile of the debt and reduce rollover
risks. The authorities could also consider efforts to
raise the country’s export potential through
policies aimed at diversifying the economy and
increasing competitiveness. The staffs also
recommend that the minimum grant element on
external borrowing be set at not less than 35
percent.17 The major risks to The Gambia’s debt
sustainability include lower than expected
economic and/or export growth, higher than
expected new borrowing, and slippages in fiscal
performance.
_____________________________________________
17

The results in this DSA reflect an assumption that new
external borrowing that was not subject to established
terms had a grant element of 35 percent.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Includes project grants.
3/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
4/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes. This
residual also includes net changes in private assets which historically (2007-2010) amounts to nearly 2% of GDP.
5/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
6/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
8/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
9/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the
baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account
as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on The Gambia
January 18, 2012

1.
This statement provides information that has become available since the issuance of
EBS/11/338 on December 23, 2011. The new information does not alter the thrust of the staff
appraisal.
2.
On December 22, 2011, the Gambian authorities officially launched the Programme
for Accelerated Growth and Employment (PAGE), 2012–2015. The PAGE was subsequently
transmitted to Bank and Fund staff and will serve as the poverty reduction strategy that will
provide a basis for Bank and Fund support to The Gambia during this period. Bank and Fund
staffs will prepare a Joint Staff Advisory Note for the PAGE, which will be submitted to their
respective Boards before the end of April 2012.
3.
The Gambian authorities made public the results of the 2010 Integrated Household
Survey. Based on a poverty line of US$1.25 per day, the poverty index showed that
48 percent of the population was living below the poverty line in 2010. The comparable
figure for headcount poverty based on the previous survey conducted in 2003 was 61 percent.
4.
On December 23, 2011, prices on gasoline, diesel, and kerosene were increased by
GMD 1 per liter. This marked the first price adjustment since a decrease of GMD 1 per liter
for gasoline in September. The increase in prices, however, fell short of the formula’s full
pass-through prices by 5–9 percent (or GMD 2.4–3.9 per liter).

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
The Gambia
On January 18, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with The Gambia.1
Background
The Gambian economy has performed well in recent years, despite challenging global
conditions. Real GDP growth averaged around 6½ percent a year during 2008-2010, driven
mainly by a strong expansion in agriculture. Tourism and remittances, however, were hit hard
by the global economic crisis. In 2011, although there were signs that tourism was recovering,
real GDP growth is estimated to have fallen slightly to 5½ percent, because of poor weather
conditions adversely affecting agriculture in some areas of the country. Inflation ranged
between 2½ and 7 percent (year-on-year) in recent years, as the Central Bank of The Gambia
(CBG) generally maintained a restrained monetary stance. At times, this required extensive
mopping up of liquidity generated by central bank financing of fiscal deficits. In recent months,
inflation has fallen below 5 percent, aided by an improved fiscal performance.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2

The government’s fiscal deficit widened substantially during 2007–2010, resulting in a sharp
increase in domestic debt. The deterioration of the fiscal balance was caused by a steady
decline in government revenues and episodes of large spending overruns. Extra-budgetary
expenditures, including realized contingent liabilities, were major factors behind the surge in
government spending, particularly in 2009 and 2010.
The Gambia continues to face a heavy debt burden. As of the end of 2010, domestic debt had
risen to almost 30 percent of GDP. Correspondingly, interest on domestic debt has consumed
an increasing share of government revenues (18 percent in 2011). Moreover, most domestic
debt consists of short-term Treasury bills, which poses substantial rollover risks. Despite a
large reduction in external debt under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative and
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) in December 2007, external debt indicators suggest
that The Gambia is still at high risk of debt distress.
Domestic debt stabilized in 2011, as the fiscal deficit narrowed substantially. Although
government revenues continued to fall (to about 14 percent of GDP)—mainly due to lost
revenues from fuel taxes—the government applied a strict cash-budgeting framework to
control spending. This has contributed to a reduction in T-bill yields in recent months, which
could generate fiscal savings going forward.
The banking system in The Gambia has expanded at a rapid pace since 2007, with the
number of banks nearly doubling (to 13). This contributed to a rapid expansion of much
needed financial services. It also strained the CBG’s resources for banking supervision. While
banks are generally well capitalized and liquid, competition in a relatively small market has
increased risks. Credit quality and profitability weakened in 2009-2010, and high loan
concentration is a concern. Similarly, several banks are vulnerable to liquidity risks from
exposure to large depositors. In 2011, financial indicators have strengthened under the CBG’s
intensive supervision.
The Gambia’s external current account deficit has widened in recent years, due to weak
tourism receipts and remittances and high global commodity prices. In 2011, strong exports of
groundnuts early in the year combined with an upswing in tourism in the fourth quarter to
narrow the deficit, despite a surge in the cost of fuel imports. Official international reserves
have remained at a comfortable level at over 5 months of imports.
The Gambia has made significant progress in implementing structural reforms, particularly in
the areas of public financial management, debt management, and financial sector
development. Good progress has also been achieved toward meeting several of the
Millennium Development Goals, most notably in health and education. However, poverty is still
widespread.

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for making progress in poverty reduction and
achieving strong growth and low inflation despite a difficult global environment. Looking ahead,
Directors observed that although the outlook for the economy is generally positive, there are a
number of risks, particularly the high cost and rollover risks of domestic debt.
Directors welcomed the improved fiscal performance and supported the government’s plans
for additional fiscal consolidation in the period ahead. They agreed that further fiscal
adjustment aimed at curbing domestic borrowing is appropriate. Directors considered that
comprehensive tax reforms, including an early introduction of the VAT and additional steps to
increase tax compliance, are essential to rebuild government revenues. In particular,
strengthening revenue administration and phasing out fuel subsidies would bolster the
credibility of the authorities’ fiscal plans for the medium term. Simplicity, broad coverage, and
low tax rates would also help to improve the business environment.
Directors agreed that monetary policymaking should remain focused on safeguarding price
stability. To this end, they encouraged the central bank to develop liquidity management
instruments that would enhance the efficiency of the money market and reduce intermediation
costs. Directors also encouraged the authorities to maintain exchange rate flexibility, as well as
the import coverage of international reserves.
Directors observed that the banking system is well capitalized and liquid. Noting however a still
elevated non-performing loans ratio and other vulnerabilities in the banking sector, they
welcomed the authorities’ intention to reinforce their oversight of the financial sector.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ new poverty reduction strategy, the Programme for
Accelerated Growth and Employment (PAGE). They emphasized, however, that the financing
strategy should safeguard debt sustainability. Directors agreed that greater private sector
participation in infrastructure projects could help achieve PAGE objectives, but success hinges
on effective policy frameworks and institutions.

Statement by Momodou Bamba Saho,
Alternate Executive Director for The Gambia
January 18, 2012
Introduction
The Gambian authorities extend their appreciation to staff for the constructive policy
dialogue with the country and for the candor in identifying the policy challenges and
presenting options for restoring fiscal prudency and maintaining macroeconomic stability
while promoting broad-based inclusive growth. They are especially thankful to the Executive
Board and Fund Management for their continued support and policy guidance against the
backdrop of a challenging global economic environment. My authorities have embarked on
improving macroeconomic management through increased fiscal consolidation and public
inancial management reforms. Accordingly, measures to enhance domestic revenue
mobilization have been introduced while prudent expenditure management is pursued under
a cash budget system. Implementation of The Gambia’s development agenda is, however,
severely challenged by inadequate external financing, which remains crucial in creating the
required fiscal space. Since the discussion of the last staff report on The Gambia’s 7th review
of the ECF arrangement, the country has held a very successful presidential election, thereby
consolidating the country’s democratic process. My authorities share the thrust of the staff
report as it provides a candid assessment of recent economic developments.
Recent economic developments
The Gambian economy has performed well in recent years. During 2008 to 2010, the
economy grew on average by 6.5 percent per annum on account of the robust growth in
agriculture and the services sector. In spite of the adverse effects of the difficult global
economic environment and poor weather conditions, real GDP growth remained fairly strong
at 5.5 percent in 2011 led by a rebound in tourism. Consumer price inflation declined to
4.3 percent in November 2011 from 6.1 percent and 5.8 percent in September and December
2010 respectively. The deceleration in headline inflation was due largely to the tight
monetary policy stance of the central bank and the fall in domestic food prices.
Fiscal performance improved in 2011, reflecting the strict implementation of a cash budget
system which limits spending to available resources. This helped to contain government’s net
domestic borrowing, cleared its overdraft with the central bank and marked an end to the
central bank financing of the deficit. Moreover, the improvement in public finances
strengthened the independence of the central bank and enabled the monetary authorities to
focus on their key mandate of price and exchange rate stability.
The balance of payments is projected to record a surplus in 2011, in contrast to a deficit in
2010 on account of the expected increase in private capital and official transfers. Similarly,
the current account deficit, before official transfers narrowed, reflecting improvement in the
goods and services account. Due largely to central bank purchases of foreign exchange, gross
international reserves reached the equivalent of 5.0 months of import cover at end-2011. In

2
the year to end-September 2011, the dalasi depreciated against the major trading currencies
in the domestic foreign exchange market owing to increased demand for foreign currency in
the face of rising international commodity prices.
Outlook and policies
My authorities’ principal policy objective over the near and medium term is to maintain a
stable macroeconomic environment to support robust and sustainable inclusive growth. It is
expected that such growth would result in job creation, poverty reduction and the
achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). GDP growth is expected to
return to trend in the medium term as government pursues prudent fiscal and monetary
policies, increase investment in infrastructure and agriculture. The external current account
deficit is expected to narrow in the medium term, on account of the expected recovery of
exports and increase in services. Gross international reserves are projected to fall to around
4 months of imports of goods and services by the end of 2016. The exchange rate is expected
to maintain its relative stability over the medium term, while inflation is targeted at 5 percent.
On the fiscal front, my authorities will strengthen efforts to enhance public financial
management to reduce new borrowing to ease pressure on interest rates. The fiscal outlook
for 2012 marks the commencement of the Program for Accelerated Growth and Employment
(PAGE) implementation, the successor program to the PRSP II. PAGE is the government’s
development strategy and investment program for 2012 to 2015. The PAGE is based on
Vision 2020 and various sector strategies, and is the execution template for the government’s
long-term vision. PAGE is fully aligned with the MDGs and its main objective is to
accelerate growth and job creation in order to consolidate and sustain recent economic
achievements and reinforce gains in welfare over the past years.
Fiscal policy
My Gambian authorities remain committed to pursuing prudent fiscal management with a
view to maintaining medium-to long-term fiscal sustainability. This was demonstrated by the
strong expenditure restraint exercised by government to strengthen fiscal consolidation
despite 2011 being an election year. Mindful of the challenges in scaling-up resources to
effectively implement PAGE, my authorities are determined to institute far-reaching policy
measures to ensure mobilization of substantial domestic resources to complement external
donor financing of government programs and projects. To this end, the authorities will
pursue tax policy and revenue administration reforms to increase revenue and make the tax
system simpler and more efficient. The foundation of these reforms will be the continuous
implementation of the fuel pricing formula and launch of a Value Added Tax (VAT) system
in 2013. Further reforms in the area of tax policy and revenue administration include the
implementation of a quota system on duty exemptions on fuel for diplomatic missions,
expansion of tax coverage through the collection of taxes on domestically produced goods,
bringing into the tax net holders of expired special investment certificates and removal of the
fuel concession to the Gambia Ports Authority. Additionally, in a bid to facilitate both tax
compliance and ease payments, the Gambia Revenue Authority (GRA) in 2011 launched an
initiative where commercial banks will accept payments from tax payers on behalf of

3
government. Besides the mandate given to GRA to collect motor vehicle taxes and fees,
GRA will be responsible from January 2012 for issuing the licenses and road tax discs to
vehicle owners. Moreover, the authorities plan to simplify small business taxation and
eliminate the existing alternative turnover-base method of determining minimum income and
capital gains tax. The envisaged upgrading of the ASYCUDA will also greatly improve tax
assessments and boost revenue collection. Finally, the authorities have adjusted fuel prices
four times in 2011, with the most recent one in December 2011.
On the expenditure front, my authorities will seek to switch expenditures towards their
strategic priorities of increasing investments in infrastructure and other key sectors such as
education, health and agriculture, consistent with the goals of the PAGE. Accordingly,
nonstatutory expenditures will be appropriately contained to create the needed fiscal space.
Also, the monthly cash budgeting framework will be refined further to ensure that borrowing
is contained within projected targets in order to avoid unnecessary buildup in domestic debt.
Unanticipated expenditures will be accommodated through the contingency reserves in the
budget. If necessary, the annual budget will be adjusted through a supplementary bill, while
maintaining the target for net domestic borrowing.
Monetary and exchange rate policies
My authorities’ monetary policy in 2011 focused on sustaining the disinflationary process,
maintaining exchange rate stability, and a viable external position. The policy was conducted
in a highly challenging global environment including larger-than-expected rise in commodity
prices in the first half of the year. Nevertheless, the monetary authorities were able to
maintain a subdued inflationary environment as well as a stable exchange rate with a
comfortable level of international reserves. This created room for the Monetary Policy
Committee (MPC) to relax monetary policy to permit a further reduction in interest rates in
the later part of the year. Accordingly, the central bank policy rate, the rediscount rate, was
reduced by 1 percentage point to 14 percent.
Going forward, the monetary authorities will continue to use a monetary targeting framework
to pursue their price stability objective. In this regard, the central bank will remain vigilant
and will stand ready to raise the policy interest rate if necessary. Furthermore, to improve
monetary management, the authorities will, in the coming week, start making public
announcements of the size of treasury bill auctions one month in advance of the auction
dates. The horizon of these announcements will be gradually extended to correspond with the
4 quarterly meetings of the MPC. Moreover, the fiscal authorities will collaborate with the
central bank to strengthen liquidity forecasting both by participating in the regular meetings
of the inter-agency committee and by improving its weekly forecast of the public sector
borrowing requirements.
The monetary authorities will continue to maintain a floating exchange rate policy,
intervening only to maintain orderly market conditions. Whenever required, the central bank
may purchase foreign exchange from the domestic interbank market to meet its target for
international reserves (around 5 months of import of goods and services).

Financial sector policy
My authorities raised the minimum capital requirement of banks in December 2010 to meet
the challenges of the growing number of banks and to ensure solvency in the banking
industry. Consequently, the banking sector remains sound and adequately capitalized to
absorb shocks, with a risk-weighted capital adequacy ratio of 27.1 percent, significantly
higher than the minimum requirement of 10 percent. The banking sector is characterized by
increased competition and expansion in the form of branches and agencies across the
country. This has increased access to banking services and products nationwide.
Accordingly, in response to the need for a well functioning financial system, installation of a
new payment system infrastructure is complete. The Real Time Settlement System (RTGS)
and the Automated Cheque Processing and Clearing Systems were launched on December 5
and December 16, 2011 respectively, while the Security Settlement System is targeted to go
live during the first quarter of 2012. Additionally, the central bank has initiated an electronic
reporting system for commercial banks for the timely reporting of data as well as facilitation
of onsite and offsite supervision. This system will become operational by June 2012. The
central bank also plans a gradual migration from a hybrid (compliance and risk-based) to a
fully risk-based supervisory framework. To keep pace with the fast growing banking system,
the central bank will continue to strengthen capacity at its Financial Supervision Department
both through maintaining adequate staffing levels and training.
Debt Management Policy
My authorities are concerned that the recent debt sustainability analysis conducted by the
Fund and World Bank indicates that the country remains at a high risk of debt distress, in
spite of the substantial debt relief granted under the HIPC and MDRI initiatives. To mitigate
these risks, my authorities have developed a medium term debt management strategy. In
addition, my authorities intend to rely more on grants and concessional external loans with
minimum grant element of 35 percent to finance the PAGE. Furthermore, the authorities will
explore productive opportunities for public-private partnerships. Moreover, as market
conditions allow, my authorities will endeavor to extend the maturity of domestic public debt
by introducing longer-term instruments such as bonds aimed at reducing rollover risks.
Finally, to strengthen debt management and monitoring, the authorities will continue to
conduct annual debt sustainability analysis in consultation with the Fund and World Bank to
ensure that all debt indicators fall and remain below their corresponding thresholds.
Structural reforms
My authorities consider the implementation of appropriate structural reforms as critical to
achieving the medium-term objective of high and sustainable inclusive growth. To this end,
the authorities have embarked on major reforms in public financial management aimed at
supporting its goal of reducing poverty through the attainment of a stable macroeconomic
environment and good governance. Accordingly, Integrated Financial Management
Information System (IFMIS), which was originally piloted to 6 sites, is now fully rolled out
to all Ministries, effective January 2011. In addition, the authorities interfaced the IFMIS
with the national payment system at the central bank. Also, to enhance accountability, the

5
Internal Audit of the Ministry of Finance has been revitalized with a view to providing an
independent and objective evaluation of government’s financial position.
Furthermore, the authorities have embarked on budgetary reforms aimed at introducing a
medium-term horizon in planning and budgeting system. The Medium Term Expenditure
Framework (MTEF) will constitute a budget planning framework that provides incentives for
policy makers and budget planners to formulate medium-term budget plans by linking
planning and policy formulation with budget allocation, aligning the annual budget decision
with the medium term macro-fiscal strategy, restricting expenditures within realistic resource
envelope, and improving monitoring and tracking of budget performance. Finally, the
authorities are committed to strengthening the Public Utility Regulatory Agency (PURA) and
to improving the financial health of the National Water and Electricity Company (NAWEC),
in line with the recommendations of the World Bank.
Conclusion
I would like to reiterate my authorities’ commitment to sound macroeconomic management
and growth promotion underpinned by prudent public finance management. This is an
important step towards job creation and poverty reduction. In this regard, my authorities
intend to direct policy efforts towards narrowing the budget deficit as the key to reducing the
debt burden and related interest payments. They appreciate the support from the IMF and the
international community and count on the continuation of such support to realize their
development goals.
