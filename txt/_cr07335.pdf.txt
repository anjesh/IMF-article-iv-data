The 2006 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Dakar during October 26–
November 9, 2006. The Senegalese representatives included the Ministers of
Economy and Finance, Budget, Energy, and Agriculture, and the National Director of
the BCEAO. The staff also met with the Acting Governor of the BCEAO and
representatives of the donors, labor, and business communities, and NGOs. The staff
team comprised Messrs. Vaez-Zadeh (head), Castro, Roudet, and Saxegaard
(all AFR), and Ms. Koranchelian (FAD). Mr. Segura-Ubiergo, the Fund’s Resident
Representative in Senegal and Mr. Morisset (World Bank) also participated in the
discussions. Mr. Sembene (Senior Advisor, OED) attended some of the meetings.

•

The last Article IV consultation was concluded in March 2005. Senegal’s PRGF
arrangement expired in April 2006, and the final review under the arrangement was
concluded in January 2006. An ex post assessment of Senegal’s program engagement
with the Fund was discussed at the Board in March 2006.

Outstanding purchases and loans amounted to SDR 17.33 million (10.7 percent of
quota) at end-November 2006. Under the MDRI, Senegal received debt relief from
the Fund, the African Development Fund, and the World Bank, totaling about
25 percent of 2005 GDP. Together with other members of the West African Economic
and Monetary Union (WAEMU), Senegal has accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Senegal has achieved macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability. Poverty and social
indicators have improved in recent years, but meeting the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) remains a challenge. Reform implementation has been uneven over the past few
years and problems with budgetary discipline and fiscal transparency persist.
Macroeconomic performance weakened in 2006, with lower growth, higher inflation, and
widening fiscal and external current account deficits. The deterioration reflected the
disruption in the operations of the chemical export company (ICS), oil price increases, and
growing energy subsidies. Domestic payments arrears of about one percent of GDP are
estimated to have accumulated by year-end.
The outlook for 2007 and the medium term is favorable, provided ICS resumes full operation
as expected, the overall fiscal deficit (including grants) is contained to about 4 percent of
GDP, and progress is made on enterprise reform, fiscal governance, and improving the
business climate. The authorities intend to contain the fiscal deficit broadly in line with staff
recommendations and avoid nonconcessional borrowing. To these ends, energy subsidies will
be phased out and the government wage bill and public investment contained.
The authorities introduced a new pricing policy for petroleum products that incorporates a
discretionary margin above international prices. The funds generated will be used for
subsidizing the oil refinery and only partially included in the government budget. The new
margin raises issues of efficiency and transparency as it implies earmarking and off-budget
use of public funds. The authorities intend to remove the margin within two years.
Serious concerns about the transparency of the new airport project linger and procurement
rules continue to be abused. It is not clear whether procedures agreed earlier with staff and
decreed by the President, are being applied for the collection and use of the receipts from the
air travel tax, which are earmarked for airport construction and kept off budget. Tighter
procurement procedures have been prepared, but enforcement will be difficult in the run-up
to presidential and legislative elections, scheduled for February 2007.
Banks meet the capital requirement but are burdened by bad loans, potential losses from ICS
restructuring, credit concentration, and an inadequate judicial framework. The capital
adequacy ratio and loan provisioning requirements should be raised to reflect these risks, and
judicial reforms implemented to facilitate loan recovery.
Discussions on a program under the PSI began in May 2006 but were not concluded. They
are unlikely to be resumed before the upcoming elections.

I. BACKGROUND: STRONG MACROECONOMIC PERFORMANCE,
BUT SIGNS OF WEAKENING
1.
Senegal has experienced robust growth, price stability, and a declining debt stock
owing to substantial debt relief, but macroeconomic performance weakened in 2006.
•

Following robust performance in 2003–05 (average real GDP growth rate of about
6 percent), economic growth is estimated to have fallen below 3.5 percent. (Tables 1
and 2). The decline reflects

The real effective exchange rate (REER) has been broadly in line with the underlying
economic fundamentals and fairly stable since 2002, as changes in relative prices
offset the appreciation of the CFA franc (CFAF) against the U.S. dollar (in line with
the Euro to which the CFAF is pegged).1

The ratio of the NPV of public external debt to exports is estimated to have fallen
from 118 percent at end-2004 to about 55 percent at end-2006 owing to Enhanced
HIPC and MDRI debt relief (Table 3). Central government domestic debt is estimated
to have remained at about 3.5 percent of GDP at end-2006.

The external current account deficit excluding grants is estimated to have increased
by about 5 percent of GDP between 2004 and 2006 (Table 4), owing to the oil price
shock and ICS’ difficulties.

After several years of prudence, fiscal discipline deteriorated in 2006. The overall
fiscal balance (including grants) moved from a balanced position in 2002 to a deficit of
3 percent of GDP in 2005 and is estimated to have almost doubled to about 5.7 percent of
GDP in 2006 (Tables 5 and 6). The deterioration reflects increases in capital expenditures,
the wage bill, and subsidies (2 percent of GDP in 2006) to the electricity company
(SENELEC) and the oil refinery (SAR) to compensate them for below-market prices for
electricity and butane gas. For the first time since 1995, domestic payments arrears of about
1 percent of GDP are estimated to have emerged by end-2006.

Substantial excess reserves in the banking system have reduced monetary policy
effectiveness. Changes in the discount rate by the regional central bank (BCEAO)
during 2003–06 (Table 7) did not have much impact on banks’ interest rates. The BCEAO
does not see a need to absorb the excess liquidity on the grounds that historically, it has not
entailed inflationary risks.

5.
Reform implementation has been uneven over the past few years. Key
achievements include the privatization of the groundnut processing company (SONACOS),
improvements in tax collection, and better expenditure tracking and budget reporting.
However, the rehabilitation of loss-making enterprises and structural reforms in the energy
sector have lagged, and serious problems with fiscal governance persist.

9
6.
Poverty and social indicators have improved, but substantial efforts will be
needed to meet the MDGs (Table 8). Maternal and child mortality have been reduced and
access to safe water and primary education improved. However, the poverty reduction
agenda underlying the PRSP remains largely unfulfilled, reflecting absorptive capacity
constraints and weaknesses in public expenditure management. The authorities have prepared
a new PRSP (covering 2006–10) which, if properly implemented, could alleviate these
weaknesses.2
II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
7.
The discussions focused on macroeconomic prospects and four main policy challenges:
(i) resolving energy sector problems; (ii) implementing prudent fiscal policy to preserve
macroeconomic stability; (iii) improving fiscal governance and transparency to raise the
productivity of government spending and sustain external assistance; and (iv) encouraging
private sector activity and enterprise and banking reforms to foster economic growth.

(para. 11) and ICS operations. These
projections are broadly in line with the PRSP’s baseline scenario.
9.
The baseline scenario allows for a narrowing of the resource gap over the medium
term. The authorities agreed that the external current account deficit should be reduced,
including by containing the fiscal deficit. Private savings should also grow over the medium
term, facilitated by rising real incomes and financial sector development. Reflecting these
2

10
trends and the recovery in ICS’ exports, the current account deficit (including official
transfers) is projected to decline substantially by 2011 (Table 10). The continued flow of
grants, concessional funding, and debt relief would help finance the deficit.3
10. The medium-term prospects are subject to downside risks. Apart from exogenous
shocks, such as drought, locust invasion, and rising oil prices, there is a risk that the recovery
of ICS may be delayed. If the ICS activities do not resume during the projection period,
average GDP growth would fall to 4.8 percent per annum during 2007–11. Other risks
include: fiscal spillovers from ICS restructuring; supervisory weakness and forbearance that
may endanger the health of the banking system; slackening political resolve to implement
structural reforms; and slippage in fiscal governance that could undermine policy credibility
and reduce the flow of aid.
B. Resolving Energy Sector Problems
11. Disruptions in the supply of petroleum products and electricity adversely affected
the economy in 2006. The price-setting formula for petroleum products and electricity did
not reflect market conditions and generated losses for SAR and SENELEC. Delays and
shortfalls in the government compensation of these companies amplified their already fragile
financial situations. SENELEC accumulated arrears to suppliers and SAR was forced to stop
refining activities and reduce its petroleum product imports.
12. To address these problems, the authorities took several steps. They (i) increased
electricity rates by 15 percent in September and initiated a gradual phase-out of butane
subsidies; (ii) revised the price-setting formula for petroleum products to reflect market
conditions; and (iii) created a new discretionary margin in the price structure, which would
allow them to limit the pass-through of declining international prices. Part of the resources
generated by the margin will be kept off budget and used to reconstitute SAR’s capital. The
other part will be deposited in a new Fund—Fonds de Sécurisation des Importations de
Produits Pétroliers (FSIPP)—to finance subsidies, compensate SAR for its commercial
losses, and possibly stabilize petroleum product prices.
13. While welcoming most of these steps, the staff advised against the off-budget use
and earmarking of resources generated by the margin. The authorities pointed out that
the resources earmarked for SAR should remain off budget to facilitate SAR’s access to bank
financing, but indicated that the off-budget component of the margin would be rescinded
when SAR’s capital is reconstituted (within two years). The authorities also downplayed the
stabilization aspect of the FSIPP, in response to the staff’s advice against it, and stressed that
the FSIPP would be managed transparently.

3

The likelihood of a scaling up of foreign assistance is limited. The optimistic scenario of the proposed new
PRSP envisages a larger investment program compared to staff’s medium-term assumptions, without specifying
the sources of financing, but it recognizes that implementation may pose a challenge.

11
C. Fiscal Policy
14. The fiscal outlook for 2007 and the medium term is not favorable, unless
corrective measures are implemented. Assuming no fiscal spillover from ICS
restructuring, the authorities’ draft fiscal program for 2007 entails a deficit of about
5.5 percent of GDP (Table 6). The staff’s debt sustainability analysis carried out jointly with
the World Bank staff (Appendix 1) shows that, although the risk of debt distress in Senegal is
low, fiscal deficits of this magnitude could eventually lead to debt distress.4 The related
additional domestic borrowing needs could be satisfied over the medium term only at
increasing costs and at the risk of crowding out the private sector. Continued increases in
public expenditure could lower the productivity of public outlays as investment surpasses
implementation capacity. Taking these factors into account, and in light of emerging
domestic payments arrears and a growing current account deficit, the authorities agreed that
the overall fiscal deficit (including grants) should be reduced in 2007 and contained to about
4 percent of GDP over the medium term.
15. The policies to achieve this fiscal objective will include phasing out subsidies,
containing the wage bill, and limiting the increase in investment outlays. The authorities
agreed to consider phasing out butane gas subsidies by end-2007. They also intend to revise
and automatically apply the formula for setting electricity prices to reflect SENELEC’s cost
structure, thereby reducing the need for transfers to SENELEC. Increases in electricity prices
would be applied asymmetrically, with smaller increases for low-income households. The
staff endorsed these measures and added that ad hoc civil service salary increases, similar to
those announced in 2006, should be avoided and the wage bill kept stable relative to GDP. It
also suggested that increases in capital expenditure relative to GDP be considered only if
investment planning and implementation capacity improve and debt sustainability is not put
at risk. The authorities broadly agreed with these recommendations.
16. The staff stressed that domestic arrears have adversely affected the private sector
and should be eliminated without delay through the issuance of treasury bills. The
authorities were unwilling to consider this financing option prior to elections on the grounds
that any securities tender could be undersubscribed or too costly. However, they committed
to clear the arrears, which they attributed to shortfalls in donor support, soon after the
upcoming elections.5
17. Effective debt management is needed to maintain debt sustainability. The staff
endorsed the authorities’ preference for borrowing externally only on concessional terms. It
highlighted the need for regular debt sustainability analyses and stressed that government
4

The analysis also shows that the realization of existing contingent liabilities of the government (about
10 percent of GDP—see the 2007 Selected Issues (www.imf.org), everything else remaining unchanged, will
not undermine debt sustainability.
5

The World Bank delayed disbursements until legislation was enacted in July to bring a new protective tax in
line with WTO safeguard rules. Also, for administrative reasons, the EU disbursed only 25 percent of its
€ 20 million budgetary aid for 2006.

12
contingent liabilities—including those stemming from Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs),
government guarantees, and public enterprises—should be monitored closely and their
financial implications included in the budget. Given the growing domestic financing needs
and the volatility of external assistance, the authorities agreed to develop a program for the
issuance of government securities and lengthen their maturity.
18. Fiscal policy will remain the key instrument of macroeconomic stability, but more
effective monetary policy is also important. The staff urged the authorities to encourage
the BCEAO to reduce excess liquidity and remove the anomalies in monetary management
identified during consultation discussions with the WAEMU.
D. Improving Fiscal Governance and Transparency to Enhance Policy
Credibility and the Productivity of Public Spending
19. The staff urged the authorities to speed up implementation of the measures
already agreed to for improving fiscal governance and transparency.6 It proposed a
three-year public financial management (PFM) plan prepared by the Fund and World Bank
staffs (Appendix 2). However, concerned about the consistency of various reform programs,
the authorities postponed the discussion of the PFM plan until the completion (by end-2007)
of the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment (PEFA), being
coordinated by the EU and the World Bank. In addition to the critical issues mentioned
below, the proposed PFM plan includes measures to extend the coverage of fiscal reports to
public enterprise operations, establish a legal framework for public agencies, and encourage
adherence to internal and external budget control and audit mechanisms.
20. Persistent problems with enforcement of procurement rules are a major concern
for the private sector and development partners. A large part of domestically-financed
expenditure (37 percent during January–September 2006) continues to be implemented
through contracts awarded on a noncompetitive basis. The staff welcomed the new
procurement code—which limits the conditions under which noncompetitive bids can be
approved and is endorsed by the World Bank staff—and urged its speedy implementation.
The authorities could not commit to a timetable for implementation, noting the need for the
new organizational structure to be set up. However, they will require submission of
procurement plans by spending ministries at the beginning of each year to reduce emergency
requests, and publish the list of contracts awarded on a regular basis to reduce infractions.
21. The off-budget use of public resources and nonbudgeted spending should be
avoided. The staff expressed concern that the external resources received by the agency
implementing the infrastructure projects for the Islamic Conference Organization (ICO)
summit had not been included in the budget, and resources had been diverted to the agency
from other budgetary lines. The authorities did not share these concerns, noting that the 2006
supplementary budget law would regularize these expenditures and the operations of the
6

These are included in the CFAA, CPAR, fiscal ROSC, and the authorities’ latest MEFP (IMF Country
Report 06/127).

13
agency would be subject to ex post control. The staff regretted that the supplementary budget
was expected to be enacted only in November 2006.
22. Serious concerns about the transparency of the new airport project remain. The
staff was not assured that the transparency procedures for the collection and use of the
receipts from the air travel tax (RDIA—instituted in April 2005) which were mandated by
presidential decree are being followed.7 These receipts are earmarked for airport construction
and kept off budget. In addition, the capital base of the company in charge of the
implementation of the project is small (US$200,000) compared to the size of the project
(US$300 million or 4 percent of GDP), there are no other contributions from the company’s
single private shareholder (who owns 55 percent of the company), and no public-privatepartnership contract is being prepared for the implementation of the project. 8 Therefore, the
entire risk of the project will be borne by the government. Consequently, the staff renewed its
call for the project to be treated as public and included in the budget. The authorities were
strongly opposed to this idea, claiming that off-budget procedures would accelerate
construction and facilitate financing of the project.
23. A streamlined tax system and a stronger tax administration would help
consolidate the progress achieved in revenue collection. The authorities agreed that
exemptions should be recorded in the budget, but they did not commit to their reduction.
They did not agree that direct tax collection responsibilities should be transferred from the
treasury to the tax department. While the transfer could simplify filing and payment
procedures and improve enforcement of tax arrears, they were concerned that any change in
the organizational structure could disrupt an already well-performing tax collection system.
Nevertheless, they intend to implement the long-overdue installation of a software for datasharing between the three tax collecting agencies (treasury, tax department, and customs), to
improve information exchange on taxpayers, detection of unreported activities, and
assessment of each agency's performance.
E. Fostering Economic Growth by Encouraging Private Sector
Activity and Structural Reforms
24. In light of the recent slowdown in economic activity, maintaining robust growth
remains a challenge. The government is preparing an Accelerated Growth Strategy (AGS)
that focuses on developing five sectors with presumed export potential and improving the
business climate, and aims at raising the annual growth rate to 7 percent over the medium
term.9 The authorities indicated that, when completed, the AGS will be incorporated into the
PRSP. The staff pointed out that attaining the AGS’s growth objective will be a major
challenge as it is substantially above the already high rates of the past few years. The
7

See IMF Country Report 06/127 (Appendix I, MEFP, paragraphs 23–24 and annex II).

8

In its letter to the authorities dated July 12, 2006, the World Bank staff has raised similar concerns (see also
IMF Country Report 06/127).

9

The five sectors include agro-industry, fisheries, electronic customer support services, tourism, and textiles.

14
emphasis on developing specific sectors through government investment and incentives is
also questionable. The authorities agreed that priority should be given to implementing the
AGS action plan aimed at: (i) raising the efficiency of public administration and eliminating
complex administrative procedures; (ii) reducing corruption and strengthening the judicial
system; (iii) removing infrastructural bottlenecks, especially in the transport and electricity
sectors; (iv) alleviating labor market rigidities; (v) deepening the financial market; and
(vi) generally, strengthening competition throughout the economy.
25. Resumption of full operations by the ICS is essential for raising the growth rate.
The company stopped its operations in March 2006 and is not servicing its debt.10 It is
currently under court protection. Some of the litigations against it have been settled, and an
urgently needed restructuring plan is under discussion. The staff urged the authorities to
ensure that the plan includes cost-cutting measures, management improvements, and capital
injection by private partners, and minimizes the impact on public finances. The authorities
concurred that any contribution by the government should be included in the budget. They
agreed to reduce the government’s 47 percent stake in the company, but did not commit to
total divesture.
26. Further efforts will be necessary to ensure the financial viability of SENELEC.
The staff welcomed the planned efforts, in collaboration with the World Bank, to increase
production capacity, diversify sources of energy, and reduce costs, over the next three years.
To ensure that the company becomes profitable and able to provide a reliable electricity
service to the country, the authorities endorsed the World Bank staff’s view that the company
be placed under private management, but could not commit to a precise timetable.
27. Raising the contribution of the financial sector to the economy through improved
access to credit and enhanced soundness is essential for growth. Nonperforming loans are
sizeable and the banking sector suffers from excessive loan concentration (Table 11), which
cannot be easily corrected owing to a shortage of creditworthy enterprises in a nondiversified
economy. As part of their financial sector development plan (Table 12), the authorities intend
to provide adequate budgetary allocations for the implementation of judicial reforms to
facilitate loan recovery and enhance enforceability of private sector contracts, thereby
facilitating credit availability. The staff stressed that, in addition, banks’ capital adequacy
ratio should be raised above 8 percent to account for the loan concentration risk. Since the
implementation of this measure, which is in line with the FSAP recommendations, requires
coordination at the regional level, the authorities should urge speedy progress by the
WAEMU on the proposed measures.11 The staff also emphasized the need to remain vigilant

10

ICS’ cumulative losses over 2003–05 amounted to about 4 percent of 2005 GDP. They were due to cost
overruns, managerial weaknesses, disputes with clients, low export prices during 2001–03, and the appreciation
of CFAF against the U.S. dollar in 2004–05.
11

The Minister of Finance has written to the BCEAO requesting that this issue be placed on the agenda for the
WAEMU Council of Ministers.

15
in detecting fragilities in banks and microfinance institutions and impose timely corrective
actions.
28. The financial difficulties of the ICS are weighing on bank soundness. Against staff
recommendations, the government guaranteed ICS’ debt to banks—amounting to 1.5 percent
of GDP—and all interest falling due until a restructuring plan is in place. As a result, banks
are not required to make provisions for ICS risk. The BCEAO agreed with the staff that the
supervision commission should proactively urge banks to begin provisioning against
potential write-offs arising from ICS restructuring.
29. The contribution of the export sector to economic growth should be raised. The
share of exports in GDP has declined, and Senegal's share in world exports has been
gradually declining. The lackluster performance of the export sector could be attributable to
falling world demand for some of Senegal’s products and declining competitiveness (as
indicated by the evolution of the unit labor cost REER)12 arising from structural weaknesses
that raise production costs and hinder diversification. In this light, the authorities agreed that
export diversification and infrastructural improvements are essential for export growth.

30. Further trade openness will enhance the efficiency of the economy. Senegal has
adopted the WAEMU’s common external tariff, and its average tariff rate does not exceed
12 percent.13 However, the following measures reduce free trade and hinder competition in
the import sector.

12

13

See the 2007 Selected Issues Paper (www.imf.org).

In 2006, Senegal is expected to have met all of the WAEMU’s convergence criteria, except those on
domestic arrears, the basic fiscal balance, and the external current account deficit.

16
•

The tax protecting the vegetable oil import operations of the newly-privatized
groundnut company SONACOS (adopted in January 2006 against staff
recommendations) should be eliminated as soon as possible. This tax is regressive (as
imported vegetable oil is used mainly by the poor) and creates wrong incentives for
SONACOS.

•

The recent arbitrary increase in the indicative value for the import price of palm oil,
which allows customs to reject the prices reported by importers, should be rescinded
as it constitutes another element of protection for SONACOS.

•

The reference values used by customs for assessing import duties hinder competition
and should be eliminated in conformity with WTO commitments.14

The authorities considered these measures to be temporary, allowing domestic firms to adjust
to foreign competition. They also noted that another protective tax (Taxe Dégressive de
Protection) has been suspended and its elimination is under consideration.
III.

RELATIONS WITH THE FUND

31. The authorities reiterated their interest in a close relationship with the Fund.
Discussions on a program under the PSI— to succeed the PRGF arrangement that expired in
April 2006—began in May 2006, but could not be concluded. The authorities needed more
time to forge a consensus within the government before committing to any policy package.
These deliberations are unlikely to be completed before the upcoming elections.
IV.

STAFF APPRAISAL

32. Renewed efforts at macroeconomic stabilization and progress on the structural
reform agenda will be critical to reverse the weakening macroeconomic performance
and to move toward the MDGs. Maintaining a robust growth rate and improving the
economy’s resilience to exogenous shocks will require, among other things, enhancing the
efficiency of public expenditure, rehabilitating ICS and SENELEC, developing the financial
sector, improving export competitiveness through diversification and infrastructural
improvements, and reducing impediments to private sector activity. In this regard, speedy
implementation of the action plan for improving the business environment and reducing the
cost of doing business, proposed under the AGS, is critical.
33. Macroeconomic stability hinges on reversing the rising trend in the fiscal deficit.
The authorities’ intention to lower deficits over the medium term in order to contain external
current account deficits and prevent debt distress and arrears is welcome. Reducing subsidies
is the critical component of this policy. Energy subsidies only delay adjustment and cannot
be maintained indefinitely in an environment of high energy prices. Prompt elimination of
domestic payment arrears is also needed.
14

These were supposed to be reduced by July 2005, but a two-year extension was granted by WTO.

17
34. The recent changes in the pricing policy for energy products, which will help
reduce subsidies, are welcome. However, the discretionary margin included in the price
structure, the off-budget use of the resulting resources, and the creation of a stabilization fund
can hamper economic efficiency and transparency. The government should eliminate the
margin and reduce official intervention in the energy sector.
35. A prudent borrowing policy is necessary to maintain debt sustainability. The
authorities should comply with their commitment to borrow exclusively on concessional
terms in the post-MDRI era. They should also conduct debt sustainability analysis regularly
and closely monitor the potential liabilities of the government, including those stemming
from activities of public agencies.
36. The country’s dependence on external assistance makes it imperative to improve
policy credibility and fiscal transparency. To this end, the breakdown in procurement
practices should be rectified, the new procurement code strictly applied, off-budget use of
public resources avoided, and transparency in the implementation of the new Dakar airport
project ensured.
37. The prompt rehabilitation of ICS and SENELEC is essential for economic
growth. The authorities should press for injection of funds by the private partners of ICS,
cost cutting, and management improvements. They should also allow electricity prices to
reflect market conditions and place SENELEC under private management by 2009.
38. The large nonperforming loans and credit concentration in the banking system
are potential sources of vulnerability. These problems are exacerbated by the financial
difficulties of ICS. The Banking Commission should require banks to make adequate
provisions against potential losses arising from the restructuring of ICS. Planned judicial
reforms should be accelerated to facilitate loan recovery and capital adequacy ratios raised to
account for the risks inherent in the Senegalese economy.
39. The authorities should create a level playing field in the import sector. In
particular, the new tax protecting the import operations of the privatized SONACOS should
be eliminated as soon as possible.
40. It is expected that the next Article IV Consultation discussions will take place
within 12 months.

1/ Reflects MDRI stock debt relief in 2006. Debt relief from the Fund is recorded as a capital transfer. Debt relief from the IDA and the AfDF on the amounts
falling due in 2006 is shown as exceptional financing, while debt relief on amounts due in 2007 and beyond is recorded as a capital transfer.
2/ Until 2005, HIPC Initiative flow debt relief granted by the IMF is recorded as a grant, and that granted by the World Bank,
the African Development Bank, Paris Club creditors,and Kuwait is recorded as exceptional financing.

Appendix 1. Senegal: Joint Fund-World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis
This analysis assesses the sustainability of Senegal’s external public debt and total public
debt. The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) was conducted jointly by the staffs of the IMF
and the World Bank, using the joint Bank-Fund framework for debt sustainability analysis
for low-income countries (LIC). The data in this DSA were updated by Fund staff and
Senegalese authorities during the October 2006 Article IV consultation mission.
1.
The risk of debt distress in Senegal is low during the period 2006–26, given the
low current level of debt, and assuming the fiscal deficit remains below 4 percent of
GDP on the average, real interest rates remain below real GDP growth rate, and the
inflow of concessional funds is sustained at historical levels.1 Under the baseline scenario,
which assumes fiscal deficit and inflow of concessional funds aligned with historical trends,
the net present value (NPV) of total (domestic and external) public and publicly guaranteed
(PPG) debt-to-GDP ratio will remain below its policy-dependent threshold during the whole
projection period. The total PPG debt service-to-revenues ratio (including short-term debt
service) will nevertheless double to 30 percent in five years if the average maturity of new
debt remains at the current one year. Debt burden indicators worsen significantly if
borrowing terms deteriorate or if the fiscal deficit remains high.
I. BACKGROUND
2.
Senegal’s debt sustainability indicators improved substantially after the
enhanced HIPC Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). Senegal
reached its HIPC floating completion point in April 2004, when it received debt relief of
about US$488 million in NPV terms (about US$850 million in nominal terms).2 Debt relief
under the HIPC has been granted by Kuwait and all Paris Club creditors except Sweden.
China has committed to cancel all Senegal’s debt. In 2005, Senegal qualified for further debt
cancellation under the MDRI when the IMF, the International Development Association
(IDA), and the African Development Fund (AfDF) cancelled their claims on Senegal
amounting to about US$1.4 billion in nominal terms (19 percent of 2006 GDP in NPV
terms).3 As a result of these two initiatives, the NPV of external PPG debt outstanding is
estimated to have amounted to 13 percent of GDP at end-2006. Public domestic debt is
estimated at about 3 percent of GDP, of which two-thirds is long term.
1

The risk of debt distress is considered low if all debt indicators are well below relevant country-specific debtburden thresholds and stress testing does not result in indicators significantly breaching thresholds.

2
3

See Senegal: Enhanced Initiative for HIPC-Completion Point Document (IMF Country Report 04/130)

MDRI debt relief from the IMF became effective in January 5, 2006, providing stock relief on debt disbursed
before end-2004 and still outstanding at end-2005. IDA and the AfDF started providing debt relief in July 2006.
The eligible debt covers IDA credits disbursed before end-2003 and AfDF credits disbursed before end-2004
that are still outstanding at the time of qualification.

32

3.
The exposure of the private sector also appears limited. The International
Investment Position compiled by the BCEAO for end-2004 indicates that the stock of private
external debt (net of private external assets) is only 9 percent of GDP. The net private
external debt includes trade credit (2 percent of GDP), currency and deposits owed by
Senegalese banks to nonresidents (3 percent of GDP) and loans taken abroad (3 percent of
GDP).
II.

METHODOLOGY AND BASELINE SCENARIO

4.
Following the guidelines of the LIC DSA framework, staffs have analyzed the
evolution of the total public debt stock and debt service indicators for Senegal subject to
a baseline scenario and a series of stress tests.4 The stress tests are designed to assess a
country’s probability of facing debt distress in the future.5 The analysis is guided by
indicative, country-specific external PPG debt-burden thresholds, which take into account the
empirical finding that the external debt levels that a low-income country can sustain increase
with the quality of its policies and institutions. The quality of policies and institutions is
measured by the World Bank’s 2005 Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA),
according to which Senegal ranks as a “strong performer.” The indicative external debtburden thresholds for countries in this category are: (i) an NPV of external PPG debt-to-GDP
ratio of 50 percent; (ii) an NPV of external PPG debt-to-exports ratio of 200 percent; (iii) an
NPV of external PPG debt-to-revenue ratio of 300 percent; (iv) an external PPG debt serviceto-exports ratio of 25 percent; (v) and an external medium and long-term PPG debt serviceto-revenue ratio of 35 percent.
5.

Broadly in line with the PRSP II, the baseline scenario assumes that:

•

Economic performance will follow the trends observed during 2000–05 (Box 1 and
Table 3). Economic growth will recover from around 3.3 percent in 2006 and range
between 4.9 and 5.6 percent during 2007–26—3.8 percentage points higher than the
average real interest rate on public debt over the period. The projected recovery
in 2007–8 will be induced by the decline in international oil prices and the resolution
of the financial crisis in Senegal’s largest company (Industries Chimiques du Sénégal

4

See “Operational Framework for Debt Sustainability Assessments in Low-Income Countries—Further
Considerations,” March 28, 2005 (www.imf.org). The new framework introduces some methodological changes
in the calculation of the NPV of debt compared to the HIPC methodology by using (a) a fixed 5 percent
discount rate instead of currency specific discount rates (under HIPC), (b) WEO exchange rate projections
instead of fixed exchange rates as of the end of the base year and (c) annual exports instead of a three-year
average of exports as the denominator in the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio.

5

The standard stress tests conducted for Senegal for external DSA are listed in Table 2 and for fiscal DSA in
Table 4. The most extreme stress tests (worst case scenarios) depicted in Figures 1 and 2 and detailed in Box 2
are those with the worst indicator in 2016.

33

- ICS).6 Beyond 2008, the reforms to improve the business environment will boost
private investment and sustain economic growth close to the trend level of 5.1 percent
per year observed in 2000–05.7
•

The overall fiscal deficit (including transfers) will remain below 4 percent of GDP
over 2007–26 on the average.

•

The external current account deficit will decline during 2007–26 as export growth
exceeds that of imports (Box 1 and Table 1). Growth in the exports of goods will
outpace the growth in GDP in 2007–26 as ICS, which accounts for about 10 percent
of total exports, will gradually resume its activities during 2007–08, and structural
reforms expand the export base. Imports as a percentage of GDP will fall in 2007–08
as oil prices decline and the local refinery resumes its operations. Remittances will
grow slightly faster than GDP during the entire projection period, in line with recent
trends.

•

External borrowing on concessional terms will remain constant at trend level of about
3.5 percent of GDP throughout the projection period, with an average grant element
of 45.3 percent (1.6 percent of GDP). The authorities intend to borrow abroad only on
concessional terms. Financing needs of the public sector beyond that level will be
covered almost entirely by short-term domestic borrowing on nonconcessional terms,
which is consistent with the debt management policy implemented in recent years.

6

The price of oil is assumed to decline to US$59 per barrel, at end-2006 from US$68 in mid-2006, and rise to
US$64 at end-2008. It is projected to decline again to US$59 at end-2011 and stabilize at that level for the rest
of the projection period.
7

Excluding 2002, when a severe drought reduced real GDP growth to 0.7 percent.

Interest rate on private and domestic PPG debt assumed to average 4.5 percent.

III. EXTERNAL SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
6.
Under the baseline scenario, Senegal’s external PPG debt-burden indicators
remain below the thresholds throughout the projection period. The NPV of external PPG
debt-to-GDP ratio will rise slightly from 13 percent in 2006 to 15 percent by 2026 under this
scenario, below the policy-dependent threshold of 50 percent for a strong performer such as
Senegal. Similarly, the NPV of external PPG debt-to-exports ratio and the external PPG debt
service-to-exports ratio are projected to remain under 56 and 6 percent, respectively, during
the whole projection period, below their respective policy-dependent thresholds (Figure 1
and Table 2).
7.
External debt sustainability indicators remain below the thresholds in case of all
standard temporary shocks, including the most extreme.8 The most extreme stress test
for Senegal consists of a combined two-year decline in GDP growth, export growth, capital
inflows, and a reduction in GDP in US dollars (Box 2).9 External PPG debt and debt service
will rise sharply as a result of such a shock, but will remain below the thresholds during the
projection period (Figure 1, Table 2).

8

The effect of fiscal slippages on total PPG debt is analyzed in the next section. The tests assume that balanceof-payments gaps are financed by public sector borrowing. External PPG debt indicators remain unchanged if
the balance-of-payments gaps are financed by private sector borrowing.
9
The magnitude of the shocks in the worst case scenarios is substantially more severe than the effect of
delaying the resumption of ICS for one year, in which case GDP growth rate would be around 1.5 percentage
point below the baseline scenario in 2007.

8.
The debt indicators are sensitive to borrowing terms. If all new external borrowing
(3.5 percent of GDP annually on average) is concessional with an average grant element of
45.3 percent, the NPV of external PPG debt-to-GDP ratio will rise by only 2 percentage
points in the projection period. However, it will grow by 21 percentage points and reach
34 percent in 2026 if all new external borrowing is nonconcessional (Figure 1 and Table 2).
In this case, the debt indicators remain below the threshold during the projection period but
continue to grow and eventually breach the thresholds after the end of the projection period.
If financing under the worst case shock is nonconcessional, the NPV of external PPG debtto-GDP ratio in 2008 will be 10 percentage points higher than if it is concessional (Figure 1).
These results underline the need for the government to adhere strictly to the policy of
borrowing externally only on concessional terms.
IV. FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
9.
Under the baseline scenario, the public debt indicators mirror the external debt
indicators. The NPV of total PPG debt-to-GDP ratio and the NPV of total PPG debt-toexports ratio will remain low during the entire projection period, even though the domestic
portion of the total public debt is nonconcessional. The medium and long-term debt serviceto-revenues ratio will similarly remain low under the baseline scenario (Box 1, Figure 2,
Tables 3 and 4).
10.
The government may face rollover difficulties over the next 5 to 10 years owing
to the growing share of short-term domestic debt (Figure 3). If the current policy of
issuing short-term securities to close the financing gap continues in the medium-term, the
total PPG debt service-to-revenue ratio (including short-term debt service) will double to
30 percent by 2011 before stabilizing at a high level, around 42 percent, over the rest of the

36

period.10 These projections underline the need for Senegal to extend the maturities of public
debt securities and to develop a liquid primary and secondary market for government debt.
11.
Fiscal debt sustainability hinges on the reduction of the fiscal deficit to below
4 percent of GDP on the average. If the fiscal deficit remains at its 2006 level of
5.7 percent of GDP (equivalent to a primary deficit of 5.0 percent of GDP) during the entire
projection period, the NPV of total PPG debt-to-GDP ratio will reach 50 percent in 2021.
The financing needs caused by the accumulated deficits could crowd out the private sector.
The NPV of total debt-to-revenue ratio and debt service-to-revenue ratio (including shortterm debt service) will follow similar trajectories, reaching 268 and 197 percent by 2026,
respectively. This prospect highlights once again the need for the authorities to pursue a
prudent fiscal policy over the medium term (Figure 2 and Tables 3 and 4).
12.
Temporary adverse shocks will require additional fiscal adjustment to reduce
domestic borrowing and stabilize public debt. The most extreme shock for fiscal DSA,
which involves GDP growth rate falling to 2.3 percent a year in 2007 and 2008 (equivalent to
one standard deviation below its historical average), would raise the NPV of total PPG debtto-GDP ratio to 50 percent by the end of the projection period. The NPV of total PPG debtto-revenues ratio would follow a similar trajectory and reach 200 percent in 2022. The
realization of the government’s existing contingent liabilities (about 10 percent of GDP
in 2007—see Selected Issues (www.imf.org) will have a less severe impact on debt
sustainability than the worst-case scenario. To ensure that debt indicators remain within
reasonable limits in case of a shock, the fiscal deficit should be reduced below the level
assumed under the baseline scenario (Box 2, Figure 2 and Table 4).
V.

CONCLUSION

13.
The risk of debt distress remains low. Debt indicators rise steeply during the
projection period only if the overall fiscal deficit remains at its 2006 level of 5.7 percent of
GDP, or the average maturity of new domestic debt remains at one year or less.
Beyond 2026, the debt distress may arise only if GDP does not grow as projected, or all
borrowing is on nonconcessional terms. In these cases, additional fiscal adjustment will be
needed to ensure that the risk of debt distress stays low. This DSA highlights the need for
Senegal to continue to adopt strict fiscal discipline, a prudent strategy regarding borrowing
on non-concessional terms, and appropriate debt management policies.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that NPV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments devided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.

Source: Staff projections and simulations.
1/ Stress-tests assume that shocks are fully financed by public sector on non-concessional terms, not by private sector.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 3.5 percentage points higher than in the baseline, while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for the alternative scenario (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Safeguards Assessments:

The Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) is the common central bank of the
countries of the West African Economic and Monetary Union. A new safeguards assessment
of the BCEAO was completed on November 4, 2005. The assessment found that progress has
been made in strengthening the BCEAO’s safeguards framework of the bank since 2002
when the previous safeguards assessment took place.
The BCEAO now publishes a full set of audited financial statements and improvements have
been made to move financial reporting closer to International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS). Furthermore, an internal audit charter has been put in place and mechanisms have
been established to improve risk management and risk prevention and follow up on internal
and external audit recommendations has been strengthened.
The new assessment identified a number of areas where further steps would help solidify the
progress made. The main recommendations relate to improvements in the external audit
process (including the adoption of a formal rotation policy), further enhancement of the
transparency of the financial statements by fully adopting IFRS, and further strengthening of
the effectiveness of the internal audit function.
The staff follows up regularly on the BCEAO’s progress in implementing the
recommendations in the context of the Fund's semiannual regional consultation missions.
X.

Exchange System:

Senegal is a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). The
exchange system, common to all members of the union, is free of restrictions on the making
of payments and transfers for current international transactions. The union's common
currency, the CFA franc, had been pegged to the French franc at the rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02.
Effective January 12, 1994, the CFA franc was devalued and the new parity set at CFAF 1 =
F 0.01. Effective December 31, 1998, the parity was switched to the euro at a rate of
CFAF 655.96 = €1.

3

The Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member countries
that are qualified for the assistance. The debt relief covers the full stock of debt owed to the Fund as of end2004 which remains outstanding at the time the member qualifies for such debt relief. The MDRI is financed by
bilateral contributions and the Fund's own resources, as well as the resources already disbursed to the member
under the HIPC Initiative (see Section VII above).

5
The authorities confirmed that Senegal had not imposed measures that could give rise to
exchange restrictions subject to Fund jurisdiction. They will inform the Fund if any such
measure is introduced.
Aspects of the exchange system are also discussed in the recent report on economic
developments and regional policy issues of WAEMU.
XI.

Article IV Consultations:

Senegal’s last PRGF expired in April 2006 and, therefore, the country is on a 12-month
Article IV consultation cycle. The 2004 Article IV consultation was completed by the
Executive Board on March 7, 2005 (2004 Article IV consultation and the second review, and
IMF Country Report No. 05/155). In concluding the Article IV consultation, Executive
Directors stressed the importance of prudent fiscal policies and structural reforms to enhance
policy credibility, maintain debt sustainability, and achieve the growth needed to further
reduce poverty. They emphasized in particular the need to enhance public expenditure
management and fiscal transparency, rehabilitate and privatize public enterprises, address the
under-development of financial markets, and press ahead with structural reforms and
infrastructural improvements to lower the cost of production, improve the business climate
and raise productivity in the export sector.
XII.

Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) and Report on the Observance
of Standards and Codes (ROSC) Participation:

A joint team of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund conducted a mission
under the FSAP program in November 2000 and January 2001. The Financial System
Stability Assessment (FSSA) was issued in August 2001 (IMF Country Report No. 01/189).
An FSAP update was undertaken in June 2004, focusing on development issues (in particular
nationwide supply of basic financial services and access of SMEs to credit), in line with the
priorities defined in the PRSP (IMF Country Report No. 05/126).
A ROSC on the data module, based on a September 2001 mission, was published on
December 2, 2002. An FAD mission conducted a ROSC on the fiscal transparency module in
January 2005.

The legal and institutional framework for AML/CFT is only partially developed. Senegal is
scheduled for an AML/CFT evaluation in March 2007 in the context of ECOWAS InterGovernmental Action Group Against Money Laundering, based on which the AML/CFT
framework will be updated.
XVI. Fourth Amendment of the Articles of Agreement and the Eleventh Quota Review
The authorities have indicated their agreement with the Fourth Amendment of the Articles of

7
Senegal: Relations with the World Bank1
(As of December 18, 2006
Data as at November 14, 2006)
Partnership in Senegal’s development
1.
Senegal’s second PRSP has recently been forwarded to donors. A JSAN is currently
being prepared. The second PRSP covers the period 2006–2010. It sets out the following
pillars of the Government’s strategy: (i) creation of wealth, with emphasis on the country’s
Accelerated Growth Strategy, (ii) access to basic social services, (iii) protection of
vulnerable groups and risk management, and (iv) good governance and participatory
processes.
2.
Regarding the division of responsibilities between the Bretton Woods institutions, the
IMF takes the lead in the policy dialogue on macroeconomic policies and monitors
macroeconomic performance by way of quantitative performance criteria and indicators. In
addition, the IMF’s last PRGF-supported program contained structural conditionality in areas
such as electricity and groundnut sector reform, which have a direct bearing on
macroeconomic stability and growth prospects.
3.
The PRSP and its comprehensive poverty analysis have provided the framework for
the Bank’s country assistance strategy (FY03–05). The Bank supports the Government’s
efforts to achieve sustained growth rates, reduce the incidence of poverty and improve access
to basic social services. In particular, the Bank is currently supporting the implementation of
the PRSP in the areas of health/nutrition, education, HIV/AIDS, rural development,
transport, water, and urban development through the implementation of a portfolio of
specific projects, as outlined more fully below. A new CAS (FY07–10) is being prepared to
take into account the Government’s priorities as set in its new PRSP. CAS Board
presentation is currently planned for April 2007.
World Bank Group strategy and portfolio
4.
IDA has provided external assistance to Senegal since 1966. The main objective of
the Bank’s assistance strategy for Senegal has been to reduce the incidence of poverty and
improve employment. The Bank is working to (i) develop country ownership through policy
dialogue; (ii) use public expenditure reviews with a focus on impacts at the levels of the
consolidated central budget; (iii) monitor linkages between implementation and aggregate
results; and (iv) emphasize investment in human capital through the lending and advisory
services.
5.
As of December 18, 2006, the World Bank had approved 137 credits for Senegal with
a total amount of about US$2.9 billion. Past projects had supported agricultural
1

8
diversification, irrigation, human resources development, institutional development, and
expansion of the country’s infrastructure, particularly its transport system. In recent years,
the emphasis has shifted to better utilizing and maintaining existing facilities and to helping
the Government resolve some of the key issues hampering long-term development prospects.
The current active portfolio has a commitment value of about US$806.7 million equivalent,
with an undisbursed amount of about US$512.3 million. The portfolio is composed of
19 credits in various sectors (rural development, human resources: population/health/
nutrition/ education/social development, HIV/AIDS, infrastructure/urban development,
energy/water, industry, and private sector development, budget support).
6.
Bank support to the health sector is provided under a series of Poverty Reduction
Support Credits. PRSC II is expected to strengthen the Government’s efforts aimed at
improving health infrastructure and the allocation of human and financial resources toward
the regions. An HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project aims at assisting the
Government in: (i) preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS by reducing transmission among high
risk groups; (ii) expanding access to treatment, care, and support for people living with
HIV/AIDS in Senegal to serve as a pilot for the implementation of antiretroviral treatment in
sub-Saharan Africa; and (iii) supporting civil society and community initiatives for
HIV/AIDS prevention and care.
7.
In 1999, the Government adopted a ten-year program (PDEF) with the ultimate
objective of reaching universal primary education by the year 2008 (up from 60 percent of
gross primary enrollment in 1999). A Quality Education For All Project (QEFA Education SIP) supports the program in three phases. Key issues in education include the
need to (a) consolidate gains in expanding access while addressing the needs of the underand un-served areas; (b) support quality improvements in education through interventions at
the school and at local education structures; (c) improve sector management (in particular,
financial and personnel management); and (d) prepare for smooth deconcentration, and
eventual decentralization, to the regional and departmental levels. The first phase of the
QEFA closed at the end of December 2005. The second phase was approved on August 30,
2006.
8.
A Nutrition project was approved in November 2006. Its objective is to expand
access to, and enhance nutritional conditions of, vulnerable populations, in particular those
conditions affecting the growth of children under five years of age in poor urban and rural
areas.
9.
Bank support to the urban sector is provided under the Urban Mobility project,
which aims to improve the safety, efficiency and environmental quality of urban mobility in
the Dakar metropolitan area, especially for the urban poor, and to improve road safety in
Thiès and Kaolack. Support to urban municipalities is also provided under the recently
approved Local Authorities Development Program which aims at (i) strengthening the
capacity of urban municipalities to improve resource mobilization, and municipal and urban
management, and (ii) increasing access to and quality of public infrastructure and services in
urban areas.

9
10.
Up until 1996, the urban water sector was facing two major issues: (i) a shortage of
water production and distribution capacity in the Dakar area requiring substantial immediate
investments, (ii) low managerial efficiency with no financial viability of the sector. To deal
with these issues, the government adopted two Water Sector Projects in 1996 and 2001
supported by seven donors, including the World Bank as lead agency. The Long-Term
Water Sector project includes a large physical investment program and institutional
reforms (PSP), which have increased access to potable water in the Dakar area and improved
overall management of the sector.
11.
In terms of rural development, Bank support is provided under various instruments.
First, a recently approved second phase of the Agricultural Services and Producer
Organizations Program aims at increasing access for smallholder producers to effective and
diversified agricultural services and innovations, with a view to diversifying and stabilizing
their productions and increasing their food security. Second, the recently approved first phase
of the Agricultural Markets and Agribusiness Development project will help increase
non-traditional agricultural exports and farm revenues for project-supported producers.
Finally, the recently approved Participatory Local Development project will assist the
Government in setting up an effective framework for participatory local development,
decentralization, resource mobilization and transfer to local governments and communities,
to deliver services in rural areas and targeted poorest cities efficiently.
12.
In the transport sector, capacity constraints are being addressed with a program of
new investments, especially in rehabilitating rail links between Senegal and Mali, as well as
institutional reforms. The Transport SIP was launched in 1999 with support from several
donors, including the World Bank. Key issues in transport include the need to strengthen
institutional capacity, direct private sector involvement in investment and management of the
sector, improving the condition of the priority road network and reducing the cost of road
maintenance and rehabilitation.
13.
Due to global difficulties in the energy sector, the two “privatization” efforts
conducted over the last five years to bring private sector expertise and private financing into
SENELEC were not successful. Bank’s assistance to the Government takes into account the
lessons learned and the overall international context where private sector interest in investing
in Africa is reduced. A Rural Electrification Services project was approved in
September 2004, and an Electricity Efficiency Enhancement project was approved in
May 2005.
14.
In terms of private sector development, the Private Investment Promotion project
and the Private Sector Adjustment operation assist in creating the conditions to stimulate a
sustained increase in private investment in Senegal through an improved investment climate,
greater private participation in economic activities, and polity and sector reform.
15.
As of September 2006, credits from the International Finance Corporation’s (IFC)
portfolio totaled about US$46 million and included two large investments (the GTI-Dakar
power plant—the first independent power producer of the country—and Ciments du Sahel—
the country’s second cement producer). Direct SME investments were made to finance a

10
130-room hotel, a private school, a microfinance institution, and expand a fishing fleet. Prior
equity investments in the financial sector in housing and leasing are mature and IFC is
seeking exit. IFC has been active in advisory work with FIAS assessments of investment red
tape and the taxation system. IFC is also an active participant in the President’s Investors’
Advisory Council, a forum for high-level dialogue between the government and private
sector (domestic and foreign).
World Bank-IMF collaboration in specific areas
16.
The IMF and the World Bank staff maintain a close working relationship, especially
with respect to (i) the implementation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy; (ii) reforms in
public finance management; and (iii) structural measures in specific sectors, such as
electricity and groundnuts, which have systematic impact on the public finances and on
macroeconomic stability.
17.
The conditionality for the groundnut and electricity sectors in the last PRGFsupported program has been developed in close collaboration with World Bank staff, and the
Bank takes the lead role in working out the technical details of the envisaged reforms. The
IMF and the Bank also coordinate their activities and conditionalities in the area of public
expenditure reform, an area in which both institutions have an interest.

Senegal: Statistical Issues
1.
Although the economic database is comprehensive, there are weaknesses in data on
national accounts, production, international trade, and social indicators. The authorities are
strongly committed to improving the quality and availability of economic, financial and
social indicators, partially relying on technical assistance from the Fund and other
international organizations. A Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes—Data
Module, a Detailed Assessment Using the Data Quality Assessment Framework (DQAF),
and a Response by the Authorities were published on the IMF website on December 2, 2002.
2.
Senegal has embarked on a process of regional harmonization of statistical
methodologies within the framework of the West African Economic and Monetary Union
(WAEMU).
3.
Senegal participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS), and its
metadata were posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board on
September 10, 2001. Metadata were updated in July 2005. The authorities intend to subscribe
to the Standard Data Dissemination System (SDDS) within two to three years. A STA
mission in May 2006 helped the authorities develop an action plan to meet SDDS
requirements.
Real sector
4.
The compilation of the national accounts generally follows the System of National
Accounts, 1993. While staff demonstrates professionalism, the lack of adequate financial
resources has constrained efforts to collect and process data. Data sources are deficient in
some areas, particularly the informal sector. Owing to financial constraints, surveys of
business and households are not conducted regularly, impeding the production of national
accounts estimates (e.g., input-output tables and institutional sector accounts are not
compiled annually). However, efforts are being made to improve data collection procedures,
strengthen the coordination among statistical agencies, and reduce delays in data
dissemination.
5.
A regional advisor in real sector statistics covering the West AFRITAC countries,
including Senegal, was posted for one year beginning December 2005 and the first
assessment visit covering real sector statistics took place in March 2006. Progress reported
by the advisor includes: (i) completion of a national accounts series for 1980–2004 with 1999
as base year; (ii) dissemination of the series 1980–2003 in hard copy and on the internet;
(iii) production of accounts by institutional sector; and (iv) production of national accounts
according to schedule. The authorities plan to start production of quarterly accounts in view
of the country’s intention to subscribe to the SDDS.
6.
The coverage of the harmonized consumer price index, introduced in January 1998, is
limited to Dakar. Its weights are based on a household budget survey conducted during only
three months in 1996, and the regular provision of financial resources required for the price

14
collection is not assured. The authorities plan to extend the scope of the CPI to cover all
11 regions of the country.
Public finances
7.
Government finance statistics (GFS) are compiled by the Ministry of Economy and
Finance from customs, tax, and treasury directorate sources. Data last reported to STA for
inclusion in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook were for fiscal year 2001.
Subannual data are not updated for publication in IFS, although the ministry compiles and
disseminates reasonably detailed quarterly government financial operations tables (TOFE) in
their own publications.
8.
An AFR team worked with the authorities in February 2004 to improve fiscal
reporting in the context of the PRGF-supported program. The team focused on (i) public
accounts that are outside of the direct purview of the treasury; (ii) the treatment of
correspondents’ accounts in the TOFE; and (iii) ensuring consistency between treasury and
banking system information concerning government transactions. The mission found that the
recent adoption by the authorities of the five WAEMU directives on public finances had set
off a series of reforms, which should contribute to improving the overall government
financial operations and bring the TOFE much in line with the extended WAEMU TOFE.
However, full implementation of these reforms could take time because of delays in
addressing the weakness in the treasury computerization system. In the interim, the mission
proposed a number of specific recommendations for improvement of the fiscal accounting
practices. The authorities will review with Fund staff the modalities for incorporating these
recommendations.
Monetary data
9.
Preliminary monetary data for Senegal are compiled by the national agency of the
Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) and officially released by BCEAO
headquarters. There has been an improvement in the timeliness of data provided on interest
rates, monetary institutions, and deposit money banks. The authorities are now reporting
monetary data to STA on a regular basis, with a reduction in the lag from about six months to
about three to four months. An area-wide page for the WAEMU zone was introduced in the
January 2003 issue of IFS.
10.
In 2005, the BCEAO made substantial revisions to the estimates of banknotes in
circulation in member states resulting from cross-border banknote movement. These
revisions were due to changes in the method to estimate currency in circulation in the
WAEMU countries. The revised method, based on updated sorting coefficients (“coefficients
de tri”), has been applied retroactively from December 2003.
11.
In August 2006, as part of the authorities’ efforts to implement the MFSM’s
methodology, the BCEAO reported to STA monetary data for June 2006 for all member
countries using Standardized Report Forms (1SR-central bank, 2SR-other depository
corporations, and 5SR-monetary aggregates).

15
Balance of payments data
12.
Balance of payments data are compiled by the national agency of the BCEAO. With
STA support, several steps have been taken to tackle deficiencies, including:
(i) implementation of the Balance of Payments Manual, fifth edition; (ii) modified and
simplified related surveys for companies and banks; (iii) improvement in the computerization
of procedures; and (iv) significant strengthening of staff training. Although definitive balance
of payments data can now be provided with a delay of less than one year, there are
significant delays in reporting data to STA. Further efforts are required to enhance the
quality and coverage of balance of payments data. In particular, their latest published data
show inconsistencies between the balance of payments and the international investment
position.

IMF Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with Senegal
On January, 29, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Senegal.1
Background
Senegal has experienced strong growth, price stability, and a declining debt stock owing to
substantial debt relief, but macroeconomic performance weakened in 2006. Following robust
performance in 2003-05 (average real GDP growth rate of about 6 percent), economic growth is
estimated to have fallen below 3.5 percent. The decline reflects mainly the impact of higher oil
prices, disruption in electricity supply, and interruption in the operations of the chemical
company (ICS), one of the largest firms in the country. Since 2002, CPI inflation has remained
below 2 percent on an annual average basis, owing to favorable food supply conditions and
inadequate adjustments of administered prices of butane gas, electricity, and transport.
The real effective exchange rate has been broadly in line with the underlying economic
fundamentals and fairly stable since 2002, as changes in relative prices offset the appreciation
of the CFA franc (CFAF) against the U.S. dollar (in line with the Euro to which the CFAF is
pegged).
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed
during the March 7, 2005 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

2
The economy remains vulnerable to exogenous shocks and is dependent on donor support.
The external current account deficit excluding grants is estimated to have increased by about
5 percent of GDP between 2004 and 2006, owing to the oil price shock and ICS’ difficulties.
Foreign assistance, in the form of grants, concessional loans, and debt relief (flow savings)
amounted to about half of the external current account deficit in 2005–06.
The overall fiscal balance (including grants) moved from a balanced position in 2002 to a deficit
of 3 percent of GDP in 2005 and is estimated to have almost doubled to about 5.7 percent of
GDP in 2006. The deterioration reflects increases in capital expenditures, the wage bill, and
subsidies (2 percent of GDP in 2006) to the electricity company (SENELEC) and the oil refinery
(SAR) to compensate them for below-market prices for electricity and butane gas. For the first
time since 1995, domestic payments arrears of about 1 percent of GDP are estimated to have
emerged by end-2006.
The ratio of the Net Present Value (NPV) of public external debt to exports is estimated to have
fallen from 118 percent at end-2004 to about 55 percent at end-2006 owing to Enhanced
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC) and Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI)
debt relief. Central government domestic debt is estimated to have remained at about
3.5 percent of GDP at end-2006.
Poverty and social indicators have improved, but substantial efforts will be needed to meet the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The authorities have prepared a new Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper, covering 2006-10, which aims at accelerating progress toward
MDGs.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors observed that Senegal has achieved macroeconomic stability and debt
sustainability, and that progress has been made on poverty and social indicators.
Directors observed, nevertheless, that macroeconomic performance had weakened in 2006,
with lower growth, higher inflation, and widening fiscal and external current account deficits,
reflecting higher oil prices and financial difficulties of a major export company. They stressed
that renewed efforts at macroeconomic stabilization and deepening of structural reforms would
be critical to improve the economy’s resistance to shocks, address problems in budgetary
discipline and fiscal transparency, and move toward the Millennium Development Goals. In this
context, Directors urged speedy implementation of the authorities’ action plan for improving the
business environment and reducing the cost of doing business, which would be crucial for
enhancing growth prospects. More generally, Directors stressed that the authorities should use
the opportunity provided by debt relief under the HIPC Initiative and the MDRI to address
Senegal’s long-standing economic problems and further reduce poverty.

3
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to lower fiscal deficits over the medium term in
order to contain the external current account deficit and prevent debt distress and arrears. They
highlighted that reducing energy subsidies should be the main component of this policy,
supported by containment of the wage bill relative to GDP and limited increases in capital
outlays. Directors also urged prompt elimination of domestic payment arrears.
Emphasizing the need for a prudent borrowing policy to maintain debt sustainability, Directors
welcomed the authorities’ commitment to borrow exclusively on concessional terms in the postMDRI era. They encouraged close monitoring of the potential liabilities of the government,
including those stemming from activities of public agencies.
Directors welcomed the recent measures that allow energy prices to reflect market conditions
better, but encouraged further liberalization in the energy sector. They cautioned against the offbudget use of any resources generated by the new pricing mechanism for petroleum products.
The government should allow electricity prices to reflect market conditions, with adequate
safeguards for the low-income households, and should reduce official intervention in the energy
sector.
Directors called for early efforts to improve policy credibility and fiscal governance and
transparency, stressing that such improvements would be crucial for ensuring continued
international support to Senegal. To this end, they urged the authorities to rectify the breakdown
in procurement practices; strictly apply the new procurement code; avoid
off-budget use of public resources with the expansion of the fiscal framework to include the risks
posed by parastatals, public-private partnerships, and government guarantees; and ensure
transparency in the implementation of the new Dakar airport project.
Directors observed that the financial sector could make a greater contribution to the economy
through improved access to credit and enhanced soundness. The large nonperforming loans
and credit concentration in the banking system are potential sources of vulnerability, and these
weaknesses are exacerbated by the financial difficulties of the chemical export company.
Directors stressed the need for banks to make adequate provisions against potential losses
arising from the restructuring of this company. In addition, they urged the authorities to
accelerate planned judicial reforms to facilitate loan recovery and to discuss with the West
African Economic and Monetary Union authorities a possible increase in banks’ capital
adequacy ratio in view of the risks inherent in the Senegalese economy.
Directors recommended that the authorities rescind recent measures that reduce free trade and
hinder competition in the import sector. In particular, they urged the authorities to eliminate the
new tax protecting the import operations of the groundnut company as soon as possible.
Directors were of the view that the authorities’ second poverty reduction strategy paper provides
an adequate framework for poverty reduction in Senegal, and recommended that

4
implementation be vigorously pursued. They also emphasized the need to prioritize public
expenditure, improve its effectiveness through better investment planning and evaluation, and
involve the private sector in infrastructure projects, especially in view of the tight budgetary
conditions.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Laurean Rutayisire, Executive Director for Senegal
January 29, 2007
I would like to convey to Management and staff my authorities’ appreciation of the good
quality of the dialogue between the Fund and Senegal. After the expiry of its last Fundsupported program in April 2006, this Article IV consultation provides a good opportunity
for the Senegalese authorities to benefit from Fund candid advice and assessment of their
macroeconomic policies and reform agenda. As discussed below, the Senegalese economy
has been affected in 2006 by a number of shocks, including oil price increases and the
disruption in the operations of one of the largest exporting companies in the country. The
authorities are making their utmost efforts to mitigate the impact of these shocks, while
addressing increasing social needs, especially in the run-up to next month’s presidential
elections.
Recent Economic Developments
Over the past years macroeconomic performance in Senegal has been strong. During the
period 2003-05, real GDP growth averaged about 6 percent, average inflation was maintained
below 2 percent, and the overall fiscal deficit (including grants) amounted, on average, to
less than 3 percent of GDP. Throughout the same period, Senegal maintained a good track
record of implementation of sound macroeconomic and structural policies and pursued
prudent debt management policies, enabling Senegal to reach the completion point under the
Enhanced HIPC, and more recently to benefit from MDRI debt relief.
In 2006, my authorities have continued the implementation of their structural reform agenda
with a view to improving economic efficiency and maintaining fiscal and debt sustainability.
Owing to the authorities’ prudent debt management policies and MDRI debt relief, debt
indicators have strengthened further, with the ratio of the NPV of public external debt to
export amounting about 55 percent at the end of last year. Inflation is estimated to have been
slightly above 2 percent, in line with the convergence criterion on inflation defined by the
Convergence, Stability, Growth, and Solidarity Pact of the West African Economic and
Monetary Union (WAEMU). All other secondary convergence criteria set by the Pact were
also met, except that on external current account deficit.
However, macroeconomic performance was adversely affected by oil price increases and the
interruption in the operations of the Industries Chimiques du Sénégal (ICS), one of the
largest exporting companies in the country. On one hand, these higher oil prices partly
contributed to aggravating the numerous problems already facing the energy sector, fueling
energy subsidies to the electricity company (SENELEC) and the refinery company (SAR)
and exacerbating disruptions in supply of these companies’ products. On the other hand, ICS
faced epic difficulties that resulted in a significant scale-down of its operations, owing to
inadequate export pricing, depreciation of the US dollar relative to the euro-pegged CFA, and
weak management,. Given that this company accounted for 2 percent of GDP and 10 percent
of total exports at end-2005, the disruption in its operations contributed to the slowdown in
GDP growth and the significant deterioration of the external position.

2
Due to these adverse developments, real GDP growth is estimated to have declined in 2006
and the external current account deficit is estimated to have widened. Despite strong, higherthan-projected revenues, the fiscal deficit is also estimated to have deteriorated, largely as a
result of increases in subsidies mainly induced by the exogenous oil price shock. However,
the government has since taken measures to gradually reduce these subsidies.
Medium-Term Growth Prospects and Economic Outlook for 2007
In order to achieve the poverty reduction objectives set forth in Senegal’s second PRSP
(PRSP-II), my authorities are determined to achieve higher growth rates in the context of
macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability. It is their expectation that medium term
growth will range, on average, between 5 and 8 percent depending on the extent to which
additional resources expected for the implementation of the poverty reduction strategy set
forth in the PRSP-II are mobilized and absorbed. In the most optimistic scenario, the growth
rate is projected to reach the upper bound of this range, in line with the objective set by the
accelerated growth strategy (AGS). Based on their extensive consultations with domestic and
external stakeholders, my authorities expect that growth rates of this magnitude can be driven
by the promotion of domestic and foreign direct investment and sectors with high growth and
export potential. They plan to facilitate the achievement of such growth rates by continuing
the implementation of structural reforms aimed at creating a more market-oriented, private
sector-led economy. In this respect, they intend to pursue their efforts to improve the
business climate and reduce budgetary support to energy and electricity companies.
The economic outlook for 2007 continues to be favorable. In order to improve growth
prospects, my authorities intend to work on ensuring full recovery of ICS activities. They are
hopeful that their ongoing negotiations with potential ICS private partners will be
successfully concluded this year, which would help growth regain momentum. Meanwhile,
they have appointed a new management team tasked with running the company until new
strategic partners are found and the restructuring plan of the company finalized. The
government is still eager to reduce its 47 percent stake in the company upon entry of new
private partners.
It is also my authorities’ intention to take action to improve the potential of the agricultural
sector whose contribution to growth is projected to be higher in 2007. The dynamism of the
services sectors, including tourism, telecommunication, construction, and transportation is
expected to boost growth. Growth will be also expected to be driven by higher exports
resulting from the resumption of ICS and SAR productive activities that should be facilitated
by my authorities’ efforts to restructure ICS and better adapt the price-setting formula for
petroleum products to market conditions.
Fiscal Policy, Transparency and Governance
As noted by staff, the Senegalese authorities agreed that a 4 percent fiscal deficit will be
appropriate in 2007. In light of the latest available estimates, my authorities are hopeful that
the projected fiscal deficit for 2007 will be about 4.3 percent of GDP in line with staff’s
projection, instead of 5.5 percent as previously suggested by their draft fiscal program. My

authorities have already taken steps that make them hopeful that this objective will be
achieved. These steps include but are not limited to the gradual phase-out of gas butane
subsidies, the projected salary freeze in the civil service, and the expected, higher frequency
in adjustments of the electricity price-setting formula to better reflect market conditions. My
authorities intend to keep the ratio of the wage bill to GDP constant in 2007, and they are
contemplating no salary increase in the public sector. On the revenue side, they plan to
continue their efforts to strengthen and modernize tax administration, notably through the
installation of an information-sharing system between the main agencies responsible for tax
collection. The achievement of this fiscal objective set for 2007 will be consistent with the
authorities’ commitment to preserve debt sustainability. My authorities will also continue to
abide by their commitment to borrow only at concessional terms.
My authorities are fully aware of the need to strengthen fiscal governance and transparency.
In order to improve fiscal transparency and reporting, budgetary and public financial
management, and public procurement, they are implementing many reforms based on the
World Bank’s Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) and the review of
Country Procurement Practices (CPAR), the Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability Assessment (PEFA), and WAEMU guidelines. They have institutionalized all
WAEMU requirements on budget classification, fiscal reporting, and public accounting. My
authorities have decided to postpone discussions on the proposed three-year public financial
management plan until the completion of the PEFA. As they are already implementing many
fiscal reform programs, they want to subject any additional reform to their implementation
capacity and are concerned about the sequencing of these various reforms and the
consistency between ongoing reform programs.
With regard to the airport project, my authorities reiterate their commitment to ensuring
transparency in the implementation of the new airport project. The revenue generated by the
airport tax is being collected and held by the International Air Transport Association (IATA)
and is not being used yet. In addition, IATA is sending regular reports to the authorities on
the amount of revenue that is collected. The project has been submitted to, and fully endorsed
by the National Assembly and the Infrastructure Council. The government was encouraged to
carry the project forward after committing before the Parliament to ensuring full transparency
in the conduct of the project.
In order to increase fiscal transparency, it is my authorities’ intention to closely monitor the
activities of the agency in charge of the preparation of the Islamic Conference Organization.
Regarding staff’s concern about the diversion to this agency from other budgetary lines, my
authorities note that such practice can be undertaken in full compliance with existing fiscal
rules and guidelines. Other actions signaling the authorities’ commitment to transparency
include the submission of the 2006 supplementary budget to the National Assembly and
continued audit of SENELEC’s accounts by an international audit company and the
publication of its annual reports.
Given my authorities’ efforts to strengthen fiscal governance and transparency, staff’s
suggestion that improvement in fiscal governance and transparency will help sustain external
assistance can possibly send adverse signals that reported shortfalls and disbursement delays

4
in donor assistance are due to weak fiscal governance and transparency. In fact, it is my
authorities’ view that the absence of a Fund-supported program had sent a negative signal to
development partners about the commitment of the Senegalese authorities to embark on a
new program relationship with the Fund. This signal coupled with the imminence of the
upcoming elections motivated a wait-and-see attitude on the part of these partners, translating
into shortfalls and disbursement delays in donor assistance
Energy Sector
My authorities are fully aware of the need to reduce budget transfers to the electricity
company and butane gas subsidies. To this end, they have taken some measures aimed at
addressing the difficulties facing SENELEC, including a 15 percent increase in electricity
tariffs in September 2006. Work is also being undertaken by the regulatory commission,
Commission de Régulation du Secteur de l’Énergie, to ensure more frequent revisions of the
formula so as to enable a prompter adjustment in electricity tariffs and shorten delays in
payments of government compensation for the company’s losses. This work is also aimed at
revising the price-setting formula for electricity prices, with a view to better reflecting fuel
costs borne by SENELEC in electricity production. Over the coming years, the authorities, in
collaboration with the World Bank, envisage to increase SENELEC’s production capacity
and reduce its operating costs.
At the same time, my authorities have taken steps to reduce the budgetary impact of
government compensation to the refinery company. They have translated into actions their
strong commitment to gradually phasing out butane gas subsidies. Since August 2006,
subsidies on butane gas have been drastically reduced and it is the authorities’ intention to
continue these subsidies’ cuts until completely phasing them out by end-2007. Furthermore,
the authorities have proceeded to the revision of the price-setting formula for petroleum
products with a view to making this formula more sensitive to market developments.
Financial Sector and Competitiveness
My authorities welcome staff’s advice on ways by which the contribution of the financial
sector to the economy could be increase. This advice will particularly useful to the ongoing
efforts made by the authorities to preserve the soundness of the banking system and enhance
credit availability, especially among the poor. How best monetary policy can help achieve
these objectives is under the competency of regional monetary authorities; but, whenever
necessary, my authorities will draw their attention to any issues that call to actions in this
area, as was recently the case with the issue related to banks’ capital adequacy ratio.
My authorities share the concerns about the adverse impact of ICS crisis on bank soundness.
But they are also concerned about the need to ensure a fair distribution of risks caused by
ICS bankruptcy. In the absence of the government guarantee of ICS debt the adverse impact
of the ICS crisis on bank soundness would have been worse. This guarantee which covers a
large part, but not all, of ICS’ debt to banks was actually meant to minimize this adverse
impact. While the authorities recognized that such guarantee may impact on fiscal risks, they
took this last resort measure, concerned that, without this guarantee, the health of the banking

5
system would have been seriously affected by the potential bankruptcy of many small banks
to which ICS is indebted. It is also important to note this guarantee will expire once the ICS
restructuring plan is completed.
We note the results of the analysis presented in the Selected Issues paper which indicate that
competitiveness measured by unit labor costs- and CPI-based REER has declined between
1994 and 2004, although the ex-post assessment report for Senegal which was carried out for
this same period indicates that competitiveness actually improved. As this Chair has
repeatedly stated, exchange rate is a regional issue and in order to improve competitiveness
my authorities are committed to implementing other measures which are under their control,
including structural reforms.
In concluding, I would like to reiterate my authorities’ intention to maintain close
relationships with the Fund, which would enable them to reach agreement with staff on a
successor arrangement after the upcoming elections.
