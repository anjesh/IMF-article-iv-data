STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Macroeconomic situation: Recent performance has been strong, but risks are rising.
Agriculture, services, and remittances strengthened growth and the external accounts in
2011/12. Inflation moderated year-on-year, but is again on the rise. External risks—
particularly India’s slowdown—will pose challenges in 2012/13. Strong remittances and
accommodative monetary policy have eliminated last year’s liquidity crunch and
facilitated modest improvement in some financial sector indicators. However, risks
remain elevated from exposure to a post-boom real estate sector, and may be higher in
smaller financial institutions.
Medium-term prospects: Medium-term prospects remain clouded by political
uncertainty, low levels of investment, and dependence on remittances. Higher growth
and progress in poverty reduction could be enabled by political consensus, policy
stability, an easier labor environment, and higher utilization of external support.
Political situation: The constituent assembly (CA) was dissolved after failing to meet an
end-May deadline for a new constitution. A new consensus government will likely be
formed, followed by CA elections in April 2013. Political delays are complicating
macroeconomic management. A full-year budget for 2012/13 has yet to be passed.
Policy recommendations: On the fiscal side, a full budget for 2012/13 consistent with
macroeconomic and debt sustainability should be passed by presidential ordinance as
soon as possible, supported by public financial management reforms to ensure full
execution of the capital budget. Given the rise in non-food inflation and divergence of
interest rates vis-à-vis India, monetary policy should be tightened. An acceleration of
financial sector reform is warranted, with a focus on those institutions likely to be most
affected by exposure to the real estate sector.
Exchange rate regime: Nepal maintains a peg with the Indian rupee. Nepal has
accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. Nepal maintains an
exchange restriction under Article VIII, arising due to the limit of 75 percent placed by
the Industrial Enterprise Act on conversion and transfer to foreign currency of salaries on
non-residents from countries where convertible currencies circulate.

CONTEXT
1.
Nepal is a post-conflict state seeking to formalize democracy in a challenging
environment. Significant headway toward a new state has been made since the 2006 peace accord.
Progress on a range of technical issues (including public financial management, monetary policy,
and financial sector supervision) has also been achieved. However, the failure of the constituent
assembly to meet an end-May 2012 deadline to ratify a new constitution is a serious setback, and a
major impediment to macroeconomic management and prospects for growth. The subsequent
dismissal of the constituent assembly in June 2012 has left day-to-day operations in the hands of a
caretaker government. New elections are notionally slated for April 2013, but will require fractured
political parties to agree on an interim consensus government. In the meantime, key articles of
legislation (such as the government budget) have been delayed. More broadly, the lack of a
consensus government and functioning parliament appear to be dampening investment (foreign
and domestic), keeping potential donor support at bay, and undermining prospects for sensitive
financial sector and state enterprise reforms.
2.
The political transition and a gradual approach to reform in some areas appear to have
come at some macroeconomic cost. Real GDP growth has slowed from an average of 5 percent
over 1990–2000 to around 4 percent over 2001–2012. Concurrently, the share of industry in GDP has
fallen by nearly 5 percentage points—with most of the decline in the manufacturing sector. In the
meantime, services have grown, and now account for nearly 50 percent of total real GDP, with the
remainder in agriculture. Progress has been made on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs),
but an important adjunct to reform efforts in social services has been the rise in inward
remittances—which has also fueled some of the growth in the services sector. While there are some
benefits from emigration and remittances (knowledge transfer and higher household incomes) the
scale of remittances—doubling since 2001 to almost one-quarter of GDP—also represents a source
of vulnerability in times of external shocks.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
3.
Growth accelerated while average inflation declined. Real GDP growth rose to
4.6 percent in 2011/12 compared with 3.9 percent in 2010/11. A timely monsoon boosted
agricultural output, while the services sector benefitted from robust growth in remittances. Industrial
sector performance remained lackluster, however, largely reflecting a sharp drop in construction
activity following the sharp drop in real estate prices. Average inflation declined to 8.3 percent, due
largely to lower food prices. However, non-food and core inflation remained persistently high
throughout the year—hovering around 9 percent on average. Rising non-food prices appear to have
been driven by multiple increases in administered fuel prices, exchange-rate depreciation, and rising
wages and salaries.
4.
The overall budget deficit was less than expected. Revenue gains were notable,
particularly in the second half of the year as tax administration reforms bore fruit. Customs, VAT, and
income tax all exceeded budget targets. An early surge in current spending was contained through
austerity measures, while capital spending continued to underperform the budgeted level due to
capacity constraints.1 Disbursement of foreign aid was similarly lower than budgeted, mirroring the
performance of recent years and reflecting lower-than-anticipated implementation of capital
projects. Finally, while the official fiscal deficit was modest, quasi-fiscal liabilities continued to rise
through ongoing financial losses at the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) and the Nepal Oil
Corporation (NOC) 2—the latter financed by borrowing from public pension schemes.3

Over-performance relative to the budget was due mainly to a small over-performance in revenue (0.2 percent of
GDP more than projected in tax and non-tax revenues), combined with a shortfall of 1.3 percent of GDP in current
spending (mainly goods, services, and operations and maintenance), lower-than-budgeted capital expenditure
(2 percent of GDP less than expected)—offset by lower grant disbursements. Staff estimates the 2011/12 capital
budget execution at about 73 percent, compared with 81 percent in 2010/11.

NOC and NEA incurred losses of Nrs 13 billion (0.8 percent of GDP) and Nrs 6 billion (0.4 percent of GDP) in
2011/12, respectively. NOC’s debts stand at Nrs 27 billion (1.7 percent of GDP), including Nrs 10 billion owed to the
government, and Nrs 10 billion borrowed from pension funds with a government guarantee. The NOC has stopped
servicing the loans owed to the government and the pension funds, and requested to write off these debts. NEA’s
debts stand at Nrs 61 billion (3.9 percent of GDP), which is owed to the government and not serviced.

The pension schemes include the Provident Fund and Citizen Investment Trust, both backed by government
guarantees.

The balance of payments ended the fiscal year with a record surplus. The trade balance
remained flat as a share of GDP in 2011/12, reflecting modest export growth and weaker-than
expected imports (possibly tied to the slowdown in the construction sector and lower demand for
imported building supplies). Remittances were unexpectedly strong—rising by nearly 25 percent
year-on-year to a level equivalent to about 23 percent of GDP. As a result, the external current
account shifted to a sizeable surplus—facilitating an increase in Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) foreign
exchange reserves to $4.3 billion (6.8 months of imports). The real effective exchange rate
depreciated by 4.6 percent, in line with the decline of the Indian rupee (Box 1).

Application of select methodologies suggests the
NR is modestly overvalued, albeit less than last
year’s assessment. The macroeconomic balance
(MB) approach suggests an overvaluation of
9 percent (compared to 14 percent in the previous
assessment), and the external sustainability (ES)
approach shows an overvaluation of around
11 percent (compared to a previous assessment of
20 percent), largely due to the smaller projected
current account deficit in the medium term.4The
PPP approach shows a decline in overvaluation
from 19 to 16 percent—with due caveats on the
difficulty in estimating equilibrium PPP rates.
Overvaluation resonates with Nepal’s small
export base and large trade gap. On the other
hand, the NRB has accumulated reserves of six
months of import cover, the balance of payments is
in record surplus, and interventions to support the
peg are few.

6.
Monetary policy was largely passive in 2011/12, signaling support for balance sheets
and private credit. The influx of remittances was only partly sterilized, and the growth in net foreign
assets contributed to reserve and broad money growth of 36.4 and 22.7 percent, respectively—well
above nominal GDP growth of 14 percent. Excess reserves (held as non-remunerated deposits at the
NRB) climbed, and interest rate spreads vis-à-vis India widened considerably. Despite ample

These results should be interpreted with caution, due to data limitations and variation in norms across
methodologies. The MB approach yields a norm of ½ percent of GDP, while the ES norm is 1¼ percent of GDP.

banks’ funding costs, allowing for some recovery in interest-based profits. However, the level of
profitability remains low overall, reflecting weak credit growth and a prolonged slump in the real
estate market. Given the magnitude of the real estate decline, a higher NPL ratio might have been
expected, raising some doubts as to reported data.

The outlook for 2012/13 is challenging. Growth is projected to decline to 3.8 percent for
2012/13. A weaker monsoon may lower agricultural production, while continued political
uncertainty, a delayed budget, and potentially weak private sector credit will likely inhibit both
investment and consumption. Externally, outflows of migrant workers appear to have peaked.
Combined with a softening global outlook, this suggests that remittance growth will slow, and in
turn dampen some service sector activities and reduce the current account surplus in the coming

year.7 India’s slowdown—which increasingly appears to be a medium-term phenomenon driven by
declining domestic investment—will negatively impact Nepal via lower export demand, weaker
inward investment, and possibly through the remittances channel. Inflation is also projected to rise,
in line with developments in India in the coming months.
9.
Medium-term prospects hinge on reaching a political consensus that would serve as a
base for reform and facilitate higher levels of confidence and investment. Nepal has significant
potential in services, hydroelectric power generation, and basic manufacturing, but a stable policy
regime backed by sound macroeconomic policies and continued reforms to the investment
environment are needed. Current macroeconomic projections (Tables 1–4) are based on the status
quo—incorporating only modest improvements to growth and investment.

MANAGING DOWNSIDE MACROECONOMIC RISKS
The past year has provided breathing space, but macroeconomic and financial pressures are once
again on the rise. Spillover effects from a slowing Indian economy, combined with the dampening
effect of continued political impasse will likely dampen growth. Inflation pressures are also likely to rise
in the coming months. Continued fiscal prudence, more effective use of budgetary and donor
resources, and a tighter monetary policy are warranted to maintain stability.

A. Fiscal Policy and Public Financial Management
10.
Continued fiscal prudence is needed to maintain fiscal and external sustainability8 over
the medium-term. Given potentially large quasi-fiscal liabilities in the SOE and financial sectors, the
baseline fiscal strategy should aim to keep public debt roughly constant as a share of GDP—
implying annual net domestic financing of about 2 percent of GDP. Once key vulnerabilities are
addressed (and their fiscal cost assessed), there may be room to moderately increase borrowing to
finance key investment and social protection schemes. Scaling up should be done only if the
schemes are well designed, however, and implemented on the basis of continued improvements in
public financial management.
11.
The near-term priority is to pass a full-year budget. Delays in passing a full-year budget
could further damage business confidence, lead to under-execution of key capital projects, and
create additional pressure on the banking system. Recent experience (the 2010/11 budget was
passed seven months late, resulting in significant under-spending on capital projects) highlights this
risk. Line ministries are reluctant to undertake expenditures in the absence of a full and approved
7

Growth in outgoing workers slowed to 8 percent in 2011/12, and the growth rate of remittances in 2012/13 is thus
expected to moderate. Import growth fell sharply last year, but is expected to normalize in relation to remittances
(there is also a strong lagged relationship between import growth and remittances, which suggests a recovery in
imports in 2012/13). In addition, given the interest rate gap vis-à-vis India, there is a risk of capital flight (including
through unrecorded channels), which is reflected in reversal of other investments (net) on the financial account.

budget. In addition to under-spending, delays also appear to exaggerate a tendency toward
bunching of expenditures near the end of the year, complicating liquidity and macroeconomic
management. A late-year rush to spend can also adversely affect the quality of public expenditures.
In line with medium-term fiscal objectives, an overall deficit consistent with a net domestic financing
of no more than 2 percent of GDP is needed. Near term measures to support these goals include:

Bolstering revenues through continued tax and customs administration. The three-year
reform plan and the five-year strategic plan by the Internal Revenue Department (IRD) are
welcome, as is the initiative to update the 2009/13 reform plan by the Department of Customs
(DOC) in line with IMF TA.



Collecting arrears and reducing non-compliance. Further action is needed to collect arrears
identified in the recently completed fraud investigation (Nrs 6.5 billion), and tax arrears (Nrs 29
billion). The large share of non-filers (22 percent for VAT, 56 percent for income tax) indicates a
need to improve compliance management.



Using the Treasury Single Account to improve budget execution and management. With
the TSA covering 95 percent of revenue and expenditure transactions, closer monitoring and
more frequent adjustment is possible. The staff recommends publication of monthly financial
statements and regular reviews of budget execution.

Box 2. Nepal: Potential Spillover Risks
The slowdown in India and increasing global risks raise the specter of spillover effects on Nepal. Other
risks include a slowdown or loss of confidence feeding through the financial sector.
Key channels through which negative external developments might spill over to Nepal include:



Trade. India is Nepal’s dominant trade partner—accounting for 67 percent of Nepal’s exports
and 65 percent of imports in 2011/12, up about 20 percentage points from a decade ago.



Remittances. Remittances are the main source of Nepal’s foreign exchange receipts, equivalent
to about ¼ of GDP. GCC countries, Malaysia, and India are the main hosts of Nepalese migrant
workers.



Financial linkages. FDI and cross-border lending may also be a conduit for India-related shocks.
Reports indicate extensive involvement or interest of Indian investors in key hydroelectric
projects. Most of Nepal’s financial flows (a surplus of about 1½ percent of GDP in 2011/12) take
the form of trade credit and therefore are likely to be associated with India.



Confidence shocks—inspired by India or other events—could trigger capital flight as seen in
2009–10, possibly forming a feedback loop between external sector deterioration and escalating
banking sector risks.

Macroeconomic simulations highlight the potential
spillover effects of three scenarios: (i) a further
India
Nepal
decline in India’s growth; (ii) slowing remittances
against the backdrop of increasing global uncertainty;
10
and (iii) a major banking sector stress (potentially
triggered by external shocks) stemming from
5
preexisting financial sector fragilities. Although India’s
slowdown is the main (i.e., most likely) downside risk,
0
the three episodes are potentially additive as elevated
global uncertainty could trigger decline of remittances,
-5
and external shocks could be amplified by
vulnerabilities in the financial sector. The simulations
indicate external shocks represent substantial risks, and could cause a visible output loss, a rapid decline
of foreign exchange reserves, and a moderate increase in public debt. Financial sector distress would
instead result in a large output loss over the medium term and substantial rescue costs incurred to the
public sector, ultimately leading to unsustainable debt. (See Appendix I for details).

Over the medium-term, continued progress needs to be made on increasing the
government’s ability to implement the budget (particularly capital expenditures), effectively utilize
donor resources, and eliminate quasi-fiscal liabilities. Important steps in this regard could include:


Simplifying the budget release process for capital spending. The requirement for the
National Planning Commission (NPC) to assess high priority projects after budget approval
could be eliminated. Instead, information regarding performance benchmarks (currently
addressed through the NPC’s post-budget approval assessment) would be included in budget
submissions and endorsed by NPC prior to formal budget approval.



Implementing an automatic adjustment mechanism for fuel prices, and handling interim
losses through the budget. Fuel prices should be increased gradually to levels at least
consistent with cost recovery, followed by an automatic price adjustment as the final objective9.
NOC’s interim financial losses should be accommodated within the 2012/13 budget (with a
supplemental budget later in the year). NOC’s outstanding debts/arrears should be cleared,
conditional on an audit of past claims and a strategy to prevent accumulation of new arrears.



Strengthening the on-budget pension system. The current public (on-budget) pension
scheme is defined benefits only. Funding for this scheme needs to be secured (for example, by
government employee contributions), the coverage streamlined, and an actuarial analysis
undertaken.

Authorities’ Views
13.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s recommendations, and highlighted in
particular the need to pass a full-year government budget. They noted the urgency of providing
line ministries with a full-year allocation for expenditures, and with the need to target net domestic
financing of no more than 2 percent of GDP. A full-year budget has been prepared10, and the MOF is
actively seeking support to pass this budget by presidential ordinance before the end of November.
They expressed optimism that continued gains in VAT, income tax, and customs collection could be
made, and highlighted the need for continued reforms at IRD and DOC, the importance of targeted
incentive schemes at these agencies, and further technical assistance from the Fund. The authorities
also concurred on the need for an automatic pricing mechanism for fuels, but noted that such
decisions required a careful political consensus and supporting measures for public welfare. Future
pension liabilities were also a shared concern. The authorities noted that an employee contribution
system had been initiated in 2006, but was terminated in 2009 after public protest.

9

A move to market cost would need to be accompanied by measures to protect the poor. There is not currently in
place the administrative architecture needed to enact a direct cash transfer system.
10

The draft full-year budget was not shared with the mission. However, the major spending and financing elements
were discussed, and these are reflected in the projections for 2012/13 in Table 2.

B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
14.
Accommodative monetary policy in 2011/12 allowed banks additional space to rebuild
profitability, but inflation and exchange risks are on the rise—suggesting the need to tighten.
Weak credit demand and the overhang of banks’ excess reserves at the NRB suggest that, while
money growth was excessive, upward pressure on prices from monetary policy was moderate.
Rather, the bulk of inflation stemmed from factors noted earlier (administered prices, higher import
prices through exchange rate depreciation, and the effect of wage and salary increases). However,
prices have continued to climb since the end of the fiscal year, with headline inflation reaching just
under 12 percent, year-on-year, in August—the ninth consecutive year-on-year increase. Real
interest rates have been negative for over a year, and the wedge between domestic and India’s onemonth interbank rate has widened to almost 900 basis points on a sustained basis—suggesting a
powerful financial incentive for capital flight, and a risk to the exchange rate peg. The NRB shifted
policy in July 2012, signaling its intent to bring broad money growth to 15 percent in the coming
year, consistent with a targeted average inflation rate of 7.5 percent.11

The exchange rate peg has served as a pillar of stability, and although quantitative
estimates suggest some overvaluation, the rupee does not appear fundamentally misaligned.
The peg continues to provide a widely visible nominal anchor and support macroeconomic stability.
Adjusting the peg may curb imports, but (depending on accompanying monetary and fiscal policy
adjustments) could also stoke inflation. More meaningful adjustment is likely through structural
reforms to address a weak business climate—particularly infrastructure and labor relations. However,
the peg also complicates macroeconomic management in times of external shocks, by limiting room
for adjustment. In this context, consideration should be given to exit options should external shocks
bring unsustainable pressures on the external accounts. There is some evidence that while fixed

Reserve requirements were raised in July (one percentage point for commercial banks and a half percentage point
for development banks), and NRB reverse repurchase operations have absorbed some NR 8.5 billion between July
and September 2012. More frequent open market operations, would serve to mop up excess liquidity,

regimes better control inflation, flexibility can be growth promoting, and help cope with real shocks
better than a fixed rate regime.12

Authorities’ Views
16.
The authorities concurred that monetary policy had been relatively loose in the past
year, and that tightening was needed. They argued that from a macroprudential point of view, it
had been important to provide banks with room to recover from the sharp downturn in real estate
prices. They also saw inflation developments as being largely driven by external factors, supply
bottlenecks (particularly the effect of strikes on movement of food products), and exchange-rate
induced changes in import prices. However, they agreed that with prices already rising and the
inflation already high in India, monetary tightening was needed. They noted that the interest rate
wedge vis-à-vis India was a concern, and that it was important to reassert support for the exchange
rate peg, which continues to serve Nepal well as a clear and widely accepted anchor.

ADDRESSING FINANCIAL SECTOR RISKS
The influx of remittances eliminated the 2010/11 liquidity squeeze that pressured banks’ balance
sheets, and accommodative monetary policy and gradual financial sector reform have allowed some
improvement in financial soundness indicators. However, risks should not be underestimated. It is
unclear whether the real estate market has bottomed out. Further, little is yet understood about the
inter-connectedness of financial institutions and contagion risk. Underlying balance sheet weaknesses
related to real estate exposure remain—particularly in smaller institutions. A targeted acceleration of
ongoing reforms, combined with a medium-term strategy for consolidation is warranted.
17.
Reported financial sector indicators (Class A banks only) show modest improvement,
but the sharp decline in real estate prices since 2009 continues to pose risks. Direct exposure to
real estate remains above 10 percent of total assets for all classes of banks, and higher still among
smaller financial institutions. Moreover, indirect exposure through collateral is nearly two-thirds of
total assets. Though official data are lacking, real estate prices are said to have declined by
30 percent or more off their peak, which may have significantly damaged banks’ balance sheets but
is not being reflected in reported NPLs. This raises concerns about the quality and integrity of
reported data, and possible ever-greening of loans.13 Balance sheet risks may therefore be
substantially higher than suggested by reported data.

12

Occasional Paper #270, Exchange Rate Regimes and the Stability of the International Monetary System.

13

An additional factor weakening the reliability of reported data is the relative strength of supervisory resources.
With over 200 financial institutions under its purview, the NRB is stretched to adequately monitor the financial
system. Each supervisory department has only about 40 personnel. For development banks, on-site inspections tend
to cover the top 20–30 borrowers. For commercial banks coverage of their loan assessment is around two percent,
which is comparatively low.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NEPAL

18.
The NRB has taken a gradual approach to financial sector reform. Some forbearance
measures to address the fall in real estate and capital market are still in place. These include easing
conditions for restructuring real estate and margin loans, increasing the loan-to-value ratio ceiling
for loans against promoter shares, and postponement of a reduction in the limit on real estate
sector loans to 25 percent of total loans. On the other hand, efforts have been made to strengthen
regulation and supervision, and to facilitate mergers and credit diversification. Specifically:


Minimum capital adequacy will be strengthened by introducing a 1 percent capital buffer.
Some Basel III elements—including 4.5 percent common equity Tier 1—are also under
consideration.



An amended NRB Act—allowing for swift resolution of problem banks—is in the final stages of
drafting by the NRB and will be submitted to the government. Nonetheless, in the absence of a
constituent assembly it is unclear when this legislation could go into effect.



The prompt corrective action framework is being broadened to include liquidity and nonperforming asset ratio triggers. Stress test guidelines were issued as well as guidelines on
Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP).



A single department supervising both class-B and C banks was split into two dedicated
departments14. On-site inspection practices have improved in line with IMF recommendations.
Macroprudential monitoring has been strengthened by creation of a Financial Stability Unit in
the NRB, which will create semi-annual financial stability reports.



The government injected capital (as part of the partial 2012/13 budget) into the two insolvent
state-owned commercial banks that would partially cover their capital deficiency.15



The NRB introduced a requirement that banks extend at least 10 percent of total credit to
the agriculture and/or energy sector. Work is also proceeding on establishment of a base
(minimum) lending rate for banks, based on cost of funds.



A moratorium on licensing new commercial banks, development banks and finance
companies will be continued for another year. To encourage mergers, regulatory forbearance
and tax incentives have been extended.16

14

Class B banks are “development banks” and Class C banks are “financial companies”. They have broadly similar
operations as Class A banks (commercial banks) but are generally smaller in scale.

15

According to latest available data (June 2012), Nepal Bank Limited and Rastriya Banijya Bank have net negative
capital of NR 4.4 billion and NR 8.7 billion, respectively. The government recently injected NR 1.4 billion via
subscription to a rights issue in NBL, and NR 4.3 billion in RBB. NBL and RBB are 45.5 percent and 100 percent
government owned, respectively.

16

Since May 2011, 40 out of nearly 200 financial institutions have approached NRB for approval to merge, of which
19 cases have been approved.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NEPAL

19.
Recent efforts to bolster supervision and regulation are welcome, but there is a need
for a targeted, well sequenced acceleration of financial sector reform. The influx of liquidity via
remittances has bought time, and allowed banks to accumulate a liquidity cushion, but potentially
serious balance sheet and other vulnerabilities remain. Real estate exposure remains the primary
risk. However, the lack of clarity on the interconnectedness of banks is another source of concern as
some banks are reported to share the same promoters (initial capital contributors). Given the widespread practice of providing loans to promoters with banks’ shares as collateral, there is a risk that
problems in one bank may cause contagion in the system. The current gradual approach runs the
risk of a disorderly adjustment in the financial sector, which could be magnified by banks’ interlinkages. Reforms should proceed with a short- and medium-term vision for increasing financial
sector safety and soundness. In the near-term:


Amendment of the NRB Act should be completed as soon as possible to strengthen the
NRB’s powers to swiftly resolve banks. Enactment of a modified Deposit Guarantee Act to
expedite the repayment process is also a priority. These two actions provide the necessary preconditions to decisively address problem banks.



Planned diagnostic reviews with World Bank and DFID assistance need to be “deep dive”,
with decisive follow-up to deal with problematic banks, including resolution in case of nonviable banks. Mergers may be an option to resolve viable banks, but should not be used as an
excuse for less-than-optimal restructuring and recapitalization. Thorough post-merger
assessments should be conducted to assess the viability and effectiveness of the merger.



Supervision should continue to be strengthened, and the new PCA framework needs to be
implemented. Transition to IFRS-based accounting standards for loan classification and
provisioning should also proceed as planned. Supervisory resources need to be increased and
new staff trained to provide sufficient resources for broader and deeper on-site inspection as
well as managing bank resolutions.



NRB should avoid directed credit policies. Cross country experience suggests that—in the
absence of bank capacity to adequately assess credit risk in targeted sectors—directed lending
can decrease bank efficiency and undermine bank soundness.17 At a minimum, targets for
specific sectors should only be indicative.

20.
Over the medium term, a comprehensive review of financial sector policies should be
considered. To this end, the liberal licensing policy that has resulted in a large number of banks
needs review, even as the current moratorium on licensing is maintained. The current legal
framework, with three categories of financial institutions without clear differences in their scope of

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NEPAL

business, also needs review. Supervisory resources should be increased. A possible roadmap is
presented in Table 6. However, an FSAP could be useful in setting priorities.

Authorities’ Views
21.
The authorities emphasized that the gradual approach to financial sector reform was
deliberate, but that action would be taken as needed to ensure financial system stability.
Legislative reform to strengthen the NRB’s resolution powers is recognized as a key priority in
accelerating efforts to address weak banks. Work on amendments to the NRB Act is in an advanced
stage, and will be delivered to the Government in October 2012. However, lack of a parliament is
viewed as a setback, and the authorities are hesitant to implement amendments to the NRB Act and
other financial sector legislation via presidential ordinance. The quality of data reporting is
recognized as a problem. The authorities are more confident about Class A Banks, but the NRB is
pushing for more frequent on-site examinations among Class B and C banks, as well as requiring
daily liquidity reporting. The authorities expressed interest in an FSAP.
22.
The authorities view a minimum level of credit to ‘productive sectors’ as a useful
policy. They argued that diversification of bank credit is justified on the grounds that lending to
agriculture and the power sector will support growth in these important sectors and also help
diversify banks’ portfolios, which are too highly exposed to real estate. Moreover, the 10 percent
requirement is broadly defined to include project finance, insurance, and refinance. Work is also
underway to support directed lending with credit insurance, though further development of microinsurance for agricultural credit would be useful. In the energy sector, risks are perceived to be
already contained via power purchase agreements.

Discussions continued on the potential for closer engagement with the Fund, including
through an ECF or other program. The authorities continued to express interest in a program, noting
the potential benefits for advancing the reform agenda, catalyzing donor support, and providing
another anchor of stability in an uncertain environment. However, they noted that, in the absence of
a consensus government and constituent assembly, the risks to program performance would be
high. Given the absence of an urgent balance of payments need, they suggested that further time
be given to come to a political situation conducive to a consistent policy framework and ambitious
reform agenda. In the interim, they expressed interest in continued coordination on policy advice
and technical assistance, and emphasized that the dialogue on a potential program be kept open.
24.
Investment and trade policies remain open, but significant impediments remain. The
current government has continued a liberal trade and investment policies. A number of significant
sectors, including hydropower, have been opened to foreign investment and ownership. The
government has dedicated 2012/13 to be an “investment year”, and recently created an Investment
Board to coordinate domestic and foreign investors. The Board will focus on large investment
projects worth more than Rs 10 billion (USD 130 million) and certain key sectors, and could help cut
through bureaucratic delays and improve interagency coordination. Despite these positive steps,
political instability, labor unrest, bureaucratic delays and inefficiencies, perceived corruption, and
perennial power shortages create an uncertain environment for foreign and private investment.

Nepal’s last anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism
(AML/CFT) assessment in September 2010 revealed serious deficiencies. This led the Financial
Action Task Force’s International Cooperation Review Group to agree on an action plan with Nepal
to improve its compliance with the international AML/CFT standard—which is being supported
through IMF technical assistance. This TA resulted in the adoption of an AML/CFT National Strategy

in 2011. Current assistance focuses on drafting amendments to the AML/CFT law, developing the
capacity of the financial intelligence unit, and creating a risk-based tool for offsite supervision.

STAFF APPRAISAL
26.
Economic outturns for the past year have been favorable, and progress on a range of
structural reforms has been achieved in a difficult political environment. On the fiscal side,
maintaining spending discipline, bolstering revenues, and completing reforms to public financial
management (including implementation of a Treasury Single Account (TSA) during a political
transition are notable achievements. Monetary policy was accommodative, but reflected a conscious
decision to reduce pressure on balance sheets, and does not appear to have fueled inflation or put
immediate pressure on the exchange rate peg. Financial sector reform has progressed, albeit
gradually, and financial sector indicators show some modest improvement.
27.
Most signs point to a more difficult year in 2012/13. On the domestic side, the continued
political impasse will continue to have a dampening effect on investment and consumption. A late
monsoon is likely to lower agricultural output, and negative spillover effects from India’s slowdown
will also exert some negative pressure on Nepal over the coming year. The potential for lower
remittances—which provided respite to fragile financial sector balance sheets and boosted services
activity—also looms as a chronic risk.
28.
Room for counter-cyclical macroeconomic policies is limited, and efforts should focus
on more effective budget implementation. Further delays in enacting a full-year budget will
complicate macroeconomic management and add to downside risks. The mission urges the
authorities to move as quickly as possible to pass a full 2012/13 budget by ordinance, and to follow
up with line ministries on month-to-month execution of spending plans. To maintain fiscal and debt
sustainability, the budget should be consistent with net domestic financing of no more than
2 percent of GDP, and set a suitably ambitious target for investment spending. The draft full-year
budget appears to be in line with this advice. However, achieving these objectives will require
continued progress on tax and customs reform, as well as efforts to utilize the TSA as a tool for
increasing the transparency of public financial management and highlighting areas where budget
implementation may be weak.

Fiscal policy has generally been prudent and medium-term sustainability hinges more
on maintaining space to deal with quasi-fiscal liabilities in state enterprises, public pension
schemes, and potentially the financial sector. Nepal does not have a history of fiscal profligacy.
However, losses at the NOC and NEA represent a current and future drain on public resources—
including a large stock of outstanding arrears. The current public pension scheme, while not
currently in arrears, is growing in cost and is without an independent source of funding—suggesting
a steadily increasing need for budgetary resources in the years ahead. Restructuring and reform of
NEA needs to proceed quickly, and an automatic adjustment mechanism for fuel prices is a
necessary first step in bringing NOC to a cost-recovery basis. Complementary actions to protect the
most vulnerable could be key in forging a political consensus around these reforms, and Fund

technical assistance could prove useful in this regard. Similarly, a review of the public pension
scheme, supported by an actuarial analysis is warranted as means of reviving discussion of
sustainable financing mechanisms.
30.
Monetary policy needs to be tightened to signal a clear intention to price stability and
support of the exchange rate peg. Nine consecutive months of rising inflation risk embedding
inflation expectations and creating additional pressures on the exchange rate peg—on top of a
large interest rate differential vis-à-vis interest rates in India. Open market operations and regular
auction of T-bills should be used to mop up excess liquidity (which remains high even after recent
interventions). The establishment of a base rate for banks, and publication of this information, is a
welcome step in increasing transparency in the financial sector.
31.
A targeted acceleration of financial sector reform is needed. The staff sees the financial
sector as the greatest potential source of risk, particularly if external shocks noted above exacerbate
existing balance sheet vulnerabilities. Stability is important, but the mission believes the current
gradual approach runs the risk of a disorderly adjustment, which could be magnified by interlinkages between banks. Any strategy needs to be well-sequenced, as it would require the capacityconstrained supervisor to carry out multiple complicated tasks. Such key reforms as the expanded
prompt corrective action framework and the amended NRB Act should be given clear priority. The
latter should be enacted as soon as possible to complete an essential pillar in the authorities’ crisis
resolution framework. Upcoming diagnostic reviews should be used for deep-dive assessments of
the most vulnerable institutions (i.e., those most exposed to the real estate sector), and the NRB
should be prepared to intervene and resolve problem institutions where necessary.
32.
Tackling long-standing structural problems is essential to achieve higher, more
inclusive growth over the medium term and to increase Nepal’s resilience to external shocks.
The poor business climate, power shortages, weak governance, and difficult labor relations remain
major impediments to growth and investment. A political consensus is essential for moving ahead in
several of these areas. Progress can be made in a range of areas, and in this context the
establishment of the Investment Board is a welcome step, particularly given the focus on potentially
growth-enhancing infrastructure projects.
33.
A renewed effort to increase transparency and good governance could give a welcome
boost to government credibility and public confidence. One key step in this regard would be regular
publication of fiscal, monetary, and financial sector data on the MOF and NRB websites. Another
would be the appointment of an Auditor General. Finally, there are a large number of quasi fiscal
operations and tax expenditures that are used to promote policy objectives, but are not transparent
and often unmeasured. These include the price subsidies to fuel and electricity (estimated at
1.2 percent of GDP in 2011/12), interest rate subsidies for agriculture and other priority sectors, tax
exemptions for specific industries. These should be quantified and reported, and preferably entered
on the budget explicitly as expenditures. Continued progress on AML/CFT issues is encouraged.
34.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ continued interest in close engagement with the Fund,
including through a potential program. A political consensus and common view on economic and

structural reform priorities would be an essential pre-requisite for a successful engagement. In the
meantime, the staff will continue to offer advice, as needed, and facilitate technical assistance to key
areas.
35.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation takes place on the standard 12
month cycle.

APPENDIX I. BACKGROUND ON SPILLOVER AND FINANCIAL
SECTOR RISKS
Spillover Risks
1.
Economic links between Nepal and the rest of the world, notably India, have deepened
in recent years. Growing economic integration has benefited Nepal in terms of economic
development, stability, and poverty reduction (including through remittance-based increases in
household income). These links, however, can also facilitate transmission of adverse shocks to Nepal.
2.
This paper discusses potential spillover effects from three scenarios: (i) India’s slowing
growth; (ii) slowing remittances against the backdrop of softening global outlook; and (ii) a banking
sector distress that could be triggered by external shocks considering preexisting financial sector
fragilities. As shown below, slower growth in India represents substantial risks to Nepal’s output,
while remittance shocks could weaken the balance of payments. Financial sector distress would
result in a large output loss over the medium term; substantial rescue costs incurred to the public
sector, and potentially lead to unsustainable debt dynamics.

A.

Links to India and Other Countries

3.
India is Nepal’s single most important trading partner and also accounts for a
significant share of Nepal’s remittance inflows1. The open border between the two countries
allows cross-border transactions to be conducted with few restrictions. The peg of Nepalese rupee
to India’s currency also provides a nominal anchor for Nepal’s monetary policy and a steady basis
for cross-border exchange (the Indian rupee is common in circulation, particularly in border areas).
India is also a source of know-how, providing access to better education for students from
neighboring countries including Nepal.


Trade. India is Nepal’s dominant trading partner. Some 60–70 percent of Nepal’s exports
and imports were associated with India in 2011/12, compared to below 50 percent a decade
ago. Even these figures may be underestimated. Transactions across the open border tend
to be underreported and there is thought to be significant unofficial trade. Some observers
estimate that unofficial trade between India and Nepal was more than their official trade in
the 1990s. These close links can also serve as a conduit for shocks, however. Dabla-Norris et
al (2012) indicate significant spillover effects through the trade channel: a 100 percent
increase in trade openness increases the elasticity to partners’ growth by 0.56.

1

Remittance inflows from India are not well covered by official statistics, but it is generally believed that there are
1½–2 million Nepalese workers in India, who account for about 20 percent of Nepal’s receipts of remittances.

30

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NEPAL



Financial linkages. FDI2 and cross-border lending may also serve as a conduit for Indiarelated shocks. India is the most important source of foreign investment to Nepal. Although
bilateral data is not available, most of Nepal’s financial flows (a surplus of about 1½ percent
of GDP in 2011/12) take the form of trade credit and therefore are likely to be associated
with India. The size of direct bank lending across the border seems limited3, but a slowdown
in India could negatively impact Indian banks’ credit lines to Nepalese banks as well as to
exporters and importers. Moreover, a confidence shock could trigger capital flight. In recent
years, a shock to confidence led to reserve losses reached about $400 million (15 percent of
reserves at the time) within few months—forming a feedback loop between external sector
deterioration and escalating banking sector risks.



Remittances. Remittances are the main source of Nepal’s foreign exchange receipts,
equivalent to about ¼ of GDP. The GCC countries, Malaysia and India are the main host
countries, although anecdotal evidence suggests that Nepali workers in India receive lower
salaries than those in GCC countries and Malaysia. Although remittances are essential to
smoothing consumption and supporting Nepal’s balance of payments, their impact on
potential growth may be less significant.4 One explanation for the weak link is that the bulk
of remittances finance consumption rather than investment and leak out through imports.
Although remittances could boost consumption of non-tradable goods, inflationary
pressures on these goods tend to rise as a result and jeopardize competitiveness, which are
commonly seen in the cases of “Dutch disease”.

4.
Nepal’s nonagricultural real GDP growth largely follows the trend of India’s, but has
been consistently lower because of structural impediments such as low institutional capacity,
political instability, insufficient infrastructure, impaired competitiveness, and financial system
vulnerabilities. Ding and Masha (2012)5 estimate that a one percentage point decrease in India’s per
capita real GDP growth would cause real per capita GDP growth in South Asian economies to fall by

2

According to government statistics there were 2,108 foreign investment projects in Nepal at the end of 2010/11,
worth a total of approximately $2.6 billion. India was the most important foreign investor with 501 ventures,
accounting for nearly 47.6 percent of total foreign investment. Ten of the 20 largest foreign enterprises in Nepal had
Indian investment. China with 401 ventures ranked second, accounting for 10.3 percent, and U.S. with 174 ventures
ranked third, accounting for 7.3 percent of total foreign investment.
3

BIS data shows foreign bank loans and deposits with Nepalese banks amount to $80 million (0.4 percent of GDP).

4

A stream of literature suggests that remittances have marginal impact on economic growth (Jonwanich (2007) and
Barajas et al (2009)). Data limitations hinder meaningful empirical work, but staff estimates of the relationship
between remittances and growth in Nepal suggest that a shock to these inflows would have a limited impact on
growth.

0.77 percentage points. Dabla-Norris et al. (2012)6 indicate that Asian LIC’s growth will lose
0.71 percentage points over a two-year horizon given a one percentage point decrease of real GDP
growth in major emerging market leaders (India in this case). A recent study by IMF staff on a few
major remittance recipients including Nepal also finds visible business cycle synchronization
7
between remittance source countries and recipients.

B. Shock Scenarios
Scenario 1: India’s Slowdown

5.
This scenario considers a further decline of India’s growth by 1 percentage point from
the baseline scenario (5.6 percent) in 2012/138. In this context, Nepal’s growth path could
experience an output loss of 1 percent over the medium term (although uncertainty regarding
remittances and the impact on Indian investment suggests the dampening effect on growth could
be higher). The current account balance would decline to a deficit of about 1½ percent of GDP over
the medium term compared to a deficit of less than 1¼ percent of GDP under the baseline scenario
as a result of slowing exports and remittances. Import cover of reserves is expected to fall to 5
months compared to 5¼ months in the baseline scenario by end 2016/17. Fiscal revenue and
foreign grants and loans would also decline, leading to an increase of net domestic financing
(NDF—the financing of the government budget deficit) to 2½ percent of GDP compared to
2¼ percent in the baseline scenario over the medium term.

Panel Data,” IMF Working Paper (to be published).

This is a one-off shock rather than a step-decrease in growth. It assumes a dip in India’s growth by 1 percentage
point in 2013 compared to the baseline, with growth recovering gradually to the baseline level of 6.9 percent by
2016. In the medium term, the output loss in India would be 1.3 percent (calculated as cumulative losses of real GDP
in 2013-2016 as a percent of the 2013–16 baseline real GDP).

32

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NEPAL

Scenario 2: Decline in Remittance Growth

6.
A sudden slowdown in remittance growth, which could possibly be triggered by a
slump in oil prices affecting GCC countries (through lower non-oil GDP growth, depending on
the policy response) could weaken national income (through lower transfers, which effectively
decreases household income), the current account balance, foreign exchange reserves, and fiscal
performance.
7.
Under this scenario, an assumed decline of remittance growth by one standard
deviation (4 percentage points) would give rise to a widening of current account deficit over
time to 2 percent of GDP by 2016/17, and a decline of import cover of reserves to 4¼ months by
then. The impact of lower remittance inflows would be partly self-corrected, as imports would likely
slow in the face of lower remittance inflows. Fiscal revenue will decline due to slower imports and
weaker activity, leading to an increase of NDF to just above 2½ percent of GDP compared to
2¼ percent in the baseline scenario over the medium term.

Scenario 3: Financial Sector Distress

8.
As indicated in the second section of this appendix, Nepal’s financial sector harbors
significant vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities were highlighted in recent years during downturns
in remittances that contributed to a squeeze on bank liquidity. Despite a robust recovery in
remittances (which relieved the liquidity stress on banks in 2012), numerous institutions remain
under stress—low profitability, weak capital base, and substantial exposure (either directly or
through loan collateral) to a frozen real estate market.
9.
A major financial dislocation could potentially be very costly. The table below indicates
the international experiences of financial crises that took place in the past few decades:

3/ Total depreciation over first 2 quarters of depreciation in the crisis year (in percent).
4/ Cumulative loss of real GDP over 3 years after crisis against trend.

10.
A middle range estimate suggests that real GDP loss could reach 30 percent in the first
four years of a financial crisis before growth recovers to the baseline trend.9 Reserves would fall
by half in the first two quarters of the crisis through the widening current account balance10 and
capital flight, though foreign borrowing could reverse partially the reserve losses later. The fiscal
cost would be about ¼ of GDP, leading to rapid deterioration of debt dynamics. Even though the
fiscal cost could be largely assumed domestically at the onset of the crisis (for bank resolution and
deposit coverage), NDF has to be gradually brought down to 2¾ percent of GDP in outer years
considering the capacity of domestic financial system, and foreign borrowing would be heavy over
the long run.
9

The assumption of output loss is based on the average level of crisis episodes in the past few decades. In low
income countries, macro-financial linkages tend to be lower compared to more advanced economies, and therefore
output loss may be smaller. However, Nepal’s financial sector is relatively large, standing at 80 percent of GDP, which
is comparable to many emerging economies.

10

The widening of the current account balance is consistent with recent experience in Nepal. Remittances appear to
decline in times of uncertainty. Further, when there is “flight to safety” the general population tends to import gold
as a store of value—increasing imports.

11.
The joint Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability Analysis Framework (DSA) indicates
substantial worsening of debt carrying capacity after the financial stress unfolds. The present
value of external debt in relation to GDP plus remittances would reach 40½ percent over the
medium term, compared to the pre-stress level of 15¼ percent. The present value of external debt
to revenue would more than double to 337¾ percent over the medium term. Present value of total
public debt would rise to more than 90 percent of GDP or almost six times of revenue over the

A. Background and Recent Developments
12.
Financial sector vulnerabilities in Nepal have built up over the past several years and
risks remain elevated.11 Dramatic proliferation of banks took place in an environment of weak
supervision, accommodative monetary policy, and excessive lending in the real estate market driven
by unsterilized remittance flows. The collapse of the real estate bubble after reaching a peak in 2008,
coupled with a subsequent slowdown in remittance growth in early 2011 led to a severe liquidity
squeeze in April–May 2011—bringing these vulnerabilities into sharper focus and driving fears of a
potential banking crisis. Rather than intervening and closing weak and insolvent banks, the Nepal
Rastra Bank (NRB) responded with large-scale liquidity support through multiple lending windows,
and regulatory forbearance.12

11

See IMF Country Reports 10/184 and 08/182 for a description of the evolution of banking sector problems.

12

Twenty banks accounting for 26 percent of banking system deposits received liquidity assistance. Prudential
criteria relating to real estate lending, margin loans, and loans against promoter shares were relaxed, and a 13-month
accounting year in FY 2010/11 was allowed for banks to report income, without which two-thirds of the banks would
not have reported a profit for the financial year. Intervention options were rarely exercised even though solvency
concerns are likely widespread; two finance companies were placed under Prompt Corrective Action (PCA), one
development bank was declared problematic, and one finance company was liquidated.

13.
A financial crisis was avoided with due largely to an influx of remittances that boosted
bank liquidity, but also for reasons specific to Nepal. Regulatory forbearance, liquidity support,
and generally loose monetary policy allowed breathing room for banks to rebuild capital and remain
profitable as interest rates declined and spreads widened (though credit growth did not respond
strongly to low interest rates). A closed capital account helped contain the risk of capital outflows
despite low interest rates vis-à-vis India. In addition, general lack of investor education and low
financial sector literacy among the population may have contributed to the absence of pressure on
banks.
14.
Structural weaknesses remain. These include: (i) resource and capacity constraints at the
NRB, undermining the ability to effectively supervise nearly 200 financial institutions; (ii) the NRB’s
authority to resolve weak banks is hampered by the legal framework; (iii) a potentially extended
timeframe for returning two large state-owned banks to minimum capital adequacy; (iv) the real
estate market remains relatively static, impairing bank assets; (v) the inter-linkages between financial
institutions are not well understood, nor is ownership / interests in subsidiaries such as insurance
companies; and (vi) data quality / accounting are weak, and may understate the extent of balance
sheet problems.
15.
The NRB has made efforts to address vulnerabilities and strengthen the financial
system, but progress is slow. Recapitalization plans have been announced (and partially
implemented) for two insolvent state banks.13 The NRB has sought to encourage mergers, including
through regulatory forbearance,14 as a way of strengthening capital adequacy in the system. The
monetary policy statement for FY2012/13 adds prompt corrective action (PCA) triggers on NPLs and
liquidity ratios in addition to capital adequacy. Amendments to the NRB Act empowering the central
bank to swiftly resolve problematic banks appear to be in final stages of drafting, but
implementation is hampered by the lack of a Parliament. Nepal has received intensive technical
assistance (TA) from the IMF to help strengthen the financial sector (Box 1). However, effective
implementation will be required.

13

NBL, RBB, and Agricultural Development Bank of Nepal (ADBN) are the three major state owned commercial
banks. Only ADBN meets minimum CAR.

14

An NRB bylaw on mergers relaxed capital requirements, extended grace periods to bring violations of limits on
promoter shares, loans to single borrowers, loan to deposit ratios, and controlling ownership into conformity. Some
of the forbearance extends beyond prudential considerations, and includes liberalized refinancing conditions with the
NRB. Restrictions on opening new branches within Kathmandu valley, as well as requirements for lending to
“deprived sectors” have also been relaxed, along with tax breaks for merging institutions. Forty banks have
approached the NRB for approval to merge so far, of which 19 have been granted approval to merge since May
2011, and the remaining are in various stages of the approval process.

Box 1. IMF Technical Assistance in the Financial Sector
Nepal has been an intensive user of IMF technical assistance on financial sector issues. TA has
focused on (i) improving monetary operations, including liquidity management and the monetary
policy framework; and (ii) financial sector supervision, including prudential regulations and the legal
framework for the banking sector. TA in the past year has been provided in the context of the acute
liquidity stress of early 2011, including:
Crisis management framework: Focused on building capacity to respond to a financial crisis,
through enhanced regulation and supervision, and clarification of legal authority of the central
bank to intervene and resolve banks.
Banking supervision and diagnostics: A resident advisor provides guidance on supervision and
coordinates/oversees a program to conduct diagnostic reviews of banks.
Guidance on deposit insurance: Focused on identifying key areas for strengthening deposit
insurance, including preparation of deposit profiles and assessment of funding adequacy.
Legal framework for bank resolution: Focused on assisting authorities in establishing an effective
legal framework for bank resolution, by providing drafting suggestions for amendments to laws
and acts delineating the central bank’s powers.
Anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT): Assisting the
development of a National Strategy; currently focused on amending AML/CFT legislation,
improving supervision and enhancing capacity of financial intelligence unit.

thousands of rural credit cooperatives that are under the purview of the Ministry of Agriculture.
Other financial services are available through insurance companies and the Nepal Stock Exchange.

There are 24 insurance companies and 225 listed companies, of which 80 percent are banks or nonbank financial institutions. More than 50 remittance agencies are overseen by NRB’s foreign
exchange department.

Banking sector assets have grown
rapidly—from 60 percent of GDP in 2001 to a
peak of 100 percent during the height of the
credit boom in 2009, before stabilizing at
around 80 percent at present. Loans and
advances to the private sector spiked up from
25 percent of GDP in 2004 to nearly 40 percent
over the same period. The concurrent rise in
inward remittances and the associated impact
on the real estate market helped fuel banking
sector growth.

The banking sector is dominated by
commercial banks, which account for fourChange in Banks' Deposits During Liquidity Squeeze

operating with negative capital for the past

banks and Class C (finance companies). These are smaller and more numerous than commercial
banks. Problems in these banks are less well understood, but there is a commonly held perception
that Class B and C institutions suffer from weaknesses in governance and asset quality.

19.
Regulation is split along industry lines—the NRB licenses, regulates and supervises
deposit taking institutions; the Securities and Exchange Board of Nepal (SEBON) oversees stock
brokers, merchant banks, and other capital market participants; and the Insurance Board under the
Ministry of Finance supervises and regulates insurance companies. A government-backed deposit
guarantee scheme is run by the Deposit and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DCGC), which in its
present form may have limited effectiveness in maintaining public confidence in the banking system

38

in the event of a bank closure.15 Finally, there is a High Level Coordination Committee consisting of
representatives of financial sector regulators, chaired by the NRB, tasked with coordinating
regulators and policy formulation.
20.
There is uncertainty regarding the nature and magnitude of interconnectedness in the
financial system. Due to weak licensing practices, the ownership structure of banks, as well as
affiliates, subsidiaries and other related parties has not been fully identified, though the NRB has
better information on ownership structure of relatively new banks. Moreover, liberal lending rules
with respect to bank shares may have given further impetus to cross-shareholding. Three quarters of
the margin loans in the system are against such shares, and may constitute 2 percent of total
loans.16
C. Financial Stability Indicators
21.
Reported financial sector indicators (FSIs) for commercial banks suggest some
improvement. The shortcomings in data quality must be kept in mind while interpreting these
figures. Capital adequacy among commercial banks (including NBL and and RBB) declined to the
regulatory minimum of 10 percent in the past year, but has recovered subsequently to over
11 percent.17 All private commercial banks report capital at or above the regulatory minimum.
Among the Class B and C institutions, most report capital levels well in excess of the regulatory
requirement, although one Class B and three Class C institutions reported levels below the required
minimum in January 2012.
22.
Non-performing loans. Reported NPLs among all commercial banks declined to
2.6 percent in July 2012 from just over 3 percent at the end of FY 2010/1118. Among private
commercial banks, NPLs are reported to be quite low at around 2.4 percent. NPLs at state owned
banks are much higher: around 11 percent at RBB, 9 percent at ADBN, and 6 percent at NBL. Among
development banks, NPLs increased from 4.4 percent to 5.7 percent over the same period. Data for
finance companies are not as current and contain gaps. Between April and September 2011, NPLs in
finance companies went up from 2.8 percent to nearly 5 percent. It is likely that actual NPLs are
higher for all classes of banks, due to concerns about data quality, as well as possible ever-greening
of loans.
22.
Profitability. Return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA) exhibited a declining trend
over the past three years, likely reflecting the consequences of the real estate market bust. Credit
15

At present, the repayment process is subject to delays and could take several months. An important legislation to
expedite the process of repayment, which follows recommendations made by the World Bank, is on hold due to the
current political circumstances.
16

NRB estimates that margin loans could be as high as 5 percent of total loans, but due to data issues and possible
misreporting, the cited number is the best estimate based on available data.

margins are relatively high at 3.8 percent in 2012, profitability is weak.

inward remittances. A negative shock to
remittances, due to a slowdown in India
and/or the GCC states could lead a reintensification of liquidity stresses observed last year. Moreover, on account of weak assets, and a
tiered interbank market, liquidity management can be a problem for banks in times of stress.

25.
Stress tests. The latest stress tests conducted by the authorities for commercial banks show
some improvement compared to the previous year’s results, but weaknesses persist. Among the 32
existing commercial banks, a standard credit shock would push capital below the regulatory
minimum in 20 banks, and a third of commercial banks would be under-capitalized if real estate and
housing loans are downgraded20. Sustained deposit withdrawals over five consecutive days would
render 14 banks illiquid, and liquidity ratios at a number of banks would fall below 20 percent in the
event of sudden large withdrawals, or withdrawals by institutions.

19

Previous stress tests revealed that a 30 percent fall in real estate prices could lead to a 20 percentage point
increase in NPLs. See IMF Country Report 10/184 for details.

20

This refers to the scenario in which 25 percent of performing loans of real estate and housing are directly
downgraded to loss loans.

E. Fiscal Impact of Banking Stress21
26.
International experience has shown that fiscal costs of a banking crisis can be severe.22
In Nepal, the magnitude of fiscal costs including recapitalization of banks could be as high as onequarter of GDP, based on experience in other countries that have endured financial crises. A crisis in
Nepal could be triggered by another liquidity squeeze, depending on the relative strength of
balance sheets one year on from the last liquidity crunch, and three years on from the sharp drop in
the real estate market. The intensity of such a crisis would also depend on whether the impact is
contained among Class B and C institutions (where exposure to real estate is the heaviest), or
whether it spreads to Class A banks as well. The former, which account for a fifth of all deposits, are
especially prone to flight, as evidenced during the 2010/11 liquidity crisis.
27.
If only those Class B and Class C institutions with liquidity levels below the median for
their respective class were subject to deposit flight, roughly NR 100 billion ($1.2 billion,
about 6 percent of GDP) of deposits could be at risk. Assuming that all of the banks’ liquid assets
21

These scenarios are based on estimates specific to the Nepal banking system, taking into account estimated values
for liquid assets and resources of the deposit insurance scheme before calculating residual fiscal cost associated with
coverage of remaining deposits in the event of a crisis. The fiscal cost in the previous section is an average based on
cross-country experience.
22

For known cases in developing Asia, fiscal costs were estimated to be 5 percent of GDP in Sri Lanka in 1989, and
10 percent of GDP in Vietnam in 1997. However, costs can be much higher, as seen during the East Asian crisis (see
Laeven and Valencia, IMF WP 08/224).

42

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NEPAL

are exhausted in paying out deposit withdrawals, and institutional deposits are not paid, this would
still leave about half the deposits (NR 40-50 billion, about 3 percent of GDP) in depositor’s claims
which the deposit insurance scheme could not cover without further capitalization.
28.
Should a genuine crisis materialize, it is unlikely that damage would be contained to
only Class B and Class C institutions. A sudden drop in remittances is likely to squeeze liquidity
across the banking system. Moreover, systemic financial crises can be triggered by failures in a few
institutions that spread quickly due to erosion of confidence and interconnectedness among banks.
While the extent of interconnectedness is currently unknown, contagion effects could substantially
raise the price tag of a financial crisis.
29.
Costs would increase dramatically if the crisis spreads to Class A banks. Table 5 shows
the potential fiscal costs of a scenario where an escalating financial crisis initially afflicts smaller and
weaker banks, causing deposit runs, and then spreads to larger banks. This represents an extreme
loss of confidence, given past history of deposit flight to Class A institutions (including the two net
negative state banks) during times of distress. However, to illustrate magnitude, deposit runs at NBL
and RBB alone could add

VII. Exchange Rate Arrangement
In February 1993, Nepal unified its exchange rate and eliminated the multiple currency practice
associated with the previous dual exchange rate arrangement. In October 1997, the exchange

2

NEPAL

arrangement of Nepal was reclassified as that pegged to a single currency unit from pegged to a
currency composite. The Nepalese rupee is pegged to the Indian rupee at a rate of 1.6. Currently, all
merchandise imports (except for a few goods restricted for security or related reasons) are freely
available through an open general license system, with foreign exchange provided through the
banking system at the market exchange rate. As of October 4, 2012, the exchange rate for the
Nepalese rupee (Nr) was US$1=Nrs. 82.79.
The restriction on quantitative limits on foreign exchange for leisure travel was removed in early
2011. The Industrial Enterprises Act places a 75 percent limit on the conversion and transfer to
foreign currency of salaries of non-residents from countries where convertible currency is in
circulation. Since the limit applies to amounts that may be less than net salaries, it gives rise to an
exchange restriction under Article VIII. Staff is investigating whether this measure is also
discriminatory.
VIII. Safeguards Assessments
A safeguards assessment of the NRB was concluded in May 2011. The assessment noted that the
external audit mechanism needed improvement, since the audit procedures did not meet
international standards. Transparency of the financial statements should be enhanced by resolving
qualifications raised by the external auditors.
IX. 2011 Article IV Consultation
The Executive Board discussed the staff report for the 2011 Article IV consultation (IMF Country
Report No. 11/318) on October 19, 2011. It was proposed that the Article IV consultations take place

ANNEX II. RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
GROUP
(As of October 8, 2012)

A. Partnership in Nepal's Development Strategy
Nepal is passing through a momentous and prolonged political transition following a 10-year
violent conflict that ended in 2006. This transition entails multiple interrelated processes:
maintaining peace through the integration of armies; rehabilitation, truth and reconciliation; power
sharing between the major parties; and developing a new constitution. The constitution, which was
supposed to lead to a major restructuring of Nepal into a federal state, has recently experienced a
setback as the Constituent Assembly failed to deliver the new constitution by the deadline of May
27, 2012.
The prolonged transition has eroded the effectiveness of some key institutions. However, even
during the height of the conflict, state institutions by and large continued to function and innovate.
Perhaps paradoxically, the country even produced impressive results on various levels:
Nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita has doubled from US$350 in 2006 to US$735 in
2011. The percentage of people living below the international poverty line (people earning less than
US$1.25 per day) has halved in only seven years. At this measure of poverty, the percentage of poor
people declined from 53.1 percent in 2003/2004 to 24.8 percent in 2010/2011.
Net Primary Enrollment in schools has increased from 81 percent in 2002 to 94.5 percent in 2010.
Gender parity has been achieved in primary education, but full caste inclusion is still outstanding.
The Gender Parity Index for secondary school net enrollment has also increased from 0.87 (2007) to
0.98 (2010). The Maternal Mortality Rate declined from 538 in 1996 to 380 per 100,000 live births,
earning Nepal the MDG Millennium Award in 2010. The Infant Mortality Rate dropped from 79 in
1996 to 39 in 2010. At least one-third of deliveries are now in the presence of trained health
workers. Full immunization coverage rose from 43 percent in 1996 to 87 percent in 2011.

B. IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
Areas in which the Bank leads and there is no direct IMF involvement
The areas in which the Bank leads the policy dialogue and there is no direct IMF involvement are the
social sectors, infrastructure, environment, and agriculture.
In education, the Bank has encouraged Nepal’s decentralization efforts to achieve more effective
delivery of public services and has played a pivotal role in supporting the transfer of public schools
to community management. Along with other donors, the Bank is actively supporting Nepal’s
well-formulated, ten-year primary education reform program through the ongoing School Sector

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 5

NEPAL

Reform Project (SSRP). This Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) brings together GON and 12
development partners – of which 9 partners pool their resources with those of the GON, and 3
development partners who support the program directly. The Second Higher Education Project
supports (a) enhanced quality, efficiency and relevance of higher education through a set of
systemic reforms, and incentives to selected institutions; and (b) improved access for academically
qualified students from disadvantaged groups in (i) higher education and (ii) higher secondary
education. The objective of the Enhanced Vocational Education and Training Project is to expand
the supply of skilled and employable labor by increasing access to quality training programs, and by
strengthening the technical and vocational education and training system in Nepal.
In health sector, the Bank has been working closely with the government and development partners
in supporting the government’s sector program since 2004 through a SWAp, similarly to its
engagement in the health sector. The Second HNP and HIV/AIDS Project is assisting the
Government in improving the equitable delivery of health care services, specifically by increasing
access to essential health care services and their utilization by the underserved and the poor. The
Community Action for Nutrition Project (Sunaula Hazar Din) aims to improve attitudes and practices
known to improve nutritional outcomes of women ofreproductive age and children under the age of
2. Changes in attitudes and practices would address the key risk factors for child malnutrition and
create demand for nutrition related services and products. T he supply of these services and
products will be provided through existing public sector and donor-funded programs, the private
sector and, to a limited extent, financed through the Project.
To support broad-based growth, the Bank supports investments in several key infrastructure sectors.
The Road Sector Development Project provides all-season road access in select hill districts. The
Bridges Improvement and Maintenance Program provides innovative financing by utilizing a new
financing instrument (Program-for-Results), which links disbursements of funds directly to the
delivery of verifiable results. It is the first Program-for-Results to be approved by the World Bank’s
Board under IDA and supports the vision behind Nepal’s Bridge Policy and Strategy of 2004 to
provide “safe, reliable and cost effective” bridges. The Bank is also strongly engaged in the energy
sector where, however, progress continues to be slow. The Power Development Project aims to
develop the country’s hydropower potential to meet electricity demand, improve access of rural
areas to electricity services and promote private sector participation. However, the project will have
to close by the end of calendar year 2012 with 45 percent of commitments remaining undisbursed.
The Kabeli Transmission Project aims (i) to support the addition of transmission capacity to the
Integrated Nepal Power System; and (ii) to provide access to electricity and cooking fuel to
communities in the area of the Kabeli 132 kV transmission line.
To address issues arising from rapid urbanization in Nepal, IDA also provides support to improve
municipal governance, including municipal services, through the Urban Government and
Development Program: Emerging Towns Project.
To support rural development, the Nepal Irrigation and Water Resources Management Project aims
to improve irrigated agriculture productivity and management of selected irrigation schemes, and

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NEPAL

enhance institutional capacity for integrated water resources management. At the same time,
project finance is supporting decentralization to improve service delivery by promoting
grassroot-driven, bottom-up planning and community-based management. The Modernization of
Rani Jamara Kulariya Irrigation Scheme aims to improve irrigation water delivery to, and
management in, the command area. The Rural Access Improvement and Decentralization Project
(RAIDP) helps to improve governance and service delivery for rural infrastructure, while at the same
time promoting agricultural and rural economic growth, and generating employment through direct
project investments in rural transport infrastructure. The Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project
aims to improve rural water supply and sanitation sector institutional performance and mainstream
the “Board” (Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Fund Development Board) approach into the
Government’s system. It also supports communities to form inclusive local water supply and
sanitation user groups that can plan, implement, and operation drinking water and sanitation
infrastructure that delivers sustainable health, hygiene, and productivity benefits to rural
households.
After a long gap, the Bank re-engaged in the agriculture sector through the Agriculture
Commercialization and Trade Project. It aims to improve the competitiveness of smallholder farmers
and the agribusiness sector in selected commodity value chains and 25 districts supported by the
project. To address the food insecurity issues, a Social Safety Net Project is under implementation.
It addresses the short and medium term implications of the global food crisis for the country by
strengthening the agricultural production and safety net mechanisms on a broad scale. The
objective is to ensure access to food and basic needs for vulnerable households in the short term in
food insecure districts.
Recognizing that Nepal’s development agenda is closely intertwined with peace building, a Peace
Support Project is under implementation. The project aims to contribute to the peace process by
providing interim cash transfers and services to conflict-affected groups.
While many of the Bank’s investment/sector operations mentioned above also support social
inclusion, a more direct initiative in this area that received Bank support is the Poverty Alleviation
Fund (PAF). PAF channels resources to the poorest groups in rural communities by creating
infrastructure, employment and income-generating opportunities.
Areas in which the Bank leads and its analysis serves as input into the IMF program
The Bank takes the lead in assisting Nepal with public expenditure analysis. The Bank takes the lead
in assisting Nepal with public expenditure analysis. In addition, the Bank’s intensive dialogue and
technical assistance have been supporting the reforms, including the development of a credible
Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). This framework has applied since FY04 to the
prioritization of the development budget to ensure efficient budget allocations for priority projects.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 7

NEPAL

Areas of shared responsibility
The Bank and the IMF continues to provide assistance in the overall management of the country's
macroeconomic aggregates. The Bank and the IMF have assisted in debt management through
technical assistance, joint Debt Sustainability Analysis and policy dialogue to ensure that the overall
debt stock and fiscal deficits are within reasonable limits. To sustain the impressive revenue growth,
in addition, the Bank and the IMF continue to provide policy advise and technical assistance.

C. World Bank Group Strategy and Lending Operations
Given the transitional nature of Nepal’s situation the World Bank Group prepared an Interim
Strategy Note covering fiscal years 2012 and 2013, which was discussed by the Bank’s Board on
September 15, 2011. It proposes development programs that are consistent with the government of
Nepal’s Three-Year Plan.
Nepal has been selected as a pilot country to implement an enhanced joint strategy to leverage IDA
and IFC resources and realize synergies. The strategy reflects considerable continuity, building on
programs with successful track records that are adapted to local conditions. It also emphasizes
greater selectivity, focusing on areas considered vital to Nepal’s development and complementing
programs supported by other development partners.
Supporting the government of Nepal’s overarching goal to build a peaceful, prosperous and just
Nepal, the strategy is organized around three “pillars” that emerged during consultations within the
Bank Group and with the government, donor partners, and key stakeholders.
The first pillar intends to enhance connectivity and productivity for growth. The second focuses on
reducing vulnerabilities and improving resilience. The third pillar concentrates on promoting access
to better-quality services. Governance, accountability, gender equality, and social inclusion are
themes that run across all three pillars.
Within each of these pillars, the strategy identifies specific areas where the Bank Group can make a
difference. For IDA, these include roads, food security and livelihood vulnerability, education, health,
urban services, and disaster management. For IFC, these include improving access to finance and
investment climate, trade facilitation, lending to Small and Medium Enterprises, and trade finance
facilities for local banks. IDA and IFC expect to work together on power development, agriculture,
and climate change.
FY12 Lending Program: In FY2012, IDA approved US$143 million in new commitments, including
the Modernization of Rani Jamara Kularia Irrigation Project (US$43 million), the Sunaula Hazar Din
Multi-Sector Nutrition Project (US$40 million), the Bridges Improvement and Maintenance Program
(US$60 million).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NEPAL

Bank Assistance Program in Nepal: The Nepal country portfolio includes 18 IDA funded projects
with a net commitment value of about US$1.3 billion. We also oversee implementation of 17 Trust
Funded recipient-executed operations (US$170 million).
Economic and Sector Work: The World Bank Group is also engaged in analytical and knowledge
dissemination exercises. It provides regular economic updates and advises the Nepalese authorities
on key economic policies. It also works with partners and the government on analyzing poverty
trends in Nepal. For example, with support from the U.K.’s Department for International
Development and Denmark, the Bank worked closely with the Central Bureau of Statistics to
complete the latest Living Standards Survey (NLSS 3), to provide core data on poverty trends and
access to services.
Strong IFC/private-sector engagement in the creation of the Nepal Business Forum is facilitating
public-private sector dialogue and pragmatic problem-solving. Other areas of attention have
included analysis of migration and remittances trends, medium-term public expenditure
management, assessment of the investment climate, financial sector risk management, and
implementation of the Right to Information and food security and nutrition challenges. In addition,
teams have disseminated information on international experience on specialized topics (such as
fiscal decentralization and civil service transition) at the request of Constituent Assembly committees
and other government bodies.
Other areas of analytic focus include water resource management, where the Bank team is working
with the Water and Energy Commission Secretariat to establish a geo-referenced water resources
information system, develop river basin models, build capacity within the GON for river basin
modeling, and support the formation of a Trans-boundary Waters Cell. A recently completed
Ganges Strategic Basin Assessment built a knowledge base and promoted an open, evidence-based
dialogue on the shared opportunities and risks of cooperative management of the Ganges River
Basin. Analytical support to understand governance issues in the forestry sector and support to the
REDD Readiness Plan preparation are under way.
Other ongoing IDA/IFC work is laying the foundation for carbon-based trading and financial support
from the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience and other climate investment funds. Joint work on
disaster management (in collaboration with the United Nations, Asian Development Bank (ADB), Red
Cross and others) is expected to lay the basis for future program support from the Global Fund for
Disaster Risk Reduction. In partnership with the government and other donors, the Bank continues
to provide advice on ways to improve existing social protection systems and on the design of a
national social protection framework.

Activities of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in Nepal
Investment Services: IFC’s committed investment portfolio in Nepal stood at US$27 million as of
March 2011, consisting of three power generation projects, one airline, one tourism project, one
microfinance institution, one Financial Sector ICT service company, and four trade finance facilities.
In FY2011, IFC provided four trade finance facilities (for US$9 million in total) and signed one
additional facility (of US$5 million) under IFC’s Global Trade Finance Program to date. In FY2010
and FY2009, IFC committed US$14 million and US$15 million, respectively, including IFC’s first power
investment in Nepal in a decade (for US$6.5 million), IFC’s first ever investment in microfinance in
Nepal (for US$0.3 million), a US$10 million long-term debt in aviation as well as GTFP trade facilities.
After having a low level of activity during FY2002-FY2007 due mainly to the conflict, IFC re-opened
an office in Kathmandu in January 2008 with the objective of scaling up both investment and
advisory operations. IFC’s program successfully rebounded, focusing on increased access to finance
and infrastructure, as well as support to help improve investment climate.
IFC Advisory Services: IFC is engaged broadly in four areas, including investment climate, financial
market and access to finance, sustainable business, and Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) and has
been more active in the former three areas thus far. IFC’s work on Investment Climate Reform
Project (ICRP) began in Nepal in 2007. In FY11, IFC, with funding support from DFID, embarked on a
new three-year ICRP that consists of three mutually-reinforcing components: (i) Public Private

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NEPAL

Dialogue (PPD); (ii) Regulatory Reforms; and (iii) Special Economic Zones (SEZ). Through this
program, IFC has assisted with the establishment of Nepal Business Forum (NBF). As a Public Private
Dialogue (PPD) mechanism, NBF helps the government set up reforms at the national and subnational level. IFC’s Financial Markets and Access to Finance (A2F) advisory work focuses on
financial infrastructure, sustainable energy financing and SME lending, microfinance, credit
information bureaus, secured transaction registries and support to long-term lending institutions.
IFC increasingly plays a key advisory role in diverse areas, including credit bureau and collateral
registry, sustainable energy and water finance project, microfinance project, SME finance project,
and in particular “Payments, Remittances and Securities Settlement Systems (PRSSS)”. Furthermore,
IFC is providing advisory support to promote sustainable business practices in the private sector,
helping to strengthen environment, social and governance aspects and SMEs through linkages to
IFC’s investments. In the area of climate change, IFC, in partnership with the World Bank and ADB, is
implementing the Strategic Program on Climate Resilience (SPCR) and Scaling up Renewable Energy
(SREP) projects in benefit for the private sector in Nepal.
Going forward, IFC will seek to continue the programs aligned with the three strategic pillars of IFC’s
regional South Asia Strategy which include: (a) Inclusive Growth; (b) Climate Change; and (c)
Regional and Global Integration. IFC continues to focus on investment climate to lay the ground for
attracting investments, access to finance and financial sector development to promote efficient and
innovate ways of financial access, and infrastructure strengthening to facilitate people’s access and
economic development. Building on its global and regional experiences, IFC remains interested in
providing support for the development of PPPs in Nepal. IFC will also seek to leverage the colocation of the IFC and World Bank offices, aiming for greater collaboration and interaction in Nepal,
particularly in the areas of financial markets, infrastructure, climate change, and business enabling
environment.

ANNEX IV. STATISTICAL ISSUES
Economic and financial data are generally adequate for surveillance, with scope for improvement
especially in fiscal (external financing) data, more detailed price statistics, and the timeliness and
quality of balance of payments data. Nepal provides core data to the Fund and releases data in
government and central bank publications. It has been a participant in the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS) since May 2001. Metadata were initially posted on the Dissemination
Standards Bulletin Board in May 2001 and last updated in January 2009.
Real Sector Statistics
The Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) compiles national accounts using the methodology of the
1993 SNA. Key estimates include GDP by industry (in current and constant prices) and by
expenditure categories (current prices), and gross national income and savings. A 2011 STA mission
revealed that on the expenditure side, no separate estimate of change in inventories is made, and
inventories plus statistical discrepancy is treated as a residual, which has risen over time to more
than 13 percent of GDP. This raises serious doubts over the reliability of other categories of final
expenditure, particularly household final consumption and capita formation. On the activity side,
while benchmark estimates are assessed to be robust, weaknesses arise due to low quality of
extrapolators and lack of benchmark surveys in key areas such as construction and trade. Previous
STA missions in 2005 and 2006 (with AsDB assistance) provided support to the development of
quarterly national accounts (QNA) and the rebasing of the annual national accounts to 2000/01
from 1994/95. CBS is now considering rebasing national accounts to 2004/05 or 2010/11, for the
reference year 2013/14 or 2014/15. QNA from the activity side have been prepared for 2004/05 to
2010/11, and publication is expected this year, two months after the end of the first quarter of
2012/13. High frequency indicators are generally lacking; a quarterly manufacturing production
index exists but updates are not available since Q1 of 2010/11.
The Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) compiles the consumer price index (CPI), with 2005/06 as base year.
Survey work to revise the CPI basket is underway, expected to be completed in 2013/14, in order to
produce a new CPI series by 2015/16. The new survey will include more commodities and is
expected to yield a more representative basket, as the previous survey was carried out during the
armed conflict, which may have affected survey responses. A core inflation series is not published,
although underlying data necessary to calculate such a series appear to be available. NRB also
publishes a wholesale price index (WPI), with weights based on 1999/2000 data. Broadly, the index
covers agricultural commodities (49.6 percent), domestic manufactured goods (20.4 percent), and
imported goods (30 percent). As well, an index of wages and salaries is compiled and published,
with base year 2004/05.
Government Finance Statistics
Authorities began to compile fiscal data in accordance with IMF’s 2001 Government Finance
Statistics (GFS) in 2011, an important step forward. Meanwhile, treasury single account (TSA) has
14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NEPAL

been rolled out to 60 districts including Kathmandu, which allows for more timely and accurate
fiscal data reporting and monitoring. However, a number of fees collected outside the budget and
the operations of local governments are not reported in the annual budget, monthly reporting of
development spending often excludes amounts directly paid by donors, and there is no compilation
of the government’s balance sheet in accordance with IMF’s GFS 2001. Government finance statistics
are regularly reported for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook, but not in the
International Finance Statistics.
Monetary and Financial Statistics
Following up on the recommendations of a 2009 STA mission that NRB broaden the coverage of
monthly monetary statistics to include development banks and finance companies1, NRB now
publishes an expanded broad money survey, which is a significant step forward.
There is room for improvement in the reporting of interest rate data. At present, key policy rates
including t-bill, interbank, and NRB policy rates are available, but deposit and lending rates of
commercial banks are not well reported, while those of development banks and finance companies
are not reported at all. It may be useful to report the prime lending rate of top 5 commercial banks,
as well as average deposit rates of the same, to provide a sense of the movement over time. At
present, maximum and minimum rates are reported, which remain relatively fixed over time and are
not very informative.
Following up on recommendations of a 2011 STA mission NRB has resumed reporting monthly
monetary data in the format of SRF 1SR for the central bank and SRF 2SR for commercial banks; and
resume reporting monthly monetary data in the format of SRF 2SR covering the entire ODC sector.
External Sector Statistics
The NRB compiles and disseminates balance of payments statistics in conformity with the fifth
edition of the Balance of Payments Statistics Manuel (BPM5), but does not compile statistics on the
international investment position. Overall the quality of BOP data is weak and net errors and
omissions remain large2. Trade data compiled separately by the NRB, the Customs Department, and
the Trade Promotion Center (overseas trade only) exhibit discrepancies. Export and import price
indices are not published.
A 2010 STA mission identified key shortcomings in BOP statistics, including: (i) underestimation of
imports, and to a lesser extent exports; (ii) significant problems in measurement of remittances; (iii)
incompleteness of data on foreign grants, making it difficult to classify current vs. capital, and official

Latest data provided by authorities for July 2012 indicated that 16 percent of private sector deposits are accounted
for development banks and finance companies.

In 2011/12, errors and omissions were 20 percent of the current account balance. In previous years, this has been as

vs. private grants; (iv) absence of direct investment data; and (v) unrecorded financial flows. The
report makes specific recommendations to improve the quality of BOP line items. For example, trade
data should be reconciled with main trading partners India and China, and coverage of trade should
be expanded to include undeclared imports and exports using border surveys. Remittance data,
which relies on bank reporting, should be verified in the short run with money transfer operators
and counterparts, and in the long run be based on an enumeration of migrants in different
destinations.
The STA mission also found that adequate data exists to produce annual and quarterly IIP statistics,
subject to improvements in the quality of direct investment data.
MoF does compile data on total grants received by the government and private sector from donor
agencies, and a new Aid Management Platform (AMP) has been in use since last year, which should
help improve reporting of foreign aid. However, coordination between Foreign Aid Coordination
Division (FACD) in Ministry of Finance (MoF) and the Balance of Payments Division (BOPD) in NRB
on external grants appears to be weak, complicating estimation of foreign financing.

and the World Bank

Nepal remains at moderate risk of debt distress.1 The baseline external public debt
indicators show that external debt dynamics are sound and broadly resilient to standard
stress tests. Nevertheless, under an alternative scenario reflecting systemic financial
sector stress, external debt indicators breach the indicative thresholds, underscoring the
pressing need to address financial sector vulnerabilities.2 A prudent fiscal stance remains
appropriate, and net domestic financing of deficits should be contained to around
2 percent of GDP in the near term. However, a marginal increase in net domestic
financing (by less than ¾ percent of GDP) to finance much-needed capital spending
could be warranted in the context of enhanced public financial management. In this vein,
stronger efforts to improve the utilization of foreign aid, particularly grants, would
mitigate pressures on the domestic debt market, while structural reforms to boost longrun growth and revenue generation would improve overall public debt sustainability.

The risk rating is determined using the Low-Income Country Debt Sustainability Analysis (LIC-DSA)

framework. Nepal’s fiscal year starts in mid-July.

The thresholds are determined based on Nepal’s policy performance rating, which is “medium” according to

the CPIA score.

BACKGROUND
1.
The total stock of public debt in Nepal remained stable at 33¼ percent of GDP by end2011/123, the same level of 2010/11 and down from around 60 percent a decade ago, largely
reflecting a prudent fiscal policy. External public debt stood at 20½ percent of GDP (US$ 3½
billion) by end-2011/12, rising from 18¾ percent of GDP due mainly to exchange rate depreciation
against the U.S. dollar. The World Bank and Asian Development Bank (ADB) account for 83 percent
of external debt, while Japan is the largest bilateral creditor accounting for 6¼ percent of total
external debt. Domestic public debt stood at 12¾ percent of GDP by end-2011/12, compared to
14½ percent a year ago.

MACROECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS
2.
Macroeconomic assumptions are broadly similar to those of the previous DSA. Key
differences include: (i) a higher path for fiscal revenue over the medium term (taking into account
the strong reform momentum in this area); and (ii) a small narrowing of the external current account
deficit, which to some extent reflects the correction of exchange rate overvaluation as a result of
recent depreciation against the U.S. dollar (Box 1). Other assumptions are as follows:

Real GDP growth is projected to slow to 3¾ percent in 2012/13 compared with
4½ percent in 2011/12, and then gradually accelerate to 4 percent in the medium term.
This short-term drop in growth reflects a softening global economic outlook, and particularly
much slower activity in India. The medium term outlook would be supported by a gradual global

recovery, enhanced political stability, and rising investment. Over the long run, resolution of
such structural impediments as infrastructure would set growth on a higher sustainable path.
Inflation is expected to decline to 8¼ percent in 2012/13 and further to 5 percent over the long
run, assuming moderating external price pressures.


The exchange rate peg to the Indian rupee is assumed to remain at the current level over
the projection period, and the external current account is projected to move from a small
surplus in 2012/13 to moderate deficits over the medium and long term. Remittance
growth is projected to moderate to 7½ percent over the long run, largely reflecting a gradually
slowing historical trend and economic prospects of migrant host countries.4 Exports are
hampered by structural bottlenecks as well as exchange rate overvaluation, and the ratio of
exports to GDP is expected to further decline through the projection period reflecting weak
competitiveness. Imports are largely driven by remittances, and thus would also decline in
relation to GDP as remittances moderate. Both exports and imports are projected to grow by an
annual average of 7–8 percent.



Fiscal policy is assumed to remain prudent, with net domestic financing (NDF) standing at
2¼ percent of GDP over the medium term, and at 2¾ percent of GDP in the long run.
Revenue and grants are projected to reach 17½ percent and 1¾ percent of GDP over the long
run, respectively (compared with 15¾ percent and 2½ percent in 2011/12). Higher revenue is
mainly attributable to improved tax administration and revenue policy, while lower grants are
associated with the end of the peace process and an expected shift in donor financing from
grants to concessional loans. On the expenditure side, current spending has been constrained
and capital expenditures under-executed in 2011/12, leading to a lower projection of primary
expenditures compared to the previous DSA. Assuming improved budget execution and higher
capital spending, primary expenditures would stand at 21¼ percent over the long run. As a
consequence, the primary deficit would stand at 2 percent of GDP in the long run (same as in
the previous DSA) .



Concessionality of foreign loans is projected to decline gradually. With rising per capita
income and capital spending, new borrowings on relatively less favorable terms, for example,
loans from non-traditional donors to finance hydropower projects, could become increasingly
important. As a result, the assumed grant element (the measure of concessionality in this DSA
exercise), would fall to 32½ percent by 2032.

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
A. Baseline
3. Under baseline projections, Nepal’s debt indicators remain below the indicative sustainability
thresholds (Table 3b, Figure 1). As in the previous DSA, remittances are formally included in the analysis
because the inflows (accounting for 23 percent of GDP) represent a sizeable and comparatively stable
element of the balance of payments. Nevertheless, debt dynamics are also vulnerable to the potential
volatility of remittances. The impact of a sharp slowdown in remittances is discussed below. With relatively
conservative assumptions on growth and external borrowing, current projections indicate that the baseline
debt ratios would remain sustainable over the long term.

B. Stress Tests and Alternative Scenarios
4.
Nepal’s debt dynamics remain generally sound under standard stress tests. Standard tests
include shocks to GDP growth, exports, non-debt creating flows and combinations of these shocks, as well
as a one-time 30 percent exchange rate depreciation. Nepal’s debt indicators are below the sustainability
thresholds under all but the most severe of these stress test scenarios. More specifically, Nepal’s debt
dynamics remain susceptible to shocks to remittance inflows. A substantial slowdown in remittances—
reflected in a one standard deviation below average growth of non-debt creating flows in 2013 and 2014—
would cause the “PV of external debt to export + remittance” ratio to exceed the indicative threshold by
10 percentage points in 2014.
5.
Non-standard scenarios, based on Nepal-specific risks, highlight the financial sector
fragilities as a key risk. Higher remittances have eased banks’ liquidity situation in 2011/12, but
heightened credit risk following the recent sharp downturn in real estate prices remains a key vulnerability.
A hypothetical financial stress scenario mimics the shocks that could be triggered by a loss of confidence or
a drop in remittances—leading to self-reinforcing feedback between deposit runs, capital flight, and a
systemic financial sector stress. Under this scenario, the ratio of “PV of external debt-to-GDP+remittances”
would rise substantially and stay above the threshold in 2015–2018, peaking in 2016 at 40½ percent; the
PV of external debt-to-revenue ratio would be above the threshold across the whole projection period, and
peak at 337¾ percent in 2013; and the debt service to revenue ratio would also be slightly above the
threshold from 2016 onwards. (Figure 1).5

5

Key assumptions include (i) a 50 percent loss of central bank foreign exchange reserves; (ii) a one-time exchange
rate depreciation of 33 percent; (iii) an output loss of 30 percent over a 4 year horizon; and (iv) a fiscal cost (for bank
resolution and deposit coverage) of 23 percent of GDP—presumably financed through domestic debt, but later
replaced by foreign debt given the more favorable terms and the need to supplement depleted foreign exchange
reserves.

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NEPAL

PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
6.
Under the baseline scenario, the PV of public debt would be moderately higher at the end of
the projection period. As a share of GDP, the PV of public debt increases from 31 percent in 2012 to 37 by
the end of the projection period. In percent of revenue and grants, the PV of public debt increases from
171 percent to 190 percent.
7.
Although the total level of public debt remains broadly in the same margin, its composition
is projected to shift toward domestic debt due to constraints on the capacity to mobilize external
resources.6 In the context of the current exchange rate peg, weak competitiveness and financial sector
vulnerabilities, sizeable increases in public domestic debt could be increasingly difficult to accommodate.
This could lead to higher real interest rates— potentially crowding out private sector credit—or requiring a
tighter rein on primary fiscal expenditures which could endanger anti-poverty and development goals.
8.
Stress tests suggest vulnerability to shocks. The largest adverse impact arises from the
heightened financial stress scenario outlined above, which would raise the PV of debt to GDP ratio to over
90 percent. Among the standard stress tests, the largest impact on public debt arises from an increase in
other debt-creating flows by 10 percent of GDP, which would increase the PV of debt-to-GDP by more
than 9 percentage points and leave it at higher levels for a prolonged period.
9.
Contingent liabilities arising from, inter alia, the SOE sector and pension scheme could pose
risks to this assessment. NOC and NEA are making substantial losses, and hold domestic debt arrears
equivalent to 5¾ percent of GDP, with the majority owed to fiscal or quasi-fiscal agencies.7 Meanwhile, the
on-budget pension scheme has no independent source of funding (such as employee contributions), and
could over time cause the fiscal stance to deteriorate. Limited information on the pension scheme impedes
a reliable estimate of the financing needs in the periods ahead and their potential impact on debt
dynamics. The clearance of SOE arrears would presumably be based on first introducing an automatic fuel
pricing mechanism supplemented by a social protection scheme, the cost of which depends on the
program design.

AUTHORITIES' VIEWS
10.
The authorities concurred with the DSA and its policy messages. They are aware of the risk to
debt dynamics posed by financial sector stress and other contingent liabilities. Meanwhile, they recognize
the need to improve utilization of donors’ resources to curb the increase in domestic debt and commit to
contain net domestic financing to 2 percent of GDP in 2012/13. However, they stress that systemic financial
sector stress is not very likely and the chunk of the banking sector is generally sound though weaknesses

concentrate in a few smaller banks and financial companies. They also argue that foreign grants would be
stronger than staff projection given the sizable commitments.

CONCLUSION
11.
Nepal faces a moderate risk of external public debt distress but risks could arise from
financial sector vulnerabilities, a shock to remittances, or quasi-fiscal liabilities. Although external
debt burden indicators generally do not breach the thresholds in both baseline scenario and stress tests,
under a heightened financial stress scenario, the debt burden rises notably, with external debt breaching
thresholds for prolonged periods. This test stresses the need to urgently address financial sector
weaknesses via in-depth reforms. The analysis also suggests that contingent liabilities from SOEs and the
pension scheme could pose additional risks to debt dynamics. This highlights the importance of containing
net domestic financing of deficits to around 2 percent of GDP in the near term that would create space for
contingent liabilities, though there is marginal room to accommodate additional capital spending in case it
is strengthened via enhanced public financial management.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 3, 2012

International Monetary Fund

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with Nepal
On November 16, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Nepal.1
Background
Nepal remains in an important political transition, but the lack of political consensus complicates
macroeconomic management. The dissolution of the constituent assembly in May has delayed
significantly the passage of a full-year government budget for 2012/13 and other key pieces of
legislation. Higher growth and progress in poverty reduction could be enabled by political
consensus, policy stability, an easier labor environment, and more effective use of external
support.
Macroeconomic performance improved in 2011/12 despite lingering financial sector
vulnerabilities and an uncertain political environment. Real GDP growth accelerated to
4.6 percent, reflecting a strong agricultural harvest, and a vibrant services sector—driven partly
by a resurgence of inward remittances. Average headline inflation declined to 8.3 percent on the
back of subdued food prices, but nonfood inflation was over 9 percent. The balance of
payments registered a record surplus, and the Nepal Rastra Bank’s (NRB) foreign exchange
reserves increased to $4.3 billion (6.8 months of imports). The government fiscal deficit was
smaller than expected. Revenue targets were largely achieved, but capital expenditures were
lower than budgeted. Public debt remained constant as a share of GDP. However, quasi-fiscal

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares
a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this
summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can
be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

liabilities continued to rise through financial losses at the Nepal Electricity Authority and Nepal
Oil Corporation.
Stress on the financial sector receded with strong remittances, but serious balance sheet and
other risks remain. The influx of remittances eased liquidity conditions, allowing banks to unwind
support provided by the NRB. Financial soundness indicators show some improvement, but
concerns remain about the reliability of reported data. Profitability remains low and extension of
new private sector credit was tepid. The authorities rendered support to bank balance sheets
through accommodative monetary policy and extended forbearance, but have also
strengthened supervision and regulation. Revision of the legal framework for bank resolution is
under way, and recapitalization plans have been announced and partially implemented for two
insolvent state banks. However, significant restructuring of the financial system has yet to
emerge, and balance sheet risks from concentrated exposure to a moribund real estate market
are high.
The outlook for 2012/13 is challenging. Real GDP growth is projected to decline to 3.8 percent,
reflecting a weaker monsoon, and slower services activity as remittance growth may slow.
Spillover effects from declining growth in India (through lower export demand, weaker inward
investment, and possibly less remittances), and the dampening effect of continued political
uncertainty will also present further challenges to growth in Nepal. Inflation is also on the rise,
and upward pressure on prices may increase in line with projected developments in India over
the next few months.
Against this background, the 2012 Article IV consultation focused on managing downside
macroeconomic risks and addressing financial sector vulnerabilities.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Nepal’s improved macroeconomic performance and progress on
structural reforms despite the difficult political environment. However, Directors noted that
downside risks are increasing because of spillover effects from the slowing Indian economy, a
protracted political transition, and stresses in the financial sector. To secure macroeconomic
stability and to foster sustainable and inclusive growth, Directors emphasized continued
commitment to sound policies and structural reforms, particularly in the financial sector.
Directors advised continued fiscal prudence, consistent with the objective of keeping public debt
roughly constant over the medium term. They called on the authorities to act expeditiously to
pass a full-year budget for 2012/13 and to strengthen public financial management to ensure full
execution of the capital budget. Directors stressed the need to address the quasi-fiscal liabilities
arising from financial losses at the Nepal Oil Corporation and the Nepal Electricity Authority.
Recognizing the difficult political situation, they encouraged the authorities to build consensus to

3
gradually adopt an automatic price adjustment mechanism, while putting in place well-targeted
subsidies to protect the vulnerable. Reform of the pension system should also be considered.
Directors commended the enhanced revenue mobilization efforts but saw scope for further tax
and customs administration reforms.
Directors welcomed the steps taken by the authorities to stabilize the financial sector.
To address the underlying vulnerabilities and to strengthen the system, they emphasized the
need for a targeted and well sequenced acceleration of financial sector reforms, including the
amendment of NRB Act to improve the governance of the financial sector and the broadened
prompt corrective action framework. Enhancing supervision and improving the quality of data
will also be necessary for increasing financial sector stability. Directors also called for further
progress on the AML/CFT framework. They welcomed the authorities’ interest in an FSAP.
Directors considered that a tightening of monetary policy appears warranted to signal
commitment to price stability and support the exchange rate peg, which has served the country
well. They agreed that open market operations and regular auction of T-bills should be used to
mop up excess liquidity.
Directors concurred that accelerating the pace of structural reforms will be important to address
competitiveness challenges, and achieve higher and more inclusive growth. Efforts should focus
on enhancing the business environment, removing infrastructure bottlenecks, increasing
transparency, and improving governance.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Der Jiun Chia, Executive Director for Nepal
and Chaipat Poonpatpibul, Senior Advisor
November 16, 2012
1.
Our Nepalese authorities would like to thank the IMF mission team for
the comprehensive assessment of the economy as well as the constructive policy dialogue
during the 2012 Article IV consultation. Risks in the financial sector have abated, and
macroeconomic conditions have improved since the last assessment. Notwithstanding these
positive developments, our authorities are cognizant of the remaining challenges on both the
economic and political fronts and continue to be committed to pursue policies to achieve
sustained and inclusive growth and foster economic and financial stability.
Recent Developments and Macroeconomic Outlook
2.
Despite the adverse prospects and sharply rising risks in 2010/11 particularly from the
intensified stress in the banking sector and the prolonged political transition, the efforts by
our authorities to restore confidence in the banking sector through liquidity provision,
accommodative monetary policy, and strengthened supervisory framework together with
favorable remittance proceeds helped prevent the problems that were concentrated in small
financial institutions from spreading to the other parts of the system. The banking sector has
since started to stabilize and the economy has begun to move back to its normal trajectory.
3.
In addition to receding stress in the banking sector and strong remittances, robust
growth in the services sector and favorable weather for agricultural production contributed to
the 4.6 percent economic expansion in 2011/12 after a dip to 3.9 percent in 2010/11. For
2012/13, although staff’s growth projection is 3.8 percent, our authorities expect that it would
not be lower than 4 percent as the services sector has continued to perform well, significant
progress has been made in resolving the banking sector problems, and remittances have
continued to be at high levels albeit with relatively softer growth.
4.
On the economic stability side, average inflation declined to 8.3 percent in 2011/12
and is expected to remain within the NRB’s target of 7.5 percent in 2012/13, assuming the
likely economic slowdown in India, stable exchange rate, and slower money growth. The
primary fiscal balance recorded a lower deficit in 2011/12 than in 2010/11, owing to slower
capital spending relative to rising revenue mobilization as a result of reform efforts.
However, the recent data show that both government revenue and spending in the first month
of 2012/13 grew significantly from the same period in the previous year. With the strong
outturn of remittances, the current account shifted to a notable surplus and the import
coverage of Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB)’s foreign exchange reserves at mid-July, 2012 rose to
as high as 8.8 months of imports of goods and services.1

This number differs from the number in the Staff Report of 6.8 months of imports as the NRB used the current
year’s imports of goods and services as a denominator while the staff used the projected imports of goods and
services of next year.

5.
Notwithstanding the prospects of continued growth and some moderation of inflation,
the authorities remain cautious about the risks on both the external and internal fronts. They
recognize that India’s as well as global slowdown is a major external risk to growth with
potentially sizeable impact on remittances, exports, as well as foreign investment. It is also
still not clear if the real estate sector is out of the woods. In addition, they are aware that the
prolonged political uncertainty can affect fiscal budget implementation and investment
decisions of the private sector. Fragility in the financial sector also continues to be an
important risk. On the inflation front, they see that higher global fuel prices and some supplyside bottlenecks could emerge as significant drivers of inflation in the future.
Fiscal policy
6.
Our authorities are fully committed to maintaining fiscal discipline even during the
ongoing political transition period. They recognize that an immediate priority is to pass a
full-year budget to ensure timely execution of the envisaged spending in the remaining
period of the fiscal year 2012/13. The ruling political parties are exerting full efforts to gather
support to pass this budget and, in the case further delay, the current administration will
consider to authorize spending through executive orders. Against the shortfall in 2011/12,
capital spending is expected to increase in 2012/13 with its declaration as “Nepal Investment
Year” to attract foreign investment and the establishment of the new Investment Board in
charge of promoting large investment projects.
7.
On the revenue side, with the enhanced efforts on revenue mobilization assisted by
the Fund experts, the ratio of tax to GDP has reached 15.7 percent in 2011/12. Further efforts
will focus on expanding the tax base, executing tax law compliance, controlling revenue
leakage, and strengthening human resource development. Our authorities recognize that there
is scope to further enhance revenue and view that the main challenge is to increase domestic
taxation and reduce reliance on import taxes. The Fund’s further technical support in this
area is highly appreciated and it will continue to be crucial for further progress.
8.
With significant quasi-fiscal implications, continued deficits at the National Oil
Corporation (NOC) and the National Electricity Authorities (NEA) need to be addressed.
Tackling this problem through implementing an “automatic price mechanism” together with
providing well-targeted subsidies to the vulnerable groups is an option; however, this is not
an ideal choice under the current political transition period. Likewise, our authorities are
open to discuss pension reform and the desirable modalities but this area of reform also needs
to await decisions of the new government.
Monetary and exchange rate policy
9.
Monetary policy in Nepal has been formulated with the objectives of maintaining
price, external sector, and financial sector stability, as well as promoting financial access to
the general public and facilitating sustainable economic growth. In 2012/13, the targets
include limiting inflation at 7.5 percent, maintaining foreign reserves equivalent to at least 8
months to imports, and attaining credit growth of 15 percent to support economic growth.

3
Monetary management would be carried out cautiously by closely taking into account the
risks to inflation from volatile oil prices in the international market and increasing domestic
demand on one hand and possible adverse impact on economic growth and financial sector
stability from inadequate liquidity and credit growth on the other hand.
10.
Our authorities view that maintaining the pegged exchange rate with the Indian Rupee
is still appropriate as a means to maintain economic stability as it provides a transparent and
stable anchor for the conduct of monetary policy. They would closely monitor interest rate
differentials between India and Nepal and cross-border flows. They view that deposit rate
differentials are the main factor behind cross-border capital flows rather than interbank rate
differentials. As the former is significantly less than the latter, they assess that an occurrence
of capital flight is less likely than in the staff’s assessment. In this regard, they regard the peg
as appropriate, but are open to review this if conditions change and no longer support it.
Financial Sector
11.
Our authorities view that the actions to resolve the problems in 2011/12 in effect have
helped stabilize the banking sector. Nonetheless, they still see the need to push forward with
further financial sector reforms to address the remaining challenges and strengthen the
system as a whole, while taking into account impact on the real sector during the course of
the reforms. They view that the reform pace needs to be appropriate to the circumstances and
the financial landscape in Nepal. Further initiatives will focus on ensuring timely amendment
of the relevant acts, bylaws and licensing policies, strengthening the capital base of financial
institutions, implementing risk-based supervision system, enhancing regulatory and
supervisory capacity, and promoting financial access to the general public especially in the
rural areas.
12.
For the key legal reforms, both the amended draft of Nepal Rastra Bank Act, 2002 to
increase effectiveness of NRB as a financial institution regulator and the revised draft
Bill of the Bank and Financial Institutions Act (BAFIA), 2006 that addresses major issues
related to liquidation procedures of financial institutions have been submitted to the
parliament. However, due to an absence of parliament, the authorities are trying to legalize
these laws through issuing ordinance. Being cognizant that the proliferation of banks has
continued to overstretch supervisory capacity of the NRB, moratorium of licensing to
commercial banks, development banks and finance companies has been extended except to
"D" class financial institutions (micro finance). Meanwhile, the threshold of deposit
insurance has been increased to NPR 300,000 from 200,000 to protect the small depositors
and enhance depositor's confidence towards financial institutions whereas a modified Deposit
Guarantee Act that would incorporate the explicit procedure of deposit payments would be
drafted and presented to the future parliament.
Structural Policies
13.
Structural reforms on various fronts will continue to be further strengthened.
Removing structural bottlenecks especially in electricity generation will help raise potential
output of the country. In this regard, a total of 70 megawatt of electricity would be increased

4
in 2012/13 from the completion of six different hydropower projects. In addition, the
authorities have decided to form a steering committee across the government and with the
private sector and development partners to further accelerate hydropower development.
The formation of the new Investment Board under the chairmanship of the Prime
Minister and the recent Bilateral Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement
(BIPPA) with India are the major new steps to increase investment in infrastructure and
improve the business climate.
Final Remark
14.
Although tail risks have abated, and the overall macroeconomic prospects have
improved, our Nepalese authorities recognize that the period ahead will continue to be
challenging with significant risks on both the internal and external fronts. Hence, the focus of
policies will be on ensuring economic and financial sector stability and simultaneously
pursuing inclusive growth through enhanced efforts on structural reforms. Our authorities
view that continued engagement with the Fund has been very helpful in keeping policies in
Nepal on a sound footing and therefore are open to discuss a potential
IMF program if the need arises.
